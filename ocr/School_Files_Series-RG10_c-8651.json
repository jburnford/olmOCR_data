KIRKNESS, Clandebaye, Man.\n\nACCUSED - Wesley HUNDLE and Richard KIRWATIN, T.I., Juveniles, Indian Residential School, Brandon, Man.\n\nCHARGE - that Wesley HUNDLE and Richard KIRWATIN, children, did on or about the 18th day of April A.D., 1951, at Clandebaye, in the said Province, commit a delinquency, in that they did unlawfully break and enter the Canadian Pacific Railway Bank-house, situated at Clandebaye, Manitoba, and therein did steal one pair high-top leather boots, of the value of Fifteen Dollars ($15.00) the property of Robert G. KIRKNESS, Clandebaye, Manitoba, contrary to the form of the statute in such case made and provided.\n\n16-4-51\n\n1. At approximately 8:40 a.m. this date, a phone call was received at this office from Mr. Robert G. KIRKNESS, an employee of the C.P.R. section gang, at Clandebaye, Man., who advised that the C.P.R. station house and bunk house at Clandebaye had been broken into sometime between 7:00 p.m. the 17-4-51 and the 8:00 a.m. the 18-4-51, and that a pair of men's, high-top work boots had been stolen from the bunk house. KIRKNESS further stated that two half-breeds or Indians had been seen hanging around the station the evening previous, and he believed they might have been responsible for this offense.\n\n2. Upon receipt of this information, immediate patrol was made by the writer to Clandebaye, where KIRKNESS was interviewed, also Mr. Mike OKO, Foreman of the section gang. OKO stated he had quit work at approximately 7:00 p.m. the evening previous, and on leaving the station, he had noticed two half-breeds or Indians hanging around the station. OKO informed them that they could not stay there and told them to leave, which they did. OKO did not see them after this. He stated further that he had returned to the station at approximately 8:00 a.m. of the 18th., at which time he found that someone had been in the station. OKO stated he had found nothing stolen, but he had found evidence of three empty egg crates which had been left inside the station, had been burned in the stove. Upon arrival of KIRKNESS to the bunk house, which is situated across the train tracks from the station, they found someone had also been in the bunk house, and had stolen a pair of high top, ten inch, man's work boots, belonging to KIRKNESS. It was believed that nothing else had been taken.\n\n3. Investigation was made of the train station, and it was found that entry had been gained through the door. I might explain that the station is a one-roomed building.\n\nFILE NUMBERS, HEADING AND MARGINAL REFERENCE ARE TO BE PROPERLY FILLED IN.\nBUILDING, which serves as a lodging house and waiting room both, there is no agent in attendance. The door of the station is not locked, although it is kept closed with a hook-and-eye type catch, there was no evidence of any damage done in opening the door. Found inside the station was a common type gunny sack and a handkerchief, neither bore any special mark of identification. It was learned that there had been three empty egg crates inside the station on the evening previous, but investigation showed these had been broken up and burned in the stove inside the station. It was believed nothing else had been taken or disturbed. Several footprints were noted on the ground surface immediately around the station, but these could have been made by any number of people either working or waiting at the station. The wooden surfaces of the station did not appear suitable for fingerprint purposes.\n\n4. Investigation was then made of the bunk house, which is situated approximately 100 yards north of the station, on the other side of the train tracks. It too is a one-roomed building, and is suitable for living in, but is presently used for the workmen to change in, there was no-one sleeping in it the night of the break-in. It was ascertained that entry had been gained to the bunk house through the door, which had been locked with a Yale type lock. KIRKNESS explained that the key to this door was usually kept just inside a screen window beside the door, and one could easily reach it by opening one side of the screen, this is apparently what happened, as it was found the key had been disturbed, further that the door bore no signs of having been forced. A further check was made of the bunk house by KIRKNESS, but he could find nothing else missing, apart from his work boots. Footprint impressions were found in the soft earth underneath one window, but these were not believed suitable for reproduction. The wooden surfaces of the bunk house did not appear suitable for fingerprint purposes.\n\n5. OKO described the two men he had seen there the evening previous as being either Half-breed or Indians, 20 to 25 years, #1. approximately 5'8\", wearing a red and black plaid shirt, overalls, and a cap - #2. shorter in height than #1, wearing a light plaid shirt, overalls, and cap. OKO could not enlarge at all on this information.\n\n6. With this in mind, a patrol was made of Clandeboye and district, but no-one could remember having seen two men of these descriptions previously. It was learned that there were two camps of Indians who were trapping muskrats, approximately 4 miles east of Clandeboye, and it was thought possible that the two described men might have been on their way to these camps. A patrol was made to these camps, and the men interviewed, but all stated they had not seen anyone answering the descriptions given. Check was made at a number of farm houses along the way, but nothing of any value was learned.\n\n7. Patrol returned to Clandeboye and continued north on PTH #9, and it was learned that two men answering these descriptions had been seen at Petersfield at approximately 7:00 a.m. that morning, the 13-4-51. Extensive enquiries were made at Petersfield, but nothing further was learned. It was believed at this time that the two men might have been hitch-hiking.\nHITCH-HIKING further north, and patrol was continued on to Nettley, Man. It was learned at this point that the two men had stopped there at approximately 9:00 or 10:00 a.m., and had been fed at William ROBINSON's farm. Mrs. ROBINSON was interviewed, and a different description obtained, in that the two suspects were young boys, around 16 or 17 years, and that the tallest one was wearing a fedora hat, with a string around his chin to hold the hat on. The rest of Mrs. ROBINSON's description tallied with that obtained at Clandeboys. It was further learned that the two boys had stated they were on their way to Gimli, Man.\n\n8. In view of this, patrol was continued further north to Winnipeg Beach, and a check was made with merchants, etc., of that town. Streets of down-town Winnipeg Beach, stores and pool halls were searched, but two boys answering these descriptions were not noticed. The N.C.O. I/c that Detachment was advised of the facts of this case, and was requested to be on the watch for these two boys.\n\n9. Patrol was then continued to Gimli where a like search was made of restaurants, pool halls, etc., was made, but with no result. The Cst. I/c that Detachment was also given the facts of this case, to be on the watch for these two boys. Patrol was then made back to Selkirk, with enquiries conducted along the way.\n\n10. At approximately 2:45 a.m. this date, a L.D. phone call was received from Arborg Detachment, advising they were holding two boys at that office, who had admitted breaking into the C.P.R. Station at Clandeboys the day previous. Arrangements were made for the escorting of these two boys back to Selkirk, and patrol was made immediately to Winnipeg Beach, where the Arborg detachment members were met, and the two prisoners handed over.\n\n11. Upon arrival back at Selkirk, the two boys were questioned, and they were found to be Wesley RUNDLE, 16 years, and Richard KEWATIN, 15 years. It was also learned at this time that the two boys had escaped from the Indian Residential School, Brandon, Man., on Saturday afternoon, the 14-4-51, and had hitchhiked rides from Brandon to Selkirk, and had walked to Clandeboys they had intended to go to Fisher River, Man. The two boys admitted they had broken into the C.P.R. station and bunk house at Clandeboys, and in view of this they were given the usual police warning, after which they volunteered the following statements:\n\nStatement of Wesley RUNDLE, 16 Years, Fisher River, Manitoba.\n\n\"On Tuesday, April 17, 1951, I came from Winnipeg to Selkirk accompanied by Richard KEWATIN, we were heading for Fisher River. We stopped in Selkirk for a while, and then we walked to Clandeboys. We got to Clandeboys about 9:00 o'clock at night and we decided to stay there overnight. We were walking up the railroad tracks and when we came to the train station we decided to stay there for the night. The door was locked but I undid it and Richard and I went in. It was cold in the station, so we took some egg crates that were in...\"\nTHAT WE'RE IN there and broke them up and burned them to keep warm, then we slept in the station overnight.\n\nThe next morning, Wednesday, April 18, we got up about 5:00 a.m. and left the train station. I saw a bunk house across the tracks, so Richard and I went over to it. I decided to break into it, so I took the screen off one of the windows and was going to go in through the window, but I found the key to the door just inside the window sill, so I unlocked the door and Richard and I went inside. We looked around inside, and I saw a pair of boots on the floor, so I decided to take them. I put the boots on inside the bunk house and threw my boots away in the bush. Richard and I went through all the cupboards and drawers in the bunk house, and I took a pair of steel cleats for the boots. We left after and walked back through Clandeboye, and then north on the highway.\n\nWe left Clandeboye and got a ride in a car to Gimli. We kept on going and walked to Arborg.\n\nWhen we got to Arborg we were looking for a place to stay, and we went to a house and we found it was the police office. They asked us questions and told them we had escaped from the Brandon Indian Residential School on Saturday. The police at Arborg then put Richard and me in their car and took us to Winnipeg Beach and another police car took us to Selkirk.\n\nWit: J.F. Friend, R.C.M.P. (Sgd) Wesley Rundle.\n\nStatement of Richard KEWATIN, 15 years, Balcarres, Saskatchewan\n\n\"On Tuesday, April 17, 1951, I came from Winnipeg to Selkirk with Wesley Rundle. We stopped in Selkirk for a while, and then we walked on to Clandeboye, we were going to Wesley's place at Fisher River. We got to Clandeboye at about 7:00 o'clock and we decided to stay there overnight. We were walking near the train tracks and we went over to the station and went in, it was cold inside there so we made a fire out of some egg crates in the station.\n\nWe left the station the next morning and then we noticed a bunk house across the tracks so we decided to go over and break in. I helped Wesley take the screen off one of the windows and we saw a key inside the screen on the window sill. Wesley took the key and opened the door with it, then we went inside. We looked through the cupboards and drawers, and I took a pocket knife off the top of the cupboard. Wesley took a pair of boots and when he left we put them on.\n\nWe walked back through Clandeboye onto the highway, and then started walking north. We got a ride in a car to Gimli and then from Gimli we went to Arborg. We were looking for a place to stay overnight and we went to a house and found it was a police office. The police there asked us some questions, and we told them we had escaped from the Brandon Indian Residential School. Then the police put us in their car and took us to Winnipeg Beach and some more policemen met us there and took us to Selkirk.\n\nWit: J.F. Friend, R.C.M.P. (Sgd) Richard Kewatin.\n\n12. The articles mentioned in the above statements which were stolen, the boots, steel cleats for the boots, and the pocket knife, were all recovered in possession of the two boys. Later the same a.m., the complainant KIRKNESS was...\nWAS contacted, and he advised he was desirous of laying a charge as above against these two boys. Charge was laid same date before Mr. R. Millidge, J.P., Selkirk, and a Warrant to Apprehend was issued. The two boys were then escorted to the Vaughan St. Detention Home, Winnipeg, and handed over to authorities at that point, receipt being obtained.\n\n13. At this same time, this matter was taken up with Mr. A. KITCHEN, Administration Officer, Juvenile Court, Winnipeg, and he was given the facts of this case. Mr. KITCHEN stated this would be referred to Judge E.J. NEALEY, Juvenile Judge, and in view of this, the two accused were remanded in custody without plea, to appear at Winnipeg Juvenile Court at 10:00 a.m., the 23-4-51.\n\n14. Winnipeg Communications Branch was also given the facts of this case, and were requested to advise Brandon Sub-Division to contact the necessary authorities at the Residential School at that point.\n\n20-4-51\n\n15. With particular reference to the three egg crates which the two boys broke up and burned in the C.P.R. station at Clandeboye, the writer was advised by Investigator IRWIN, of the C.P.R. Investigation Branch, Winnipeg, that in view of the fact that the station at Clandeboye is what is called a \"Flag Stop\" with no agent in attendance, owners of any property left there do so at their own risk, and may hold no claim for any stolen property against the C.P.R. The owners of these egg crates, Mr. A. HOLLANDS, Clandeboye, and Mr. N. GOUTURE, also of Clandeboye, were advised of this, but they stated that in view of the fact that the egg crates are of no importance and little value, they wished no further action taken. Further that they were not desirous of any further police action.\n\n16. In view of the above, file in this connection will be held open pending the appearances of the two accused in Juvenile Court on the 23-4-51. A further report will submitted after that time.

Olson,\nSuperintendent, Glandeboyne Agency,\nManitoba.\n\nDear Mr. Olson:\n\nI wonder if you could obtain from one of your legal friends a ruling on the following problem:\n\nThree Treaty Indians ages, 11, 12, 15 were had up under the Juvenile Delinquents Act for breaking and entering.\n\nAfter hearing the evidence and the plea of Guilty by the boys the Judge ruled that the three boys\n\n1. Were to be sent to Indian Residential Schools.\n2. They would remain under the supervision of the Chief of the Bloodvein Band, who would receive the co-operation of the local Judge, until arrangements were made for the acceptance of the lads, in question, in Residential Schools.\n\nAfter the trial the Prosecutor, Cons. Henzie stated that the boys were still his prisoners and with this idea in mind sent the following wire to his O.C. in Winnipeg Quote.\n\n\"Three Treaty Indians, Juveniles, convicted breaking and entering and theft, Bloodvein, Man. Sentenced to be placed in Indian Boarding Schools. May instructions be received reference their escort, transportation and custody\". End of quote.\n\nIt will be noticed that no mention is made of ages or the Judge's decision regarding the supervision of their behaviour until their acceptance in Residential School.\n\nI maintain that through the above action of the Cons. the decision of the Court was overruled by the prosecutor.\n\nI ask you to obtain a ruling from a Private friend in the legal profession in case a like case occur at some future date. I may add that I let the Cons. carry out his wishes in fact have not mentioned any objections. I did this as the boys have remained on the Reserve until Cons. Henzie escorts them to Winnipeg. Nevertheless I maintain that a prosecutor cannot overrule a decision of a Judge. By the way, this is the first offence for these boys.\n\nYours sincerely, F. Leach\nBloodvein,\nMatheson Island P.O.,\nManitoba.\n\nAugust 23, 1950.\n\nMr. B. E. Olson,\nSuperintendent, Glandeboyne Agency,\nSelkirk, Man.\n\nDear Mr. Olson:\n\nFreddy Bouchie Hamilton, age 11, Henry Duck age 15; and Charley Duck age nearly 12 were had up for breaking and entering the store of Ed. Kirkness at Bloodvein. These boys are not bad characters but as this was the third time that the doors of the same store had been tampered with I thought it better to send the boyds to a boarding school.\n\nFreddy Bouchie, R.C., will be accepted at the McIntosh Residential School. Our Father Provincial approved of this. If you telephone No. 201227 or call at the Juniorat in St. Boniface immediate transport to McIntosh will be arranged.\n\nHenry Duck and Charley Duck belong to the United Church that is the reason I sent the wire asking you to make arrangements for their acceptance at Brandon Industrial School.\n\nAttached to this letter is another. I would be glad if you will obtain the favour I am asking therein.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nF.

These children are now in residence at Brandon School without authorization from this Office as both families live in close proximity to the Fisher River Day School and the parents are capable of caring for and maintaining the children. The parents of these children on learning that the Brandon Residential School Van was in the Hodgson Area, no doubt told the driver that the children had been accepted for entrance to the School.\n\nThe Principal Rev. O.B. Strapp telephoned to the Hodgson R.C.M.P., that the Van would be in this district, however we were not notified and were unable to supervise the loading of the pupils for whom authorization had been obtained from your office.\n\nWe do not recommend that these children be retained at the Brandon Residential School. Russell Smith #1093 Peguis was approved by your letter 575-10 (E.6) dated August 28th., 1951 for admission to Birtle Residential School - however, this boy was taken by the Brandon Residential School Bus and is now at Brandon. The mother of this boy was informed that her son was to go to Birtle and we recommend that this boy who is taking Grade 9 be transferred from the Brandon Residential School to Birtle Residential School.\n\nThese incidents would not occur if the Principal of the Brandon Residential School would write and inform this Office prior to the arrival of the School Van so that we could supervise the loading of the children for whom authority has been obtained for admission from your Office.\n\nD.A.H.

Under these circumstances the Department desires the children to attend a day school and leave the space at a residential school for more deserving cases. Please make arrangements to return the above mentioned three children to their home immediately.\n\nWe are also advised that Russell Smith, whose admission has been approved to the Birtle School, has been admitted to the Brandon School. Please arrange to have him sent to Birtle immediately.\n\nIn future it would be appreciated if you would write and inform Mr. Nield prior to the arrival of the school van so that he could supervise the loading of these children whom the Department has authorized to be admitted to the Brandon School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nCopy sent to Mr. Nield\nMr. G.

Dr. Best, the Supt. of Missions responsible for the Indian Schools under the United Church in Manitoba. I am taking this action because of the last paragraph in your letter.\n\nWith reference to the letter of Sept. 27th., to answer the last paragraph first. I took the trouble to telephone long distance to Hodgson, Manitoba, on August 25th. through the R.C.M.P office and notify Mr. Nield that our school van would be in Hodgson at 9.00 A.M. on August 27th. This telephone call is on record with the Manitoba Telephone System and so may be verified.\n\nWith reference to the three children Elaine and Edith Mallett, also Arnold Sinclair, these parents assured our driver that the papers were completed and the Chief advised him that it would be in order for them to come down.\n\nRe; Russel Smith. This boy is a pupil registered in this school since February 1939. I shall be pleased to receive information from you as to the reason for the admission of this boy to the Birtle School when he has not been formally discharged or transferred from this school. Please do not misunderstand me in this matter but it seems that if formalities have to be observed on the part of the management of this school they should also be observed on the part of Departmental Agency Offices.\n\nI have not received advice that I should consider discharged the majority of pupils recently transferred to the Birtle school but have co-operated in directing pupils who desired to come to Brandon, to the Birtle School.\n\nI wish to assure you that it is my policy to co-operate with your office and I shall expect the same courtesy from them.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

With reference to the above and Brandon Radio Broadcast Item B-2642, dated 8 May 51, 6:45 P.M., Mrs Samuel MCDONALD, Melbourne, Man., telephoned this Detachment to advise that there were two very young boys walking East on the South side of the C.P.R. tracks and she believes that they must have run away from some place as they are unknown to her.\n\n2. The two boys in question were picked up by the writer in his private car, one mile East of Melbourne, Manitoba, on the C.P.R. tracks. Both boys were Indians and neither could or would speak English. They indicated with shakes of their head however that they were Johnny and Louis ROSS from the Indian Residential School, Brandon, Man., and the numbers on their clothing indicated they were the missing boys. They were brought to the Detachment and Brandon Detachment was notified.\n\n3. As there was an Emergency Road Block being maintained on P.T.R.

Rayson,\nSuperintendent.\n\nJR/eb\nOctober 16, 1951.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan;\n\nFurther to your letter re \"Truancy\" at this school.\n\nI have discussed the matter with Rev. Dr. Best and we have carefully considered all possible angles of the situation.\n\nI am first to draw your attention to the fact that Mr. R.S. Davis has instituted numerous \"investigations\" during the last few years. Whether he has made reports to your office or not I, of course, do not know. The net result of the various visits of officials from the Portage La Prairie and Winnipeg offices in the past have been that additional trouble has been stirred up and for a few weeks the school has been seething with discontent.\n\nI shall not permit any further \"investigations\", instigated by the Winnipeg office unless Dr. Best has been notified and given an opportunity to either be present or have a representative of the United Church present at the same time as the official of Indian Affairs.\n\nDuring the past seven years I have from time to time drawn the attention of visiting Indian Affairs officials to the need for recreation space, playing fields on the school grounds level, and recreational equipment for outdoor sports. If, as, and when this matter receives attention I am prepared to employ a Playground Supervisor who will give direction and supervision.\n\nI shall in future return immediately to their homes any pupils that I find have been sent to this school instead of to a reform school after having been brought up in police court for infractions of the law.\n\nIn this connection, most of our trouble stems from children who have been sent to this school against the will of their parents and who have been kept in the school through the summer holidays by direction of the Indian Supt. or Regional Supervisor. This action on the part of Indian Affairs officials gives the child a feeling of resentment against the school which becomes localized in their attitude toward the individual staff members in the school. This in a group of forty to fifty boys or girls eventually leads to serious trouble.\nMr. Philip Phelan\n\nI have for several years been calling attention to the need for a shop in which we could hold Manual Training activities but no action has been taken.\n\nMr. Marcoux recently suggested to me that I make a request for an additional building in which we could have another classroom and also a manual training shop. However with the very real need for a good dairy barn to be built I do not feel that the matter of an extra classroom so that all the children would be in school all day for five days a week is just as pressing.\n\nThe majority of the children that come to this school will never go on to High School and Collegiate and for them the training in the practical work of the school is very important.\n\nIt must be always borne in mind that no school can at any time completely take the place of the home in the thought life of the child and strangers definitely cannot take the place of parents, no matter how much they may try so to do.\n\nThe problem in this school is not one that can be solved overnight, nor is there any easy solution. I am prepared as I always have been to work with anyone who has constructive suggestions to make but when people who have never spent any time in this school to observe the day to day operation of the different departments can only make destructive criticisms the problem becomes just so much more difficult. I have received some helpful suggestions from Mr. Marcoux but this is the first time that any help whatever has been offered.\n\nOur main building is now in good condition and we are endeavouring to train the children to look after the equipment and keep damage to a minimum. The toilet facilities still leave much to be desired as they are old fashioned troughs with an overhead flush tank.\n\nI am informed by the Engineering Services that long overdue repairs are to be made to our water system and it is hoped that when these are completed we will be able to spare sufficient water to have a skating rink for winter use. Unless these repairs are attended to immediately there will be too much frost in the ground for anything to be done before next May.\n\nIf you have any suggestions to make I shall be very glad to receive them and at least endeavour to carry them out.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nMr. R.S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg,\nManitoba.\n\nOctober 16, 1951.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSince you interviewed the three boys from this school in Winnipeg recently we have had a great deal of trouble with them. Herbert Spence has been very insubordinate in his attitude to the various staff members and when I talked to him about it his reply was \"Mr. Davis told me that if I did not get treated right to telephone him at Winnipeg collect, and I don't need to do anything if I don't want to.\"\n\nThis is to inform you that I will not any longer keep these boys in this school. Their influence following their interview with you has been definitely subversive.\n\nThe following pupils will be discharged with bus tickets to their home on Friday, October 19. They will leave Brandon on the bus at 11:45 A.M., arrive at Winnipeg 2:45 P.M., and leave for Hodgson at 6:00 P.M.\n\nThe names of the boys are as follows: Russel Smith aged 16, the teacher of the senior room refuses to have this boy in her class any longer; Milford Spence aged 16, this boy has repeatedly absented himself from classes on the pretext of working for some of the outside staff members. Herbert Spence aged 15 insubordination and swearing at staff members.\n\nI do not know just what you did say to the boys but whatever it was they returned to the school with the impression that you would give them support in whatever they did. This is of course definitely subversive of the discipline of this school and can no longer be tolerated.\n\nCopy to: Mr. P. Phelan, Rev. George Dorey, Rev. C.H. Best.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPrincipal.\nHenry TROUT - et al (Juveniles) Indian Residential School, Brandon, Manitoba\nRunaway Boys-\n(assist. to Dept. of Indians Affairs)\n\n25 - Sept - 51\n\n1. 9 A.M. this date, Norman HAILES, Carberry, Manitoba telephoned this office to advise that two young Indian boys, who he believed were from Brandon, had called at his house this A.M. for something to eat. He had taken them in and they were now at his place.\n\n2. The two boys were found to be from the Indian Residential School, Brandon, Manitoba. They had left Brandon in the afternoon of 24 Sept 51 and were cold and hungry. The names and ages of these two boys are:\n   - Henry TROUT - age 13 years, Treaty Indian.\n   - Donald BEE - age 13 years, Treaty Indian.\n\n3. Brandon Sub-Division were advised by telephone and about 10:30 A.M. both boys were turned over to Mr. STROPP, Supt. Indian Residential School, Brandon who had come to Carberry for them.\n\nMr. STROPP advised that there were four boys away from this school and he believed they had been together. However the two boys, TROUT & BEE did not appear to know where the other two boys were. Later Mr. STROPP's assistant called at this office looking for the other two missing boys and later in the day a telephone message was received from Mr. STROPP advising that the two missing boys had returned to the School.\n\nCONCLUDED HERE\n\nTHE O.C., R.C.M.POLICE,\n\"D\" DIV.

In view of his statement that Regional Superintendent Mr. Davis was privy to that arrangement and that the transfer would unite the brothers and sisters and the transaction appeared very much in order and the parents of all the children concerned were very much satisfied. It was presumed that notification of these changes would be conveyed to Department by the Principals of the schools by means of their quarterly reports. In the case of Elizabeth Apetagon #0404 now at Portage La Prairie School while application and approval was received for Brandon it was felt by the writer that this girl's delayed entrance to school would be more acceptable at Portage than at Brandon which latter institution had received a greater number of new pupils from this Agency this term. Principal Mc Lean was able to find room for her and her parents were quite satisfied.\n\nLack of my signature on the twenty-four applications submitted under cover of my letter of September 13th last is an oversight for which you may have my apology. These signed applications are now returned with applications of numbers 337-8-9 changed to show\nIndian Residential School\n\nPortage La Prairie, Man\nOctober 10th, 1951.\n\nMr. J. D.

For our records will you please send the treaty numbers, birthdays and year of birth of the eleven new admittances.\n\nWhen the new children came some already here felt very badly when they learned their brothers and sisters were going to Brandon School. One day later when Mr. Davis and Mr. Strapp were both here we talked it over and it was agreed that we trade three in order to keep the families together. On September 19th, I sent you a list of the children here from your Agency but neglected to draw your attention to the fact that we had traded Publius Harper, Talbot Harper and Julia Harper for Tiras Beardy, John James Monias and John Angus Mc Kay. Tiras Beardy's sister Barbara, and brother Epstein have been here for the past two years; John James Monias has a sister Isabel here for one year; and John Angus Mc Kay has a brother Peter here also a year. Our children are all very pleased and happy over the present arrangement.\n\nI do hope that this is satisfactory to you and does not cause you any inconvenience.\n\nYours truly,\n\nL.

With the results the children was placed in Indian Residential schools. Granvell was admitted to Mount Elgin in 1923, and the following year, he and his brother Burney were sent to Brandon Residential School, where they stayed until they came of age, the whereabouts of the father is not known; the mother died twenty years ago.\n\nThese men are now trying to establish their relationship to a deceased brother Le-Roy Borgoone, killed while with the United States Army. There is an office record of the mother Irene Borgoone, but there is no record of any of the family.\n\nIt is presumed that the Department have a record of their admittance to the Residential schools, which might show their mother Irene Borgoone as guardian. If there is such a record we would be pleased to receive a copy of the same, there is an estate in connection with the brother LeRoy of which the United States army is endeavouring to dispose of.\n\nStuart Spencer,\nAgency Superintendent.\nJuly 10, 1952.\n\nMr. S.

We have taken the matter up with the Membership and Status Division of this Branch and Mr. McCrimmon advises that he has no record of this family as this family is considered to be of non-Indian status as the mother married an non-Indian.\n\nIs it possible that the mother's marriage and subsequent births of the children are registered with the Director of Vital Statistics, Parliament Buildings, Toronto?

We were doubtful of some of them and arranged with the Department to have the test made. Every milking cow went down and the herd was practically wiped out. We started a new herd that autumn with purebred dual-purpose Shorthorns. Every animal purchased was T.B. tested. In 1933 we received our accredited herd certificate and, fortunately, have retained it constantly ever since. The last annual test is dated May 18th, 1937. We have in all 56 females in the herd, about twenty milking at one time.\n\nWe also maintain annually the blood test for Bang's Disease.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle,\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal.\n\nP.S. We do not purchase any milk.\n\nJ. A. D.\nDear Sir:\n\nAs we require a new herd sire in connection with our Purebred Shorthorn herd, I thought it advisable to go to Ontario to secure one. I made this trip serve as holiday, and was away just one month.\n\nJ.A. Doyle.\nPrincipal.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am sorry to have to report that when we went to the cow-barn on Sunday morning we found one of our most valuable heifers dead. As we could discover no cause, we phoned Dr. Harry Ross, who does our veterinary work. He came out immediately and diagnosed the trouble as black-leg. We immediately burned the carcass and everything pertaining to it and had him go ahead at once and vaccinate all the younger animals in the herd, fifty head in all. He will also do our new herd sire which we expect to arrive on Monday next. Dr. Ross told us that if twenty-four hours lapsed without any further trouble we were likely safe from any spread of the disease in the herd. It is now forty-eight hours, and no symptoms have occurred.\n\nWe have no idea whatever as to how the disease was contracted. No outside animal has been brought on the place for months, and none of the cattle that were in the stable at the time have been off the farm, except a few heifers that have been taken over to the Experimental Farm during the recent months, and there has been no trouble of this kind in their herd.\n\nDr. Ross' bill for this service will be approximately $20.00. Unless I am instructed otherwise I will forward it when it arrives, to your office. I am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJAD/RS.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is hoped that you will not have any further cases.\n\nWith regard to the account of the veterinary surgeon I may say that at the other Indian Residential Schools in Canada it has not been our practice to pay such accounts. During the time of your predecessor as Principal it was usual to send for payment accounts for services and supplies which were not usually allowed to other Residential Schools.

J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., April 23, 1941\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have deemed it necessary to break some additional land in connection with the farm here which has never been under cultivation.\n\nDuring these dry years when we had great difficulty in contending against soil drifting in the lighter land, we found it necessary to seed to permanent grass two fields containing 21 and 27 acres each in the highest and lightest part of the section of land lying to the North. This reduced our crop acreage.\n\nDuring the years when there was normal rainfall and plenty of moisture the north part of the south field of the section of land was so wet it could not be cultivated, and now during the dry years it has become dry enough to work. So we have decided to break 45 acres in this field and 8 acres in the field corresponding to this land in the east third of this section. This entails fencing these two pieces, the small piece on one side and the larger piece on two sides which makes an even mile of fencing, and are hereby requesting that you supply us with the material for this fence and we will build it ourselves.\n\nIt will require 200 posts. These are round cedar posts, 5 inch, and will cost $60.00. I have secured from the Johnson Hardware Co., Ltd. a quotation on the wire required. This is a 7 wire woven fence, 42 inches high, with one strand of barbed wire on the top. This costs a little less than the ten wire fence which has been put up in the past. The quotation for the fencing, barbed wire and staples is $175.98.\n\nTrusting you will be able to give us this material.\n\nI am, Yours respectfully,\n\nJAB/TS\n\nPrincipal\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

If the fencing and posts mentioned in your letter of April 23 are purchased their cost will have to be taken from the amount appropriated. It has, therefore, been decided to defer action on the purchase until I hear further from you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J.A.

Last evening Mr. Chapin, the farm Manager, and myself went over the situation as carefully as we could and we find it absolutely necessary that we go forward with the fencing of the newly broken piece in the central section. This will require $120.00 to purchase the material, and we are therefore making requisition for this amount.\n\nIf the weather continues as favorable as it is now we will break up a piece of land in the east field as suggested, and when a slack time comes in the work will cut some oak posts in our own bush and move the fence to the north of this piece, thereby saving any further draw on the $500.00 set apart for us.\n\nI am, Yours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle\n\nPrincipal\nOttawa,\nMay 8, 1941.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant it is noted that you have now decided that material costing $120.00 would be sufficient to do the fencing at the Brandon Residential School.\n\nI should appreciate it if you would let me know the number of rods of fencing that you require so that the Departmental Purchasing Agent may secure it.

This would give us a further supply of honey for the children's table, which is of good food value for them, and could replace some of the other desserts. We now have twelve hives and would like to increase the number to twenty. This would entail, outside of the bees, an outlay of $60.75 for the new equipment needed as listed below: Quantity Catalogue No.\n\n| Item       | Quantity | Catalogue No. | Price |\n|------------|----------|---------------|-------|\n| Hive stands | 8        | @35\u00a2          | $2.80 |\n| Bottom boards | 8      | @48\u00a2          | 3.36  |\n| Covers     | 8        | @55\u00a2          | 4.40  |\n| Hive bodies | 32       | @63\u00a2          | 20.16 |\n| Frames     | 350      | @4.90 per C.  | 17.15 |\n| Metal eyelets | 3000   | @60\u00a2 per M    | 1.80  |\n| Frame wire | 8 lbs    | @45\u00a2          | .90   |\n| Queen excluder | 8     | @65\u00a2          | 5.20  |\n| Reducer    | 8        | @02\u00a2          | .16   |\n| Bee escape board | 8     | @60\u00a2          | 4.80  |\n\nWe will be responsible for supplying the bees and wax foundation for the frames.

Mr. Hetherington, who was my assistant two years ago, organized the Boy Scouts in connection with the Brandon Industrial Institute. We have about forty members in the troop. I have gone to the expense of getting them a special Boy Scout outfit which cost $300. My son, Fred, was appointed assistant Scout Master. Lieut. Hetherington went overseas with the 203rd Battalion, and was wounded on the 15th of April, and died on the 15th.\n\nThe boys are very anxious that they shall continue this Scout work. I have secured the assistance of a returned soldier to help in the movement, and the boys are very anxious to have a bugle band, consisting of about ten bugles and two or three drums. The cost will be in the neighborhood of $125 or $150. I would consider it a great favor if the Department would encourage this movement by providing these bugles and drums. Personally I am strongly of the opinion that the movement is a great help to the building up of character, and in the physical training of the boys. Favorable consideration of this request will be greatly appreciated.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nD. C.

Reports would indicate that he would secure a credible pass.\n\nLulu Ironatar #0303, has attended Brandon Collegiate taking Grade XII, she has done very faithful work during the whole year and her conduct has been satisfactory in every way. She has found the work fairly heavy and from the reports I would think it hardly likely that she should make a pass on all the subjects. She had one supplement in one of the subjects in Grade XI. Lulu is a promising and trustworthy girl.\n\nCatherine Keewatin #0334, has been taking part of Grade X and part of XI. She is now writing examinations and I would think doing well. She also has given good conduct and is a promising girl.\n\nAnnie Weather #0329, Cora Keewatin #02330, Maud Cowenska #0331, Dora Bear, #0332, Myrtle Bear #0333, and Donald Sutherland #264 have all taken Grade IX in the School here. Also Parry Berens #286 and Walter Green #287.\n\nThe work of these students on the whole has been very satisfactory. Donald Sutherland and Maud Cowenska are now writing on Examinations. After talking over the progress\nof the others with the teacher, Miss Werthenbach, and Mr. Morrison, the Inspector, and with the students themselves it was the general opinion that in the long run it would be better for the other six to cover this same work again next year and thus lay a much better foundation for future studies. They each seem quite willing to do this and evidently are looking forward to next year with a good deal of hope and confidence.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A.

The Norway House boys seem to lack background but every one of them is working hard and will ultimately succeed if their present attitude continues.\n\nThe experiment in sending three boys to the Technical School has been very gratifying. All three have passed and are marked \"Excellent\" in conduct and attitude toward their work, \"Good\" in mechanical genius, and \"Satisfactory\" in the advancement they have made. I have a very strong feeling that at least six or eight of our boys should attend this school next year and no doubt there will be some new boys coming in who should take this Course. If a number of boys do take the Course next year it will be a heavy drain on our school funds if we have to pay the school fees for them. Perhaps this matter can be adjusted with the Department.

Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., June 11th, 1932.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of June 8, #135-0-3, came in last night and was exceedingly disconcerting.\n\nNotwithstanding our constant efforts to carry out rigid economy in all expenditures consistent with having the children well-fed, decently clothed, and efficiently taught, we were compelled to end the fiscal year with a deficit of $2050.49. Just at that time we received your notice of the 10% cut retroactive to January 1st. I immediately had to make serious cuts in salaries, making these also retroactive and had to cut out other expenses which seemed necessary and had been counting all along on the full amount of the education grant to clear off our indebtedness and meet a few other items of urgent need. And I trust yet that it may come through in full.\n\nAs to the extra expenses incurred by carrying on High School work I beg to submit the situation as it appears from our standpoint. For this work we require an extra and well-qualified teacher. I am paying her this year in cash $655.00, a very reasonable value of her board would be $240. I have paid out for the three boys attending the Technical School in fees, supplies required in the shop and tools, $32.75. Then the item of extra clothing for young men and women of this type is considerable. Even at $10.00 extra, which I am sure does not cover it would be $290.00. The transportation of those attending Normal, Collegiate, and Technical School entails about 3400 miles with a car, over half of this at least could be charged wholly to their account, which is worth at least, in gas and wear and tear of car $35.00. Then the high school pupils are in school the whole day and therefore unable to give any valuable help in connection with the farm. There are 14 boys and the 200 half days that they would otherwise give to farm work would easily be worth to us $350. We have to pay much more than that for extra help.\n\nThese items amount to $1882.75.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., 19\u2014\n\nI do realize very keenly the situation in which the Department finds itself in these times when the Budget can only be balanced by drastic cuts on all departments and I am very desirous of co-operating with the Department in any way which we can to help relieve the situation and I am exceedingly sorry that owing to the falling off of any profit from the farm and the very slight reduction in the cost of much that we have to purchase we find ourselves in the serious financial need which now exists.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.

Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nPHONE 2638\n\nNov. 15th, 32\nBrandon, Man.,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAfter favorable correspondence with you last year we started three boys in a Three-Year's Course at the Technical School for Automotive Mechanics in Brandon. So far the venture has turned out very satisfactory. All three boys passed with good standing and are showing decided aptitude and efficiency in this kind of work. Maurice Grey, while home during the summer on the reserve at Sintaluta, reconstructed a McLaughlin car owned by his family into a truck. His work in doing this attracted the attention and approval of the Indians on the reserve and some who visited them from other reserves.\n\nThis year six other boys requested to be allowed to take this Course. But a regulation of the City School Board limited the attendance of boys from outside the city and only four of the six were admitted, to commence the Course this year. All four seem to be doing well, though we had some doubts in regard to one of them and arranged with the Principal to substitute another boy if he did not make good. He is exceeding our expectations.\n\nIt is quite probable that there will be more applications on the part of both boys and parents to take this Course than we can accommodate. It is probable that four a year will be the limit. If four enter each year it will soon mean that twelve of our boys will be taking this Course, four graduating and four entering each year. When we return to anything like normal conditions there should be good openings for well-trained and efficient mechanics. It seems desirable, therefore, that we should take advantage of this opportunity to give as many as possible of our boys who are trustworthy and who show aptitude for this work this very splendid training, which is given in Brandon and only in a few other places in Western Canada.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man.,\n\nThe fees this year for this course have been advanced to Twenty Dollars ($20.00) per student. I have therefore, paid out of our school funds, One Hundred and Forty Dollars ($140.00) in this connection. While I recognize the fact that the Department is hampered in many of its enterprizes on account of lack of funds, I feel also, that this is a larger amount than we can conveniently pay out of school funds and especially will this be so, if we increase the number to twelve as it seems desirable that we should.\n\nI am writing you more fully in this connection that I may have your direction as to what policy should be adopted for the future and what relief the Department might be able to give us in following out this policy.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.

Before the school reopens after the summer holidays, you should advise the Department regarding the pupils that you consider should take advanced work during the year 1933-34. You should give the age in each case.\n\nThe pupils who are, at present, taking advanced educational work should be carefully surveyed with a view to determining if each of them is making reasonably satisfactory progress. If there are any whom you consider are not taking full advantage of the opportunity offered to them, the Department feels that it would be only a waste of money to have them continue and, if there are any in this class, application should be made for their discharge.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., June 29th, '33\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of June 25th #133-0-22 has just come in. And I have noted carefully its contents. Early in August I will write you fully in regard to the pupils desiring to take or continue High School or other advanced educational work. In the meantime I wish to say that examination returns so far as they have already come in are very highly satisfactory. The lowest average with the Technical boys on the final examinations is 72%. The first reading of the twenty pupils who have taken Grades IX and X examinations would indicate that all have secured their standing.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of the annual letter which I am now sending out. I find that a letter like this with a number of pictures of the pupils and school activities creates a great deal of interest on the Reserves and takes the place of recruiting for pupils.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.

Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, enclosing an account for $49 covering the cost of examination fees of pupils of the Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I would point out that for each pupil who has taken higher education during the present year the Department has allowed the sum of $50. It is considered that the examination fees should be paid from this amount. The account which you forwarded is, therefore, being returned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. A. Boyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal, Indian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., July 13, 1953\n\nMr. J. D. Sutherland,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nConfidential\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have just received a letter from Rev. K. J. Beaton of our Home Mission Office suggesting that I send you a few copies of the circular letter which I sent this year to parents, Indian Agents and Missionaries among the Indians. I am therefore enclosing four copies herewith.\n\nI have felt very much recently like writing you in regard to the Technical School here. On account of financial difficulties the Provincial Government has reduced its grant for this school very seriously and as the Dominion grant for this kind of education is an amount equal to the Provincial grant the funds available for the school will be so reduced as to make its continuation problematical. Negotiations are now being carried on by which the Dominion Government is requested to accept a grant from the Municipality in lieu of the amount which the Provincial Government has previously paid and make their grant the same as in former years. I have been informed that a great deal of influence will have to be exercised on the Dominion Government to secure this result.\n\nOn account of the above facts I felt I wanted to state to you my convictions in regard to the service this Technical School is rendering to our bows. If you see fit to do so it might be that a word from you would carry considerable weight with the Minister of Labor in regard to the grant requested.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., 19\u2014\n\nI am quite convinced that Technical and Vocational Education are bound to receive greater emphasis in the future and mechanically trained men will be in greater demand than ever and these schools can render a very great service in this direction especially at a time like this when so many boys in their later teens are unemployed and can be trained for useful and productive service instead of drifting into idle and useless lives which will become a menace in the future.\n\nI wish also to say that this School and the course given to our boys has given all seven of them a new ambition in life. They are taking a great interest in their work and are having a splendid affect on the spirit of the School. The fact that all seven have passed with the lowest average being 72% has been an inspiration to the other pupils.\n\nIf this School continues and your Department approves of it I would have no difficulty in placing three or four new boys in the School each year thus having nine to twelve in attendance regularly and three or four graduating each year.\n\nI must apologise for the length of this letter.\n\nI am\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. A. Doyle.\nOttawa, July 28, 1933.\n\nDear Dr. Doyle:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to the Technical School in Brandon.\n\nI visited the Labour Department and discussed this matter. The Act under which grants were set aside for technical education expressly prohibits the Dominion Government from accepting a grant from the municipality towards the cost of running expenses of technical schools in lieu of the grant from the Provincial Government. I was informed that there was a balance to the credit of the Manitoba Government for technical education to the amount of $400,000 but that, as the Provincial Government was unable to contribute towards the cost of technical schools, it was doubtful if this amount would not lapse. I may add that all grants for technical education will lapse as from March 31, 1934, unless further extended by Act of Parliament.\n\nShould the authorities in Brandon who are responsible for the conducting of the Technical School be unable to continue this activity during the coming school year, the only recourse, in so far as the Indian pupils who have been attending are concerned, is to grant them their discharge and allow them to return to their homes. However, should it be possible that arrangements can be completed to continue the Technical School during the coming academic year, this Department will continue to provide the advanced educational grant at the rate of $50 for each pupil, as was done last year.\n\nI am pleased to note that the seven boys who attended technical school last year took such an interest in their work and obtained such excellent results. It is noted that, should the school continue, you will likely be placing three or four new boys, thus having from nine to twelve in attendance regularly.\n\nWith reference to the pupils who are taking advanced educational work in the Brandon School, the Department will await a reply to letter dated June 26th, last, when further consideration will be given as to the grant that can be allowed in their case. Our\n\n- Appropriation\n\nRev. J A. Doyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\nAppropriation was so greatly reduced this year, that it is necessary, in the providing of these advanced grants, that they are continued only in the case of those pupils who passed their examinations last year, and those who failed will have to be discharged.\n\nRecently, the Department has been requested by the Treasury Board to make a further cut of ten per cent. in the Appropriation for this fiscal year, which will materially reduce the amount that can be provided for higher education. I shall be pleased to have a list of those pupils who obtained their standing last year, together with the names of any new pupils who will enter on high school work. When this information is received, the most favourable consideration will be given to providing a grant, either a lump sum or, if possible, at the same rate as last year.\n\nI wish to thank you for the copies of the circular letter sent by you to parents, Indian agents and missionaries. I have noted with interest the various school groups as well as your letter setting forth the different activities of the school.\n\nI may add that I am hopeful of visiting your school some time after the middle of September, next; and, if present arrangements can be carried out, you will be advised in due time.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

I have however just been talking with the Inspector and he feels quite confident that no change will be made in the standing given to each of these pupils by their teacher and himself. If this is not changed every pupil in these grades will have passed. Reports have come from grades XI and XII examinations and each pupil has passed in all grades.\n\nAs soon as the reports come in in regards to grades IX and X I will give you a detailed statement in regard to each student.\n\nWe will look forward with pleasure to the prospects of a visit from you in September.\n\nI am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle,\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man.\n\n4-JED\n\nFor the senior room this next year we will have a fair sized Grade VII class. Five in Grade VIII. At least one in Grade IX and eight in Grade X, that is if all are allowed to continue. It will therefore be impossible to take Grade XI in our School here. They will have to attend the Collegiate in Brandon. I have discussed this matter very fully with the Inspector and he very definite in his opinion that no one teacher in fairness to herself, the students, or the School should undertake this Grade XI Class in addition to all the subjects in the other four Grades.\n\nMay I add that I personally would like to see all these pupils have a chance for at least another year. There are very hopeful elements in each of them but if it's your opinion that any of them should not be allowed to continue I would be glad if you would send me a night letter not later than Tuesday next that I may get in touch with any such either by phone or telegram preventing them from commencing the journey back to Brandon.\n\nTrusting that the above contains the information that you desire and awaiting your reply.\n\nI am Yours respectfully,\n\nJ.

I am therefore making my reports today based on the results tabulated by our High School teacher Miss Werthenbach and the Inspector Mr. J. Boyd Morrison of Brandon. Mr. Morrison is quite confident that these figures will not be changed by the Department. It is very gratifying to note that all twenty who wrote on these grades have received their standing and only supplemental papers will be required and five of these on the part of two boys Walter Deiter and Norman Keewatin who desire to attend Technical School next year and are already qualified to enter this School. Lancelot Ahenakew was sick a good deal during the year and has only one supplemental. Thelma Pewless who has a supplemental in History should have been at the head of the list and previous tests show that she knows her History exceedingly well.\n\nThe only prospective new pupil I have for advanced education at the present time is Jessie Bear of Davis, Sask. who passed Grade VIII last year in the File Hills School and is recommended by Principal Rhodes to come here for Grade IX this year. He commends her as a promising girl.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A.

J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., August 10, 1933\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to write you in regard to Elsie McLaren No. 0396 to whom I have referred on page 3 of my letter of this date re. High Schools pupils.\n\nElsie came to us a year ago to finish Grade XI and Grade XII and with the prospect or desire of attending the Normal School here during the coming year. I wrote in this connection on January 27, 33, and have your reply of February 10, 33 No. 133-0-22. During the winter and spring Elsie repeatedly expressed a great desire to take a full Arts Course. When I was in Winnipeg early in June attending Conference I discovered that Five Hundred dollars had been left by the Will of Elsie's Grandfather to help her secure higher education. This money being held in Trust by an uncle of hers Mr. C. E McLaren of Willow Brook, Sask. This amount of money is about sufficient to pay the fees at Brandon College during the three years required to finish her course in Arts. I made the suggestion to Elsie's Aunt who gave me the information that I would suggest to your Department that Elsie be allowed to remain in this School and attend Brandon College from here. Miss McLaren sent this word to her brother at Willow Brook and on the strength of this suggestion he sent the Five Hundred dollars to me asking me to have this plan carried out at all possible.\n\nI might add that Elsie is one of the best students and to every appearance that we have yet discovered, is one of the finest girls I have ever met. Mr. Reid the Principal of the Brandon Collegiate is unqualified in his commendation of Elsie both as a student and as a girl of fine Christian character.\n\nHoping that the above arrangement may meet with your approval and awaiting your direction in the matter.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.

While her mother was an Indian, her father was the late Reverend Mr. McLaren, at one time Principal of the Birtle Indian Residential School. The girl is legally White and, for your information, I may say that the following assistance has already been granted her:\n\n| Attended Elphinstone Consolidated School | Amount of Grant |\n|------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| 1927-28                                  | $100.00        |\n| 1928-29                                  | $120.00        |\n| 1929-30                                  | $65.85         |\n\nAttended Prince Albert Ladies' College\n\nIn addition to the above, she was at the Birtle Residential School for the academic year 1931-32 and has been at the Brandon Residential School for the past academic year.\n\nIn view of her parentage, it is a question whether or not the Department should ever have assisted her. However, a decision must now be made regarding our future action. The matter has received very careful consideration and the Department feels that, in view of her legal status and the assistance we have already given her and the similar fact that our funds this year are extremely limited, it will not be possible to grant her any further assistance, even to the extent of providing per capita grant for her attendance at an Indian residential school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

But first permit me to say how delighted we all were with your visit yesterday and only regret that it was so short.\n\nWhen I received your letter of August the 17th, No. 13200-22, I immediately withdrew Elsie's name from the list of Grant Earning pupils but retained her as a pupil in the School awaiting the opportunity of conversation with you in connection with her case. I also decided that instead of going forward with her Arts course it would be much better for Elsie to take her normal training and be ready to earn her own living at the end of this year.\n\nElsie's mother, also the executors of both her grandfather's and grandmother's will, were anxious also that she should remain here for this year at least. All her expenses, fees, etc., to be paid out of funds willed to her for the purpose of advanced education.\n\nI was glad yesterday to have your approval of this course and as you suggested I am writing this letter that the matter may have official confirmation.\n\nI am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle,\nOttawa, October 18, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, in regard to Elsie McLaren. In reply I have to say that, as agreed when I visited your school recently, Elsie may reside at the Brandon Indian Residential School during the present academic year - it being understood that her name will be removed from the regular grant-earning pupils and that she will be kept at the school in order that she may attend normal school, without expense to this Department.\n\nWith reference to payment of the advanced educational grant, I have to confirm the agreement made at the time of my visit, viz.: that the sum of $50.00 will be allowed in the case of each pupil attending high school in Brandon, as follows:- 6 in Grade 11, 1 in Grade 12, and also for the 11 boys attending Technical School. Besides, the Department will pay the school fees for the pupils attending high school. The tuition fees of the boys attending Technical School are to be paid by you from the per capita allowance or other receipts of the school.\n\nWith reference to the five pupils in Grade 10 and one in Grade 9, who are attending classes at the Brandon School, I have to say that the Department will allow the advanced educational grant in the case of each at the rate of $25 for the current academic year.\n\nIt is understood that the advanced educational grants allowed are in addition to the regular per capita allowance. I believe this will now clear up the matter of advanced educational grants which the Department can allow for pupils taking courses in higher education at your school during the present academic year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Please exercise very great care in choosing these pupils. Only those who show exceptional ability should be selected. Any who were unsuccessful in the examinations at the end of June should not be given another chance next year. In your reply, you should state whether the pupils recommended by you will attend either the Collegiate or Technical School in Brandon or will take higher educational work in the Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nA brief report should also be included regarding each child recommended for higher educational work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

I am writing you now concerning Mary Belle Watson, No. 0377, age 19. This girl belongs to Broadview and came to us three years ago from Round Lake. She cleared her Grade IX in one year, had one honor paper in Grade X and two honor papers, taking an average of 71.4%. She has a good mind and expresses herself in public address very well. She went home for holidays last year as she had done on all previous years but conditions in her home were not favorable. Her mother was elsewhere and I believe another woman was living in the home. She was, therefore, without the care and protection that she should have had. As a result on two occasions, if her story is correct, and I am confident that it is, she stepped aside in her moral conduct. When she returned to us in the fall she seemed much chagrined confessed her mistake and asked very earnestly that she would not be allowed to go home for holidays this year. So she is remaining with us and is very anxious to stay here next year. But she has failed on a number of subjects and will be required to repeat her Grade XI, which she requires to qualify her to train as a nurse, which is her ambition. I feel, therefore, like making a special plea for this girl to be given another chance and am writing you hoping that special consideration will be given in her case.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev.

I note that you have consulted with Inspector Hamilton and also with Ewart himself, and that he is anxious to remain in the school for another year and take a course at normal school with a view to obtaining a teacher's certificate. I also note your report regarding the character and behaviour of this young Indian, and that you are assured he would apply himself and make a success if the opportunity were granted him to continue his studies.\n\nIn discussing this boy's case with the Deputy Superintendent General, he feels that the Department has dealt very generously towards his maintenance and education. However, if you will keep him at the school without further per capita grant for him after the end of the present academic year, viz., June 30th, this Department would allow grant towards the payment of fees for the normal course to the amount of $100 during the next school year.

Doyle D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., June 24, 1935.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am writing in regard to Lancelot Ahenakew,\nNo. 436.\n\nWhen this boy received word that he should be discharged this year, he wrote to his parents. His father has been talking the matter over with Mr. Ernest B. Goodman, the teacher on their reserve, and asked if there was any way by which Lancelot could continue for another year and they pay the board while in school. I wrote Mr. Goodman telling him that the matter might be considered if he were taking a Normal course and if they wished me to do so, I would take the matter up with the Department.\n\nLancelot is now writing on his Grade XI, which, if he passes clear on every subject, will entitle him to attend Second Class Normal and he seems very anxious to do so. He would then be qualified to earn and continue his education later.\n\nI am submitting the matter for your consideration. If you decide that this privilege should be given to him, I will be glad to take him on with Ewart Monias. With over twenty pupils being discharged, there will, no doubt, be plenty of room for most of the year at least.\n\nLancelot is a very good student, has a keen\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J.

It is noted that this boy has only completed his Grade XI this year. Would it not be necessary for him to finish his Grade XII before he enters Normal School? In view of his age, the Department cannot continue the per capita grant for him but, if you can provide accommodation at the school, we would allow a grant towards his tuition if he attends Normal School at the same rate as in the case of Ewart Monias, viz., $100., during the academic year 1935-36. This would be the final year that any further assistance can be given this boy.\n\nThe above grant is allowed on the understanding that he has successfully passed his Grade XI examinations and is qualified to enter Normal School. Should he fail in his Grade XI examinations, it is considered that, in view of his age, he should be discharged and returned to his home. I should be pleased to hear from you later regarding the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J. A.

Mr. R. J. Reid, Principal of the Collegiate, called me in the other day and urged that Gladys should not be required to write on all five subjects, remaining to complete her Grade XI, at this time. She has been kept out of school on account of illness and temporary quarantine for fear of Scarlet Fever and Mr. Reid thinks that if she took two subjects now and the other three next midsummer she would be practically assured of completing this Grade successfully. But he fears, if required to take all five at this time, she would not be successful on all of them.\n\nMr. Reid had every good word to say in regard to Gladys' attitude and application to her work and I am glad to report that her attitude and conduct in the school as well as her efficiency in taking responsibility have been excellent. I am writing, therefore, to ask that she be allowed to continue with us until midsummer. I might add that Inspector Hamilton knows this girl and her family very well and with us is very anxious that she should be given all possible assistance and encouragement in attaining the objective of training as a nurse on which her heart is very definitely set. She certainly lacks nothing in ambition and perseverance.\n\nTrusting that you may see fit to grant our request in this respect,\n\nI am,\n\nyours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Last year he took his final year in Technical School, also Grade X in connection with our classes here at the school and cleared both successfully. He worked on a farm in the summer and fall and has put in most of the winter in the coal mines in southern Manitoba. He has saved $65.00 and is with us for a few days at present until he gets other employment, the mines having closed down. He is anxious to take up electrical engineering as soon as he has funds enough to warrant him in starting a course. We are informed through the agent at Kamsack that there are funds to his credit in the Department. He is anxious to know the amount that he may make his plans with the above purpose in view.\n\nWe have found Walter decidedly ambitious, willing to work and with sufficient stick-to-iteness to make it quite hopeful that he will make good if given a chance.\n\nIf you will kindly give me the information desired I will pass it on to him and will be glad to co-operate with you in anything you may suggest for the safeguarding of the proper use of his money if it is deemed advisable that he should continue his education.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.

It is understood, of course, that such accounts would be in connection with his higher education.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J. A.

Principal Ross of Round Lake a few weeks ago in Winnipeg, he expressed concern in regard to a formal pupil of his, Leonard Stevenson, whom he says is exceedingly anxious to take a technical course and wishes to come to Brandon School next year. I suggested that he speak to the agent Mr. McKenzie, and I now have his letter suggesting that I drop a line in regard to Leonard. He is twenty years of age and in Mr. Ross' opinion shows sufficient mechanical aptitude to make him a promising young man. If in your wisdom he should come to us we will be glad to receive him.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJAD/EW\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant, the funds available for tuition grants have been greatly reduced this year and, in view of this and the further fact that Leonard Stevenson is now twenty years of age, the Department is not prepared to approve his transfer from the Round Lake Residential School to the Brandon Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

It is noted that this girl has developed a skin condition on her hands and that it would be unwise for her to enter a hospital for training as a nurse. Your recommendation, that she be allowed to return to the Brandon School and attend normal school, in order to qualify as a teacher, is approved.\n\nThe Department will allow the School the usual per capita grant for this girl, together with the advanced educational grant to the amount of $50.00. This is the same as allowed in the case of the pupils of the Brandon Indian Residential School who attend Technical School and Brandon Collegiate. Gladys could live at the school and attend the Normal School. She would then, during the course of her studies, receive care and oversight during the period she is taking the course at the Normal School. I would request that you inform Dr. Doyle accordingly. It is noted that he will take her into the school and furnish necessary transportation. The above is the full amount the Department can provide in assisting this girl to take a course at normal school.\n\nAs requested, I return herewith the snapshot. It shows, as stated by you, considerable improvement in the present generation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, August 22, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI would request that you inform the Department of the names of the pupils of the Brandon Indian Residential School who will be attending Technical School and Brandon Collegiate during the coming academic year, as well as the names of the pupils who will take up high school work at the Brandon School during the same period.\n\nWe are informing Mr. Inspector Hamilton that Gladys Haywahe may return to the school in order that she can attend normal school. The Department will allow the usual per capita grant for her, together with the advanced educational grant to the amount of $50.00. This is the total expenditure we can incur for this girl, and any other expenses, over and above the amount stated, will have to be provided by yourself or the girl's parents. Mr. Inspector Hamilton is being informed accordingly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J. A.

He got employment in the vicinity during that summer, worked in the mines during the winter and, as stated in my letter of March 16, 1936, is ambitious to take up electrical engineering. He was working with the Central Refineries but they closed down in the fall and Walter decided to attend the Collegiate here and secure his Grade XI. We arranged for him to stay at the school and his fees have been included in the enclosed bill.\n\nI am complying with the suggestion of your letter of March 19th, 1936, #133-0-22, in making request that this amount be paid on his account.\n\nWe find Walter very satisfactory and feel quite confident that he will make good.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.

I am very much pleased, indeed, to report favourably on both points. There is no question that she is facing up to her work in a good, earnest way and seems to be keeping up with the class as well as could be expected, coming in as late as she did. Her spirit and attitude in the school leave little to be desired. She is a very promising girl and we will be glad to give her all the help we possibly can. We will report to you later in regard to her.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd.) J. A. Doyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., April 12, 1937.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nLast school year Ewart Monias took Normal while in attendance here and in the early summer was appointed teacher at Nelson House. When his appointment was made he expected to go as a married man and the arrangement with Jessie Bear, #402, was quite definite before holidays. However, when she returned from holidays she was quite doubtful in the matter and his marriage was indefinitely postponed. Subsequent correspondence, however, has made their engagement quite definite and it seemed advisable also that the marriage should take place before the winter travelling to the North should become impossible. Last week I received a wire from Wabowden urging that she be sent forward at once. So she is now on her way to Nelson House and they will be married on her arrival. I might add that Jessie is a very satisfactory type of girl. She is, or will very shortly be, twenty years of age. She has shown special adaptability in the school for nursing and should be a great help on the Nelson House reserve.\n\nTrusting that this arrangement is quite satisfactory to the Department,\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.

His reports during the year have been favorable. He has been able to finance his living expenses from his own funds, that is, from money saved out of his wages, except $60.00, which he now owes for board. He also had some money from the sale of horses on the reserve.\n\nWalter has requested me to write you, asking for $60.00 to meet this outstanding account, to be charged to funds to his credit in your office.\n\nWalter is exceedingly anxious to go forward with his school work and is making request that the Department re-admit him in the school here and finance him as a higher education pupil after his own funds are exhausted. He will work out during the summer and should be able to save approximately $40.00 and will be glad to apply this on his school work next year. It is with absolute confidence that I recommend that this privilege be granted to him. He is above the average as a student, especially in his dogged perseverance.\nand has a very commendable ambition to get an education and qualify himself for some worthwhile service in life.\n\nTrusting that you may see fit to grant Walter this privilege and opportunity,\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6259, file 576-22, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nOttawa, July 6, 1937.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the first instant, with reference to Walter Baldhead. At the present time there is an amount of $177.35 to his credit. A cheque for $60.00 will be drawn from this account and sent to you.\n\nIt is noted from the last paragraph of your letter that Walter wishes to continue at school. In your letter of March 16th, 1936, you indicated that it was his intention to study electrical engineering. There are so many white persons who have taken different university courses and are now out of work that I feel it would be a mistake on Baldhead's part to endeavour to take the course mentioned. I would strongly recommend either the diploma course in Agriculture, requiring two years, or the graduate course in Agriculture, requiring four years. Either of these courses can be taken at the Faculty of Agriculture at the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Man. By taking either course, this boy would fit himself for work in which openings are generally available and would make it possible for him to be of some real value to his own people.\n\nPlease discuss his future with him again, and let me have your opinion. If he decides to take the course which I suggest in this letter, you might let me know the approximate amount of help that you think the Department should allow him during the academic year 1937-38.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., July 13, 1937.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to thank you for your letter of July 6th, #132-0-22, concerning Walter Baldhead. I note that you state that a cheque for $60.00 drawn on his account will be sent forward in my care. I have today received a cheque from Ottawa for $59.24. I do not quite understand why this amount is sent as it does not seem to cover the total amount to his credit in your office. I will, however, put this in the Bank to his credit and await further information from you.\n\nWalter is now working on a farm east of Brandon but was over for a short visit on Sunday afternoon and we talked over the matter of his further education. Since then I have had conversation with Mr. Tinline, Superintendent of the Experimental Farm here, and a young Mr. Good, who is at the present time taking the degree course at the Faculty of Agriculture at the University of Manitoba. I then drove out to see Walter last night and while he would like very much to take the degree course, he has decided that in the light of all the circumstances it would be better take the diploma course, chiefly because it would give him a more practical training, fitting him for the service he might be called upon to render if he were employed in connection with one of the reserves in the advanced programme which is being adopted.\nThe Secretary - 2\n\nJuly 13, 1937.\n\nAs to the expense of this course I have not definite figures by me at this time but, from the information received from Mr. Good, I would think that if the Department made provision for Walter to the extent of from $75.00 to $100.00 he would be safely cared for for the coming year.\n\nWe appreciate very much your interest in this boy and I feel confident that he will make good.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. [Signature]\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, July 22nd, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th instant, the Department forwarded to you a cheque for $60.00, in favour of Walter Baldhead. Please let me know if this cheque has reached you since you wrote me on the 13th instant.\n\nWe cannot find any record of having issued a cheque for $159.24, in favour of Baldhead. Please let me know the cheque number of the latter cheque.\n\nIt is noted that Walter Baldhead intends to take the course recommended by official letter of the 6th instant. When he requires additional funds, you might communicate with me.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J. A.

He will leave early Monday morning.\n\nWalter turned $75.00 of his wages in during the summer and has asked me to look after his finances. We have checked up fairly carefully and find he needs considerable clothes, also a suitcase, which, including his fare to Winnipeg and $5.00 of spending money, will total $42.00. Then he should have at least $5.00 per month I would think for pocket money while attending College. Then the payment required to the College at this time is $82.00, making a total of $150.00. Will you, therefore, be good enough to send forward $75.00 out of Walter's money, which I think now stands at about $117.00.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle\n\nRev. J. A.

In appearance and attitude there is no trace of Indian characteristics. He has fair hair and white skin, is quite tall, athletic and naturally mechanical. He is a splendid student. He has an impelling ambition to make something of himself. He is a very ready and willing worker, reliable in every way. He will take over the tractor, wash a car, mend a chair, take dining-room duty or do anything he is asked to do in a fine spirit and with efficiency. The North country has a great attraction for him but he is not willing to go as a trapper or fisherman or even a guide. He states that if there is something that he could qualify for in connection with radio, survey work, mining engineering or the mechanical side of airplane service, he would be glad to devote himself to any necessary course of study or preparation. I have suggested the agricultural course but it does not appeal to him as much as something that would take him to the North country.\n\nI appreciate very much your personal interest in boys of this kind and if in the light of what I have written you wish to suggest something further and definite in regard to Herman, he will be glad to consider it and I will certainly spare no pains in helping him toward achieving the success which he is ambitious to attain.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man.,\n\nThe Secretary - 2.\n\nRe - Herman Crate\n\nI can use Herman to good advantage in connection with our work at the school here as soon as he is through writing on his Grade XII examinations. Will give him at least $25.00 per month.\n\nAwaiting your reply,\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle,\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nMay 11, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 5th instant with reference to Herman Crate.\n\nI note that this boy will likely obtain Grade 12 standing at the close of the present academic year. In view of the large number of university graduates who find it difficult to secure employment at the present time I doubt the advisability of incurring additional expenditure on this boy's behalf. He is now 19 years of age and I feel that the Department has dealt very generously with him. I am sorry that he did not see fit to take advantage of the opportunity of accepting the training offered at Riding Mountain Park.\n\nI note from the last paragraph of your letter that you intend to employ him at the school next year. If he saves his money he should be able to provide some additional training from his own funds, if he feels so inclined.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J. A.

I have pointed out to them that these courses will take several years and that it will require a strong determination and deep concentration on the part of the children to achieve their goal, the children assure me that they are prepared to apply themselves to the utmost of their ability in order that they may qualify themselves to work in their chosen fields.\n\nMr Anderson and Mr Bird have offered to bear part of the expense of this training to the extent of $75.00 per Annum, I cannot speak for Mr Ahenakew, but I am sure that he would be willing to contribute a like amount toward the expense of his daughters training, in the case of Mr Goforth; this man is not the type to extend himself sufficiently to enable him to make any definite contribution but his daughter is very anxious to continue and if the Department could see their way clear to extend High School privileges to her I am sure she would make the very best use of the advantages offered.\n\nDoris Anderson, Catherine Ahenakew and Gerald Bird have very good ability and have proven exceptional Pupils and I would appreciate it very much if they could be given the opportunity.\nfor further advancement.\n\nAs the Branden Truck will be here on September 1st to transport their Pupils to their School I will appreciate it very much if you will advise me by wire if the Department approve of this transfer so that there will not be any additional expense in transporting these particular pupils to Branden.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev.

I might say that I made very serious\neffort to connect with Mr. Hoey when in Winnipeg at\nthe time referred to in the last paragraph of this\nletter, but was unable to get in touch with him.\n\nThe situation with Mary is this: she\npassed Grade X examination very successfully; was\nanxious not to return to the reserve for the summer\nand got work under Dr. Sims at the Indian Hospital\nat Fort Qu'Appelle, and what word I have had concerning\nher has been decidedly favourable. She is very anxious\nto take up Grade XI, that she may be able to enter a\nhospital and train for a nurse. She has proven herself\nhere to be splendidly adapted for this profession.\nThe atmosphere and condition of her home, and the\nattitude of her parents would make it almost impossible\nfor her to remain at home and continue her studies\nextramurally. The best possible place, as far as we\ncan see, is attending the Collegiate here at Brandon.\nMrs. Ross has secured I think it is $125.00, to pay\nus for her board; and after considering the matter\nvery thoroughly, we have no hesitation in appealing\nto the Department to give some help toward this girl's\nfurther training, and would suggest that the Department\npay the $50.00 which we receive for pupils taking\nhigher education and attending the Collegiate, and\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man.,\n\nThe Secretary\u20142\n\nalso look after the Collegiate fees, which is another $50.00. We would like also that she be regarded as supernumerary with us.\n\nIf the Department feels that it cannot pay the full amount of $100.00, we would be glad to learn at an early date, just what they would be prepared to do.\n\nI might further add that everyone who knows Mary has confidence that she will make good if given an opportunity.

Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., Aug. 16, 1938.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am writing now concerning Vera Gray, No. 0414, and Agnes Kay, No. 0474, referred to in our correspondence concerning the discharge of pupils, dating from May 3rd, to your letter of June 3rd, No. 133-0-\n\nI have just returned from holidays, and have delayed writing till I would get further information concerning Vera's examination results. These have just come to my desk, and I find that she has passed clear in all subjects, and I now have no hesitation in urging that she be given the opportunity to attend here next year and take Grade XII. This girl is exceedingly ambitious to qualify herself for some useful place in life. From appearance she is absolutely white, there being no sign of Indian blood; and her whole desire is to identify herself permanently with the white race, and mingle as a citizen in Canadian life. Her mother is an English woman, and both father and mother are exceedingly anxious for her to continue in School. Her brother is now doing well employed in tractor work on the reserve in the vicinity of Broadview. He was employed in this School acceptably for about three years after his graduation in Technical School. Her younger sister graduated last year and is now rendering satisfactory service in one of our good homes in Brandon. I'll be glad if you can see your way clear to accede to this request.\n\nAgnes is also a very fine type of girl, is more reserved, less confident than Vera, has more of the Indian appearance, expresses her desire to become a teacher; would be willing to take up nursing if this were considered more advisable for her; and I feel confident, if given an opportunity, would make good; and I am leaving\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man.,\n\nThe Secretary------\n\nthe decision in regard to these girls to you. You can see from the above that I feel like urging the case of Vera more especially.\n\nAwaiting your reply, I am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle,\nPRINCIPAL.\nAugust 25th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 17th instant with reference to four pupils of the File Hills Residential School who you recommend should be transferred to the Brandon Indian Residential School in order that they might continue high school studies.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter to the effect that the parents of Doris Sanderson, No. 0164, Catherine Ahonakew, No. 0226 and Gerald Bird, No. 166, are prepared to provide an amount of $75.00 each towards the cost of the tuition, the Department approves the transfer of these three pupils to the Brandon Indian Residential School. We will depend on you to arrange with the father of each of the three pupils mentioned above to forward $75.00 to Rev. J. A. Doyle, Principal, Indian Residential School, Brandon, Manitoba.\n\nUnless the father of Maud Gefforth, No. 0174, is prepared to make the same payment as the other three parents mentioned above, the Department cannot see its way clear to approve the transfer of this girl to Brandon.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. HOBY,\nSuperintendent Welfare & Training.\n\nF. Rhodes, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nFile Hills Indian Residential School,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nAugust 25th, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nRecently we received a request from the Principal of the File Hills Residential School for the transfer of four pupils to the Brandon Residential School in order that they might continue High School studies.\n\nFor your information, I enclose a copy of official letter of today's date to the Principal of File Hills School. You will note that the parents of the three children whose transfer is approved will each forward you $75.00. This amount should be funded by you and used for the expenses that are incurred in their case over and above the per capita grant.\n\nIn other words, the Department will only pay the Brandon School the per capita grant for these three children.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. HEST,\nSuperintendent Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Manitoba.\nAugust 25th, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 16th instant with reference to Vera Gray, No. 0414, and Agnes Kay, No. 0474.\n\nOur records show that Agnes Kay took Grade 9 work last year. She may continue in Grade 10 for the academic year 1938-39 and we will allow for her the advance education grant of $25.00 in addition to the per capita grant.\n\nIt is noted that Vera Gray has completed Grade 11 and I understand that this would enable her to attend normal school. Under these circumstances, I cannot see any reason why she should wish to take Grade 12. It is difficult to justify the expenditure required for her to spend another year at High School, in view of the fact that funds do not permit our assisting many Indian pupils.\n\nIf she wishes to attend normal school during the academic year of 1938-39, the Department is prepared to assist her.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Do you desire that we allow $100.00 plus the per capita grant, or is $100.00 the only amount that you expect from us?\n\nOn receipt of your reply to this letter, a definite decision will be made in the case of this girl.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.

Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., 1938.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have just returned from one of my long trips in bringing pupils back from holidays, and find your letter of August 25, No. 133-0-22, re Mary Tapotat, No. 0464, awaiting me.\n\nThe amount we are asking the Department to allow is $100.00; $50.00 to pay the Collegiate Fees in Brandon, and $50.00 as the extra Higher Education Grant made by the Department toward our pupils who are attending School in the City of Brandon. Mrs. Ross has secured, I think it is $125.00, which with some $20.00 or $30.00 that Mary has earned this summer, we are willing to accept in lieu of the regular $161.50 per capita grant; and we are also asking that she be regarded as supernumerary on our list of pupils.\n\nI am Yours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle.\n\nPRINCIPAL.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., Aug. 31, 1938\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter No. 133-0-22 of August 25th, concerning Vera Gray, No. 0414, and Agnes Kay, No. 0474, is before me.\n\nI wish to thank you for your consideration in allowing Agnes Kay to return and go forward with her grade ten work this year.\n\nIn regard to Vera Gray. I am sure she would be glad to avail herself of the opportunity of attending Normal this coming School year, if she were allowed to do so; but I have just been in touch with the School Board and find that students are no longer admitted to the Normal with Grade XI standing. They require Grade XII. Under these circumstances, I sincerely hope the Department will see fit to allow Vera to go on and take her Grade XII.\n\nI would like further to express my appreciation of the action of the Department in giving Normal training to former pupils of this School. I have just been recounting those who have taken that training since I became Principal here. They are as follows: the first was Winnie Steinhauer, No. 0241. Winnie taught for a time in Manitoba and then was with us as Junior Teacher here for nearly two years. She was called home on account\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., Aug. 31, 1938\n\nThe Secretary------\n\nof her Mother's serious illness, is now married, and I have had a good report of her influence in the Community; the next was Alexander Sparvier. He taught for a while, then married and settled on the reserve and cannot be pointed to with much satisfaction. Lulu Ironstar, O303, took this training, taught with us for two years, did exceedingly well, went to Nelson House to teach, married a white man living on the Reserve, and she is maintaining a good home. The next was Elsie McLaren, O396. She has since completed her Arts Course, and went a couple of weeks ago to teach at Cross Lake, Manitoba. Two years ago Gladys Haywahe, No. 5087, attended Normal. She taught for a while last year at Round Lake, and has now secured a School near Hodgson here in Manitoba. Perhaps the most outstanding of our graduates who took Normal training was Ewart Monies, No. 416, who for the past two years has been teaching the Day School at Nelson House, is married to another graduate, Jessie Bear, No. 0402, and we have a splendid report, both of their work and of their home. In reviewing this list, I cannot help but feel that our combined efforts, and the money spent on these pupils has been abundantly worth while.\n\nI am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle\n\nJAD/RS\n\nPRINCIPAL.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., Sept. 6 1938.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have two boys, Joseph Mason, No. 422, and Allan Thomas, No. 434, who wish to attend the Technical School for Automotive Mechanics in Brandon, during this coming year. They have had this in mind for over a year, and I have hesitated recommending it, as I was not satisfied with the way the School has been run during this last year or so, and felt that unless there was a radical change, that our boys would not receive the benefit for the time and money expended. That change has taken place. A new Principal has been secured, and the course has been reduced to one year instead of covering three years, and the outline of training emphasizes those practical uses of gasoline and electricity, and general machine-shop work which come into practical use either in a shop or on a farm. I have looked into the matter as thoroughly as I can at its present stage of development, and I feel quite confident the course will be of real benefit to those adapted to this kind of training.\n\nJoseph Mason is on our books as seventeen. He tells me, however, that he will not be seventeen until next month. He has completed Grade VIII, is a\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man.,\n\nThe Secretary---\n\ngood, steady, trustworthy boy, is a good average in mechanical ability, and I am sure this course would benefit him very much.\n\nAllen Thomas is sixteen, is above the average in his liking and ability in handling machinery, is especially good with the tractor, and this course might make him quite outstanding in this line of work. He also has completed Grade VIII.\n\nThe fees for this course are $20.00 per student for the year, and the course starts on September 15th. I would be glad of an early reply in connection with this matter.\n\nI am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle,\n\nJAD/RS PRINCIPAL.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 12, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 31st ultimo the Department will allow an amount of $100.00 for the academic year 1938-39 as a tuition grant to assist Mary Tapota to continue her high school work.\n\nIt is noted that it will not be necessary to allow a per capita grant for her and, therefore, her name should not appear on the quarterly return.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your other letter of the 31st ultimo the same grant as last year will be allowed for Vera Gray in order that she can take grade 12 work during the academic year 1938-39.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Doyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 12, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant the Department will allow an amount of $30.00 each over and above the per capita grant for the academic year 1938-39 to enable Joseph Mason, No. 482, and Allan Thomas, No. 434, to attend the Technical School for Automotive Mechanics in Brandon.\n\nI note that the former three year course has been reduced to one year and I am inclined to doubt that any pupil will be able to obtain any real value from this abbreviated course.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

I have also received a letter from the Principal of that School informing me that he will be very pleased to take him for Grade X work, and that his pupils are taking High School and Collegiate work and doing very well.\n\nI have also discussed the matter with the Principal of the High School, and he approves the suggestion.\n\nI would therefore recommend that the admission of this boy be approved to the Brandon Residential School, and that his transportation and necessary expenses for meals &c be authorized.\n\nWaiting your early reply, so he can get there as soon as possible, and so not miss more time than is necessary, if his admission is approved.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 20, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 14th instant with reference to Fraser Kejick who has been attending high school at Kenora.\n\nRecent information received from the Principal of the Brandon Indian Residential School indicates that a one year course of vocational training can now be obtained at the Brandon Technical School. The Department is not prepared to approve transferring Fraser Kejick from Cecilia Jeffrey to Brandon in order to take up the regular high school work. We are willing, however, for him to transfer provided he takes the one year vocational course. If he is willing to do so you may arrange for sending him to Brandon immediately.

A few days after he went to work for Mr. Eisler, I happened to be in Souris, and found that Walter had gone to a very difficult place. This man has a record of constant trouble with his hired help; one spring had six men in succession during seeding. Walter stayed till after haying, and when he felt he could not stay any longer, secured another man to take his place. Eisler refused to pay Walter, so Walter secured the services of a lawyer in Souris, who secured a statement from Eisler that he would pay Walter $58.00 at the end of October. Walter then got work with a Mr. Latcham south of here, and will have $80.00 coming to him when he is through, which makes a total of $138.00. His prospective expenses will be as follows:\n\n- College Board & Fees: $171.00\n- Personal Expense, 5 months, including clothes: $35.00\n- Other Students' Fees, including pool fee for Medical Service: $20.00\n- Expenses re Christmas Holiday when College is closed: $10.00\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev.

Waite Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage-la-Prairie.\n\nDear Mr Waite,\n\nFour of our senior girls are anxious to continue their education and want to transfer to Brandon Residential School, where they can take the High School Course. I think it is most desirable that their request be granted. Dr. Doyle is willing to accept them. The girls have an excellent record here; they are intelligent and would make good use of higher education; they are girls of good character and worthy of continued support from the Department.\n\n0214 Grace Johnnie, 16 years grade 8 from Roseau Reserve\n0217 Jean Prince, 16 \" \" Long Plains\n0220 Edna Tanner, 16 \" \" Swan Lake\n0221 Helen Myerion 15 \" \" Long Plains\n\nI am pleased to recommend the transfer and respectfully ask you to present to the Department for their consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJoseph Jones\nIndian Residential School\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nSep 7th 1939\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have asked Indian Agent Waite to forward applications for transfer of four pupils from this school to Brandon Indian School to take the High School Course.\n\nThese girls are good students and excellent character. They are worthy of the continued opportunity they will find at Brandon.\n\nThe parents or Guardians of three of these pupils are willing to allow the children to be transferred. The father of the fourth girl (0221 Helen Myerion) wants me to ask for the discharge of Helen to go and live with him. The girl does not want to go and I think it would be a cruel thing to send her away in charge of her father, he is not capable of caring for her in any way, and certainly not from a moral standpoint. Two years ago Helen's older sister Lucy left the school and went to her father, (the mother died some years ago) I have a letter today from Lucy asking me to take her in the school. In less than one week after Lucy left the School her father allowed her to co-habit with a half-breed and in less than three months she was in jail for drunkenness. The father is one of the worst drinkers on Long Plains Reserve. Therefore I would urge that the Request of the father be not considered and that Helen be allowed to continue her education. She is a splendid girl in every way and will I am sure be a credit to the school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJoseph Jones\n\n0214 Grace Johnnie 16 years Grade 8 from Roseau Reserve\n0217 Jean Prince \" \" \" \" Long Plains\n0220 Edna Tanner \" \" \" 7 \" Swan Lake\n0221 Helen Myerion \" \" \" 8 \" Long Plains\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nSept. 4th, 1939.\n\nI beg to attach hereto a letter received from the Reverend Principal of the Portage Residential School in which he makes certain recommendations in regard to a number of pupils of the school. I recommend that the first three on the list be allowed to take the high school course at Brandon. The last on the list, Helen Myerion is passed to the Department for decision. The father of the girl does not want her to go to Brandon, but wants her home. I interviewed the girl on Saturday last and she expressed the wish that she be allowed to attend the Brandon School. The girl is the daughter of Archie Myerion, No. 133 Long Plain Reserve. He is living with Mrs Simon Prince, No. 125 Long Plain Reserve. This is a common law wife. Under these conditions the home atmosphere is not all that could be desired, and it is my opinion that the girl would be better off with two years at Brandon School. There has been considerable controversy in regard to this matter and I would be pleased to have the Department decide the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 12, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 4th instant the Department approves the transfer of the under-mentioned children from the Portage la Prairie Indian residential school to the Brandon Indian residential school:\n\nNo. 0214 Grace Johnnie\n\" 0217 Jean Prince\n\" 0220 Edna Tanner\n\" 0221 Helen Myerion\n\nYou will note from the above that the list includes Helen Myerion.

A. Doyle.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, July 10, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to the attached account, I would point out that payment of $25.00 is requested for Oriel Flett. Information on file indicates that he only attended high school for three tenths of the term. Consequently, only $15.00 should be requested.\n\nIn reviewing our files I cannot find any authority having been given for the grants for the pupils shown on the account. However, I presume that you considered these grants went on from year to year and consequently the account will be paid when the amended account is received.\n\nOwing to lack of funds, it will be impossible to consider allowing any high school grants for pupils desiring to enter high school for the first time during the academic year 1940-41.\n\nYou still have pupils in the Brandon School who have not yet completed their high school work and who wish to do so. Please forward a special letter giving the names, register numbers and the standing they have obtained on the June examinations. When this information is received, it will be decided whether or not the grant can be renewed for another year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend J. A.

They are as follows:\nKatie Ahenakew, No., 0416 continued in school until May 8th.\nOriel Flett, No., 0351 quit school before the Christmas Examinations. I have put the date as December 5th., it was however, a little later than this date. Doris Ironstar, No., 0396 quit school on February 6th. I put these three in at $25.00 each, but I find that in working out the proportion of time that each one attended collegiate it works out at $40.00 for Katie Ahenakew, $15.00 for Oriel Flett and $25.00 for Doris Ironstar.\n\nI will in the near future send you a list of those who have already commenced their high school work and who wish to continue their studies next year.\n\nI expect to be able to return to the office in a few days.

Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., May 31, 1941\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of May 28th #133-0-22 has just come in, and I note that you are in error as to the arrangement concerning the grant for pupils taking advanced education.\n\nWhen I took over the School twelve years ago $50.00 each was being paid for all pupils above grade 8. The first year we operated there were about 30 in the list, and we received approximately $1500.00. When Mr. Sutherland of the Dept. visited us about that time we negotiated a new arrangement whereby we would receive $25.00 for those taking their work in the School here, and $50.00 each for those attending the Collegiate, Normal School, Technical School, or Business College. This extra $25.00 was in consideration of three things: transportation which meant two trips a day, extra clothing required to correspond with Collegiate standards, then these pupils are not able to contribute anything to speak of to the work of the School.\n\nIf you will look over the records you will find that during these eleven years the School Board fees have been paid by the Department and not by us out of the $50.00 grant.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle\n\nJAD/TS Principal\nOttawa, July 25, 1941.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nNo request has yet been received from the Brandon Residential School for any tuition grants for Indian children to take high school work during the year 1941-42. Upon reviewing the June quarter return, it appears that many, if not all, of those who were engaged in high school work during the academic year 1940-41 were discharged at the end of June. If you refer to the third paragraph of official letter of July 10, 1940, you will note that it is not our intention to allow grants for pupils desiring to enter high school for the first time. Our funds are very limited and we are obliged to keep these grants to the minimum.\n\nUnder these circumstances, no order is being placed for the high school books requested on requisition forwarded to the Department by the former principal, Dr. Doyle, under cover of his letter of May 14, 1941.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

I did not understand the request for Tuition grants for High School work was necessary till the pupils had started school in September. However in looking over the records I find that four of the children who have been granted permission to remain in school this coming year, per your letter of May 13th, have been taking High School work, and also four other children under sixteen years of age have been taking High School work this past year; so these eight we want to continue.\n\nUnder these conditions would you kindly forward the High School books as requisitioned.\n\nAlso I herewith request Tuition grants for 1941-'42 for the following children:\n\nFour at $25.00 each who will be in grade ten:\n- Number 403 Reginald Murdoch\n- Number 495 Edwin Smith\n- Number 510 Ross Francis\n- Number 0508 Dorothy Bear\n\nFour at $50.00 each, in addition to the Tuition fees payable to the Brandon School, who are in grades 11 and 12 and will be attending Brandon Collegiate:\n- Number 0509 Connie Gaddie - Grade 11 - 16\n- Number 0518 Jean Prince - Grade 11 - 17\n- Number 0521 Grace Johnnie - Grade 11 - 16\n- Number 0494 Irene Gaddie - Grade 12 - 18\n\nTrusting this will meet with your favorable consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP.T.

As per your letter of May 28th, 1941, you sent $275.00 covering the eleven pupils. The $150.00 covering the three pupils attending the Brandon Collegiate was forwarded to the Collegiate to pay their tuition fees, and nothing was paid this School. As pointed out in Dr. Doyle's letter to you of May 31, 1941, your grant to this School of $50.00 per pupil attending the Brandon Collegiate is exclusive of tuition fees payable to the Collegiate. I am therefore forwarding voucher number 35 payable to us for this $150.00. Hoping this is satisfactory.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.T.

It has been decided to allow her to remain in the Brandon School for another year, in order that she may complete her Grade 12. However, at the present time I am unable to give any definite assurance that we will be able to assist her in attending normal school. The amount of funds at our disposal next year is uncertain, and, besides, we doubt very much the advisability of encouraging Indian girls to study for the teaching profession. Our experience in this particular regard has been unsatisfactory.\n\nWith reference to this girl attending high school next year, we will allow the usual advanced educational grant of $50.00 over and above the regular per capita grant.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend R.

However, I suggest that you communicate with the Department of Education for the Province of Manitoba with a view to securing the correspondence course for Grade 9 for these children. It is quite possible that the Department will provide the course free of charge. In any case, they will likely give you a reduced rate for five.

Does this mean she is taking a correspondence course?\n\nOur records also indicate that pupils 0509, 0558 and 0554 were approved for high school work in official letter of July 15, 1948. Is it your intention to apply for the discharge of these children at the end of June? Approval was also given for pupils\n\nRev. R.T.

I should appreciate your advising what action you consider should be taken with regard to them at that time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Residential School\n\nBrandon, Man., March 31, 1945.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Mines & Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI received your letter of March 1st, file 133-0-22, when I was used up with the 'flu and so the reply has been held over for a little while.\n\nLast year, in reference to high school students, you stated it was not the intention of the Department to give extra grants for pupils entering high school for the first time. So we were allowed extra grants this year only for pupils who had already started their high school work. I thus understood it was the matter of the special grant to which the Department took exception in these times. Our senior teacher teaches grades 9 and 10 in his classroom, grades 11 and 12 attend the Brandon Collegiate. The pupils who had passed their grade 8 and were not yet 16 automatically went on to grade 9 in our senior classroom. Some of the pupils mentioned in your letter were transferred from Round Lake School and some from File Hills School to take their grade 9. I have not the Department's letters in reference to this, but I have letters from the principals saying that the transfers were approved by the Department on the understanding there would be no extra grant.\n\nIn reference to Edwin Smith, there has been a little slip somewhere. He never has been taking Technical work. He has been taking grade 11 in the Brandon Collegiate, as per request made last year.\nDorothy Bear, #0508, failed in grade 10 last year, not grade 9, and has been repeating her year in our classroom. This year she has shown splendid progress in her grade.\n\nIn regard to those children who will be reaching sixteen years of age, I am making full report and recommendations to accompany the March Quarterly returns.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In view of the information that you supplied regarding Edwin Smith, No. 495, the Department approves his remaining in the Brandon Residential School for another year and taking Grade 12 work at the Collegiate Institute, provided he is successful in his Grade 11 examinations at the end of this month. In the event of his continuing in high school to Grade 12, we will allow next year his collegiate fees and an advanced educational grant of $50.00 in addition to the school per capita grant.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

These pupils,\nhowever, should be enrolled on the definite understanding\nthat after they have completed Grade 9 they will proceed\nwith vocational or semi-vocational courses. It has been\nour experience that pupils who take the regular high\nschool or academic course have difficulty in securing\nprofitable employment after graduation and those of them\nwho return to the reserve do not appear to be in any\nsense more successful than pupils who have left school,\nhaving completed Grade 8.\n\nIn view of the acute shortage of skilled\nmechanics throughout the Dominion, the Minister is partic-\nularly anxious that the brighter Indian pupils should be\nencouraged to take practical courses.

He has been working at the C.P.R. car Shops in the City but has been staying at the School. About three weeks ago he informed me that he had contracted venereal disease and wanted advise. I got in touch with our Doctor who gave him an examination and finally pronounced him as a positive case and prescribed treatment. On Sunday last Edwin complained of severe pains in his right leg and ankle. By night he was unable to walk and has been in bed since that time. I called the Doctor by telephone and he advised me that it in all probability was an arthritic condition set up by the infection and would not subside until the infection abated and the possibility not even then. Because of Edwin's condition and the possibility of the infection being passed on to pupils who would have to give him attention and handling clothing and utensils for him, the Doctor strongly advised that he be removed to hospital as he is not in condition to return to his home reserve.\n\nI shall be glad to have your instructions in this matter at your earliest convenience.\n\nI remain.\n\nYours truly\n\nRev O B Strapp\nPrincipal\nOttawa, October 11th, 1944.\n\nA.

Strapp's letter of August 15th, in connection with the above mentioned Indian, which is self explanatory.\n\nMr. Morris, while at Hodgson, secured a copy of Mr. Strapp's letter and informed Mr. Clarke that he would discuss the case with the Principal when he was at Brandon. At Brandon Mr. Strapp advised that Elwin Smith had left the school and had gone to Winnipeg. His father's name and address is - Private M. Smith, H.71043 - Regimental Police, Fort Garry, Winnipeg. His Aunt's name and address is - Mrs. Bella Dupre, 227 Donald Street, Winnipeg, or 449 Sargeant Street, Winnipeg.\n\nMr. Morris regrets that he did not discuss this case with you as he intended when he was last in Winnipeg. It is suggested, therefore, that as this boy has venereal disease that you communicate this fact to the local authorities and they will see that he takes the necessary treatment.\n\nR. A.

Hoey\n\nOctober 26th,\n1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI expect shortly to be in a position to give you a more extended report on the Conference of Principals of Indian Residential Schools, held in Winnipeg last week; but, in the meantime, I want to take up with you the question of special grants for pupils taking Grade IX and possibly Grade X in a school where this can be done. I have always understood from you that, where a pupil showed aptitude and a likelihood of profiting by the instruction, the Department was not only ready, but indeed anxious, to pay these grants.\n\nIt was reported that there were five pupils taking Grade IX in Brandon this year and that grants had been refused for them, although payment had been made in the case of pupils similarly situated at Edmonton. I am well aware of the fact that difficulties arising in connection with such cases as these are easily straightened up. That is the reason I am writing to you. I shall be glad to know if it is still the policy of the Department to encourage these children to take higher training when they are fitted for it. Perhaps you would be good enough to look up your file on Brandon and see if any have been refused and the reason for the refusal.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6259, file 576-22, part 1)\nOttawa, October 31, 1944.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of October 26, in which you refer to five Indian pupils now taking Grade 9 instruction at Brandon and all of whom are anxious to secure tuition grants from this Department.\n\nDespite the somewhat limited staff at my disposal, I have had the officers here undertake a diligent search of the files, with the object of discovering why these tuition grants were refused. Having undertaken this search, however, I can only state that there is not a vestige of evidence on file to indicate that the grants were either requested by the Principal or refused by this Branch. The last request for a grant at Brandon was sent in by Indian Agent W.J.D. Kerley, of Broadview, Sask., on behalf of Marion Bear, who was anxious to take up high school studies at Brandon. Mr. Kerley's letter is dated September 5 and the tuition grant was authorized on September 14. It has always been understood, between the Principal of the Brandon School and this Department, that a number of tuition grants were awarded to high school pupils, annually, and it is somewhat difficult for me to realize how this misunderstanding has arisen. You might communicate with us again in respect to this matter.\n\nIt is my hope that I shall be able to visit Toronto some time during the week ending November 18 and I should welcome an opportunity to discuss a number of matters with you during the course of my visit to the city.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.

I think that the refusal to which I referred was due to the fact that in July, 1942, you wrote to Brandon, stating that it was not your intention to allow grants for pupils desiring to enter high school for the first time. Evidently, those who were already in high school were to be allowed to complete their course, but no more were to be allowed to proceed to get higher education. I do not know whether that was due to lack of money or to a considered policy on the part of the Department. In any case, the School is requesting grants for higher education in accordance with the list attached hereto.\n\nI shall be glad to have the opinion of your Department on the matter of allowing these children to get a higher education. If the ruling of the Department as given in 1942 obtains, then none of these children will be allowed to proceed.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEncl.\nOttawa, January 25, 1945.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nIn reference to your letter of the 23rd instant, regarding certain pupils at the Brandon Residential School who are attending high school, the Department will allow the following grants for the academic year 1944-45:\n\n1.

Marion Beer has failed badly in every subject. Marguerite Hudson also failed badly in all subjects.

Reid the Principal.\n\nI had a conference with Mr. Reid this morning and he is of the opinion that only the strongest of our students can make the many adjustments that are necessary for them to make between the type of life they have to live in the residential school, with one teacher taking all subjects, and the entirely new set of conditions in the collegiate school where different teachers take individual subjects.\n\nAs you know, I took over this school about two and a half years ago and so have not had very much time in which to study the difficulties encountered by our students who attend the collegiate classes. I have formed the opinion that they would make much better progress if they entered the grade X classes in collegiate instead of taking the course in residential school. This would put them on the same level with all the other students who were starting collegiate classes and would permit them to make their adjustments under more favorable conditions.\n\nI would appreciate your consideration of the course to be adopted in the case of these pupils. I do not feel that they would do very much to improve their standing if they reverted to grade X in residential school for the balance of their year, but can see how they might benefit greatly by attending classes at the collegiate in grade X for the balance of the year. They all have a clear\ngrade I standing and so would not be required to write the examinations at the end of the term.\n\nI discussed this possibility with Mr. Reid and he is willing to try the experiment, provided a number of other students who did not pass their examinations revert to the grade X classes.\n\nAs Mr. Reid has yet to contact the parents of these other students he is not yet sure as to what the decision in their cases will be.\n\nCollegiate classes resume on Monday January 6th.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nBrandon Residential Schools\nHigh School Pupils\n\nVol 1.\n\nJune, 1931 To Dec. 1946\n\nClosed\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(RG 10, Volume 6259)\n\nFile 576-10, part 15\nBrandon Residential School - United Church - Admissions & Discharges. 1941 - 1946\n\nFile 576-10, part 16\nBrandon Residential School - United Church - Admissions & Discharges. 1946 - 1950\n\nFile 576-10, part 17\nBrandon Residential School - United Church - Admissions & Discharges. 1950 - 1952\n\nFile 576-14, part 1\nBrandon Residential School - United Church - Livestock. 1938 - 1942\n\nFile 576-17, part 1\nBrandon Residential School - United Church - Boy Scout Brigade. 1917\n\nFile 576-22, part 1\nBrandon Residential School - United Church - High School Pupils. 1931 - 1946\n\nFile 576-23, part 1\nBrandon Residential School - United Church - Deaths of Pupils. 1940 - 1949\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev.

These members of the Board shall, in each other's presence, complete this memorandum, which shall then be forwarded to the Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, in one copy.\n\nThe Board of Inquiry shall, if at all practicable assemble within 48 hours of the pupil's death.\n\nThe parents or guardians of the deceased pupil shall be given notice of this inquiry and be permitted to attend it or to send a representative. They or their representative shall be asked if they wish to make a statement. In the event of their so wishing, their statement shall be attached to the report. The inquiry, however, shall not be delayed more than 72 hours after the time at which it would otherwise be held, to enable them to attend it.\n\nIf the Indian Agent is located at such a distance from the school as to make it impracticable for him to attend the Board, he shall request a responsible local resident to act for him. A suitable person for this duty would be a Justice of the Peace or a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted or Provincial Police. A more or less permanent arrangement of this kind might be necessary in some cases. The Department is prepared to pay a reasonable fee for this duty, on the Agent's recommendation. The report of the Board, in any case, must reach the Department through the Indian Agent's office.\n\nThis inquiry is not designed to take the place of, or prevent, any other inquiry, including an inquest, which may be required by law.\n\nIf the pupil died as the result of an accident, the Indian Agent is required to take the statements of the witnesses of the accident, and attach them to this memorandum.\n\nForm No. 414.\nA. STATEMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL OF THE RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\n1. On what date did this pupil fall sick or suffer injury? Saturday April 16, 1949.\n\n2. At what time of day? about 11:30 A.M.\n\n3. When and to whom did he or she report this illness or accident? Death was immediately reported to the school and medical personnel were called.\n\n4. What means were taken to afford relief? Nil.\n\n5. What medicines were used for this purpose and in what dose or quantity? Nil.\n\n6. When was the doctor called? Dr. Evans, Brandon, was sent out.\n\n7.

If the pupil was not removed to hospital, what measures were taken for his or her care at the school?\n\n9. Add any other useful information here.\n\nAt about 11:30 A.M., I was informed by the School Master that a boy had come in to say that Roderick had been run over. Immediately went to the scene of the accident. Saw that he was dead. Returned to the school and informed the Medical Attendant, the R.C.M.P. Officer and the Coroner, Mr. P.C. Robertson of Brandon.\n\nThe R.C.M.P. took charge and made an investigation, obtaining statements from the child who was driving the tractor and another person who was with him. The Coroner declared death was accidental with no blame attached to either of the parties and released the body.\n\nNOTE: If the deceased pupil died in hospital at a distance from the school, under the care of the physician or surgeon who attends him at the hospital, a clinical report of the patient's illness and death in the hospital is to be secured and attached to this memorandum.\n\nUndertakers: Called Mr. Anderson and Young & Sons, who came by telephones and reported the death and asked that he report to Mr. Hamilton, Agency Superintendent, Portage la Prairie. Also notified the parents of the patient and Father, Rev. Hugh Macdonald, St. Joseph's Church.\n\nB. STATEMENT OF THE PHYSICIAN WHO ATTENDED THE DECEASED PUPIL\n\nI attended Roderick Beatty from 16 April 1949 to 16 April 1949. The immediate cause of death was injury to neck and lower jaw with wound accidently following.\n\nThe contributory cause of death was nil.\n\nDo you consider that the Principal of the School, and the members of the School staff exercised reasonable care and judgment in regard to the illness and death of this pupil? Yes.\n\nDid they follow out your professional instructions? More than.\n\nIf in either respect, you consider them to have been at fault, it is required that you express your carefully considered views as follows:\n\nI did not see this boy immediately before his death. He was dead only arrived at the scene of the accident.\n\nJ.S. Purdie M.D.\nC. STATEMENT OF INDIAN AGENT\n\n1. Having heard and read over the statements of the Principal and the Physician, do you consider that all essential circumstances relating to the death of ____________________________ have been recorded? If not, you are required to add here any further particulars which strike you as essential.\n\nRoderick Beardy is from Cross Lake, in the Norway House Agency. We have several day schools at this point and this boy should never have been sent into boarding school.\n\n2. In this space record any recommendations which the Board consider should be made to the Department in relation to the health or safety of the pupils of this School.\n\nThis death was purely accidental. This boy went for a walk towards the field and he jumped on the tractor to have a ride home and fell off and the wheel went over him and killed him.

(RG 10, Volume 6259, file 576-23, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nOn the 16-4-49 a phone call was received from the Matron of the Indian Residential School, Brandon, Man., at approximately 12:00 noon advising that a boy residing at that point had been fatally injured in a tractor accident and requested that a member of this force attend. In view of the above information Mr. P.C. Robertson, Coroner, was notified and accompanied the patrol to the Indian School.\n\nIn compliance with existing instructions the following information is submitted in this connection:\n\n(a) Name of deceased...........Roderick BEARDY.\n(b) Age or approximate age.....15 yrs.\n(c) Address of deceased.......Indian Residential School, Brandon, Man., Home at Cross Lake, Man.\n(d) Cause of death..............Fractured skull.\n(e) Place and date of death....30th 15-4-49, R.M. of Cornwallis, Manitoba. Approximately 11:30 to 11:45 AM on 16-4-49.\n\nOn arrival at the Indian School the Rev. O.B. STRAPP, Principal, was contacted and immediately directed the patrol to the point where the accident had occurred. On arrival at the scene of the fatality the body of the deceased was found lying on the ground, lying on the back. At this time it was noted that there had been extensive bleeding from the mouth and ears. Mr. F.J.E. PURDIE, Brandon Man., was present at this time, as he had been called to the scene of the accident as soon as notification of this had been received at the school. However on arrival he found that life was extinct. At this time he stated that the cause of death was a fracture of the skull.\n\nQuestioning at this time revealed that one Percy BINGUSS, 15 yrs. and a resident of the Indian School had been the operator of the tractor at the time of the accident. He was contacted and the following statement given in connection with the accident.\n\nBrandon, Man.\nApril 16th, 1949\n\nSTATEMENT OF PERCY BINGUSS.\n\nToday about noon I was driving a tractor at the Indian Residential School returning from the field to come in to dinner. This was about 11:35 AM. With me was Eddy PRINCE, Angus CHEEP and Roderick BEARDY, all riding on the tractor. I put the clutch of the tractor in when about half way down a small hill, Roderick BEARDY was standing alongside me at this time. The next thing I knew was when he fell forward in front of the left rear wheel of the tractor and as far as I know the left rear wheel hit him.\n\nFILE NUMBERS, HEADING AND MARGINAL REFERENCE ARE TO BE PROPERLY FILLED IN.\nTHE LEFT REAR wheel passed over him. I at once put on the brakes and stopped as soon as possible and when we went back to where he lay he seemed to be dead. One of the boys then came down to the school and told Miss COCHRANE what had happened.\n\nWitnessed:\nT.S. Hierlihy, Oct.\n16-4-49.\n\n5. Eddie PRINCE, a rider on the tractor at the time of the accident gave the following statement in this matter.\n\nBrandon, Man.\nApril 16th, 1949\n\nSTATEMENT OF EDDY PRINCE, 16 yrs.\n\nTo-day about 11:30 AM Angus CHIEF, Roderick BEARDY, Percy BINGUIS and myself left the field in the Indian Residential School Farm field to return to the school. I was riding on the right rear fender of the tractor. Percy BINGUIS was driving. Angus CHIEF was standing on the draw bar of the tractor and Roderick BEARDY was on the left fender. I did not see Roderick fall at all. The first thing that I remember was a slight bounce of the tractor and I looked and seen him lying on the ground behind. I ran back to where he was and then told Angus to get Mr. STRAPP. The blood was running out the left side of his mouth when I first seen him.\n\nWitnessed:\nT.S. Hierlihy, Oct.\nRCMP. 16-4-49.\n\n6. Angus CHIEF the other rider on the tractor was interviewed at this time and corroborated the statements given by the other two boys, however he could not offer any additional information as to how the accident had occurred.\n\n7. Rev. O.B. STRAPP, Principal of the Indian School also gave the following statement in connection with this fatality.\n\nBrandon, Man.\nApril 16th, 1949\n\nSTATEMENT OF REV. O.B. STRAPP\n\nAt about 11:45 AM this date I received a telephone call from Miss COCHRANE, school Matron who stated that Roderick BEARDY had been run over. I immediately got the car and went to the scene of the accident on the school farm and saw that he was dead. However, I returned and phoned Dr. EVANS who sent out Dr. PURDY. I returned to where the body was and covered it and then took Dr. PURDY to where the injured boy lay. Dr. PURDY examined the boy and pronounced life to be extinct.\n\nWitnessed:\nT.S. Hierlihy, Oct.\nRCMP. 16-4-49.\n\n(continued page three)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6259, file 576-23, part 1)\n6. From the foregoing statements it will be noted that the actual fall of BEANE from the tractor was not noted by any of the boys on the tractor, or at least they deny having witnessed the fall. The scene of the accident, it might be stated was immediately after having come down a small hill, passed through the lowest point at the bottom and started up the incline on the opposite side, the accident taking place at a point approximately 75 feet from the bottom. The ground at this point where the tractor was travelling is used as a road or passage in travelling back and forth from the fields and is not abnormally rough, being grazed over. However if the deceased was sitting on the fender of the tractor as alleged by the other boys who were riding on the tractor, it is possible that he lost his balance and fell forward and in so doing would fall in front of the rear wheel. No cry or sound of any kind was heard by the other riders on the vehicle, however this is understandable due to the noise that the motor of the vehicle would make. The tractor was an International R machine.\n\n9. After a full enquiry into the circumstances surrounding this accident, the Coroner instructed that he did not consider an inquest necessary and released the body for burial. The C.A., W.H., was also consulted and made aware of the above and stated that he concurred with the instructions of the Coroner and that the file be concluded at this point.\n\n10.

Young of Griswold, Man., who is the nearest Indian Agent. Mr. Young contacted Mr. Hamilton and telephoned me that Mr. Davis, Regional Supervisor would convene the board of inquiry about 10:00 A.M. on Tuesday April 19, 1949.\n\nMr. Davis and Mr. Young visited the school and conducted the inquiry and Mr. Davis after making inquiry from the undertaker as to the cost of casket and box ($2.00) gave instruction that the funeral should be conducted that afternoon in the cemetery located on the school property. I had completed the prescribed form #414 and Mr. Davis took it away with him.\n\nIt was felt that the matter was an accident in which the human factor was responsible and both R.C.M.P. and the Coroner were satisfied that it apparently was unavoidable under the circumstances. The boy was riding on the tractor contrary to instructions and it is obviously impossible to have an instructor always with every boy on the farm. In some manner unknown to the other boys he fell off and was crushed by the rear wheel of the tractor.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nMr. Strapp has written to say that a pupil, Roderick Beardy, died following an accident. There was an enquiry held by Mr. Davis and Mr. Young, after which Mr. Davis gave instructions to proceed with the funeral. Now, the question is -- who is going to pay the expenses? It may be quite satisfactory from the Department's standpoint to state that \"when a pupil dies at an Indian residential school, it has always been the policy for the school to provide funeral expenses.\" If so, it is time there was a new policy set up.\n\nThe per capita which we receive to cover the expenses of the pupil ceases the day he dies, and I think that, that being so, your Department is responsible for dealing with the body after the pupil dies, or else continuing the per capita. We are only authorized to expend money which we receive.\n\nNow, it is a question of who is going to pay the $22.00 for the cost of the funeral. As a matter of fact, the point is -- who ordered the funeral?\n\nPerhaps, you would look into this matter and let me know what can be done, because, certainly, the Brandon School has no funds available to pay funeral expenses. I shall be glad to hear from you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6259, file 576-23, part 1)\nMemorandum:\n\nMAJOR D.M.

I am satisfied that this class of work gives better returns and is followed with greater satisfaction every way than is brought about by the Day Schools.\n\nI have also had opportunity of observing closely your work at St Anthony's School Kenora. This is one of the Banner Schools of the Inspectorate but they are very much checkmated by limitations in accommodation. They need a better drainage system. They must have a better water supply. They lack room now that the number of scholars has been increased. I should like to see these needs supplied as soon as possible.\n\nAt Fort Alexander I find that the Father is somewhat involved. He had at the beginning of 1907 an outstanding...\ndeficit of $3506.29. Against this are some buildings which perhaps cost in the neighborhood of $2500.00 which have not been paid for. The Father constructed because he needed them but had no direct authority from the Department. Hence he is in difficulty and the way out is not very clear. Possibly the Government might do something if matters were carefully represented. However, they don't like work done until it is ordered. After that the pay is sure.\n\nYour School at Fort Frances is also in difficulties of a financial character. I am quite convinced that it will be increasingly difficult for the Churches to carry on the work of the Boarding Schools at the old figure of $70. It might be in order to memorialize the Department in regard to this question with a view to a general raise of the Per Capita Allowance to Schools of this order.\n\nWishing you every success in your admirable work\n\nI remain\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nJohn Summers\nInspector of Indians\n\nRev. Father Poitras\nSt. Mary's\nWinnipeg\nOttawa, February 19th, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nA communication addressed by you to the Rev. Father Poitras has come into the hands of the Department in which you commend the work done by the Boarding Schools at Fort Alexander, Kenora and Fort Frances. You also suggest the establishment of a Boarding School at Cross Lake. While it is, I think, perfectly proper for you to commend work already authorized by the Department which is being carried out satisfactorily by the Churches interested, it is somewhat embarrassing to have officers of the Department suggest the extension of the Boarding and Industrial School system.\n\nThe system of Indian education is now under consideration and while the Department is glad to receive the opinion of its officers it does not seem well to advise at present applications for increased financial assistance to residential schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nRevd.

There are, in the district served by this school, at least fifty (50) children of school age and a Catholic population of about three hundred (300) souls.\n\nOwing to the fact that many Indians reside at a distance from the school and that communication with the school is difficult, especially in summer, the benefits to be derived from this school are meagre.\n\nWe have reached the conclusion that the establishment of a Boarding school at this point is a matter of necessity if it is really sought to extend to these children the benefits of education.\n\nApart from other considerations, there is no questioning the superiority of the Boarding school over the day school. Our request for a Boarding sch\nSt. Mary's Church\n\nWinnipeg, Man., the 15th of J. A. 21/1/1908\n\nL. J. C. & M.

That a Boarding School be granted for Cross Lake Mission.\n\n2. That an appropriation of $3000 be made toward the building\u2014a portion of said building to be built according to plans which are being submitted for a similar building at Fort Selby\u2014I may however remark that it will cost much more to build at Cross Lake than at Fort Selby.\n\n3. That the ordinary Capitation Grant be made for thirty (30) children.\n\nPending the construction of their building, the sisters could accommodate ten or fifteen children in the building belonging to the Mission.\n\nI hope that the present request will receive your favorable consideration.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In reply I am of opinion that it is inadvisable at present to establish any additional Boarding Schools in the Norway House Agency. The Department would be glad, however, to receive suggestions for improving the attendance at the Day School at Cross Lake and extending its usefulness amongst the Indian children. It is rather in the direction of practical improvement in work of this kind and the adoption of methods which shall be directly applicable to conditions on reserves that the Department hopes to be of assistance to those interested in Indian education, and not in the establishment of the more expensive residential schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

Ainsi leurs enfants doivent aller \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole du jour et oublier leurs le\u00e7ons.\nLes pauvres indiens peuvent encore \u00eatre\nqui le veulent, mais ils ne sont pas devoir le veut.\nCe serait un grand bienfait pour eux si le\ngouvernement ordonnait de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger leur\nindigence du pays venant \u00e0 leur secours.\nLe plus grand bien pour eux serait de les aider\nardemment. Ce serait de bien donner un\nBoarding School \u00e0 Cross Lake, pourquoi leurs\nenfants y soient gard\u00e9s, nourris, habill\u00e9s, nourris\net instruits. Depuis l'\u00e2ge de cinq ans aux\njeunes \u00e0 douze ans quinze ans. Les parents\npourraient alors plus facilement aller travailler\nailleurs et leurs enfants seraient soign\u00e9s et bien\n\u00e9lev\u00e9s. J'ai dit bien souvent aux agents\net aux repr\u00e9sentants des missions que la premi\u00e8re\nchose \u00e0 faire \u00e9tait d'ouvrir un \u00e9cole si\nnous avions une pour eux en Boarding School\n\u00e0 Cross Lake. Et en parlant ainsi je pense\nsurtout \u00e0 leur moralit\u00e9. L'exp\u00e9rience et\nl'exp\u00e9rience de mon minist\u00e8re me prouvent qu'il est\nimpossible de moraliser cette jeune g\u00e9n\u00e9ration\nsans une \u00e9cole pensionnaire. Si le gouvernement\nvoulait nous l'accorder nous adorons de nous\nau moins quatre bonnes ann\u00e9es religieuses\npour cet effet.\nLes Methodistes ont une \u00e9cole \u00e0 Norwayton.\nNos catholiques ne peuvent envoyer leurs enfants\n\u00e0 cette \u00e9cole et d'ailleurs elle n'y aurait pas\nla place pour tant d'enfants. Il serait donc\nbon que la moralit\u00e9 \"laissant beaucoup \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer\"\nDonc cette \u00e9cole comme le pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent est une des plus agr\u00e9ables qui s'y sont pass\u00e9es. Nous avons depuis peu de temps beaucoup, m\u00eame des protestants d\u00e9sirent voir un Boarding School catholique \u00e0 Cross Lake.\n\n\u00c0 Cross Lake, il y a une tr\u00e8s bonne terre pour la culture, de quoi faire des jardins et des champs. Il y a beaucoup de poissons pour les animaux domestiques et le poisson y est assez abondant. De sorte que tout contribue \u00e0 soutenir facilement une \u00e9cole pensionnat.\n\nLa construction est pour ainsi dire \u00e0 la porte.\n\nNous avons \u00e0 Cross Lake quarante-six familles catholiques et huit m\u00e9thodistes.\n\nLa majorit\u00e9 de la population est aussi catholique. Nous avons au moins cinquante enfants qui peuvent fr\u00e9quenter l'\u00e9cole. Quelque nati \u00e9cole du jour n'en compte que de quinze \u00e0 vingt-cinq ordinairement.\n\nSi nous avions un Boarding School pour les enfants de minden classe et nous avons d'autres enfants catholiques \u00e0 Cross Lake, le dioc\u00e8se qui viendrait \u00e0 notre aide.\n\nLes ministres m\u00e9thodistes disent partout que nous n'avons jamais d'\u00e9cole et que le gouvernement ne fait jamais de faveurs aux catholiques. Je sais que ce n'est pas vrai mais je souhaite que cela soit par vrai \u00e0 Cross Lake.\nSi le gouvernement nous accordait une \u00e9cole\nprovisoire \u00e0 Cross Lake, nous aurions\nbesoin de deux ou trois personnes qui\ns'occuperaient des enfants et des adultes\npour s'occuper de nos affaires. Nous avons\ncomme exemple de malades dans la\nr\u00e9gion. Je ne peux pas dire qu'en 1884 la rougeole\ns'\u00e9tait r\u00e9pandue dans notre population. Il y avait\nvingt-quatre de ces malades dans deux mois.\nNi les m\u00e9decins blancs ni les\n\u00e9coles n'avaient malade. Je passerai tout mon\ntemps \u00e0 les visiter, les soigner, les administrer\nde l'argent. Je devrais \u00eatre en mesure de\nleur donner un peu de nourriture, de l'aide, de\nl'argent, et je serais heureux. Mais je\nne peux pas faire cela pour pouvoir\npublier. Mais si l'homme qui est \u00e0 la t\u00eate de\nnotre pays, envoy\u00e9 par les blancs, au moment\no\u00f9 on s'occupe de construire un chemin\nde fer entre le Nelson et le Churchill,\nje demande en gr\u00e2ce au gouvernement\ncanadien de bien vouloir prendre\nnos int\u00e9r\u00eats.

Aged 61 years, I have spent nearly 35 of them with these poor brave natives.\n\nThose of Cross Lake, where I have been for 7 years, and who are connected with the Norway House agency, urgently ask to have a boarding school on their reserve. I speak in the name of the Roman Catholic population of the place.\n\nTheir country is poor in fur, the fisheries of white men have ruined their lakes and rivers; in order to earn their living they are obliged to go far away from the reserve in order to seek elsewhere the means of a livelihood, and thus their children have to give up the day school and forget their lessons. These poor Indians can still find food, but they have nothing to clothe themselves with. It would be a great benefit for them if the Government, usually so paternal towards the natives of the country, would come to their assistance. The greatest good for them and what they desire earnestly would be to give them a boarding school at Cross Lake, so that their children might be kept there, cared for, clothed,\nfed and educated from five or six years of age until twelve or fifteen. The parents would then be able more easily to go and work elsewhere, and their children would be taken care of and well brought up. I have said very often to the agent, and to the inspectors of reserves, that the young generation of our Indians will never be well brought up unless we have for them a boarding school at Cross Lake; and in speaking thus I am thinking especially of their morality. Experience and the exercise of my ministry prove to me that it is impossible to make this young generation moral without a boarding school. If the Government will grant it to us, we shall have at once at least four good nuns for this purpose.\n\nThe Methodists have a school at Norway House. Our Roman Catholics cannot send their children to that school, and besides there would be no room for all the children, and then it must be said that the morality leaves much to be desired in this school as proved by regrettable facts that have occurred twice within a short time; nearly all the Protestants desire to see a Roman Catholic boarding school at Cross Lake.\n\nAt Cross Lake there is fairly good land for cultivation, of which to make gardens and fields; there is plenty of hay for stock, and fish are fairly abundant, so that everything contributes to the easy maintenance of a boarding school. Building timber is at their doors, so to speak.\n\nWe have at Cross Lake 46 Roman Catholic families and 37 Methodist. The majority of the population is thus Roman Catholic. We have at least 50 children who could attend school, although our day school counts on only from 15 to 25 usually.\n\nIf we had a boarding school, all the children would go there, and we have other Roman Catholic children.\nbesides in the district who would go to our school. The Methodist clergymen say everywhere that we shall never have a school and that the Government will never grant favours to the Roman Catholics. I know that this is not true, but I wish that it were not true at Cross Lake. If the Government grants us a boarding school at Cross Lake, we shall have some nuns, and one of them who speaks English well would teach the children, and the other nuns would engage in charitable work, as for example, take care of the sick children on the reserve. I recollect that in 1887 measles spread among our population; there were 75 deaths in two months. Neither companies, merchants nor any white men concerned themselves about these poor sick people. I spent all my time in visiting them, caring for them, and administering to them. I spent all I had in their assistance. Bishop Tache knew it; he complimented me and thanked me for it; but I never received anything from the public; but at the present time, on the eve of seeing our country invaded by white men, at the moment when they are engaged in the building of the railway between the Nelson and the Churchill, I ask as a favour that the Canadian Government be kind enough to have pity on our Indians.\n\nWe have two missions well established on the Nelson, at Cross Lake, and at Norway House.\n\nWe have a day school at Cross Lake. We have none yet at Norway House; now we ask for a boarding school at Cross Lake and a day school at Norway House. For nearly thirty years I worked in the midst of the Indians of the Churchill and of the Nelson. This is the first considerable favour that I have asked of the Government.\n\nLet me hope that you will comply with my request. The Indians and the Roman Catholic missionaries of Cross Lake and Norway House will always be much obliged to the Government. I am, Hon. Sir, with respect,\n\nYour humble servant,\nEtienne Bonald, O.M.I.\nPriest, Missionary\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-1, part 1)\nOttawa, June 25, 1908.\n\nRev.

Oblate Fathers of Manitoba, wish to present you with our respects and beg to inform you:\n\n1.- that one of the principal objects of our order is to devote ourselves to the temporal and spiritual welfare of the Indians of Canada;\n\n2.- that for over 50 years, we have lived in their midst and worked in their behalf.\n\n3.- that we are the only religious body to whom the Government has been pleased to entrust the management and direction of the Industrial and Indian boarding schools at Qu'Appelle, Crooked Lake, Touch Wood Hills, Fort Pelly, in the province of Saskatchewan; and at Pine Creek, Sandy Bay, and Fort Alexander, in the Province of Manitoba;\n\nand at Kenora, Fort Frances in the Province of Ontario.\n\n4.- In all these schools, according to the reports of the Inspectors, published in the Blue Books, you will see that our Indian Schools are inferior to none in Canada.\n\nNow that the Indians of these three Provinces are well supplied with efficient schools, we are directing our efforts towards the district of Keewatin.\n\nWe have Missionary Priests, residing at Norway House, at Grass Lake, 60 miles East of Norway House, and we intend, if at all possible, to open a new residence at Baraga River in the spring.\n\nIn this great district of Keewatin, there is no government boarding school for the catholic children who form the majority of the christianized Indians, and our Missionaries are most welcome when visiting the pagan tribes who are also willing to send us their children.\nTherefore, we humbly ask you to recognize and help the new boarding school that we are just opening at Cross Lake. We have already ten children that we were forced to accept even before making this application.\n\nWe would like to have our school in Keewatin placed on the same footing as the boarding schools of the other three above named Provinces, and be authorized to accept from 25 to 30 children with the approbation of the government inspector.\n\nAnd your petitioners will ever pray.\n\nFor the Reverend Oblate Fathers,\n\n(P.S.) We have learned with pleasure, from some of the Inspectors of our schools, that it is intended to improve the administration of the Indian schools.\n\nExperience has shown that the day schools for children scattered over an Indian reserve, are a waste of money without satisfactory results on account of non regular attendance.\n\nThe keeping of children in boarding schools always under the care and the formation given by our good sisters, produce better results for the same amount of money expended.\n\nIt is a fact admitted by everybody that a yearly allowance of $2.00 is not enough for lodging, boarding, clothing and teaching a child.\n\nThe sum of $100.00 a year, per child, with no other extra amounts for buildings, or repairs, etc., which would be left to the charge of those keeping these schools, would, we believe, give better satisfaction without increasing the expenses of the Government.\n\nWe will be very grateful indeed if these are the changes intended by your department, as they would once for all provide for the public education of the Indian children on the Indian reserves of the West.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Affairs.

If there is need for a boarding school at Cross Lake, where the Roman Catholics have not had a mission established for many years, it might be considered that there is a greater need for institutions at the Pas and Fairford, where the Church of England has had established missions for many years. The Methodists also require a new building at Norway House to properly provide for their work at that point and at Berens River.\n\nAt present we have not decided to erect any additional boarding schools and I, therefore, hardly think that we could give favourable consideration to the present application.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I regret it. I beg to mention to you that in my letter of the 28th of January last, I was asking if the Department would be willing to grant $100.00 per capita to all children taken care of in the Indian Boarding schools with the understanding that no extra grants of any kind would be given to these schools.\n\nIf this new plan is accepted, as I now discover with the Honorable Minister of Indian Affairs and Doctor Mollay M.P. of Kenora, will you please inform me when it will go into operation.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nRev.

Sir,\n\nIn reply to the inquiry contained in your letter undated, which was received here on the 16th instant, I beg to say that no increase has been made in the per capita grants to the Roman Catholic boarding schools in the west this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. P. E. Gendreau, O.M.I.,\nSt. Mary's Church,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Honorable Sir,\n\nSir \u2014 I understand that the Roman Catholics of this place have made application to the Government for a Boarding School at Norway House, and also for the privilege of putting up and operating a saw mill. Allow me to say that anything that the Roman Catholics may ask the Government for for use here could not be granted on the ground of helping their people inasmuch as they have practically no constituency here to be served by these things. They have only one family with any children of school age (one child). This family has already gone to one of their Industrial Schools. I think there are only two, perhaps three, school age remaining \u2014 one of which there are three children, but all are passed.\nschool age, the second one having graduated from our Boarding School four years ago at the age of fifteen. They have or might claim two other families, but in one of these cases there are no children at all in the New Case there is one child, but they have expressed their intention of returning to their own church. They have one or two other people members of different families, but there are adults. I have been informed that another family man and his wife have lately joined them from the Anglican Church, but they have two children of school age.\n\nThe balance of the population in the larger community belong to the Methodist Church, the rest to the Anglican Church. You can easily see therefore that any Government aid to such projects as the above would simply be Government aid to fight the Methodist and Anglican Churches.\n\nNo doubt you are aware of the condition here of our Boarding School that we are in need of and are asking the Government for a new school on a new site. I understand that the Government have given the mill\nfor the benefit of their people at Cross Lake where it was to have been placed. They have failed to get it to Cross Lake by one route but I do not see any thing to hinder them taking it by the regular York boat route.\n\nThe Honorable David Laird will perhaps be able to recite the time about six years ago, when he made application for a grant of $15,000 to put in a saw mill here and for certain time be limit from which to take logs for carrying the saw mill down to $1,000 and the timber limit to two square miles, and the matter taken out by my hand and put into the hands of the agent who came to reside here at that time - considering the sparsity of the timber in this country and the cost of buying, fitting up and setting of the machine he considered both the first and the limits plan too small, and allowed it all to go by the board. If the government are willing to do anything in that line here and will make an appropriate grant towards the same, I am willing to take it up again.\n\nOur mission has been established here since 1843 and by reference to the official report of our church for this\nsummer. You will see that we have no 238 members inside the large constituency of this band, but surely when we are ready to enter into all these projects and to do anything that a church ought or can do, for the people who have the first claim to any help that the Government is inclined to give towards projects for civilizing the Indians here - at least we have confidence that now you have the information herein from you would not be persuaded to give Government assistance where the only reason for asking it is to enable them to draw members from the Methodist Church.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.A.

Father Roland, O.M.I. Several oblate sisters went to take charge of the Indian school that was part of the mission. These sisters have now been recalled from there and sent farther north to Norway House. This was decided upon after learning of the facilities offered at Norway House for the education of Indian children as well as those of white settlers, and the facilities for transportation of provisions and fuel that point.\n\nA complete equipment for a sawmill has been procured for the mission and sent north by Rev. Father Leclerc, O.M.I., for the purpose of providing lumber for the erection of a large school and church edifice, and also for supplying the same material for settlers of that neighborhood. Upon the proceeds of the sale of lumber the mission will depend largely for its support. A number of Indian children have already been sent to the new mission by Indians from the Crook Lake district, and it is expected that a flourishing school will soon be established.\n\nDIES OF TYPHOID.\n\nBrandon, Oct. 17.\u2014Austin Vaughan, a farmer from Esterhazy, died here today of typhoid.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Poitras and Gendreau of Winnipeg made application some two years ago for the establishment of an Indian Boarding School at Cross-Lake, Keewatin. Certain guarantees having been obtained, Sisters were sent, and the school started\u2014a move which was subsequently regretted, as Mgr. Langevin found that Cross-Lake was not a suitable centre for such an establishment on account of its distance from civilization, and consequent difficulties of transport. During the month of Aug. last His Lordship recalled the Sisters to Norway House whence the means of communication with Winnipeg are better, on account of the regular steamboat service. A small school was opened there, and a good saw-mill with steam motor installed: We would now like to utilize this plant to prepare building material for a permanent school-house. Before undertaking this, we would wish to have the approbation of your Department, and I therefore ask you to authorize the erection of a school at Norway House according to the new regulations and capable of receiving at least forty Indian children.\n\nI venture to hope that this application, calculated for the best interests of our Indian schools, will meet with your prompt approval.\n\nBelieve me, Dear Sir,\n\nVery faithfully Yours,\n\n[Vic. of Keewatin]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nI beg to submit the application of the Rt. Rev. Bishop Charlebois, Vicar Apostolic of Keswatin, for the establishment of a Boarding School at Norway House. He proposes to put up a building on plans approved by the Department which will accommodate at least 40 Indian children and asks that a per capita grant be provided for them. The Catholic Missions in that district have not been long established but Bishop Charlebois informs me that he has received gratifying reports of their progress.\n\nIt is impossible in this connection not to mention the Methodist work at Norway House which has been established a great many years. The situation so far as the Methodists are concerned is that they look to the Department to build them at an early date a commodious new boarding school as the present quarters are in no way suitable. This will entail a large expenditure.\n\nI think we will have to consider Bishop Charlebois' suggestion but the Minister will have to say whether the amount could be provided for the next fiscal year as the appropriation will have to be increased. The present Estimates will be fully taxed in meeting the\nexpenditure already pledged.\n\nBishop Charlebois states that a Saw Mill has been erected by the Mission at Norway House, and he is prepared to put up a building which will qualify for the $100.00 per capita grant, upon plans approved by the Department.\n\nChief Accountant.\nNorway House, January 1911\n\nThe Honorable Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nApplication has been made, I understand, to the Government by the Roman Catholic Church for a grant in support of a Boarding School to be situated here. Please allow me to draw your attention to some facts with regard to this locality which ought to be taken into consideration before the Government launch upon the scheme.\n\nNorway House is the centre of a section of country nearly solidly Methodist for four hundred miles from North to South and two hundred from East to West. The only constituency that the Catholic Church has in this whole district from which to draw children for a Boarding School is one family here with six children in it. You will know that when they range up from infancy there could not be more than four of school age. I think there are only three of school age. They have one boy in another family who is now seventeen and would be beyond school age before the school could be built. They have three other families but no children of school age in them.\n\nThey have quite a few people at Grass Lake, sixty-five miles North of here but they have had their school there for two years and could not get any of the children into it. Their present move is to bring the staff and outfit up here from Grass Lake. But you will readily see that since the people would not put their children in while it was there much less will they send them here since they have added to their former objections this that the Catholic Church has not kept faith with them having promised them the Boarding School and a sawmill both of which they are locating here if you agree to give the grant. They have a few families at Nelson House two hundred miles North but these people have steadily refused to send their children out to any school.\nThe Methodist Church is now in its seventy first year in its occupancy of this district and has established missions at every point where the Indians congregate. The following Reserves and Bands of Indians are located in this District: Severn River, Fisher River, Little Grand Rapids, Poplar River, Blood Vein, Norsay House, Grass Lake, Nelson House, Split Lake, Oxford House, Gods Lake, Island Lake, Sandy Lake. The Church of England has Missions at two of these Reserves. For about twelve years past the Catholics have been trying to gain a foothold in this district with but little success. It seems to me that it would be a monstrous thing for any Government to support by school grants any one denomination in its efforts to beset the adherents of another. They have equal rights with others to grants in support of schools for their own people but when they have absolutely no constituency tributary to the country concerned it would seem to us most unjust to use the taxes paid by Methodist people in common with others for the purpose of overthrowing the Methodist Church. A grant to a Roman Catholic School here would be simply a bonus wherewith to fight the Methodist Church. We cannot bring ourselves to think that once the Government is cognizant of these facts they would entertain the proposition of a grant for one moment. The injustice of it all is too apparent, too glaring to escape recognition. Our political party, led as it is by an honored Roman Catholic could scarcely afford to sell open eyed into such a mud hole since it would expose our Premier to a square charge of religious partiality even to the extent of the use of public funds for the advance of his religious views and his particular church.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Lonsley.\nDear Sirs:\n\nI am informed that Rev. J. A. Lousley, Principal of the boarding school, Norway House, has written a letter to the Prime Minister, protesting against any assistance being given by the Government for the transfer of the Roman Catholic school from Gross Lake to Norway House.\n\nWhile I cannot accept any responsibility for Mr. Lousley's letter to the Prime Minister, I am deeply impressed by his statement of the facts in the case. The Norway House Indians are almost entirely Methodist, with only a few other families, certainly not enough to warrant any other school being established there.\n\nYou are no doubt fully aware of the sensitiveness with which the churches concerned view the matter of unnecessary overlapping in educational and missionary work among the Indians. I venture to think that if the Roman Catholic church be assisted in their invasion of Methodist territory at Norway House, the whole issue of the relation of the churches to the Indian Work will at once be raised.\n\nI sincerely trust that the Department will seriously consider such a matter before lending their support to the suggested transfer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-1, part 1)\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nI have to report further on the educational situation at Norway House, and would refer to my memorandum of the 10th of February written upon Bishop Charlebois' request that the Department would guarantee a per capita grant for 40 pupils for a new Roman Catholic Boarding School at Norway House. In this connection the letter from Dr. Egerton Shore, with enclosure from the Rev. J. A. Lousley, Principal of the Methodist Boarding School at Norway House, should be read. The facts from the standpoint of the Roman Catholics are shown in Bishop Charlebois' letter below my memorandum of the 10th February.\n\nThis is a difficult matter to deal with as a decision is likely to awaken criticism from either one party or the other, but that is no reason why it should not be dealt with justly and to some extent in accordance with usage. Mr. Lousley, it appears to me, mixes the missionary question with the question of Indian education. With the former, we, as a Department of Government, have nothing whatever to do and our jurisdiction and responsibility extends only to the educational field. I do not think that we could admit, with reference to the latter point, that any Church has a right to exclude\neducational effort from a certain field because it has thrown its missionary aegis over the territory.\n\nTo take the present case as an example, it would surely be untenable for the Methodists to claim that because they have established a Boarding School at Norway House, recognized by the Department, and receive grants for certain day schools, they are thereby entitled to claim exclusive rights to the teaching privileges in the vast district comprised in Mr. Lousley's letter. Certainly, it is a fact that a very small proportion of the children who could attend a Boarding School, can be accommodated in the Norway House building, and the day schools by reason of the hunting and fishing pursuits of the parents cannot be operated with any degree of success. There is cooperation between the Government and several religious denominations in the education of the Indians, particularly with reference to the establishment and maintenance of residential schools, and the Churches have been given to understand that the Department will not be responsible in any way for a residential school erected without its sanction. Under this rule Bishop Charlebois comes to us with his case. If it were a known fact that every Indian in this territory was an adherent of the Methodist Church it would be oppressive were the Government to recognize and contribute funds towards the support of a Roman Catholic or Church of England Boarding School, but in the country with\nwhich we are dealing there must be hundreds of children who are to all intents and purposes pagans, whose parents are not adherents of the Methodist Church and who equally with all Indians require educational facilities. Now if the Methodists are treated fairly by the Government with reference to their needs in the Norway House district, why should they complain if the Government also recognizes the existence of the Roman Catholic Church in a district in which they have already a footing and in which they endeavor to provide for the education of pagan children.\n\nThe school regulations, which have the force of law, provide that no Protestant child shall be committed to a Roman Catholic School and vice versa. This refers to \"legal commitment\" but the regulations of the Department are even more stringent and will not allow a Protestant child to be taken into residence in a Catholic school and vice versa, so the Methodist children are fully protected and cannot be taken into the Roman Catholic school.\n\nIt appears to me that in considering the situation at Norway House the application of Bishop Charlebois, the protests of the Methodist Church, and the present condition of the Methodist Schools in that district should all be carefully weighed. At present, Parliament has provided no funds for the per capita grant to the school desired by Bishop Charlebois and although the Methodist Church has for several years asked for a grant for a new school building at Norway House we have not been able to meet the demand. I think that action\nshould be postponed until the Government sees fit to give the Methodists a new Boarding School with accommodation for 135 pupils at Norway House, and to give a grant for 40 pupils to the R.C. Boarding School, and that both items be considered in connection with the Estimates for 1912-13. If the Government grants this money the Methodists will have no cause for complaint as the large capital expenditure which they are unable to make will be made by the Government. The Roman Catholics will have no cause for complaint because we will become responsible for the maintenance grant of a school which they have funds to build in a field in which they have not many adherents but in which the pagan element is sufficiently strong to warrant a second Residential School.\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Accountant.\nOttawa, April 8th, 1911.\n\nRev.

Not one reason is given to legitimate this refusal. It can be supposed there was none or at least not a valuable one.\n\nIn reply I beg to put before the Department these two questions:\n\n1. Is it the intention of the Department that the Catholic children at Norway House, at Cross Lake, at Nelson House, and at Pakita-wagan will remain without any means of receiving instruction?\n\n2. Or does the Department expect that I will take on my own charge and expenses to keep up a Boarding School?\n\nEven I will be willing to do so if I could find the necessary means for that. So if the Department is satisfied that our Indian children will remain as they are at present, it will be done according its wishes; but it will have borne the whole responsibility before the public.\n\nExpecting an early answer to my questions,\n\nI remain,\n\nSir,\n\nyours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary of Indian Depart.\n\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Bishop Charlebois applied for a grant for the maintenance of 40 Indian children. He proposed to put up a building on plans approved by the Department with accommodation for this number. The Methodist Church, who had a boarding school established at this point, raised objections to the Roman Catholics being allowed to enter what they claimed is their field. Bishop Charlebois was informed that no funds were available at that time for the purpose. Provision, however, was made in the current year's estimates for 40 pupils.\n\nThe Archbishop of St. Boniface, writing to the Minister on the 8th of November, last, says \"You made me very happy today when you granted me a boarding school...\"\nfor Indian children at Norway House in presence of the two venerable bishops I introduced to you, Rt. Rev. Bishop Grouard and Rt. Rev. Bishop Charlebois, and I thank you very much.\n\nThe Roman Catholics have secured a tract of land for school purposes near Norway House. In February of this year Bishop Charlebois forwarded a sketch plan of the proposed boarding school buildings when he was informed that the Department's architect would prepare plans and specifications. These have been completed and sent forward on the 6th ultimo. It was understood that the Roman Catholic church would build at their own expense, if the Department would furnish working plans and specifications. This has been done and they have saved architect's fees to the extent of about $1800.00.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-1, part 1)\nOttawa, September 16, 1912.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nThe plans and specifications for the proposed Roman Catholic Boarding School at Norway House, which are not on file in the Department, call for a very large building with accommodation for 100 pupils and a staff of about 20. The church intends to put up the building and Bishop Charlebois, in a letter dated the 22nd of June, last, says I am \"just back from Norway House and I am glad to see that they are working at the excavation.\" The building will be constructed of wood on a cement foundation and the Church has a sawmill on the site and is getting out the necessary building material. The church owns the land on which the building is to be erected and when it is put up it will be a church owned building and come under class \"A\" and be entitled to a per capita grant of $125.00. If it were a Government owned building the per capita grant would only be $100.00.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement in regard to the\nthe management of Indian boarding schools the Department could not contribute towards the erection of this building, as only two classes are recognized, church owned and Government owned buildings. Building operations are now under way and this will be a church owned building in the fullest sense of the term and if the church had wished the Department to assume the cost of the building it would have had to be put up by public tender under Section 36, Chapter 39 of the Public Works Acts, Revised Statutes of Canada, Vol.1, and erected on Government land.\n\nThe Department is putting up a boarding school building at Norway House to be conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church, the cost of which will not be more than half the amount required for the Roman Catholic school and, as the Methodists have been a long time in the field, they would naturally object to the Roman Catholics being given a building costing twice as much as the Department is allowing them.\n\nThere is usually a considerable unexpended balance left over from the School Vote each year and if the Department would be justified in making a grant towards this building the money could be found for the purpose.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Scott,\nDept. of Indian Education,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn answer to your request for the description of our Boarding School at Norway House, I am pleased to bring the following items to your knowledge:\n\n1. The Building:\n   Our school is a solid frame building with stone foundations, 20 x 36 feet, ventilated and heated by a hot-air system. The room in which the 3 girls sleep is 8 x 10 x 10 feet and the one used by the 2 boys is 14 x 16 x 8 feet.\n\n2. The Beds:\n   The beds of the children are of the same kind as those used by the Fathers and Sisters in charge. Mattresses, pillows, blankets etc., make them very comfortable.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\n3/ The Food:\nMeat is given twice a day and fish once. Sugar, bread, tea and other comforts are also daily provided for the children. The fare is far better than what is generally met with in these countries. I beg to state that the Fathers and Sisters partake of the same food.\n\n4/ The Clothing:\nVery good and warm. Each child receives a nice suit of clothes which he keeps for Sundays and active days. The ordinary clothing is supplied by generous people who send us clothes all the year round. The Sisters make them anew and do the mending when necessary.\n\n5/ The Staff:\nFour Sisters give the necessary instruction and education. Two Brothers are in charge of the carpentry and general work. One Father attends to the spiritual welfare of the children.\n\nHoping that these explanations will prove satisfactory.

Previous to this on November 2nd, last, Rev. E. Lecoq, Roman Catholic Missionary at Norway House, applied to the Department for a grant for certain Indian children who were being kept at the Mission and on the 9th of January a reply was addressed to him informing him that schools in order to draw a grant have to comply with certain conditions in respect to accommodation, etc., and that, as the Department was not in possession of any information regarding the building in which they were operating the school, inquiry would be made. A copy of the agreement for the maintenance and management of boarding schools was also sent him.\n\nOn the same date the Department wrote to Mr. Agent Stewart, Norway House, advising him that application had\nhad been made for a grant for certain children and concluding as follows: \"Before the Department can consider this it desires to have a full report as to the number of children in residence and the accommodation that is afforded them at this school. Kindly deal with the matter in detail in respect to class-room, dormitory and other accommodation, staff, practical instruction given in housework, etc., means of heating and ventilating and add any further information that you consider might be of interest to the Department in this connection.\" As soon as this information is received the Department will be in a position to deal with Father Lecocq's application.\n\nWith regard to your other memorandum of the same date the Department does not appear to have had any applications for the admission of the nine half-breeds referred to. Under the existing regulations the Department does not assume any obligation for the education and maintenance of half-breeds in any section of the country and until that policy is reversed it would not be possible to look favourably upon the suggestion made by His Grace Archbishop Langevin.\n\nSince the above memorandum was written a letter has\nhas reached the Department from Father Lecoeq giving the information asked for in the letter sent to Mr. Agent Stewart, which shows that the existing conditions at the Norway House Mission where these pupils are placed are sufficient to meet the Department's requirements. I would, therefore, recommend that they be allowed the usual grant commencing with the current quarter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The number of pupils is to be limited to five until such time as the proposed new boarding school building is ready for occupation.\n\nThe Department has been paying a day school grant of $300.00 for the tuition of these children, but this will now be withdrawn, as boarding schools are obliged to furnish instruction in the class-room from the per capita allowance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Boarding School on the Jack River, as requested, per number and date of letter above.\n\nThe staff of this school is composed of as follows; The Revd Father Lecoeq, Principal, The Revd Father Thomas, Assistant, Sister Superior, Marguerite Mary, Matron, Sister Mary de Lourdes, Teacher, Sister St John, Cooking Dept., Sister Bernadette, Seamstress, and two Lay Brothers who attend to all the outside work.\n\nAccommodation\n\nThe Boarding School although a small building has ample accommodation for the number of children in residence. The building is a frame building 20x30 feet, two storeys in height, with a kitchen attached to the main building, and is in very good condition. There is another building of 16x20ft, which is built of logs, in which the Revds Father Lecoeq and Father Thomas and the two Lay Brothers reside also the boys in the school have their sleeping quarters upstairs in this building, which is nice and warm in the coldest of weather. The Nuns four in number, along with the girls of the school have their sleeping quarters in the main building, which is kept warm day and night, thus making it very comfortable for the children.\n\nThe main building downstairs is divided into 1 dining room, for the staff 1 dining room for the children, 1 bed-room large enough for the four Nuns, and 1 large Bed-room for the girls, 1 large room used as a recreation room for the boys, while the dining room is used for the same purpose for the girls.\n\nThe kitchen is a building attached to the main building and therefore does not interfere with the arrangements (over)\narrangements, for the children in the main building. Upstairs this is divided into a Chapel and a Class Room for the children in residence. All of this I may state is kept scrupulously clean and neat. The rooms in the main building downstairs are daily disinfected in the morning so as to purify the air and keep the rooms in a healthy condition.\n\nVentilation/\nThis is secured by opening the windows and doors when required.\n\nHeating/\nThis is obtained by using furnace stoves downstairs, which supplies upstairs with hot-air and makes the school and chapel very comfortable.\n\nResidence/\nThe number of children in residence are 5 treaty Indian children, and 9 half-breed children whose mothers have died this winter, the Nuns taking care of these children for the present until the parents can keep them home.\n\nStudies etc./\nThe studies taught the children are those which are approved of by the Department of Indian Affairs, viz; Reading, Writing, Spelling, Dictation, Drawing, Composition, Hygiene, Calisthenics, Geography, Grammar, Domestic Economy which includes Politeness and Cleanliness, Vocal Music, Plain Sewing, Fancy Sewing, Knitting, Cooking, Baking, Laundry work, and fancy work in knitting, crocheting, darning, lace work, and embroidery.\n\nThursday afternoons are used for giving the boys instructions in light labour, such as piling wood and cleaning up all refuse about the place in the winter, and in summer by assisting in the garden, and other light labours. The girls on Thursday afternoons are instructed in fancy work, sewing, and knitting, also in light household work. On Saturdays if there is no light work for the boys to do they attend school for half a day.\n\nPractical instruction in housework is taught the girls as follows; Cleanliness, Cooking, Laundry work and sewing? Fire Drill has not been taught yet as the house is not large enough for drilling purposes. The first thing taught the children\n\n(over)\nchildren, on entering the school is general cleanliness, mending and taking care of their clothes. Religious instruction is given every day from half past three till four o'clock by the Principal The Revd Father Lecoe.\n\nProgress in studies are very good so far. The equipment of the school is good and quite sufficient for the number of children in the school. Attending and nursing the children when sick, is done by the Sister Superior Marguerite herself, and judging from the looks of the children they are about as healthy a lot of youngsters as one would like to see.\n\nThis is a list of the children who have been in the school and who are in now:\n\n| Name          | Age       | Status     |\n|---------------|-----------|------------|\n| Virginie Colomb | Cross Lake | 3 years and 6 months, Resident now |\n| Justine Colomb |           | 3 \" 6 \"    |\n| Veronique Colomb |         | 3 years Absent |\n| Jacob Meeno   | Norway House | 2 years and 6 months Resident now |\n| Robert Meeno  |           | 2 \" 6 \"    Resident now |\n| Blanche McKay | Cross Lake | 6 months Resident now |\n| Jerome Moose  | Norway House | 1 year Dead |\n| James Mistatin | Norway House | 6 months Absent |\n| Cinderella Budd | Norway House | 6 months Absent |\n\nRemarks:\n\nVeronique marked as \"absent\" went home for a holiday and took sick, is well now and will enter school again in the spring.\n\nJames Mistatin and Cinderella Budd also marked \"absent\", are uncertain as to re-entering school, not being Catholics.\n\nJerome Moose marked as \"dead\", was taken to St Boniface Hospital for treatment for meningitis, but died there.\n\nThose marked as \"Resident now\", are still in the school. The list also shows the time each scholar has been in the school.\n\nThe Sister Superior Marguerite also states that they had II Boarders at the Cross Lake school before the Norway House school was built, and for which they received no remuneration for.\n\nRespectfully submitting this report re the R.C. Boarding school.\n\n(over)\nI have the Honour to be Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nCross Lake.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to letter of above number and date, I beg to say that I note the instructions regarding the R.C. Day school having been turned into a boarding school.\n\nAll school returns will be made out in boarding school forms, and as soon as a Doctor arrives here I will have these children examined and medical certificates forwarded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nNorway House, Man., April 16th, 1913.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn consideration of the fact that the Department are considering the advisability of building a Boarding School here for the Catholic Church or assisting the Church to do so, I consider it my duty to draw your attention to the misleading nature of the report of the R.C. Day School here at Norway House as it appears in the Blue Book for 1912. As I suppose the intention of the Department is grounded on the reports of this school for the last few years.\n\nThe Report Of The Superintendent of Indian Education for 1912, page 411 say that the Roman Catholic School here has an enrollment of 9 boys and 7 girls, 16 in all. From personal knowledge and also from the word of your Agent here, Mr. Stewart, the Roman Catholic people here have only two (2) scholars of school age belonging to this Reserve. They have had some half breed children attending their school also a few children from Cross Lake Band which may be Treaty children.\n\nIt has always appeared to me as a great injustice that the Catholic people should have even a grant for a day school here when they have not the required number of children. That imported children from a neighboring Reserve where they already have a day school and where they have children enough to justify a claim for a boarding school should be considered reason for a boarding school here seems strange to me. The Methodist Church has been doing missionary and educational work here for the last seventy two years and yet when our average attendance ran below six here at Rossville your agent, Mr. Calverley, warned us that we had better raise it or we would be likely to lose the Government grant. How then is it possible for the R.C. Church to be given a starting grant when they have only two pupils all told of school age? Much less is there any justification for the granting of help towards a Boarding School.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nIn consideration of the facts that the Methodist Church has been laboring here for seventy-three years in the next month of this year both in mission and educational work, and the Anglican Church for about fifteen years, and that all the people here belong to either one or other of the two denominations last named, and that the Roman Catholic Church has no constituency tributary to nor within reach of this place which would entitle them to Government assistance in a boarding school here it would, therefore, appear that if the Government does assist them it would be an unjust misuse of public funds, inasmuch as their only reasonable hope of filling a school here is by proseliting from the Methodists and Anglicans. And I do not suppose that the Dominion Government has the slightest desire or intention to aid or abet proseliting by any denomination.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nJ. C.

Dr. Roche -\n\nIn forwarding the Memorandum to Council to you dated the 12th January, accepting the lowest tender for the construction of the Roman Catholic boarding school building at Cross Lake, I beg to point out that this school is to provide for the children of the Roman Catholic Indians in the diocese of Keewatin, and that the activities of the church so far as they are aided by the Government, are to be limited to this school. A few residential pupils were accommodated at Norway House but these pupils are to be transferred to the Cross Lake school when it is completed.\n\nAs the Department is constantly being pressed for the erection of buildings for residential schools, principally in remote districts, where the Indians have not at present such educational advantages, I think it well to endeavour to fix a policy for the\nDepartment with reference to future grants for educational purposes. So far as these demands are concerned, the educational field may be divided into two classes.\n\n(1) Schools which are already established in more or less settled districts. The requisitions made upon us for building expenditure for this class of schools are for repairs and enlargements, and in some cases complete rebuilding. It should be remembered that most of these schools were erected by the church authorities or by the Department without any attention to sanitary arrangements. In many cases they have fallen into disrepair and are not suitable for the work which is carried on within their walls.\n\n(2) Schools which are intended to supplement the missionaries' efforts to evangelize the Indians. The majority of these applications must necessarily come from remote districts where the Indians earn their livelihood by hunting and fishing.\n\nIt seems to me clear that our first duty is to meet the needs which arise in class 1, and to consider\nit our first object to thoroughly equip the old institutions.\n\nWhen the question of Indian Education was being considered by your predecessor in office in the autumn of 1910, and when the per capita grants were increased and the schools standardized, we stated on the authority of Hon. Mr. Oliver that the Government was willing to spend a moderate amount from year to year in establishing new and modern buildings, but would not undertake to furnish modern buildings in all cases where they are required within a short space of time.\n\nOur main Estimates for the current year provide for $342,000.00 for buildings for residential schools and $10,925.00 for buildings for day schools. It seems to me that that is a fair annual expenditure for some years to come. At that rate of expenditure we should be able in two years to meet all the requirements of the older institutions.\n\nI trust this outline of policy will meet with your approval.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nSchools Branch -\n\nPlease note letter hereunder placing the Norway House Boarding School in the Northern division from the 1st January, 1915.\n\nRev. Father Cahill, Winnipeg, should be written to and informed that the Norway House Roman Catholic school will also be placed in this class from the same date and for similar reasons, and that when the school is moved to Cross Lake, the grant will be continued at the rate of $125.00 per capita.\n\nDuncan O.

Sir,\n\nI beg to inform you that, in view of the location of the Norway House Roman Catholic Boarding School and the cost of management, etc., the Department has decided to place it in the Northern division from the first of January, 1915, and when the school is moved to Cross Lake the grant will be continued at the rate of $125.00 per capita.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Father Cahill,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\nNorway House Agency.\n\nFeb. 5th, 1915.\n\nSubject: Official trip to Split Lake.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward a report of my official trip to Split Lake to look into the condition of the Indians in that portion of this Agency and also to look into the freighting of the I.P. Treaty and Destitute Supplies to Split Lake and Nelson House reserves.\n\nOn the 8th of January I left the Agency for Split Lake and arrived at Cross Lake on the 11th. I remained at Cross Lake on Sunday and on Monday the 17th, I left Cross Lake for Split Lake and arrived there on the 17th after a fairly good journey, with the exception of one day at Thicket Portage where we had to lay over on account of a blizzard. On Monday the 15th, I held a meeting with the Chief William KitchiKeesick and Mr Fox also being present, the other councillors were not present as they were away hunting.\n\nI am glad to report that while a few of the Indians at Split Lake are poor and destitute and are receiving assistance, yet there is no real destitution, I think now that I went there and saw the condition of the Indians at Split Lake myself, and explained to them how they could avoid being dependent on the Government for their food and clothing, that they will make stronger efforts to hunt fur and food in the lakes close to their reserve. I pointed out to them that I had induced a trader to come amongst them who would pay better prices for their fur than the H.E. Company were doing, and that by hunting the kinds of fur that were fetching fair prices, they could easily be better off and more comfortable. I also explained to them that the Department would not assist able bodied men who would not try to help themselves. If a man who tried and failed, then...\npossibly some assistance would be given him so that he could make another effort. The Chief promised to see that his people would obey these instructions, and that if they did not try to help themselves, they would only have themselves to blame for being destitute, and that no assistance would be given unless they made this effort. The Revd Mr Fox has kindly consented to act with the Chief and start all who are able to go and hunt, and possibly give some of them some assistance, so as to enable them to go to their hunting camps.\n\nRe Freighting of their Treaty and Destitute Supplies\n\nI also spoke to them of how that their Treaty and Destitute Supplies would probably come by rail as far as Thicket Portage next spring, which would be much closer than coming to Norway House. I made a careful calculation of what the rate per pound would be, and told them it would be $4\\frac{1}{2}$ a pound with rations included. The Chief has promised to get seven canoes to freight their supplies. The Nelson House Indians have also agreed to come to Thicket Portage for their supplies. The money they earn on their freighting to be paid them at Treaty time. Mr Cowan a merchant at Thicket Portage has promised to receive and store the I.B. supplies for these two reserves, and also to furnish them with rations for their trip home.\n\nI would here beg to state that I think this the most direct way of getting the supplies forwarded for these two reserves, Nelson House and Split Lake. Next year the supplies could be forwarded to the Manitou rapids on the Nelson river, which would be much shorter again for the Split Lake Indians, but I think Thicket Portage would be closer for the Nelson House Indians than coming to the Manitou. The only advantage to the Nelson House Indians in coming to the Manitou, would be that there would not be so much portaging to do, and their supplies could be landed at Nelson House in a much better and cleaner condition.\n\nI would like to hear from the Department\nas soon as possible, if it was decided to freight the Treaty and Restitute supplies for these two reserves via the Pas to Thicket Portage, so that I could let the Indians know if they were to come to Thicket Portage for their supplies instead of coming all the way to Norway House, before winter travelling was done.\n\nFor Split Lake the Revd Mr Fox could be informed at Winnipeg at the Indian Office, as Mr Fox is attending a Masonic meeting or function, some time this month at Winnipeg, and a telegram or letter stating the wishes of the Department in that respect would find Mr Fox at Winnipeg. Mr Fox could then inform the Indians at Split Lake what route to take, whether to Norway House or Thicket Portage. On my return to Cross Lake I re-inspected the Roman Catholic boarding school and I will make a separate report of this inspection.\nSubject: Inspection of the Roman Catholic Boarding School, Cross Lake\n\nOn Monday the 25th of January I duly inspected the Roman Catholic boarding school called St Joseph's at Cross Lake. I now beg to forward a full report on this school.\n\nThe staff of the school consists of the following members:\n\nThe Revd Father Lecocq. Principal.\nThe Revd Father Thomas. Assistant Principal,\nThe Revd Sister Superior Marguerite Marie, Matron.\nThe Revd Sister Camille, Assistant Matron,\nThe Revd Sister Alphonsus de Liguori, Teacher,\nThe Revd Sister Bernadette, Sewing Teacher,\nThe Revd Sister St Jean, In charge of the kitchen,\nBrother Gauthier, Mechanical Superintendent,\nBrother Cordau, Assistant\nMr Desautel, Layman and Teamster.\n\nThis completes a list of the staff at present; another teacher is to be added to the staff in the coming summer, so as to be able to give their best attention to the education of the Roman Catholic children on this reserve and other reserves. I took the measurements of the different buildings in use so that a complete idea would be had of this school.\n\nMeasurement of Buildings\n\nThe main building used as school and which is attached to the church is 40 x 56 feet with one story. The residence of Father Lecocq and male assistants with a dormitory for the boys upstairs measures, 28ft x 34ft x 16 ft x 34 ft. A store building which can be used for further school purposes measures, 20ft x 30ft.\n\nIn the spring time when warmer weather appears, tents will be erected as dormitories for the pupils. One large tent size, 40ft x 40ft will be capable of housing all the girl pupils with two sisters in charge. Two tents 14ft x 28ft will be erected for the boys with two brothers in charge, thus you will see that it is the intention of the Principal Father\nFather Lecocq and his able assistants to keep up their boarding school in a very efficient manner. The day school will be kept separate and which will be used as a preparatory school for the boarding school, on much the same lines as the Methodist boarding and day school at Norway House is conducted.\n\nAt present all the girls are housed in the main building with the sisters in charge. These dormitories I inspected and found them to be spotlessly clean in every particular; ventilation was provided for by having all the windows opened all day. Another feature which speaks well for the Sister Superior in charge is, that every day these dormitories are disinfected so as to prevent any sickness invading these dormitories.\n\nThe boys are housed at the Principal's residence upstairs, the lower part of the building is divided into two fairly large rooms, one room being used as a day school, which is taught by the Revd Sister Superior. The other room is used by the Principal as his private room and office.\n\nIn the event of the Department allowing the Catholics to admit more pupils, the store building will be re-modelled with dormitories upstairs and placed in charge of Mr Desautel. Downstairs will be used as an additional class room, in fact everything possible will be done by the Revd Father Lecocq to spare no expense in housing, feeding and clothing admitted pupils to this school, if permitted by the Department to take Applications for just as many pupils as there is room for. I may also mention, so well is every detail looked after for the care of these children, that there is no overcrowding. The Principal estimates that he can take care of 25 pupils with the accommodations that he has, and trusts the Department will meet his wishes in this respect. I also inspected the class rooms, and found that there are a total of 4 children attending this school classed as follows:\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-1, part 1)\nAdmitted to the St Joseph's boarding school, Norway House, 5\nAllowed by the Department to be kept as a boarder, 1\nPupils boarded at school, and waiting for admission, 16\nIndian children attending day school, 13\nWhite children \" \" \" 19\n\nMore day scholars who live a long distance from the school attend, but only irregularly, according to the weather, these are not counted, on account of their irregular attendance.\n\nThe names of the old admitted pupils are as follows: Jacob Meemo, Robert Meemo, Virginie Colomb, Justine Colomb, Blanche McKay, and Francis Chapman allowed by the Department to be kept as a boarder. The names of the new scholars are, Edmund Meemo, James McKay, Athanase Thomas, John Samuel McKay, William Thomas, Henry Blacksmith, Sandy Cook, Angela McKay, Alice McKay, Marguerite Trout, Charles Sinclair, James Miller, Norah Cook, V\u00e9ronique Colomb, Mary Jane McKay, and Mary Trout.\n\nI also inspected the children in their studies.\n\nStandard I - Reading and Spelling, Fair. In this standard some white children were classed with the Indians; the Indian children appear to learn quicker than the white children.\n\nStandard 2, Reading and Spelling, Fair.\n\n\" 3, \" \" \" \" \" \"\n\" 4A, \" \" \" Good. Indian children.\n\" 4B, \" \" \" White \"\n\nIn Grammar and Lessons in English, the children are beginning to realise the value of this part of their education. In Geography some of the classes were good and some only fair. Hygiene is a favorite subject at this school, and some of the essays on how to keep a home, are very good, and if only they practise what they are taught now and firmly believe it, they will make good examples for the other Indians on this reserve.\n\nThe Brothers instruct the boys in\nin carpentering, gardening, and other useful outdoor work. One of the boys is now a good shoemaker and is able to turn out a good job of mending boots. The girls are taught by the Sisters all manner of housework and two of the girls are assisting Sister St Jean in the kitchen and learning how to cook. All kinds of sewing, knitting, fancy work, and mending are done by the girls also, and they have a very competent instructor in the person of Sister Bernadette. It is the intention of the Sisters to give an exhibition of all the work done by the children of this school at the next Annuity payments.\n\nThe Principal Father Lecocq has asked me in this report to emphasize the fact, that it is purely a boarding school that he is managing, and wishes to be recognized as such. He took the children of his school at Norway House and all the fixings belonging to the boarding school on the Jack River at his own expense to Cross Lake, as he did not wish the children to lose the advantage they already had, by waiting for the new school to be built.\n\nDuring this hard winter it has been a Godsend to the Catholic Indians of Cross Lake, that they had a chance to place some of their children in a school of this kind, when they could only barely provide their food, and not their clothing and in some instances in which they could not even provide food enough. It would come as a great hardship to these poor Indians who have given their children to be educated, fed, and clothed, and also, how to live cleaner lives, to be forced to take their children back to their homes, after seeing the good and thoughtful care taken of them. It is to be hoped that the Department will assist Father Lecocq in his good intentions and grant him his boarding school. I respectfully submit this report for your consideration.\nI have the Honor to be Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nCross Lake  \nFeb. 23rd 1915  \n476561\n\nDuncan C.

General  \nDepartment of Indian Affairs  \nOttawa\n\nSir,\n\nBefore sending in my annual report, as desired in your circular of the 20th Feb 1914 on the St. Joseph Boarding School of Cross Lake, I want to acquaint you with the different changes which occurred in the said school.\n\nOur school having been transferred from Norway House to Cross Lake. We found ourselves obliged to make sure a new installation and to transport during winter the material we had at Norway House for that purpose, this implied much expense.\n\nThe labour of the new school building started in the first day of May last year, but the great difficulty encountered in the transportation of the material and the labourers French and Belgian which I had hired, were compelled to leave at the beginning of August to help their country at war. It was utterly impossible for me to complete the work. Accordingly I had for this year to take possession of the buildings which belong to the mission after having repaired them. This gave me the privilege advantage to hold a greater number of children.\n\nIt was necessary as the result of the fire having completely destroyed the Indians left without any resources. But we desire anything else but to get rid of these poor children.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nand send them here with food and clothing. In fact, I was prepared for it. With the two Brothers appointed for the care of the school, they had two more men. The number of sisters are also at five. By mutual consent with the Indian Agent of Nova Scotia, they accepted 13 children more than last year, being now in all 41 - 16 boys and 11 girls. The main building being the sisters' and girls', has two flats measuring 50 x 40. A kitchen adjoining measures 20 x 30.\n\nThe Fathers, Brothers, and boys' residence has equally two flats measuring 34 x 16. Being surrounded by the main building by 80 meters. The school house apart of their building measures 30 x 20.\n\nI have seen it right on regard to the present wants of the poor Indians; to increase the number of children and that you would not make any difficulty to account them and to allow grant for. Third new children were admitted from the 1st September to December 1911.\n\nThe work at the new school will be continued as soon as the matter is favourable. But I intend first to go to Ottawa on inquiry for the 100 acres of land promised at my request and of which I do not hear of anything till then.\n\nAllow me to offer you my respectful homage\n\nE.

Rev. Father Lecoq recently transferred the pupils from the boarding school at Norway House and has opened a boarding school in the Mission buildings at Cross Lake until the new school buildings which are being erected at that point are completed. The first intimation of the transfer of this school to Cross Lake was contained in a letter of Agent Stewart of the 7th of January, last.\n\nThe buildings being used for school purposes are a main building, in which the girls and the sisters of the staff are housed, 40 by 56 feet, one storey, attached to the church. The residence of Father Lecoq is used as a dormitory for the boys and is 16 by 34 feet. The children are taught in the day school building. It is the intention of the Principal in the spring to erect tents to be used as dormitories. The Principal states that with the accommodation he\nhe has he can take care of twenty-five pupils and asks that the Department allow him a per capita grant for that number. He has at present twenty-one pupils in residence. The school is now being allowed a grant for fourteen pupils and I would recommend that the grant be increased to twenty-five.\n\nThe Principal moved all the appliances belonging to the boarding school at Norway House and the school at Jack River to equip the school which he is conducting at Cross Lake and the Agent states that it has been a God send to the Indians at Cross Lake that they had a chance to place some of their children in a school of this kind when they could only barely provide their food and not their clothing and in some instances in which they could not even provide food enough.\nOttawa, March 17, 1915.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo, informing the Department of the transfer by you, of the pupils and equipment from the Roman Catholic Boarding School at Norway House to Cross Lake, and that you are at present conducting a boarding school in the mission buildings at Cross Lake with twenty-one children in attendance.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Agent Stewart, who inspected the school in January, last, states that there is accommodation available for twenty-five pupils and requests that a grant be allowed for that number. In view of the agent's report regarding the provisions made by you for this number of children, the Department has decided to allow a per capita grant for twenty-five pupils at Cross Lake. This School has been, from the first of January, last, placed in the schools of the Northern Division and will from that date be entitled to receive a grant at the rate of $125.00 per capita.\n\nThe Department will also pay a grant for the teacher's salary at the day school, until such time as the new building for the boarding school, now in course of erection, is completed. It being understood, however, that\n\nRev. H. Lecoq, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nCross Lake R. C. Boarding School,\nCross Lake,\nVia Norway House, Man.\nthat when these new buildings are ready for occupation, the day school is to be discontinued and the grant for the teacher's salary is then to cease.\n\nThe Department notes your remarks that the work of the new buildings will be continued as soon as the weather permits.\n\nRegarding the land required in connection with the new boarding school, I beg to say that the Department of the Interior has made a reservation of 401 acres for the purposes of this school, the title to which is vested in the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nThe approval by the Department of the transfer of the school to Cross Lake and the providing of a per capita grant for twenty-five pupils is made on the understanding that the Roman Catholic Church authorities will, in future, discontinue the educational work at Norway House.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

On chante, la fanfare joue, puis la pri\u00e8re r\u00e9cit\u00e9e sur le pont vient terminer une journ\u00e9e si bien commenc\u00e9e.\n\n31 ao\u00fbt\n\nLe vent du nord s'est lev\u00e9 ; il souffle avec violence ; le lac est gris, il fait froid. Le vent se fait sentir et d\u00e9j\u00e0 plusieurs en subissent les effets. Les pr\u00eatres sont d\u00e9sappoint\u00e9s de ne pouvoir pas dire la messe. Il y a des chapelles portatives, et tous les groupes nombreux ont pu c\u00e9der \u00e0 tous les mouvements d\u00e9sordonn\u00e9s du bateau. Nous longeons la rive gauche du lac, une rive inhabitable et sauvage. \u00c0 8h30 heures, le \"Wolverine\" s'arr\u00eate \u00e0 Little Bull Head pour s'approvisionner de combustible. Tous en profitent pour se remettre un peu le c\u0153ur en courant les petits bords environnants. Nous sentons que nous approchons de la fin du voyage de l'automne. Le lac est de nouveau sauvage avec ses \u00eeles d\u00e9mod\u00e9es et ses rives faites de rochers et de langue de terre. Cette nature change tout \u00e0 coup, et se fait pittoresque. Ce sont maintenant des \u00eelots arros\u00e9s et richement bois\u00e9s, des rivages aux haies nombreuses et color\u00e9es, des tons c\u00f4t\u00e9s de merveilleux effets de lumi\u00e8re. Le \"Victor\" change \u00e0 tout moment sa course, car la navigation est extr\u00eamement difficile, et il faut un certain temps de man\u0153uvre pour \u00e9viter les \u00eeles dans le lac est rempli. Le d\u00eener nous est servi sur le pont, \u00e0 la mode des marins.\n\n\u00c0 trois heures, le \"Victor\" est au quai du portage de Whiski Jack. En effet, d'ailleurs, les bagages sont charg\u00e9s sur des chariots roulant sur des rails en bois et tir\u00e9s par des chevaux. Le gouvernement ferait une bonne \u0153uvre en donnant aux missionnaires de Cross Lake les moyens de remplacer ces pi\u00e8ces de bois par des v\u00e9ritables rails. Cela rendrait le portage beaucoup moins p\u00e9nible. Pendant que les chevaux tirent leurs charges, les voyageurs passent \u00e0 pied et parcoururent rapidement la distance de cinq milles qui les s\u00e9pare de Cross Lake. Ce n'est pas encore le terme, puisqu'il nous reste 13 milles avant l'arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 la destination. Quel est donc l'\u00e9tonnement de tous de trouver toute une flottille de canots automobiles. Vraiment nous aurions aim\u00e9 quelque chose de plus original dans cette province. Cependant nous avons r\u00e9unis vite avec la gazoline en consid\u00e9rant l'immense serviette qu'elle va nous rendre. Nous saluons Mgr Charbonneau, depuis quelques temps \u00e0 Osoyoos.\nLake, et venu \u00e0 notre rencontre, et prenons place dans une grande berge. Les canots sont attel\u00e9s \u00e0 cette berge et la tra\u00eenent lentement dans un roulement sonore de moteurs.\n\nEnfin la mission appara\u00eet \u00e0 nos yeux. Des Indiens saluent notre arriv\u00e9e par des salves, tandis que la fanfare leur r\u00e9pond par ses meilleurs airs.\n\nL'\u00e9cole de Cross Lake d\u00e9passe toutes nos pr\u00e9visions. Nous avons une maison de 104 par 40, \u00e0 trois \u00e9tages et construite en pierre solide. L'int\u00e9rieur comprend plusieurs chambres, des classes, deux salles de r\u00e9cr\u00e9ation, deux dortoirs, un r\u00e9fectoire et un grand salon. La chapelle est une construction moderne. La maison est \u00e9clair\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9, chauff\u00e9e \u00e0 la vapeur et desservie par un syst\u00e8me d'aqueduc tout \u00e0 fait moderne. Il ne manque pas de confort. Nous avons une \u00e9cole qui peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une merveille dans cette r\u00e9gion lointaine. On ne saurait croire tout ce qu'il a fallu de travail, de pers\u00e9v\u00e9rance et de patience pour les portes pour la construire. On a du transporter le mat\u00e9riel d'une tr\u00e8s grande distance et par des voies de communication tr\u00e8s primitives.\n\nCes m\u00eames Indiens ne sont rien de moins que des chr\u00e9tiens de bonne volont\u00e9. Ils ont tout employ\u00e9, m\u00eame les moyens les plus bas. Ils ont fait circuler au milieu des sauvages les id\u00e9es les plus all\u00e9chantes et les plus invraisemblables sur le compte des religieux; ils ont distribu\u00e9 la Bible \u00e0 ceux qui pouvaient la lire; ils ont utilis\u00e9 de toute leur influence aupr\u00e8s des autorit\u00e9s civiles. Le z\u00e8le intellectuel de Mgr P. Lecocq a triomph\u00e9 de ces difficult\u00e9s et l'\u0153uvre de Dieu a vaincu celle de Satan.\n\nLa maison est construite dans un endroit assez \u00e0 faire \u00e9tonner, sur une petite \u00e9chancrure par une baie qui forme un port o\u00f9 les navires sont toujours en s\u00fbret\u00e9.\n\nLe travail accompli aupr\u00e8s des petits sauvages est lui aussi \u00e9tonnant. Ces enfants des bois sont gentils et bien habill\u00e9s, tr\u00e8s propres et leur allure qui tient \u00e0 la fois de la civilisation et de la sauvagerie.\n\n3 septembre\n\nC'est aujourd'hui dimanche et Mgr Charlebois c\u00e9l\u00e8bre la grand'messe, assist\u00e9 du R\u00e8v. P\u00e8re P. Magnan, o.m.i. M. l'abb\u00e9 Lefevre remplit les fonctions de diacre, le R. P. Dugas, o.m.i., de sous-diacre, et M. l'abb\u00e9 Caron de c\u00e9l\u00e9brantaire. Mgr Charlebois donne une allocution et il exprime d'abord son regret de ne pouvoir pas parler sauvage, car il est repr\u00e9sentant de l'\u00c9glise et l'\u00c9glise aime \u00e0 s'adresser \u00e0 ses enfants dans la langue qu'ils parlent.\n\nSa Grandeur prend pour texte de son sermon ses paroles de Notre-Seigneur \u00e0 ses ap\u00f4tres : \"Allez, enseignez tous les peuples, les nations, le nom du P\u00e8re, du Fils et du Saint-Esprit, etc.\" Par ces paroles J\u00e9sus-Christ donne \u00e0 ses ap\u00f4tres l'ordre de pr\u00eacher l'\u00c9vangile, d'enseigner ce qu'il leur a dit d'enseigner.\n\nDieu a fait homme ; il se fait petit enfant et grandit comme fils du charpentier Joseph ; mais d\u00e8s l'\u00e2ge de douze ans Il montre qu'Il est Dieu et le prouve ensuite par sa vie et ses miracles. Il vient nous gu\u00e9rir et nous faire conna\u00eetre des choses que sans Lui nous n'aurions jamais connues ; Il veut nous dire que Dieu est notre P\u00e8re, le chef d'une famille dont nous sommes tous les enfants. Vous donc, enfants des bois, vous \u00eates grands et nobles puisque vous \u00eates les enfants de Dieu.\n\nJ\u00e9sus-Christ laisse des ap\u00f4tres pour continuer sa \u0153uvre ; Il leur dit : \"Allez, pr\u00eachez...\" Il ne leur dit pas : \"Allez, distribuez des livres.\" Il dit : \"Je suis la voie, la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, la vie.\" Je suis la voie qui conduit au ciel, je suis la vie des \u00e2mes. Il est une Bible et Il en fond qu'une ! Il n'y a qu'un seul troupier et un seul pasteur ; il n'y a aussi qu'une seule v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et en Afrique, comme en Am\u00e9rique, comme en Europe, nous devons \u00eatre successivement les ap\u00f4tres, pr\u00e9senter la m\u00eame doctrine. J\u00e9sus-Christ d\u00e9sire que ses pr\u00eatres ne se marient pas afin qu'ils soient plus libres de se d\u00e9vouer pour le salut des \u00e2mes. \"Vous trouverez des femmes, des Gospel-girls, qui ressemblent \u00e0 \u00eatre m\u00e8res, afin d'avoir des coeurs de m\u00e8res pour tous ceux qui tombent sous leur direction.\" Ce n'est que dans la v\u00e9ritable \u00c9glise que l'on trouve ces responsabilit\u00e9s, comme elles existent dans toutes les autres religions. Les missionnaires ne sont pas en qu\u00eate de richesses ; ils ne veulent que les \u00e2mes pour les conduire au ciel. Pour sanctifier les \u00e2mes, J\u00e9sus-Christ \u00e9tablit des sacrements, signes sensibles qui atteignent le corps et l'\u00e2me et donnent la gr\u00e2ce.\n\nNous sommes venus ici pour appuyer les enseignements que les missionnaires vous donnent et vous provoquer que vous \u00eates de la m\u00eame \u00c9glise que nous, du m\u00eame troupeau de J\u00e9sus-Christ.\n\nJ'invite le missionnaire \u00e0 vous traduire ces mots \u00e0 vous dire que nous croyons et pratiquons les m\u00eames choses et que nous esp\u00e9rons tous d'\u00eatre r\u00e9unis un jour en Dieu si\u00e9ges.\n\nLe R. P. Bonnald, o.m.i., traduit en vermonais le discours.\n\nAu d\u00eener, Mgr Charlebois adresse des paroles de bienvenue aux visiteurs, et particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 Mgr B\u00e9liveau. C'est, dit-il, le plus beau jour pour Cross Lake. Ensuite, le R. P. Bonnald, fondateur de la mission fond\u00e9e en 1901 par le R. P. Bonnald, qui passa le premier hiver dans une cabane de sauvages. Les conversions se firent bient\u00f4t nombreuses et il devint n\u00e9cessaire de construire une \u00e9cole. La mission passa par de nombreuses \u00e9preuves, mais elle vit aujourd'hui son plein \u00e9panouissement. Il faut adresser des f\u00e9licitations au R. P. Lecocq qui a construit l'\u00e9cole et au p\u00e8re de la mission, le saint Joseph qui a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 l'oeuvre. Le R. P. Lecocq n'a m\u00e9lang\u00e9 ni activit\u00e9 ni d\u00e9vouement. Il \u00e9tait impossible de faire mieux. Le bois n'\u00e9tait pas assez dur, il fallait de la patience. Mgr Charlebois, G\u00e9lieuse et Fr\u00e8re Gauthier et Cordes, qui ont si bien aid\u00e9 le R. P. Lecocq. Il rappelle le souvenir de Mgr Langevin, dont le d\u00e9vouement fut si grand et si efficace. Les R. P. B\u00e9liveau, Perrot, Forget et Th\u00e9mas ont aussi beaucoup fait pour l'oeuvre. Le D\u00e9partement des Indiens m\u00e9rite des remerciements. Monseigneur remercie tous les visiteurs et dit cette ann\u00e9e sera dans la tradition indien l'ann\u00e9e de la grande f\u00eate.\n\nMgr B\u00e9liveau prend ensuite la parole. Il fait remarquer que les r\u00f4les sont intervertis. Nous devons remercier au lieu d'\u00eatre remerci\u00e9s. L'immense imitation nous a donn\u00e9 l'occasion de nous contempler les beaut\u00e9s naturelles de cette partie de notre pays ; car il n'est pas facile d'oublier le beau spectacle qu'offre le parcours de Winnipeg \u00e0 Cross Lake. Ensuite, en qui est pas cette imitation nous fournit une occasion de profonde \u00e9ducation. Le spectacle de ce qui s'est fait et se fait encore \u00e0 Cross Lake et dans d'autres parties de l'Ontario nous montre que l'esprit apostolique n'est pas disparu de la terre. Les Oblats de Marie Immacul\u00e9e font revivre dans leurs missions les jours apostoliques. On se demande parfois si les conditions qui existent dans ces r\u00e9gions sauvages sont vraiment proportionn\u00e9es aux sacrifices consid\u00e9rables que demandent ces missions. Les Oblats jugent comme jugeait le Divin Ma\u00eetre. Une chose est certaine : si les Indiens n'\u00e9taient pas en vain qu'ils ont pris pour devise : \"Evangeliser les pauvres.\" C'est surtout sous ce rapport que nous devons de la reconnaissance \u00e0 ceux qui nous ont instruits. Ils nous aident \u00e0 monter vers le ciel.\nses comme Notre-Seigneur en a juge lui-m\u00eame.\n\nAinsi Dieu se pla\u00eet-il \u00e0 b\u00e9nir sp\u00e9cialement ceux qui font cette \u0153uvre. Une communaut\u00e9 dont les membres font aussi all\u00e9grement des \u0153uvres qui demandent une si grande d\u00e9pense peut \u00eatre assur\u00e9e de l'assistance divine.\n\nMgr Langevin est \u00e9t\u00e9 heureux d'\u00eatre ici aujourd'hui; lui sait que le charme des excursions et leur donner un caract\u00e8re sp\u00e9cial. Ses \u0153uvres font nombreuses, et l'une d'elles, la fondation de la congr\u00e9gation des Missionnaires Oblats du Sacr\u00e9-Coeur et de Marie Immacul\u00e9e, m\u00e9rite une consid\u00e9ration particuli\u00e8re. Le d\u00e9veloppement observ\u00e9 par cette Congr\u00e9gation qui travaille ici depuis quelques ann\u00e9es, lui attireront des b\u00e9n\u00e9dictions abondantes.\n\nMgr Dugas, P.A., V.C., f\u00e9licite amicalement le R. P. Lecoe et tous ceux qui l'ont second\u00e9. Il admire les petits Indiens qui sont charmants dans leurs mani\u00e8res, dans leur chant et dans leur pi\u00e9t\u00e9.\n\nLe R. P. Lecoe, dont la mission est si profonde qu'il ne peut retenir ses sanglots et remet au lendemain ce qu'il a dit \u00e0 ses visiteurs et \u00e0 ses aides.\n\nDans la soir\u00e9e, apr\u00e8s les c\u00e9r\u00e9monies, il y a confirmation par Mgr B\u00e9lievau, suivie du Salut du T. S. Sacrement, puis b\u00e9n\u00e9diction de l'\u00e9cole et d'une grande croix plant\u00e9e sur les bords du lac en face de l'\u00e9cole.\n\nAu souper M. l'abb\u00e9 Jubinville, cur\u00e9 de la cath\u00e9drale, et M. le Dr Lafrance, parlant l'un au nom des pr\u00eatres, l'autre au nom des la\u00efques, ont prononc\u00e9 un discours. Le R. P. Lecoe a une bonne offre de tous les excursionnistes. C'est le d\u00e9sir des donateurs que la somme soit partag\u00e9e entre le P\u00e8re Lecoe et les bons soeurs des Oblats.\n\nDans la soir\u00e9e les Indiens contemplent un spectacle sans pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent pour eux, un magnifique feu d'artifice lanc\u00e9 sur les bords du lac.\n\n4 septembre\n\nC'est aujourd'hui grand d\u00eener \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole. L'autorit\u00e9 civile y est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par deux agents de police mont\u00e9e. Des traitres, amis des missionnaires et les \u00e9coliers de l'\u00e9cole se joignent ainsi. Le R. P. Lecoe prend la parole.\n\n\"Apr\u00e8s ce qui m'a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit hier, j'aurais certainement mauvaise gr\u00e2ce, si je n'\u00e9tais pas de bonne humeur qui peut \u00eatre encore. Les propos \u00e9logieux que, dans votre grande charit\u00e9, vous avez eu le devoir adresser \u00e0 un humble missionnaire me touchent d'autant plus que ces honneurs sont directement \u00e0 la Communaut\u00e9 des Oblats de Marie Immacul\u00e9e dont je suis membre et aux ouvriers et ouvri\u00e8res qui m'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 adjoints pour mener \u00e0 bonne fin ce que nous avons commenc\u00e9.\"\n\nLe changement maintenant termin\u00e9es. Nous reviendrons un peu fatigu\u00e9s, il est vrai, mais l'\u00e2me embaum\u00e9e des choses \u00e9ternelles et sublimes qu'ils ont vues l\u00e0-bas.\n\nNous avons sous les yeux le rapport enfantin du Free Press. Ce rapport nous \u00e9tonne. Nous attendons \u00e0 mieux que cela. Le repr\u00e9sentant du Free Press, M. Colman, par son article, part \u00e0 une excursion organis\u00e9e par des gens s\u00e9rieux et dans un but s\u00e9rieux; il fait partout trait\u00e9 comme un des excursionistes, partageant avec l'hospitalit\u00e9 des P\u00e8res; il est \u00e0 convaincre les missionnaires les plus propres \u00e0 \u00e9veiller des sentiments nobles et g\u00e9n\u00e9reux. Tout cela n'a pu d\u00e9terminer sur lui, et n'a laiss\u00e9 place qu'\u00e0 des trivialit\u00e9s du plus mauvais go\u00fbt.\n\n\u00c0 cet \u00e2ge, cet individu se rendrait compte qu'il lui manquait cette \u00e9ducation n\u00e9cessaire au gentilhomme, mais \u00e0 lire on constate qu'il est plus savoureux que les Indiens qu'il d\u00e9crit d'une fa\u00e7on si d\u00e9go\u00fbtante.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-1, part 1)\nD. C. Scott Esq.,\nSuperintendent of\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Benediction of the Indian Boarding School of Cross Lake took place on the third instant and the festival continued on the fourth. I am one of the excursionists to Cross Lake. Father Lecoq who remained there prayed me to write to you.\n\nEvery one was delighted at the fine site of the School and at the aspect of the building and its so fine equipment. We were also marvelled to see the little Indian children so well trained.\n\nI have heard Father Louis,- an old Country French man and one who knows, - say : This School would be a fine building in Winnipeg, in Ottawa as well as in Paris. Imagine how grand it looks in that wilderness.\n\nAll those present regretted very much the absence of a representative of your Department.\n\nHis Grace Archbishop Beliveau upon the invitation of Right Reverend Bishop Charlebois hath made himself\na duty to be present. R.R. Bishop Charlebois was back in time from Fort Nelson to attend, and quite a number of priests and of laymen (about fifty) were in attendance.\n\nFather Lecoq hath caused the Indians to be informed of the festival, and although the hunting season had begun quite a number of them were present.\n\nR.R. Bishop Charlebois and Father Lecoq in addressing the Indians and the people in attendance expressed their gratitude towards the Dominion Government and the Department of Indian Affairs for the magnificent school the reserve of Cross Lake had been endowed with. Here I may say that Father Lecoq referred particularly to your kindness and to your constant readiness to help him on all occasion he called upon you.\n\nAt the request of the Reverend Father I send you per concurrent mail films of photographs taken by me, and I would be very much obliged if you would let me have a couple of copies of each of the films,- one copy I am to transmit to Father Lecoq and the other would be for me. Also at Father Lecoq's request I mail you one copy of the NORTH WEST REVIEW and one of LA LIBERTE containing a report of the celebration held at Cross Lake.\non the occasion of the Benediction of the School.\n\nI remain, dear Sir,\n\nYour humble servant:\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is true there are many children yet at home who could be in school.\n\nIf it is possible, I wish you would allow to take five children more, instead of 80. I think they can manage to room them easy. In doing so we could satisfy few more parents.\n\nBelieve me, Sir, your obedient servant.\n\n+ A. Charles Lacombe,\nBishop of Kewatin.\nApril 24, 1917.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 18th of April, in which you ask to be allowed to increase the pupilage at the Cross Lake boarding school from 30 to 35.

Charlebois, M.S.\nBishop of Keewatin.\nOttawa, November 8th, 1917.\n\nMost Rev. Sir -\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 23rd ultimo, and in reply I would state that there is no objection to your using war bread in the boardingschools during the continuance of the war.\n\nI have obtained from the Food Comptroller's Office a number of recipes, and I have pleasure in sending you herewith for your guidance and information a copy.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. O. Charlebois,\nBishop of Keeswatin,\nLe Pas, Man.\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that I made a trip to Cross Lake. Leaving here the morning of the 10th and returning the night of the 14th. I inspected the day school and the boarding school, had a talk with the Chief and Councilors relative to affairs on the reserve, saw Mrs Gaudia about destitute rations and sick Indians, visited a few sick for Mrs Gaudia and arranged with the traders to have their accounts in by the end of the month.\n\nConditions at the boarding school both as to the health of the pupils and their progress I found satisfactory. The four orphans who are under the school age were well clothed and looked well cared for and happy.\n\nAs was to be expected, the influenza has interfered considerably with attendance at the day school and the pupils attending do not look either will clothed or too well nourished. The teacher has done what she can to brighten up the room, but it is impossible to create a cheerful atmosphere where building and furniture is so dilapidated.\n\nThe chief tells me that the band has never been so hard up, the fur catch is about a third of an average year and there is no work of any sort to be had at present the potato crop was very poor. The fall catch of fish was good but is about exhausted and it will be about a month before the fish begin to come into the river, so it looks as if assistance will have to be continued to these people for some time yet. To date rations issued to the band will amount to about \u00a31500.00, and as far as I could see good care has been taken to see that the Department has not been imposed on, either by the Indians or the trader.\nThe Principal of the boarding school showed me the tables which they made for the children's dining room, a voucher for same is being forwarded by this mail. The tables are strongly built and ought to last for a considerable time. The top is of two inch plank covered by two inch cement and finished with a keen cement which resembles marble. While I think that there is value for the expense charged, I told the Principal that I thought if the estimate had been submitted before starting with the work it is probable that a cheaper table would have been approved.\n\nI am also forwarding a plan and estimate for an ice house for the boarding school. On receipt of letter 321295-5 dated January 4th, I forwarded a copy to the Principal of the Boarding School, he had not received it hence the delay in forwarding particulars as requested. I hope this delay will not result in delaying your order for proceeding with the work.\n\nAlso a plan and estimate for a day school at Cross Lake. While it calls for more than you may care to expend at this time, still I thought it would give you an idea of the cost of construction at that point. It is hardly likely that the Indians will continue to do any more work on the school this summer on a ration basis. The plan enclosed allows for cutting the logs now on the ground into boards. This can be done for about $5.00 per thousand feet.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary\nDept.

Scott,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPlease find enclosed copy of Cross Lake Indian Boarding School's Financial Statement for the year ending March 31st, 1918.\n\nThe deficit appears to be $3713.17, but I take the liberty to point out that the wages of the principal employees of the School, the Brothers, to the amount of $2850.00 though charged in the Expenditure, were not actually paid up and are cancelled in the Receipts' statement. If these wages are taken into consideration the Deficit would be brought up to $6563.17. Let me add also that the Principal of the School, Rev. Fr H. Boissin O.M.I., who is giving all his time and attention to his duties is not taking any salary. In my judgment he should do so as he is entitled to it and if such a course was followed I venture to say that the $3000.00 mark would be reached for the deficit.\n\nThis deficit has been paid by His Lordship Bishop O. Charlebois O.M.I. partly from money which he has obtained through begging (literally) and which was destined to the religious works of his poor Diocese, partly from charity gifts intended for his Indians, partly from money borrowed in order to meet up expenses.\n\nYou will readily understand that we are in a very serious position and consequently the present letter is an urgent appeal for help as we cannot bear the strain any longer and moreover as His Lordship is in need of the money he has so liberally advanced.\n\nLet me say that the Department seems to have a great deal in order to cope with the situation arising out of the present war circumstances in granting an additional per capita grant of $10.00, but I feel sorry to say that in the case of Cross Lake School this generous treatment has not been sufficient. The situation of the School and the difficulty of access are a cause of enormous expenses and even if the greatest of cares is taken supplies are lost or deteriorated in the different portages. Another consideration is that as yet there is no farm in connection with the School and everything is to be brought from Winnipeg or other places. The potato crop of last year was a total\nOn account of the cold and unhappily, the potatoes bought in Winnipeg in perfect condition reached the School in a rotten state. I do not mention flour and other commodities which are generally received in damaged condition totally independent of the shippers' care and attention. I may mention that the flour supply for the present year has reached Cross Lake in a very good state.\n\nWe have been obliged to buy oats from Winnipeg and last Winter from Le Pas. A few tons of hay were also sent from the latter place on horse trains from Mile 137, Hudson's Bay Railway, and the fanciful price paid may be easily guessed, as well as that of the meat which came from the same point.\n\nAnother source of expenses was the buying of Fish which is a necessity in those regions. Having been unable to secure nets the Principal was obliged to buy Fish from local fishermen and the price paid was quite an item in the expense column.\n\nI might add a few other considerations but I have taken already enough of your valuable time for this matter. However, I think that you are conversant enough with the facts to be in a sufficient position to take a generous course on behalf of Cross Lake School. I do not wish to point out the course to be followed but I would suggest the granting of a special bonus which would bring relief and permit us to continue the work which has been declared so satisfactory by the resident Agent.\n\nAs promised I will call at your Office about the 21st or 22nd and hope to be favored with good news about the present request.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJoseph\n\nfor Rt Rev. O. Charlebois O.M.I.\nand Rev. Fr H.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-1, part 1)\nUniversity of Ottawa,\n\nOttawa, Canada, February 9th, 1921\n\nMr. Alexander Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe undersigned, in the name of the Principal and Staff of Cross Lake Indian Boarding School wishes to draw your attention to the following facts and to their conclusion:\n\n1o-The School has become too small to accommodate the present pupils, specially the boys whose quarters (recreation rooms and dormitories) are threatened of congestion;\n\n2o-The numerous requests from all quarters for the admission of new pupils (on account of compulsory education) place the Administration in a rather difficult predicament;\n\n3o-A third class for smaller children is necessary but there is no place for it;\n\n4o-The Indian Agent, Mr. Taylor, has admitted the necessity of larger recreation rooms for the boys.\n\nTHEREFORE the School authorities submit to the Department the project of building an extension or annex to the School which would relieve the congestion and allow the admission of more children.\n\nThe said School authorities would be willing to look after the construction of the building and this to the satisfaction of the Department as past experience proves.\n\nThe same School authorities would undertake to supply lumber and stone from the immediate surroundings of the School at just the cost of labor.\n\nFinally the School authorities would respectfully\nask that immediate action be taken by the Department in order to facilitate logging operations. The difficulties of transportation is another point to be taken into consideration for a prompt decision in the matter.\n\nA proposed sketch for such extension is in possession of the undersigned who is ready to meet the architect of the Department for further explanations and details.\n\nIt may prove of interest to the Department to mention that the Agent, whose experience is well known, has lately declared that Cross Lake School is the best kept he has ever seen. Considering the many difficulties attending the upkeep and maintenance of this School this declaration has certainly a special importance.\n\nHoping that serious consideration will be given to this request and prompt and effective action taken in connection therewith, I remain\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJoseph [signature]\nFebruary 21st, 1921.\n\nDear Father Guy,\n\nI have your letter of the 9th, in which you make application on behalf of the principal and staff of the Cross Lake Indian boarding school for an extension to the Indian building. While I appreciate the work that is being done by the institution, I regret that at the present time owing to our lack of funds it is impossible for me to comply with their request. Their needs, however, will be kept in mind for consideration at a future date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Joseph Guy, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 26, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has decided to increase the pupilage at the Grass Lake Boarding School from 80 to 90 pupils and grant for this number will be paid from April 1, 1921. You will be good enough to advise the principal accordingly and, if necessary, you should give him every assistance in recruiting pupils up to the number for whom grant is allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

The hospital beds which we have in store will meet the requirements and to save freight I have decided to give them 15 beds from your stock. The Department will pay the freight as far as Selkirk and the school will be responsible for the charges from there on. These beds provided with mattresses, or at least with mattress covers should be shipped to Rev. Fr. A. Boissin, O.M.I., Indian Boarding School, Cross Lake, c/o Northern Fish Co., West Selkirk, Man.\n\nPlease advise me when shipment is made.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.,\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that on Dec. 2nd I inspected the Roman Catholic Boarding School (St. Joseph's) at Cross Lake.\n\nI found everything at the School in excellent order. All the rooms and halls were clean and well kept, the children were very clean, well clothed, and appeared very healthy. Some of the rooms are too small; in fact the accommodation at this School should be increased. The dormitories were in excellent order, but somewhat crowded. The air-space of the main dormitories, however, was nearly doubled by leaving open the trapdoors into the attics above. The boys' playroom is very much too small.\n\nThe work in the class rooms is excellent, that in the senior room unusually good for Indian children. The girls and boys were very alert and responsive, and the discipline unusually good. Both teachers are new members of the Staff since the Summer vacation.\n\nThe School grew sufficient vegetables for their own use in their garden, having had a good yield. They have horses, cows, pigs and chickens, thus producing a large part of their own food stuffs. They have built this year, a new log stable, which is very comfortable. Hay for stock is more easily procured at Cross Lake than at Norway House. Fish are also fairly plentiful.\n\nThe pupils here receive some instruction in the care of stock, handling of timber and freight, running of gasoline and steam engines, handling of boats, running a sawmill and planer, some weaving, sewing, and the ordinary domestic duties of the institution.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nIndian Agent.\n\nOttawa.\n\nForwarded Dec. 27th, 1921\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, January 3, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 10th ultimo, reporting on your recent inspection of the Cross Lake Indian Boarding School. I have noted your remarks that the accommodation at this school should be increased; that the school is in excellent condition; that the classroom work is excellent and that the school was able to produce a large part of its own foodstuffs.\n\nThe Department is pleased to learn that the pupils here receive instruction in the many domestic and industrial pursuits named by you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nWm. Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that on the 14th Inst. I made an inspection of Cross Lake Indian Boarding School. The whole building, from basement to garret was in excellent order and scrupulously clean. The day was cold, but the temperature within the building was warm and comfortable. As stated in former reports, the rooms are small for the number of children, and would ordinarily be considered overcrowded, but the ventilation system appears to work so well, that the atmosphere is fresh and sweet, even in the dormitories a short time after the children were out of them.\n\nThe diet of the children appears to be satisfactory as the average health is good. There are two or three cases of sickness, but the sick children are receiving excellent care.\n\nThe children are being taught many useful industries. All take part in keeping the dormitories, halls, etc., in spotless condition. Girls learn to cook, sew, wash iron, etc., very much as they will have to do it in their own homes later, without elaborate machinery. Both boys and girls learn to knit, mend, weave, make garments, etc. The boys learn some engineering, some electrical work, carpentry, little shoe-making, blacksmithing, caring for and handling of stock, gardening, handling of cattle, etc.\n\nIn the class room excellent work is being done, and real progress made. There is no grade above Grade 6, but this School was opened only a few years ago. The teachers here appear to have overcome the common difficulty in Indian schools everywhere, and the children speak and read distinctly, apparently with understanding, and sufficiently loud. Both are trained and experienced teachers. Writing, drawing and exercise books show great care, neatness and accuracy.\n\nThe grounds, stables and equipment are all well kept and in good condition.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Jan. 22, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 3A of the 18th ultimo, reporting on your recent inspection of the Cross Lake Indian Boarding School. The Department is pleased to learn that this institution is doing such excellent work and is being kept in such a splendid condition. Upon the occasion of your next communication with the Rev. Principal, you may convey to him the congratulations of this Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nWm. Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nReferring to the enclosed Return, it will be found that the number of pupils in this school has fallen below the number allowed.\n\nA number of reasons might be assigned for this, some of which are beyond the control of the Department, such as, \"The reaction from the first enthusiasm of the Indians for the new school,\" \"The discovery on the part of the Protestant parents that their children in this school are actually being educated as Roman Catholics,\" \"The Indians, having played the two churches against each other to the limit, find it no longer effective,\" \"The ill health of a number of the larger girls during the past year, with the death of some.\"\n\nThere is another reason which may be beyond the control of the Department, and which arises from the action of the Roman Catholic Church at Norway House, and which might be, at least, discouraged. There are a number of Roman Catholic families at Norway House. The Roman Catholic Mission here was practically closed for some years. This property is not on the Reserve. During the past year, a priest has been in charge, and a number of new buildings have been erected, and the old ones repaired. This summer a Brother has been added, also a Teacher and his wife. A school has been opened. Some children attend as day pupils, and some are boarders. For the latter, the parents pay a small sum per month for board. Some of the children are non-treaty, and some are Treaty. In my opinion, and I have already suggested this to the priest in charge, the Indian children who are residents at his school, should be candidates for the Cross Lake Boarding School, and he is competing with their own school. He assured me that he would accept pupils only for one year, after which he thought the parents would agree to send them to Cross Lake.\n\nIt is probable that the Department will be approached with a request to recognize this school at Norway House, and to make a grant toward its maintenance. Under the present circumstances, I would not recommend any assistance, unless as to a small day school, the larger proportion of the pupils of which are non-treaty.\n\nAs regards Cross Lake Boarding School, the Principal has suggested compulsion, but I do not think the time opportune for this, since the sickness and death of the large girls at the school has created a strong feeling among the Indians, and with a reason which is, to their minds, sound.\n\nI am merely forwarding this to the Department as information which should be in their hands, and am not suggesting that any action be taken at the present time.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 626c, file 577-1, part 1)\nOttawa, Oct. 27, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. IA of the 8th instant, reporting on the Gross Lake Indian Residential School. The Department learns, with regret, that the number of pupils at this institution has fallen below the pupilage allowed. You should give the school authorities every assistance in recruiting up to strength.\n\nYour report and recommendation, relative to the Roman Catholic activities at Norway House, have been noted.\n\nI have to thank you for this special report of yours.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nWm. Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that on Jan. 9th I made an inspection of St. Joseph's Indian Boarding School at Cross Lake, this Agency.\n\nIn the class rooms the work is of a high order. Good practical work is taught, and the teaching is excellent. Progress is shown from visit to visit, although at this visit the children did not appear to grasp their work as well as usual. This was probably due to the fact that my visit was on the third day of school after a couple of weeks absence from the class rooms during the Christmas holidays, and the children had not yet settled to regular routine work.\n\nThe health of the children is very good, and is improving. Since my last visit, the children all had measles, but with two or three exceptions, no bad after effects have developed. As the weather was cold, the girls were not playing outside at the time of my visit, but the boys were spending a fair proportion of their time in the open air.\n\nThe children were well clothed, and apparently well fed. The school building was spotless and in perfect order. The outbuildings were well kept. Only one is in milk, but quite a number of eggs were being gathered daily from the large number of hens. A good supply of potatoes and other vegetables were grown in the school garden last season. Beef is being secured from The Pas at a reasonable price, although the freight almost equals the original price. There is a good supply of fish on hand.\n\nThe Government property here is well cared for. I find that one division of the septic tank has fallen in. This will require replacement in the early summer.\n\nThe new addition has been walled in two stories above the basement, and is a good wall. A part of the flooring has also been done. This addition, when completed, will make the accommodations very much better, allowing more room. In my opinion, this school has been overcrowded, as the dormitories and classrooms are too small for the number of pupils allowed. The ventilation system appears to work perfectly, as I have not at any time been able to detect any taint in the air, although the rooms have been too full of pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 7th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th ultimo, reporting on your inspection of the Cross Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased to note that conditions generally at this school are in such splendid order. We note that the classroom work is of high order, the health of the children good and that they are well clothed and fed, also that all Government property is well cared for.\n\nIt is further noted, however, that there is only one milch cow to supply the milk requirements of the school. As milk should be one of the staple articles of diet, especially of the younger children, I shall be pleased if you will draw to the attention of the Principal the necessity of providing more milch cows at the school. It is hoped that as soon as weather conditions permit in the spring he will arrange to obtain a sufficient number of milch cows to provide an ample supply of milk for the daily needs of the pupils. Kindly draw this matter to his attention, and inform the Department at a later date as to what action has been taken to obtain a further number of milch cows at the school.\n\nYour report concerning the work that has been performed in the erection of the new addition has been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter No.123-1-1, dated February 7th last, re my report on the Inspection of Cross Lake Indian Boarding School, would say that I find a clerical error in that Report. I omitted the word \"one\" in stating the number of cows in milk. The statement should have been, \"Only one cow is in milk.\" The School has five cows, but at the time one only was being milked.\n\nI may say that it was the intention of one of the staff to go out for more cows last fall, but pressure of work on the new building prevented. By summer there should be five cows in milk, and it is the intention to secure more as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Asst.

He has written a rather helpful report concerning the work at Cross Lake. He strongly recommends that a change be made in the primary room, as the Sister at present in charge is not qualified to teach beginners properly. Would it be possible to obtain a normal trained teacher for this important classroom? I should be grateful if you would see that the Mother Provincial of the Order is approached with the request that a change be made.\n\nMay I point out that the classroom register should be marked regularly, morning and afternoon, so that there will be an accurate record concerning the attendance in the classroom. The Inspector reports that the institution is a satisfactory civilizing and evangelizing agency, and I am making the request regarding a change in the primary room so that the school's academic efficiency will be increased. Please let me know when it is possible to make the change.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy Secretary.\n\nRev. G. E.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nSir:\n\nOn Monday, Sept. 17th, the staff and pupils of St. Joseph's Indian Residential School, Cross Lake, held a picnic about a mile from the school, across the bay to the east. One of the smaller boys, Albert Dorion, of Berens River, a lad about twelve years of age, got separated from the other boys while chasing squirrels in the woods. His absence was not noted among the crowd until the boys were getting aboard the boat to return to the school. A search was at once made by the Principal, the members of the staff and some of the larger boys. Tracks could be found in places, but owing to the nature of the country, and some bush, these could not be followed closely.\n\nA continuous search was kept up, the Indian men from the reserve joining in, there being about forty men searching. The school bell and mill whistle were sounded at intervals. Food, clothing and notes were placed in the woods where it was thought the boy might find them, with messages giving instructions to the boy as to what to do should he find any of these.\n\nOn Friday morning a letter from the Principal reached me at Norway House. I at once notified the R.C.M.P. Police, and asked their assistance. I also requested the Royal Canadian Air Force to make a flight over the area near the place where the boy was lost, in the hope that the observer might be able to pick out the boy if along the shores of the waters, or in open muskeg.\n\nA moth plane, with Flight Sergt. Winny and mechanic McKenzie as observer, left Norway House about 12.30 of Friday noon. On the way to Cross Lake, when nearing the latter, a close lookout was kept along the shores. When flying over the North East shore of Pipestone Lake, a white spot was observed on the rocks. On circling round and flying at a lower altitude, this spot became active, and the lost boy got up and waved his arms. He had been asleep until awakened by the noise of the engines.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nThe boy had left his coat behind at the boat when going to chase squirrels; his trousers were torn to pieces scrambling through the bushes, and when found, his clothing was of very little use for warmth. The weather had been cold, and the season being late, there was little to be found in the way of fruits in the woods. He stated that a bear had chased him and that he was tired. At this season of the year he would have perished very soon. He had no matches.\n\nWhen found, the boy was taken in the plane, direct to the school. He appeared to be little the worse for his experience, of four days in the woods, but he was glad to get back, and he was certainly hungry.\n\nI feel that we should be deeply grateful to the Royal Canadian Air Force for the prompt and efficient assistance rendered. The place where the boy was found was at a considerable distance from the canoe route, and as there are numerous islands in the lake, and the boy did not know the country, he might have again wandered back into the bush, and been lost long enough to perish. Flying Officer Davy, in charge of the station at Norway House, is to be commended for his readiness to co-operate, and the promptness with which he sent out the plane for the search.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nWm. Gordon,\nIndian Agent.\nOctober 4, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Gordon:\n\nMy attention has been drawn to your letter of the 22nd ultimo, concerning the search for Albert Dorion, 12 year old pupil of the Cross Lake Indian Residential School. I am very pleased to learn that this boy was found, and I should be grateful if you would convey the Department's warmest thanks to the commandant of the Royal Canadian Air Force station for his prompt assistance. You should also thank the officers who located the boy. This pupil would have had but small chance without the splendid assistance of the fliers.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nWm. Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nBoy Is Found by Airmen After a 60 Mile Walk\n\nTwelve-year-old Indian Lad Had Strayed from Schoolhouse in Northern Manitoba.\n\nLost for five days in the densely timbered wilderness surrounding the St. Joseph's Roman Catholic mission school on Lake Manitoba, a twelve-year-old Indian boy who had walked over sixty miles in an endeavor to find his way home again was found by two Royal Canadian Air Force fliers forty minutes after the order was issued for an aerial search, according to a report just sent in to headquarters.\n\nThe boy strayed from the school into the bush and failed to show up again. He lay motionless on the ground hunted frantically for food, he getting farther and farther away from home, struggled through the thick underbrush, tearing his clothing to ribbons and scratching his flesh as it came in contact with thorns and sappings which covered his path. Without food the lad was forced to subsist on what he could find as he strove to regain his home. Wild berries, roots and bark were his daily fare until the fifth day when he was found sleeping on a rocky point jutting from the shores of Cross Lake.\n\nAfter it became fairly certain that the ground parties would not find him until it was too late, the principal of the school, Rev. Father G. L. Trudelle, O.M.I., requested the Air Force to aid in the search. The order was accordingly issued from the Winnipeg air station to the sub-station at Norway House, asking that an aerial search be started at once.\n\nFlight Sergt. H. J. Winny was immediately despatched in a De Havilland \"Moonee\" plane with Corporal J. C. MacKenzie as observer. The two men flew low from Lake Manitoba to Pipestone Lake and from there through Cross Lake. Over Cross Lake they saw two small white objects on a rocky point. At first they thought they were merely outcroppings of stone. They flew lower still and circled to investigate. One of the objects moved, stood up and moved frantically at them. They came down very close in to the rock and found the object of their quest sitting on the rock waiting for them, many miles from the nearest ground party.\n\nHe was almost naked, and had been asleep in the sun with the tattered remains of his shirt spread out on the rock beside him. At first he had refused them but as they circled low the noise of the engine had roused him from his slumber. He was hungry and tired, while his feet were torn and scratched from his long struggle through the bush, but he appeared to be quite strong and perfectly rational despite his condition.\n\nAsked if he was afraid to fly home, he beamed and said \"No.\" Ten minutes after landing the fliers started back to the school with the exhausted lad sitting on the knees of the observer in the front seat of the little plane.\n\nThree hours after the aerial search had commenced the boy was in bed having the first comfortable sleep he had had in five days.\n\nLocal officials say it seems that the report on this operation constitutes the finest story of a successful and speedily terminated flying search which they have encountered. They were all inclined to praise the youngster for his presence of mind in getting out on a point where he was conscious rather than staying in the bushes where they had done.\n\nThe whole operation took three hours. The boy was found in forty minutes, and the total flying time of the party was one hour and fifty minutes.\nOttawa, February 26, 1930.\n\nW.

Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nJust a few lines to let you know what the situation is regarding the Crosse Lake disaster. I first heard of this on the C. P. R. train on my way down to Portage La Prairie and immediately got in touch with The Pas and found that Bishop Charebois had left a few hours before for Crosse Lake by plane. I left word that I should be called up as soon as the plane returned and on the same evening I received a message saying that the plane had returned after leaving the Bishop at Crosse Lake, bringing back five of the sisters, two of them very seriously injured. One with a broken back and the other with a broken leg. I was unable, however, to get any information as to what was actually required in the way of food and clothing till the Bishop returned the next day and on Friday evening he called me up on the phone and was able to give me the ages of the eighty children and I proceeded at once to secure complete outfits of clothing. I spent all day Saturday doing this and it was necessary to send the large consignment forward by express in order to make connection with the freight train going North from the Pas on Tuesday morning and if connection are made I hope that this clothing and blankets will be in the hands of the Principal of the school by Thursday. On Friday I wired Agent Gordon at Norway House and found that he had left for the scene of the disaster. He has since returned and informs me that eleven children and one sister had perished, that the school was completely gutted, that the police are attempting to recover the bodies, that the other children were well with the exception of minor frost bites, that the food supplies were safe, that the staff and children were occupying the traders house and that some of the others are back on the reserves and that some of those that are\nliving at a distance can be sent home as soon as the clothing arrives. He makes some suggestions regarding the fitting up of the old mission buildings in order to carry on the work; however, this is a matter that can be taken up later by correspondence. I believe everything possible has been done to make matters as easy as possible for the sufferers and I will be only too glad to carry out any instructions which you wish to give promptly. I may say that I sent forward a very complete outfit for the children. I understand that two of the sisters who were seriously injured are now in the St. Boniface Hospital and that one of them is very low.\n\nGordon suggests that Norway House children return home also the Island Lake and Gods Lake children be placed at the Roman Catholic Mission. He also suggests that the Nelson House and La Pas children be sent to Sturgeon Landing school. He also recommends the discharge of several of the older children. He will write a full report to you which will be received in due course. They have been unable to ascertain the cause of the fire.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. M. Graham.\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nIt was with deep regret I read the press report last night to the effect that the Cross Lake School has been gutted by fire and that a Sister and 8 children have lost their lives in the flames, how sad!\n\nI am writing Bishop Charlebois a few words of sympathy. Be sure that you sympathise also with Mr. Ferrier and the other members of the Department as well as with the Indians in this great disaster.\n\nYours sincerely,\nArthur Banner\nLa trag\u00e9die de Cross Lake, Manitoba\n\n46 fillettes et 48 gar\u00e7ons ont \u00e9chapp\u00e9 aux flammes, mais 5 religieuses sont bless\u00e9es.\n\nA 150 milles au nord de Le Pas\n\n(Du correspondant de la \"Presse\" \u00e0 Le Pas, Manitoba)\n\nTOUT reposait paisiblement mardi soir dernier dans le pensionnat de Cross Lake, situ\u00e9 \u00e0 150 milles au nord-est de Le Pas, dans les solitudes glaciales du Manitoba septentrional. \u00c0 deux heures du matin, le fr\u00e8re Lambert, gardien de nuit, fit sa ronde et ne remarqua rien de suspect. \u00c0 cette heure, la R\u00e9v. Soeur sup\u00e9rieure Marguerite-Marie s'appr\u00eatait \u00e0 se coucher apr\u00e8s une veilleuse des flammes. L'incendie s'\u00e9tait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 probablement dans le pensionnat. La lumi\u00e8re de la lampe religieuse se leva, alla r\u00e9veiller les jeunes filles au d\u00e9but du troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tage et les religieuses. Les jeunes filles sortirent en bon ordre, les plus grandes portant une ou deux de leurs camarades dans l'espoir de sauver les autres.\n\nLutte dans les t\u00e9n\u00e8bres\n\nPresque aussit\u00f4t les lumi\u00e8res s'\u00e9teignirent.

Soeur Marie-des-Anges, qui accompagnait les enfants \u00e0 la sortie, s'aper\u00e7ut qu'il manquait encore un troisi\u00e8me enfant, elle ne savait pas o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait. Elle ne put pas sauver sa vie qu'elle se jetait du troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tage dans l'incendie ravageant le b\u00e2timent. Le feu avait atteint le troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tage avant que l'incendie ne soit ma\u00eetris\u00e9.\n\nLe feu devint terrible\n\nLes petits gar\u00e7ons racontent que Soeur Marie-des-Anges, se conduisant comme de petits hommes, les aident \u00e0 enlever les religieuses en criant : \"Voulez-vous que nous allions sauver les petites filles ?

Laviolette, pour sauver les enfants, chercha \u00e0 \u00e9teindre l'incendie. \u00c0 ce stade, il voulut se jeter dans les flammes mais trois religieuses du couvent le retinrent. En effet, il y avait encore dans l'institution les fr\u00e8res Charles, Antoine, Lambert, Dumas et deux autres qui \u00e9taient pr\u00eats \u00e0 faire la cha\u00eene pour combattre l'incendie, car Taguacoeuf \u00e9tait isol\u00e9.\n\nUn sacrifice h\u00e9ro\u00efque\n\nL'h\u00e9ro\u00efque soeur sup\u00e9rieure Marguerite-Marie romanta \u00e0 trois religieuses qui, apr\u00e8s que des \u00e9l\u00e8ves manquaient et disparurent \u00e0 jamais.

At three o'clock, the Rev. Sister Superior Marguerite Marie woke up and saw some smoke and heard the crackling of the flames. The fire had evidently started in the cellar. She instantly got up and woke the young girls in the dormitory on the third floor; the young girls walked out in good order, some of the oldest carrying the youngest.\n\nAlmost immediately, the lights went out. The flames having reached the electric wires, in the dark, the sisters sought to save the children. Sister Mary of the Angels was counting the children as they passed out, and found there were several missing; she went up to the third floor against the smoke and flames. She saved her life by jumping from the third story into the snow; several other sisters had to jump from the third story which had almost been reached by the flames.\n\nSister Superior Marguerite Marie, noticing that some children were missing, went back into the burning building where she finished with ten children. These are the names of the dead:\n\nSister Superior Marguerite Marie (see Report to Bishop)\n\nCharlotte Mercier, 12 years \u2014\nHylda Moore, 11 years \u2014\nNancy Scott, 11 years \u2014\nMartha Scott, 9 years \u2014\nAda Craig, 8 years \u2014\nAnn Crane, 8 years \u2014\nClementine Cook, 7 years \u2014\nChristie Ross, 7 years\na young girl, unidentified\n& boy, Emile Demar, 7 years\nThe retreat of the sisters superior and these ten children was cut off by a rush of flames. 46 young girls and 48 young boys escaped.\nSeveral of the Sisters were hurt during the fire. Sister Jeanne de Chantal had her vertebral column broken. Sister St. Agathe had her ankle broken. Sister Marie des Anges had her feet frozen; they are at present at St. Antoine Hospital at the Pas, under the care of Doctor Stevenson and Dr. Lucien Roch, the latter being newly arrived from Montreal.\nAll those who were saved had to run away in whatever clothes they had and many suffered from exposure. They were borrowed blankets from the neighbouring Sioux Reserve.\nThe children who perished belonged to families from Grass Lake and Norway House.\nThe losses are estimated to be over $25,000.\nThe representatives of the Chiefs of Indian Affairs Mr. Graham of Regina and Mr. Reddel of Was offered their help to Bishop Charboni.\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to:\n\n-2-\n\nSome time stop. At midnight on 24th, and at 2 a.m. on morning of fire Catholic Brothers Antoine made tour of inspection of building and found everything satisfactory stop.

I had a telephone conversation with Bishop Charlebois on Thursday last, and told him you were anxious that everything possible should be done to make matters easier for them. I advised him that I had purchased a large supply of clothing, including mocassins, caps, underwear, and suits for boys and girls, which was forwarded on the last instant, and of course has reached its destination long before this. I practised as much economy as I possibly could, but still the account will naturally run into a lot of money. These bills will be forwarded to the Department in due course.\n\nI gathered from the Bishop's conversation that there was nothing more could be done by the Department at present.\n\nThe minute word was received at The Pas that the school was burned, the Indian Agent wired here for authority to have a plane go north, which authority of course was given, and he writes to say that the use of the plane was of great benefit and that he considers it was the means of saving the lives of two of the Sisters who were seriously injured.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIndian Agent Gordon is making a full report on the matter, if he has not already done so.\n\nMy letter to you dated the 3rd. instant, contained all the information I had up to that date, and there has not been very much since.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nDauphin, March 8th, 1930.\n\nMr. A. Macdonald,\nDeputy Fire Commissioner,\n332 Parliament Buildings,\nWinnipeg.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAccording to your instructions I left Dauphin for The Pas on March the 1st, to make an investigation into the Cross Lake Mission School Fire.\n\nI spent most of the day of March the 2nd, making arrangements for transportation and finally arrangements were made with the Western Canada Airways for a plane to go to Cross Lake on the 3rd of March.\n\nI left The Pas on March the 3rd and proceeded to Cross Lake accompanied by Constable Peach and Dr. Shanks (Coroner).\n\nBefore going to Cross Lake on the morning of March 3rd I went to interview Bishop Charlebois at The Pas but found that he had gone to Winnipeg the evening of March the second.\n\nI next interviewed Sister St. Agatha, who is in the St. Antony Hospital at The Pas, suffering from a broken leg and shock. I also interviewed Sister St. Marie de Anges who is suffering from a frozen foot caused from standing on the platform of the fire escape while she directed the children down the fire escape.\n\nThe other three sisters who came to The Pas with the above named Sisters are now in Winnipeg at the St. Boniface Hospital where one of them is suffering from a fractured spine.\n\nAfter talking to Sisters Maire des Anges and Sister St. Agatha, for a short time, I came to the conclusion that to understand their stories properly it would be necessary to see the buildings and the lay-out.\n\nI then returned to the Police Office where I was informed that the plane was ready and we left shortly for Cross Lake.\n\nThat evening I made a plan of the building drawing a separate sketch of each floor, and I have written in where all persons were sleeping. I consider the plan of the building with the explanations thereon will give a clearer idea of what occurred than any written explanation could.\n\nAs it took considerable time to make the plan of the building, Dr. Shanks and Constable Peach went on with their investigation while I was getting the lay-out of the building.\n\nOn the following morning I interviewed the Principal, Father Trudeau, and his assistants, also the sisters that Constable Peach had interviewed the night before. They told me the same story they had told Constable Peach.\nI next proceeded to make a thorough inspection of the ruins, accompanied by Dr. Shanks and Constable Pesch.\n\nWe found that the building was completely gutted but all evidence pointed to the fire having burned more fiercely in the old part of the building. The white wall plaster in the basement of the new wing and in the basement of the chapel is still adhering to the stone walls, but in the basement of the old building it is completely destroyed. Also the evidence of Father Trudeau points to this fact, and I have set forth his views as to where the fire was burning most fiercely when he saw it, on the plan of the basement.\n\nBrother Antony Bealweg who was doing janitor duty the night of the fire, had left for the railroad before we arrived and we were unable to interview him.\n\nHe will arrive in the Pas on March the 8th when Inspector Day will have him interviewed and will forward a copy of his statement to me.\n\nBrother Dumaine, an old man who was sleeping in the big boy's dormitory, had also left before we arrived and we were unable to interview him. He had left for Norway House with Sgt. Saul and the Indian Agent, Mr. Gordon.\n\nIn making my inspection of the ruins, I found the heating boilers intact, their furnace doors were still closed, and from our inquiries we could not find anything of a dangerous combustible nature that had been stored in the basement.\n\nThe story of the disaster seems to be about as follows:\n\nThe sisters and the pupils retired about ten o'clock the night of February 23rd., and Father Trudeau had gone around the basement between eleven and twelve o'clock that night and everything was all right at that time.\n\nInquiries brought out the fact that Brother Bealweg was supposed to have gone to look after the fires about 2 p.m., and there was no sign of fire then, and just before 3 p.m., the basement and ground floor of the old part of the building was found to be all in flames with flames coming up stairways to the second floor.\n\nWhen we consider that the old building itself is 110 feet long we get some idea of how rapidly the flames must have spread in less than one hour from the time they could have started, and the theory that the fire started from the electric wiring does not appear feasible to me as the wiring was all open wiring of the knob and tube type. This view is also held by Constable Pesch and Dr. Shanks.\n\nSister St. Angus who was the first to awaken on the second floor, by the smell of smoke (and as she described it) a roaring noise below her. She was sleeping in a double room with four other sisters and after awakening them she ran across the hall to the Sister Superior's room to awaken her but Sister Superior was already\nawake and met her at the door. Sister Superior told Sister Angus to go and awaken the Priest and Brothers for help and that she would go up to the girls dormitory and awaken them. The last Sister Angus saw of Sister Superior was when she entered the stairs leading to the girls dormitory on the third floor. She was never seen to have reached the girls dormitory but is supposed to have died in the stairway.\n\nSister Angus on Sister Superior's instructions tried to descend to the ground floor at the east end of the building to awaken the Priest and brothers but was unable to do so owing to the smoke and flames coming up the stairway.\n\nAs can be seen from the plan of the second storey there is no doorway leading from the second storey of the old building to the second storey of the new wing where the priest and brothers were sleeping. The only way that Sister Angus could get to their rooms was to descend to the ground floor or to ascend to the third floor.\n\nReturning along the hallway she picked up the little four year old child that was sleeping in the Sister Superior's room and being unable to descend either stairways she went through the girl's infirmary to front balcony where she found a heavy comforter which she threw on the ground and endeavored to throw the little child on to it. On account of the darkness and the distance she was unable to do so and the child landed into the snow bank uninjured. Sister Angus was later rescued from this balcony by Father Trudeau and one of the brothers who caught her in a blanket when she jumped from the balcony.\n\nAs evidence to show how far the fire advanced when it was discovered and how fast it was spreading, the four sisters who Sister Angus awakened before leaving her room did not have time to get out of their rooms, and into the room known as the sister's living room where the fire escape was, they had to jump out of their rooms' windows and this is where Sister Jeanne de Chantel had her back fractured.\n\nIn the boy's and girl's dormitory on the third floor there is a solid wall dividing the boys room from the girl's room. Leading from the girl's dormitory is a stairway at the west end, and the only other means of exit is sliding type fire escape and all the children that were saved came down these fire escapes.\n\nIn the boy's dormitory there were two stairways and two fire escapes.\n\nThere being only one fire escape in the girl's dormitory and this coupled with the fact that the fire was mostly in the old building at the start, accounts for the heavy fatalities amongst the girl pupils.\n\nBoth the sisters in the boys and girls dormitories were awakened by the smoke and they had no means of knowing who awakened\nFirst.\n\nWhen the sisters awoke they could not get any light in the small boy's and girl's dormitory (see plan). This would indicate that the light circuit was broken in the old building although there was light in the dormitories in the new building for about five minutes after they awakened.\n\nAs to the cause of the fire the theory has been advanced that it may have been caused from the electric wiring; I cannot agree with this although I cannot disapprove it. Also Brother Coulter who is general repair man and engineer is not satisfied that this is the cause, he was away the night the fire occurred and of course cannot give his impression of the fire.\n\nFrom the rapidity that the fire gained headway it would appear to me that the fire may have been caused by spontaneous combustion, as it is quite evident that the fire did not smoulder any great length of time as an electrical fire would do.\n\nHowever, I can find no direct evidence to support the theory of spontaneous combustion, and doubtless the actual cause of the fire will remain a mystery.\n\nThe Coroner, Dr. Shanks, after making his investigation considered an inquest unnecessary, and therefore, issued Coroner's warrant for the burial of the remains.\n\nAfter making my investigation I could not help coming to the conclusion that if the building had been equipped with proper stair fire escapes, and an adequate means of giving an alarm in case of fire, that could be turned in from any floor in the building, there would have been very little, if any, loss of life.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that the system of fire escapes used certainly slowed down the work of clearing the building, and as Sister Marie de Anges testified to the fact that she had to stand at the head of the escape and almost force the small girls down as they did not wish to descend the cold iron pipe with only their night clothes, and it was in directing the children at the head of the escape that the Sister froze her feet.\n\nI consider the task that the sisters sleeping in the dormitories accomplished in the dark by getting as many of their charges out as they did little short of miraculous.\n\nI feel that I should make the following recommendations in regard to Mission Schools:\n\n1. That the Dominion Indian Department should have all their Mission Schools inspected by some competent inspector.\n\n2. That all schools be equipped with outside fire escapes (steel, if possible).\n\n3. That adequate means for giving alarm in case of fire be\ninstalled, and be so connected that alarm could be rung from each storey; and in the case of a large school like the Grass Lake School, the alarm should be so arranged that it could be turned in from three or four places on each floor.\n\nWith this report I am forwarding you pictures of the Grass Lake School before the fire and pictures of the ruins as they are now standing, also the plans I have made of the building, and Constable Touch's report.\n\nAbout thirty-five of the pupils and part of the staff are now housed in a six room house and the rest of the pupils are stationed with Indian families around the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"J.

I may say, in reply, that the Department realizes its responsibility at these institutions, even when they have been erected by one or other of the churches, and has bent every energy towards minimizing the danger of loss of life by fire. Within the past year or two, thousands of dollars have been expended on fire escapes, extinguishers and water supply systems. Time and again, all principals have been ordered to have regular fire drill.\n\nThe Department is satisfied that outside steel fire escapes are necessary and that alarm systems should be provided. These have been, and are being, installed. Further, commencing with last year, only fireproof construction has been specified for new buildings. The Department is constantly renewing its regulations and emphasis is placed on the prevention of fire. I am glad to have your suggestions in this important matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr Scott:\n\nPlease accept my thanks for your telegram of February 26th, in connection with the disaster at Cross Lake. When I came back from Cross Lake on February 28th, I at once telephoned full particulars to Mr Wm. M. Graham, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, who was at Winnipeg at the time, and he informed me that he would at once telegraph to you. Mr Graham was good enough to order a supply of the most necessary articles of clothing which should arrive here to-morrow or Tuesday morning. He also authorized us to purchase locally the most necessary kitchen utensils and a few tools which are being sent forward to Cross Lake at the earliest possible moment.\n\nSister Jeanne de Chantal, who suffered a broken spine, has been sent to Winnipeg and we have received word that she made a fairly good journey considering her condition. There is one sister here suffering from a broken leg and another with frozen feet. Two-thirds of the children who escaped are now with their parents, and the remainder are with neighbours at Cross Lake under the care.\nof Father Trudeau and the four sisters who remain.\n\nOn leaving Cross Lake I advised against pouring any water on the smouldering ruins as it would serve no good purpose, and freezing, would render the recovery of any of the remains more difficult.\n\nThanking you again for your sympathy,\n\nI am,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n+Q. Charlesbois\n\nBishop of Keewatin.\nMarch 12, 1930.\n\nDear Bishop Charlebois,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant. We have been greatly disturbed by the holocaust at Cross Lake, and it makes me extremely anxious about all our schools. I think that we have done all that we can under the circumstances, and we will continue to be well informed as to the conditions. I trust these devoted Sisters who were so severely injured are on the way to recovery. It has been a terrible trial for them.

G.H. Trudeau, principal of St. Joseph's Indian Residential School at that point. This letter informed me that the school had been burned that morning, with the loss of several lives, and all clothing and bedding, etc. The letter was written at 5 A.M. and stated that the fire had been discovered at 3 A.M. and that it was practically over.\n\nI immediately sent word to my driver, arranged for an extra dog team and driver, secured rations, etc., also some clothing from the Norway House Residential school, a little from the Hospital and private persons, arranged for these to be taken back by the man who had brought the letter, and sent off messages to the Deputy Superintendent, the Indian Commissioner and Inspector John R. Bunn.\n\nThe next morning the Doctor and myself left for Cross Lake, and despite the fact that the roads were very bad, reached Cross Lake that evening, late. We found that Bishop Charlebois had come in by plane during the day, had sent the injured sisters and three others out by plane, had made out a list of clothing required, and was taking this back to the Pas.\n\nThe deaths in the fire accounted for the Sister MM Superior of the school, Marguerite Marie, eleven girl pupils and one boy. These were as follows:\n\n- No. 97. Emile Dumas, Nelson House.\n- 084. Mary Ann Francois, Nelson House.\n- 087. Clemence Cook, Cross Lake.\n- 097. Martha Scott, Cross Lake.\n- 099. Nancy Flett, Thicket Portage, or Split Lake.\n- 0100. Charlotte Mercredi, Thicket Portage.\n- 0106. Hyla Moose, Nelson House.\n- 0108. Agnes Thomas, Cross Lake.\n- 0109. Nora Blacksmith, Cross Lake.\n- 0111. Christie Ross, Cross Lake.\n- 0112. Hyla Crair, Cross Lake.\n- 0114. Annie Crane, Norway House.\n\nThe pupils had escaped with only their night clothes. The boys were a little better off than the girls, as they had more time in which to leave the building. None of the children saved were injured, except for one minor burn, and some frost bitten feet. After leaving the building, the children were hurried to the stable, and were later distributed among all available houses near by and on the reserve. The staff, with some of the children took up quarters in the unoccupied house of a trader.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe majority of the pupils from Norway House came home as soon as clothing could be found for them. Two boys, No. 93, from Island Lake, and No. 100, from Gods Lake, who are affected with T.B., are at the hospital. Some twelve boys, belonging to Island and Gods Lakes are at the R.C.Mission at Norway House, where they are being accommodated, fed and taught in classroom at the day school. I recommended that eleven children, from Nelson House, Cumberland House, The Pas, Berens River, and Thicket Portage, be transferred to the school at Sturgeon Landing. I also recommended the discharge of some twelve children, who are nearly of discharge age, or who are not likely to make good at school.\n\nThe majority of the Cross Lake children have been in their homes. The school has been issuing rations to the school children, as at this season the food supplies of the Indians are short. As soon as possible a day school will be opened for the Cross Lake children, the majority of whom can sleep at home, but be fed at the school. The food supplies were for the most part outside of the main building, and consequently were not lost in the fire.\n\nThese arrangements were made, but of course are subject to the approval of the Department. For the children at Norway House Mission, I would suggest that the grant be paid to the Principal of St. Joseph's school, and he can then settle with the Mission.\n\nI made inquiries as to the cause of the fire, but without satisfactory results. The most probable causes would be as follows:\n\n1. The heating plant. This I consider may be eliminated, as the plant was in the basement of the new wing, and the fire first reached the upstairs somewhere near the opposite end of the main building. The brother also stated that he put the fire in at 2 A.M., and at 3 A.M. the fire was well advanced, when the inmates were awakened by the smoke.\n\n2. The kitchen range. This was on a cement floor, was a good distance from the wall, the smoke pipes had been cleaned about two weeks before, and were in good condition. The sister in charge of the kitchen left the kitchen at about 10 P.M., and stated that the fire in the range was then almost extinct. One of the sisters who was injured in dropping from a window, fell on the snow outside of the kitchen windows, and she stated that there were no flames visible in the kitchen at that time, and the fire was well advanced when she escaped from the window.\n\n3. The gasoline and lighting plant and bake oven. These were in the basement of the chapel, which formed a wing, and which was the last to burn.\n\n4. Cigarette stubs in the recreation room downstairs. Some of the men from the reserve spent the evening in this room, but I understood that the brother who attended the fire at 2 A.M. passed through this room on his way to the stairway which led to the corridor on the first floor, on his way to the chapel. Since he noticed no smoke in this room at 2 A.M., the fire could not have originated here.\n5. Electric wiring\u2014This is possible. The wiring was done some fifteen years ago. It was not in conduit, and I am told that in some places the wires passed through wooden beams without porcelain tubing. In such a case the fire would not start in the basement, but between floors and ceilings, or in partitions, and might be well under way before even smoke would be noticeable. The lights were off throughout the building almost immediately the fire was discovered.\n\n6. Incendiarism. While this is possible, I think it very improbable. I can think of no one who would have any cause or desire to burn these buildings.\n\nWhile it was unfortunate that the water system was out of commission because of freezing up of intake, which was due to very low water this season, I do not think the fire could have been checked even with plenty of water. The fire was so far advanced when discovered that there was little time for all to escape from the building, even though the doors from the dormitories opened directly upon the fire escapes. The stairways were impassible, owing to smoke and flames. Fire extinguishers were in convenient places, but were useless, owing to the advanced progress of the fire. From what I can learn, there was no panic in the dormitories. There was a monitor sleeping in a small room in the corner of each. The doors to the fire escapes were opened, the older children had been taught that each one should be responsible for the safety of a certain smaller child, and the children proceeded in orderly fashion. Those who were burned must have been dazed with sleep and smoke, and in the darkness were not observed. The girls' dormitory was a large room with about fifty beds; the fire escape was at one corner. In the darkness and smoke it would be an easy matter to become confused and lost.\n\nI understand that the Sister Superior who lost her life went back in an effort to get the other girls out. The Principal attempted to reenter the building, but was prevented by the men about him. The sisters who jumped from the windows and the balcony could not get along the corridors to the fire escapes.\n\nThe remains recovered by the men, under the direction of the R.C.M. Police, were for the most part merely ashes.\n\nThe stone walls are standing, and to the casual observer or the layman appear to be damaged very little. Whether they would be safe for another building, with, of course, some repairs, I am unable to say.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 5, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your I A of the 10th ultimo, reporting on the fire at the Cross Lake Indian Residential School. The Department is pleased that you took immediate steps to do what was possible after this most unfortunate loss. Under separate cover, you have been written regarding the disposition of some of the pupils. The scheme of carrying on a day school at Cross Lake is approved. Concerning the current expenses at the Norway House R. C.

MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nWm. Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nREPORT.\n\nRe: Roman Catholic Boarding School, Cross Lake, Man.\n\u2014 Loss of, by fire.\n\nFirst Report:\nOn the evening of the 25th ult., word was received at Norway House that the Roman Catholic Indian Boarding School at Cross Lake had been burned to the ground at 3 a.m. that morning and that one Sister & several children had been burnt to death.\nOn the following morning I left for Cross Lake by dog team to investigate. Indian Agent Mr. Gordon & Dr. Turpel of the Indian Dept. Also left for Cross Lake the same morning.\nUpon arrival at Cross Lake at 8:30 a.m. on the morning of the 27th ult., I found the Cross Lake School as reported, entirely gutted; there being nothing but the stone walls standing. The debris within the walls was still a smouldering mass and nothing could be done there. Inquiries were made from those in charge of the School, resident children and people living at Cross Lake with a view to ascertaining as near as possible the origin of the fire.\nIt appears that at about 10 minutes to three on the morning of the 25th ult., residents in the school were awakened by the smell of smoke, which was quite dense, which appeared to emanate from the basement in the most central part of the building, the upper portion of which was occupied by the girl boarders. The bell alarm was sounded but by the time the children were properly aroused, exit by stairs was cut off by the flames & smoke & residents had to make their exits by the fire escapes. The rapidity with which the fire made headway, due partly to the north wind, is shown by the fact that scarcely anything was saved, most of the girls & Sisters getting out of the building in their night attire. The priests & boys mostly managed to get their clothes swing to the fact that their section of the building burned later. Under the circumstances considerable presence of mind & coolness must have been displayed by those in charge, the Sisters particularly, in the orderly way in which they herded their charges to the firescapes through the darkness and dense smoke. The Sister Superior, Margaret Marie gave her life in her efforts to make sure that all the children were safe; despite this fact twelve children smile Dumas, Mary Ann Francis, Ilia Moose, Clemence Cook, Martha Scott, Agnes Thomas, Nora Blacksmith, Christie Ross, Ilia Crate, Annie Crane, Nancy Flett and Charlotte Hereredi were burnt to death.\nOn the afternoon of the 26th ult. with a party of Indians I made a search among the debris for any remains of the victims but we were able to find very few charred bones in places which would account for the thirteen victims; most of the bones having been reduced to ash. These bones were buried at Cross Lake on the 4th inst.\nNumerous rumours are rife as to the origin of the fire, these have all been investigated and found to have very little foundation in fact.\nWith regard to the origin of the fire, the following facts are known. The School had four heating appliances all of which were in different parts of the basement; a high pressure boiler which was not in use, a big heating boiler which was seen to be carrying less than one pound of steam at 2 a.m. on the morning of the fire, a bakery oven which was not in use and a cook stove standing on a cement base, nearest to where the fire originated, which was last attended to at about 9:30 p.m. on the evening before the fire.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6266, file 577-1, part 1)\nand which when left was practically dead.\n\nBrother Antoine made a tour of inspection of the building at midnight and again at 2 a.m. on the morning of the fire; on both occasions passing by where the fire was believed to originate but found nothing amiss.\n\nFather Trudeau, the Priest in charge, informs me that on one or two occasions last summer he had heard mice in the walls of the building and suggests that a short circuit in the wiring between the ceiling of the basement & the main floor by the insulation being gnawed by mice & the bare wire coming in contact with possibly a nail. If ignition of debris between the floor was caused in this manner it would probably smoulder for sometime over a fairly large area before it finally burnt through the floor, obtained air & caused the conflagration; however the electric lights functioned for about two minutes after the fire was first observed & then went out.\n\nIn the basement of the school where the fire was believed to originate was a room containing a pool table for the recreation of the young men; this room was always vacated at 9.30 every evening. There is a possibility that a match stick or cigarette butt may have been thrown around the fire but it seems doubtful as the room in question had recently been thoroughly cleaned out & painted and in any case, as mentioned before, this room was passed at 2 a.m. by Brother Antoine on his tour of inspection. From what I have seen of the interior of the building prior to the fire, I should say that it is very doubtful that a fire could be started by the dropping of a match or cigarette end as although no dirt or rubbish was allowed to accumulate to become ignited. The suggestion of the fire being caused in some way by the electric wiring seems most reasonable to me.\n\nOn the morning of the 28th. ult. I attended a Council Meeting of the Indians with Mr. Gordon; the people were apparently quite satisfied that no blame could be attached to anyone for the fire but expressed the wish that a permanent night watchman had been employed. Since then however, different ridiculous rumours such as the fire having been conjured by men at distant points, have come to life due I think to a dream of that nature that a local Indian woman had.\n\nUpon my return to Norway House I received the following radiogram from the C.C. Manitoba district:\n\n\"Radio me immediately as full details as possible regarding Cross Lake Fire for information of Coroner\"\n\nA.B.Allard\n\nA night letter was despatched to the Officer Commanding Manitoba District on the 2nd. inst. giving details of fire.\n\nOn the 11th. inst. I received the following telegram from H.J.Martin, Commissioner Manitoba Provincial Police.\n\n\"John Flett of Island Lake was at Cross Lake prior to fire endeavouring to take his son away but was refused. The son Arthur Flett desired to go with father, but Principal would not permit this. Indians at Cross Lake believe that John Flett urged his son Arthur Flett to start fire. Arthur Flette was sleeping in the infirmary on second floor on night of fire with Donald Ross. Both boys believed to have been fully dressed at time of fire. John Flett told friend of his who usually slept at the school that he Flette was glad that his friend was going away from the school on February 24th. School burnt down on night of 24th. Arthur Flett has stated since the fire that he was glad the school burned as he would now be able to go home. Boys Arthur Flett & Donald Ross now at Norway House. John Flett believed to be there also. Please carefully interview these persons and advise as to interrogation of children.\"\nand other Indians at Cross Lake. This forwarded direct to you by permission your Officer Commanding,\n\nH.J.Martin, Commissioner Man. P.Police\n\nOn the 12th. inst., I interviewed Donald Ross and Arthur Flett, both of whom are in Norway House hospital with tuberculosis. On being questioned, Arthur Flett informed me that while at Cross Lake school, for some weeks past he has been confined to his bed in the infirmary with tuberculosis. The day before the fire he was out of his bed once at 11 p.m. to go to the lavatory, which was right in the infirmary. On the early morning of the 25th. ult., he was awakened by the smoke and had just time enough to get a blanket, throw it around him and escape down the fire escape, where he stood until Father Trudeau obtained some clothes for him.\n\nWhile questioning this boy, Nurse Oliver informed me that he had received a letter from his father, John Flett at Island Lake, that morning. I obtained this letter which was in Cree hieroglyphics and had same transcribed, the following being the transcription:\n\nDear Son, To let you know I got home safe again. It took me seven days. Your sister & sister-in-law and one man were pretty sick. They were all sick the same time, but when I got here they were getting better. They are doing well every day getting strong, and none of your brothers are home yet. Today is a day later, they said they would be home. Now my son we were all sorry to hear of the school being burnt down. I just got home when I heard of the school to burn. Yes all the people were sorry but I cried myself for I felt so bad about it. I think that was very strange for the school looked so nice everything in around. That is why I think very bad about it and to be gone so soon. That is all my son. We all send kisses to you all. John Flett.\n\nUpon being questioned, Donald Ross informed me that he had been awakened by the smoke on the morning of the 25th. but had time to grab his clothes, escape by the fire escape & dress out skin. Neither of these boys had been out of the infirmary on the day preceding the fire. I have been able to confirm these statement from eye-witnesses at Cross lake. Father Trudeau informs me that prior to the fire John Flett came to Cross Lake to visit his son, which the natives frequently do, coming often from great distances. Arthur Flett asked his father to take him home with him. John Flett mentioned his son's request to Father Trudeau who told him that he considered such action very inadvisable owing to the temperature that Arthur had been running, to which John Flett quite agreed and apparently went away quite satisfied.\n\nI have been unable to see John Flett who is at Island Lake but I am quite satisfied, knowing both the man & the son, that there is absolutely no truth in the suggestion that either one of them deliberately caused the fire. Arthur Flett was one of the best boys in the school & Donald Ross bears a good reputation.\n\nI have questioned the Indians around Cross Lake but have been unable to find anyone who heard Arthur Ross state that he was glad the school burnt down.\n\nOn making further enquiries yesterday I received information from one May MacIvor to the same effect as that contained in the radiogram from Commissioner Martin, and am of the opinion that the MacIvor family are the source of the rumour. Upon questioning the MacIvors however I was unable to obtain any further satisfaction than that they had heard this & that etc. but could not say from whence. Personally I think it\nIs the out-cropping of a few facts and a very vivid imagination on the part of the Indians as the facts of the case contradict their rumour.\n\nSgt.\n\nIn charge Norway House Detachment.\n\nThe Commissioner,\nManitoba Provincial Police,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nForwarded for your information, 25-5-30.\n\nYou will be interested in the latter paragraphs of this report, and I myself consider that Sgt.

Perrier, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy dear Mr. Perrier:\n\nIn compliance with your request, I am returning herewith your file having reference to Cross Lake Indian Residential School. I have to thank you very much for your kindness in loaning these documents to me and at the very earliest opportunity I shall be pleased to have a conference with you respecting the situation in isolated institutions of this character.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nDominion Fire Commissioner.\n\nJGS:MN.\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to current expenses at the Cross Lake Indian Residential School. I regret that your proposal, to pay a small per capita grant in the case of those who are attending as day pupils, would not be acceptable to the Auditor General. The Department believes the most satisfactory way of meeting the current expense for the June quarter would be to allow per capita grant at the regular rate for the children that were sent to Norway House. Then, as far as the work at Cross Lake is concerned, it will be necessary to have a detailed statement, supported by receipts or other papers, showing the expenditure that the church authorities have incurred. This is the usual practice, and the accounting will be done similar to the arrangements made at the Guy Indian Residential School before it was placed on per capita grant.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Gordon has recently forwarded a voucher, in favour of the Cross Lake School, for 15 sacks of flour and 376 whitefish - a total of $127.60. This is not being paid as I expect that these items will be included in the expenses from the date of the fire. I am informing Mr. Gordon that special arrangements are being made to finance the school for the time being.\n\nHis voucher suggests that the rations were largely required for \"extra\" children. I presume that this means children of parents who do not live at Cross Lake, who are being kept by Indian families on the reserve. As the reconstruction of the school has not been decided\n\nRt. Rev. O. Charlebois, O.M.I., D.D.,\nBishop of Keewatin,\nThe Pas,\nMan.\nbeen decided, I believe it advisable to continue this arrangement after the summer. These children should be sent to their own homes and the activity at Cross Lake should be confined to the 13 children in residence and to all those who can attend from the reserve as day pupils.\n\nTo assist Your Lordship in financing, I am forwarding, under separate cover, an interim payment of $1,500 in lieu of per capita grant, to be applied on the current expenses at Cross Lake. This will have to be accounted for, as indicated in the first paragraph.\n\nI am enclosing an extra copy of this letter, which you may forward to the Reverend Principal.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\nOttawa, June 27, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your voucher No. 7 for $127.60, in favour of the Cross Lake Indian Residential School. This is not being paid as such, as the current expenses at Cross Lake, whether for the 11 pupils that they are keeping in residence, or for the day pupils that are on the reserve, will be met upon receipt, from the church authorities, of a detailed statement, showing all the costs, supported by receipts and other papers. Then a grant, in lieu of per capita grant, will be made for each quarter. The Department is writing to His Lordship Bishop Charlebois, concerning the current expenses at Cross Lake from the date of the fire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nWm. Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House,\nMan.\nExtract for Schools.\nOriginal on 51-123\n\nNorway House, Man.\nJune 13th, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nRecently a representative of the Provincial Board of Health visited the Hospital and also the Roman Catholic Mission at Norway House, where a number of the pupils of St. Joseph Indian School were transferred after the fire this winter, and assumed authority with regard to the housing conditions, etc., and while I do not object, I would ask to be informed just what authority the Provincial Board of Health would have in relation to institutions of the Dept. of Indian Affairs operated for Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) Wm. Gordon,\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Assist. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nJuly 25th, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to that part of your letter of June 13th which refers to the Provincial Board of Health inspection of the Roman Catholic School at Norway House, I may say that the Department understands that this school accommodates both Indian pupils and other children. If this is the case, there is no doubt that the Provincial Board of Health has the right of inspection, particularly as the school and mission property does not form a part of the reserve.\n\nThis Department is of course interested in the conditions under which its own pupils are kept at this school, and you should insure that the accommodation is satisfactory. If necessary, report to the Department any bad conditions which you may find to exist.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie,\nActing Assistant Deputy & Secretary\n\nWm. Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF WM. GORDON, INDIAN AGENT, NORWAY HOUSE, FOR THE MONTH OF DECEMBER, 1930, ON THE NORWAY HOUSE RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nThis is a day school carried on by the staff of the St. Joseph's Boarding School since the school was burned last February, or at least since it was possible to get the outhouse, a storehouse, in condition to carry on. This room is used as a classroom on week days and a chapel on Sundays. The furniture is home made, and while the benches are fairly comfortable, there are no desks, which makes seat work difficult. I found, however, neat writing and good drawing. Written number work was fairly good also. Reading was very good, and the children spoke clearly and with good voice, and very naturally. Considerable of the work is done orally, and in concert, which of course encourages the more bright children, and has doubtful value for the more plodding children. I found, however, that the children appear to understand very well the work being covered by them, and are quick and prompt with their answers. Spelling was good and oral number work excellent.\n\nThe children are supplied with a lunch at noon, and with a good substantial meal on dismissal of the classes. This is of great value to the children, especially in this year of scarcity of fur and the wherewithal to purchase flour and other store goods.\nSir,\n\nI understand that a recent amendment has been made to Section 774 of the Criminal Code, whereby the authority of a Police Magistrate for the Province of Manitoba, has been extended to be on a par with those of Ontario for certain offences. If this be true, then I, as a Police Magistrate, holding a Commission as P.M. for Manitoba, have authority, with the consent of the accused, to hear and decide these cases, so long as a charge of manslaughter is not entered. This would simplify matters greatly, as I have no doubt the boys would consent to be tried by me, and would probably plead \"Guilty\".\n\nShould the boys be sent up for trial, I would not be permitted at the Preliminary hearing, to ask them to plead to the charge, evidence would have to be secured, and at their trial, should they, on lawyer's advice, plead \"Not Guilty\", a great deal of time and expense would be necessary in order to produce sufficient evidence to secure a conviction.\n\nI may say that I have no desire to take the responsibility of settling so grave cases, and I would not wish to do anything which would look like a \"Hole in the corner\" business, nor like \"Railroading\" the boys into prison, but on the other hand, if I have the authority to hear the cases, if the boys are willing to abide by my judgment, and if thus the time and expense which would otherwise be necessary in securing and presenting evidence before a higher court can be saved, I would not wish to be recreant to the trust imposed upon me.\n\nMay I ask for a very early reply, as any delay will carry us into the freeze-up. A wire to Inspector Bunn, to be forwarded, might be the quickest means of reply.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nWm. Gordon,\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI have to report that on Saturday last, Sept. 12th Sergt. D.C. Saul, officer in charge of the R.C.M.P. Police Detachment at Norway House, brought to my office a young man, George Paynter, who had confessed that he, in company with another boy, Nelson Hughes, had set fire to St. Joseph's Residential School at Cross Lake on the morning of February 25th, 1930.\n\nInformations were laid against both of these boys on a charge of Arson, and George Paynter was remanded in custody for seven days, when he will again be remanded, while a warrant was issued for the arrest of Nelson Hughes who is reported at Nelson House, and Sergt. Saul left for Nelson House Sunday morning to bring Hughes in.\n\nGeorge Paynter (George Penders) was, at the time of the fire, pupil No. 62, of St. Joseph's Residential school, and was in his 17th year. He had been in school 10 years, and had reached Grade 6. He is said Treaty with No. 320, Norway House Band, as male dependent of the Chief, Wm. Thomas Towers. His parents are both dead. A few weeks before the fire he had run away from school, but was taken back, and punished. Some of the boys are said to have heard him making threats against the school, and one boy, Roderick McKay, ex-pupil No. 75 of St. Joseph's school, discharged Aug. 1929, but who was at the school working up to a couple of days before the fire, is said to have told at The Pas and at Cumberland House that the boy Paynter had told him (McKay) just before he left Cross Lake that he (Paynter) and another had made an attempt to set fire to the school but that they were nearly caught, but that they would do it yet. It was from these alleged statements of McKay's that the word came through Bishop Charlebois and Father Trudeau, Principal of St. Joseph's, which led to the questioning of the boy Paynter.\n\nThe second boy, Nelson Hughes, was about 17 years of age, in his graduation year, at the time of the fire. He is non-treaty, as his father was non-treaty, but since his mother was Treaty, and his father dead, he was admitted as a pupil of St. Joseph's school, in Sept. 1919. Since leaving school he has been convicted of theft and secured a short sentence. He has recently married at Nelson House.\n\nAs the charge is a very serious one, more especially in view of the 13 deaths caused by the fire, I should like to be instructed by the Department as to what I should\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, Sept. 28, 1931.\n\nJ.

G. Saul, R.C.M.P., of Norway House, has one man under arrest and is hot on the trail of another who is connected with the burning, February 25, 1930, of the Indian school at Cross Lake when the Sister Superior and nine pupils perished.\n\nWith George Paynter, 22-year-old half-breed Indian in custody, Sergeant Saul passed through Thicket Portage Saturday in an canoe packed full of firewood and bound for Nelson House on the trail of another Indian, also wanted in connection with the fire.\n\nPaynter is said to have confessed to aiding his older Indian friend in setting fire to the school on the cold winter night in February, 1930.\n\nKnown in the north country as one of the most daring of the Indians ever to patrol the lonely wastes of the Arctic, Paynter was arrested by Sergeant Saul since the night of the holocaust has been on the run incessantly.

Unfortunately, however, Sergeant Saul had left Thicket Portage before I was able to get in touch with him, taking his prisoners back to Norway House. The Manitoba Provincial Police are in somewhat of a quandary in this respect, as, owing to the very slight information we have regarding these cases, it is not known who the witnesses are, where they are located, and whether it would be cheaper to bring the prisoners and witnesses out to Winnipeg, or send a judicial party in to Norway House to hear the case. In view of the fact that there are now no means of communication to Norway House, except by radio, it has been thought better that Sergeant Saul bring the prisoners in anyhow, in order that he can give us full details in person.

I wrote to the Attorney General the same mail as I wrote to the Department (16th ?), but his reply is doubtless coming by mail. My letter to the Attorney General was for information re my jurisdiction in these cases. I am writing him again for instructions, as per advice in the message received today. Unless these instructions are in the letter which will be a reply to my former letter, they will probably have to be broadcast by radio, unless they can be sent in by plane.\n\nSergt.

I hope the instructions of the Attorney General arrive on the first boat, which may be in about Friday the 2nd October, sometime before you will receive this. This is a very bad time for anything like this to have to be settled, owing to the bad mail service for the past and for the next few weeks.\n\nThere has always been a suspicion that the fire originated in this way, or something similar, but suspicion is something not to be discussed, or even mentioned, if you wish the truth to come out. It is pretty hard to believe that the Indian boys would be guilty of such conduct. Of course the benefits of education are not sought after by boys of this stamp, and the rigorous discipline of the school is not congenial, even if salutary. Some changes in the brothers on the staff had been made just the last day, and the brother most respected by the boys was away.\n\nAs Police Magistrate for the Province of Manitoba, and the only one in this district, it may be necessary for me to hold the preliminary hearing. In any case I will await the instructions of the Attorney General.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. R. Bunn, Esq.\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg.\n\nSigned (Wm.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nDuring the latter part of August 1921, Father Trudeau O.M.I., R.C. Missionary at Cross Lake, called at this Detachment & informed me that he had received a letter from Bishop Charlebois in which the Bishop stated that while at Cumberland House this summer, an Indian had informed him that another Indian, Roderick McKay had said that he believed one George Paynter, Indian, had set fire to the school, as while McKay was at the school, Bender came to him and said \"To-night I am going to set fire to the school, get ready to escape, take off the screen window so you can get out by the window\"; a little later Bender came back to McKay's room and said \"I did not succeed, I almost got caught by the Brother, I will try again later when you wont be here so you wont be exposed\".\n\nSince this fire took place on February 25th, 1920, there have been many rumours started as to the origin of the fire, all of which have been investigated without result and I was rather sceptical as to the truth in this.\n\nOn Sept. 12th, accompanied by Indian John Bradburn, I left for Cross Lake to interrogate some of the older boys with regard to this report. Roderick McKay was away from Cross Lake & it was not known exactly where he was.\n\nShortly after we had boiled our first kettle, I came to a camp of Indians where George Paynter was staying. I stepped to question this boy as to his activities on the night of the fire. At first he was very noncommittal and I could get no satisfactory replies from him. I told him of what Roderick McKay had stated and at first he denied the truth of this, later he admitted that he had tried to burn the school unsuccessfully two or three nights before the fire took place; shortly after he broke down and admitted the whole thing, giving me the following statement:\n\nGeorge Paynter's statement:\n\"I was at the school on the night of the fire at Cross Lake. I was sleeping in the big boys dormitory. Nelson Hughes told me about the fire. I just put my pants & coat & sweater on and socks. I remember telling Roderick McKay I was going to set fire to the school. I tried to set fire to the school but I couldn't, I went down to the basement for this purpose, then the Brother came, Brother Antoine, I got frightened and came up again. Nelson Hughes was with me, he was going to help me. Two nights after this the school took fire. Nelson Hughes & I set fire to the school when it burnt. About 3 o'clock on the morning of the 25th, February, Nelson Hughes got up & woke me up. I put on my pants. I did not want to go but Nelson forced me to go. I did not go down right away, he went first. Then he came up again & told me there was nobody there. I went after with Nelson & got gasoline from the barrel in the engine room. I sprinkled it on the wood & on the floor of the pool room. Then I set a match to it. I then went back to bed. Nelson went into the play-room. About 10 minutes after he came back to bed. About 10 or 15 minutes later the alarm was given & there was lots of smoke. The people were getting out of the school by this time. I did this because Nelson forced me to it.\"\n\n(Sgd.) George Paynter\nUpon receiving this information, I arrested Paynter and escorted him back to Norway House. Upon arrival there, about 6 p.m., I laid information before Wm. Gordon P.M. against Paynter under Section 511 C.C. of C., I also laid information against Nelson Hughes under the same section & obtained warrant to apprehend this man. Paynter appeared before Mr. Gordon the same evening and at my request the case was remanded from week to week until I could return with Hughes. Paynter was then escorted to the Detachment & left in the custody of S/Cst. Robinson until my return. S/Cst. Robinson was instructed to bring back the accused Paynter before Mr. Gordon for further remands until I should return.\n\nOn the morning of the 13th Sept. I left for Nelson House via Thicket Portage, to arrest Nelson Hughes. Indian John Bradburn was discharged at Cross Lake and Indians James Ross & Henry Hamilton employed as guides.\n\nUpon arriving at Thicket Portage I telephoned through to the telegraph operator at Wabowden the following telegram to the Officer Commanding Winnipeg:\n\n\"The Brown Lake fire 1930 stop Have Indian George Paynter under arrest Norway House for burning school and have obtained full confession stop Hold warrant to apprehend Nelson Hughes half-breed accomplice stop Expect to execute same in couple of days stop Will submit full reports on return Norway House about 27th inst. (Sgd.) Sgt.Saul\n\nOwing to very bad weather, engine trouble & difficulty in finding the route I did not arrive Nelson House until the evening of the 24th! Upon arriving at Nelson House I learnt that Hughes had gone with his wife & parents-in-law to Swan Lake, about 100 miles N.W. of Nelson House. I therefore left one of my men with Mr. Nutty, trader, and borrowed an Indian who knew the route to Swan Lake from him. We arrived at Swan Lake on the morning of the 27th. & I arrested Hughes, warning him in the prescribed form.\n\nThe same day we left on our return journey. While at Nelson House on our return, Hughes made the following statement to me:\n\nNelson Hughes statement:\nOn the night of the fire at Cross Lake, at about 3 o'clock in the morning, when George Paynter went downstairs, I went after him. George woke me up before he went down. He said \"Get up & come downstairs\" The evening before the fire took place George Paynter had been talking to me and told me that he was going to wake me up that night that he was going to do something, that he was going to set fire to the school. I said \"I can't tell you yet\" When George woke me up I knew what he was going to do. I did not tell anyone that George was going to burn the school. George told me also that he had tried to burn the school two or three nights before. I was not with him when he tried the first time. When I got up & followed George I had on just my night clothes, he had his pants & stockings on. I went as far as the refectory. George told me to stand there & watch to see that nobody came until he had started the fire. As soon as George got to the engine room I went back to bed. About five minutes later George came back. He told me that he had started the fire. About 10 or 15 minutes later the room became full of smoke & we all got up and got out of the building. The reason that I agreed to help George burn the school was that I was always mad at the Priest because he was always punishing me. I make this true statement of my own free will. (Sgd.) Nelson Hughes\n\nWitness:- Sgt.D.C.Saul, W.E.W.Nutty.\n\nOn passing through Thicket Portage on my return journey, I sent the following telegram through to Wabowden to be despatched:\nThe Officer Commanding,\nR.C.M.Police, Winnipeg.\n\nMy wire 18th inst., stop Return to Detachment unavoidably delayed eight days stop Hughes under arrest has admitted guilt. (Sgd.) Sgt. Saul\n\nOn passing through Cross Lake on my return journey, I questioned some of the boys who had been in the dormitory with accused at the time of the fire, and learned that most of these boys had known all the time who had started the fire, but owing to the deaths incurred had been too frightened to breathe a word about it until it had come out. I left word with Indian boys, George Miller, Baptiste Crate & Edward McKay to come to Norway House to give evidence in this case. Upon their arrival there I found that Edward McKay's knowledge or the case was very slight so he was allowed to return to his home.\n\nI arrived at Norway House with prisoner Hughes on the evening of the 5th inst.\n\nOn the morning of the 6th, Hughes appeared before Mr. Gordon P.M. & the case was remanded until the 10th inst.\n\nThe following message was received from SS Officer Commanding Winnipeg, through CKY broadcasting station:\u2014\nBring Paynter & Hughes to Winnipeg on next boat leaving Selkirk Oct. 6th. (Sgd.) Supt. Field\n\nOn 10th inst. Paynter & Hughes were again brought before Mr. Gordon & there cases were again remanded until 3 p.m. of the 17th inst., it being expected that by this time they could be in Winnipeg.\n\nPaynter is a Treaty Indian and was born sometime during the year 1913. He has borne a bad reputation since he was quite small but has been an exemplary prisoner since he has been in custody.\n\nHughes is a half-breed, married, he was born in October 1911. He bears a bad reputation and served a short term of imprisonment in 1930 for theft. He has behaved himself well since being in custody.\n\n(Sgd.)

At present the Attorney General's Department is more or less at a loss as to what steps to take in this matter. They are proposing now to send in a Judicial party from Norway House by aeroplane to finally dispose of this case, which would, of course, entail very much expense. The two accused are willing to admit to plead \"Guilty\" to a charge of Arson, but the intention now is to lay a charge of Constructive Murder. However, the Attorney General has promised to notify me as to what final action they decide to take. In the meantime, Sergeant Saul is remaining here with the two witnesses mentioned in this report, whom he brought out with him. Both accused at the time of the offense were juveniles.

Speaking through Norman Gaudin, of Norway House, interpreter of the Cree language, to hold his story.\n\nMade Two Attempts\n\nPaynter had been punished for infraction of the rules of the convent when he was an inmate. Nursing a grudge against his teachers he made two unsuccessful attempts to burn the building. Each time he was detected by a priest and returned to the dormitory.\n\nUndeterred by his failures, but more modestly, Paynter planned a third time to start a fire. He warned one of his friends in the boys' dormitory to remove the dorm window to facilitate escape after the fire started.\n\nThat night he obtained a quantity of gasoline from the engine-room and sprinkled it upon the lower floor. He touched it and within a few minutes the building was a roaring furnace.\n\nTwenty Boys Zero\n\nThe occupants of the boys' dormitory had been warned, escaped, but 12 girl pupils, one boy who was recovering from tuberculosis, and two of the teaching sisters were burned to death.\n\nThe temperature was 20 degrees below zero and the survivors suffered from cold and exposure during the night.\n\nDuring the time on the bench Magistrate Nobbs has never before imposed a fine sentence. Nelson Hughes, alleged to be implicated with Paynter, appeared today and pleaded not guilty to the crime.

The presiding Judge was fair, the witnesses told the truth, and the jury gave the evidence great consideration before reaching the verdict.\n\nI do submit that certain principles of government and control of the Indians and half-breeds are inter-mixed with this case.\n\nI submit that a full and complete investigation should be made as to the reason why two school boys should set a school on fire.\n\nFrom the evidence disclosed every boy in that school had a hatred of the officers in charge there. Such a condition is not right, nor is it moral in an Indian School.\n\nThe Indian boy and the half-breed boy attending school in this Province has distilled in him a sense of loyalty which was certainly lacking in the boys that were brought down to Winnipeg in connection with this trial.\n\nI submit that the officers in charge of the school at Cross Lake had failed in their duty with the result that Hughes must suffer.\n\nIf this country of ours owes any duty to the Indian and half-breed in the far North, then I submit that someone has failed to discharge that duty in so far as Nelson Hughes was concerned.\n\nI told the jury in my address and I think that Mr. Justice Robson will confirm my statement, that in the case of Hughes I tried to bring out all the evidence both for and against the accused so that we could get at the root of the trouble if such was possible. I did make certain progress in this regard but if the trial had have been held in the North Country closer to Cross Lake, then perhaps the Court and jury would have agreed with my contention that the State had failed in its duty to the Indian and half-breed of the North Country.\n\nI submit that this is a matter which should have the careful consideration of your Department and that Hughes is entitled to consideration.\n\nIf the matter could be referred to the Indian Department I would be glad to express them additional facts in connection with this case.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJohn L.

I may say that on the 25th February, 1930, the Indian Boarding School at Cross Lake in the Northern part of Manitoba was destroyed by fire with the loss of the lives of 13 children and one of the teaching sisters. Subsequently George Paynter and Nelson Hughes, who were in attendance at this school, were arrested on a charge of arson. Paynter appears to have been the one who actually set the school on fire and he had induced Nelson Hughes to assist him. Paynter pleaded guilty and in October 1931 was sentenced to life imprisonment. Hughes elected to be tried by jury and according to Mr. Ross' letter the trial took place before his Lordship Mr. Justice Robson and a jury on charges of arson and conspiracy but we have no information as to what sentence was imposed on Hughes.\n\nHughes is reported to be a half-breed, born in October 1911, bears a bad reputation and served a short term of imprisonment in 1930 for theft.

Trudeau, O.M.I., in connection with the expenditures that have been incurred at Cross Lake since the school was destroyed by fire. As you are, no doubt, aware, the school authorities are requesting an additional amount and, in this connection, I might refer you to official letter of June 27th, 1930.\n\nWhile the school authorities have submitted, from time to time, statements in connection with the expenditure that has been incurred up to March 31st, last, no receipts or other papers have yet been forwarded. These are necessary to meet the requirements of the Auditor General and I am writing Father Trudeau, requesting him to prepare a detailed statement of expenditures up to March 31st, both for the pupils attending the day school and the pupils who have been kept in residence. To this statement should be attached receipted accounts or cancelled cheques in order that the Department may have full details in connection with the expenditure incurred. When this is received, consideration will be given to what balance can be allowed. I would appreciate your giving Father Trudeau any assistance you can in the preparation of this.\n\nFrom April 1st, 1932, the following arrangements will be in effect:\n\n(1) A salary at the rate of $95 a teaching month will be allowed for the teacher of the day school now being conducted at Cross Lake and which is attended by, approximately, 30 pupils.\n\n(2) A grant at the rate of $175 per capita will be allowed for approximately 12 pupils - some of whom are in residence at Cross Lake and the others at Norway House. Separate returns should be forwarded for the children attending the day school and those in residence. These returns, of course, should be forwarded through your office and certified by you. Reverend Father Trudeau is being so advised.\n\n(3) The Department will only be able to allow a grant for a midday meal supplied to the pupils attending the day school. This will mean that the Department can allow from the Appropriation for Indian Education a grant towards the cost of only one meal a day. Please let me have a recommendation from you, stating what monthly amount you consider would be reasonable in this regard. I may say that, at other Indian schools where a midday meal is served, it is usual to supply a hot soup or cocoa and biscuit. In other words, the meal should not be elaborate, as our funds for this purpose are quite limited.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-1, part 1)\n\nPULLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nOttawa, August 18th, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th ultimo, in connection with the expenditures that have been made at Cross Lake since the school was destroyed by fire. The Department has, also, had a visit recently from Rev. Father Lajeunesse, O.M.I., in connection with this matter.\n\nAs pointed out in official letter of June 27th, 1930, addressed to Rt. Rev. O. Charlebois, O.M.I., D.D., it will be necessary, before a final payment can be made, to have a detailed statement, supported by receipts or other papers, showing the expenditures that the Church authorities have incurred. Up to the present, you have only submitted statements which do not meet with the requirements of the Auditor General. As pointed out above, the Department will have to have a statement together with receipted accounts or cancelled cheques. Mr. Agent Gordon is being requested to give you any assistance he can in the preparation of this.\n\nIn the meantime, another advance of $2,500 is being forwarded and, when your complete statement showing the disbursements from April, 1930, to March 31st, 1932, supported by receipts or other papers, is received, the Department will deal as generously with you as funds will permit.\n\nUntil the visit of Father Lajeunesse, the Department was not aware that the Church authorities have been doing so much for the children attending as day pupils. At many Indian schools, a midday meal is served but this only consists of soup or cocoa and biscuit. The cost of this is comparatively small. Our funds\n\nRev. G. E. Trudeau, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nCross Lake, Man.\nthis year are so limited that it will be impossible to consider continuing the present arrangement at Cross Lake and, after discussing the matter fully with Father Lajeunesse, it was decided to advise you, as follows:\n\n(1) From April 1st, 1932, a salary at the rate of $95 a teaching month will be allowed for the teacher of the day school now being conducted at Cross Lake and which is attended by, approximately, 30 pupils.\n\n(2) The Department will only be able to allow a grant for midday meal purposes as outlined in a previous part of this letter. I am communicating with Mr. Agent Gordon with a view to ascertaining what would be a reasonable amount to allow in this regard. This will mean that the Department will make a grant towards the cost of only one meal a day.\n\n(3) From April 1st, 1932, grant at the rate of $175 per capita will be allowed for 12 pupils - some of whom are in residence at Cross Lake and the others at Norway House.\n\nPayment of the salary due the teacher, as well as the grant for the pupils in residence, will be made upon receipt of the usual quarterly returns, which should be forwarded through the office of Mr. Agent Gordon.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. G. E. Trudeau, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nCross Lake, Man.\nOttawa, August 18th, 1932.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nThe Department has recently had a visit from Reverend Father Lajeunesse, O.M.I., in connection with the expenditures that have been made at Cross Lake since the school was destroyed by fire.\n\nThe Department was not previously aware that the Church authorities had been dealing so generously with the children who have been attending as day pupils - I refer particularly to the fact that two meals a day have been given these children.\n\nBefore the Department can make a final settlement, it will be necessary, as pointed out in official letter of June 27th, 1930, to have a detailed statement together with receipted accounts or cancelled cheques. These are required for purposes of the Auditor General. I am, therefore, writing to Reverend Father Trudeau requesting him to supply this information and a copy of the letter to Father Trudeau is enclosed for your information.\n\nYou will note the suggested arrangement from April 1st, 1932. This was fully discussed with Father Lajeunesse when he visited the Department and he felt that you would concur.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRt.

L'objet de cette p\u00e9tition est de solliciter la reconstruction de l'Ecole pensionnat qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truite par le feu dans la dite R\u00e9serve il y a deux ans.\n\nJe ne puis m'emp\u00eacher de manifester que j'approuve fortement leur demande; car elle est tout \u00e0 fait juste. Les 91 signataires ne repr\u00e9sentent que les catholiques de Cross-Lake. Il ya en plus les catholiques de Nelson-House, de God's-Lake, d'Island-Lake et de Norway-House qui ne d\u00e9sirent pas moins ardemment que la dite \u00e9cole soit reconstruite. Ils repr\u00e9sentent tout un grand District. Il n'y a pas \u00e0 dire, il faut une \u00e9cole pensionnat dans cette partie du pays. Celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truite doit donc \u00eatre reconstruite le plus t\u00f4t possible.\n\nNous souhaitons que le D\u00e9partement Indien ne perde pas de vue cette obligation. D\u00e8s que les affaires financi\u00e8res le permettront, nous comptons bien qu'il s'en occupera.\n\nJe vous prie d'agr\u00e9er mes salutations les plus sinc\u00e8res.\n\n+P.G.

Williams,\nActing Deputy Minister,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received lately, from the Indians of the reserve of Cross-Lake, a copy of the petition which was addressed to you. The object of that petition is to solicit the reconstruction of the boarding school which was destroyed by fire on the said reserve about two years ago.\n\nI can only manifest my strong approval to their request; because it is absolutely just. The 91 signees only represent the Catholics of Cross-Lake. There are, furthermore, the Catholics of Nelson-House, of God's-Lake, of Island-Lake and of Norway-House who wish just as ardently that the said school be rebuilt. They represent a very large district. There is no doubt, that a boarding school is urgent in that section of the country. The one which was destroyed must be rebuilt as soon as possible.\n\nWe hope that the Department will not lose sight of this obligation. As soon as the financial situation will permit, we hope that it will be taken into consideration.\n\nI beg you to receive my most sincere regards.\n\nO. Charlebois, O. M. I.,\nVic. Apost. of Keewatin.\nNovember 7, 1932.\n\nDear Bishop Charlebois:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 26th ultimo, enclosing copy of petition addressed to you by the Indians of Cross Lake, requesting the erection of a new school at that point, to replace the one destroyed by fire two years ago.\n\nOwing to lack of funds, the Department is not in a position, at the present time, to give a favourable reply to this request, but I can assure you that I will keep in mind the need for a new building at Cross Lake.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRight Reverend O. Charlebois, O.M.I., D.D.,\nBishop of Keewatin,\nThe Pas,\nMan.\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to the conversation we had when I had the pleasure to see you, in the beginning of last month, you were asking me how many indian children were attending our Residential School at Norway-House, giving me to understand that, as long as the Cross-Lake School, will not be rebuilt, we would be granted the grant per capita for all the Treaty indians.\n\nI wish to inform you that, at the present time, there are five indian children for whom we receive the grant. These children were transferred to Norway-House at the time of the fire. At our Res. School, at Norway-House, there is accommodation for fifteen to twenty more children and if you wish us to send the applications for them we will be pleased to do so.\n\nWishing you the best compliments of the Season, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, January 18th, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Rev. Martin Lajeunesse, O.M.I., The Pas, Man., stating that there is accommodation for fifteen to twenty children in the building owned by the Oblate Mission at Norway House. At the present time, the Department understands that five of the former pupils of the Cross Lake Residential School are in residence at Norway House.\n\nThe Department has just received the December quarter return of the Cross Lake Residential School and this shows the names of eleven children. As you, no doubt, have a copy of this return, I would appreciate your stating the names of the pupils who are still at Cross Lake, also the names of those at Norway House.\n\nYou should, also, state if you consider there is sufficient accommodation at Norway House for the number of children mentioned by Rev. M. Lajeunesse, O.M.I., and whether or not you would recommend that the Department provide per capita allowance for this number.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nWm.

Measurements are as follows:\n\nLittle girls, 9' x 15' x 9' high; less monitors room.\nBig girls, 32' x 16' x 9' high.\nLittle boys, 24' x 16' x 9' high.\nMonitor's rooms are approximately 6'x8'x9'.\n\nBig boys, 18' x 20' x 7' high.\n\nThe only provision for ventilation is by doors and windows. The building is steam heated, and has running water and electric lighting.\n\nThe cubical air space in the dormitories would total approximately 10,500 cubic feet.\n\nThe dining rooms are of good size, and the classroom has accommodation for 35 pupils.\n\nIf the Boarding School at Cross Lake is not likely to be rebuilt for some time, then the Roman Catholic Indians deserve some consideration with regard to Boarding School accommodation for their children. For this reason I would recommend that a per capita grant be provided for the number of children that may be allowed, according to dormitory space; with the understanding that Boarding School regulations must be strictly adhered to, particularly with regard to other boarders in the institution, and the health and religion of the children on admission. Such an arrangement would give the Department more direct supervision in these respects, than we have at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nWm Gordon,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 14th, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter of December 16th, last, I enclose, for your information, a copy of official letter being directed to Mr. Agent Gordon in connection with the admission of children to the Norway House R.C.

Your letter of the 21st ultimo states that there are already five children at the Norway House R. C. Mission and, therefore, application may be made for the admission of fifteen (15) more. Only one quarterly return, including the names of all the children, should be forwarded.\n\nIt is understood, of course, that, in placing children in the Roman Catholic Mission at Norway House, the same regulations will apply as in the case of any other Indian residential school. Only Roman Catholic children should be admitted and application forms and certificates of health for all new pupils should be forwarded for the Department's consideration.

According to your desire, we will keep and board twenty Indian children, for which the ordinary Grant is promised. So, there will be no more than 20 beds in all the dormitories, inspected and measured by the Indian Agent Mr W Gordon.\n\nBut, besides these 20 Pupils, I was desiring and intending to keep 3 or 4 Orphans and destituted Indian children. They were at School last year; and I had made the promise of taking care of them. We will supply them with beds, in special and personal rooms, separated from the 20 ones. They would have no other contact with them, except in the dining and the class rooms. There will be no difficulty for the recreation, as it is taken usually, in the open air. I don't thing, the presence of these 3 or 4 supernumerary children, will do any harm to the health of the 20 ones. Of course, we will feed and board them, at our own expenses. I ask the Indian Department if they have any objection to that. And I am glad\nto take this opportunity of conveying to the Department my most sincere gratitude for the great favour granted this year to our School of Norway house.\n\nHoping You will hear favourably our humble request,\n\nI am, dear SIR, Your very sincerely,\n\nRev.

The total accounts forwarded in accounting for these advances amounted to only $7,403.74, as per the statement enclosed, which is a copy of the list showing the payments made, forwarded by the late Bishop Charlebois. You will see, from this statement, that there is a balance of $596.26 which has not been accounted for. The Auditor General is requesting an accounting for the advances which were made the Cross Lake School, in lieu of per capita grant, during the above mentioned period. If Your Lordship has any accounts, other than those mentioned in the enclosed list, I would request that you will forward copies of same, in triplicate, properly certified, in order to account for the above mentioned sum of $596.26. I should be pleased to have receipted accounts covering this amount at the earliest possible date.\n\nIf Your Lordship is unable to submit further accounts covering expenditure made in this connection, it would appear that overpayment was made, and the Auditor General would request that the amount be retained from per capita earnings of the school until adjustment has been made.\n\nI shall be pleased if the above will receive your early attention, in order that these accounts can be received and the matter adjusted before our books close at the end of the present fiscal year, viz.: March 31st, next.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. M. Lajeunesse, O. M. I.,\nBishop of Keewatin,\nThe Pas, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nRefer: to yours No I23-I-I.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of yours of January 29th Re expenditure incurred by us for the maintenance of the children at the Cross-Lake School from the date of the fire on February 25th, 1930 to March 31st, 1932.\n\nFirst I wish to draw your attention on this point that the statements forwarded to the Department last September by Late Bishop Charlebois were covering only the expenditures made for the children attending day school. So these statements do not include expenses made for the boarders kept from the time of the fire, some at Cross-Lake and some at Norway-House. For these children the regular Quarterly Returns were regularly forwarded for which no per Capita Grant was received until June Quarter 1932.\n\nAs stated in a letter received from the Department No I23-I-3 dated June 27th, 1930 it was understood that the Department would pay the regular Per Capita Grant for the boarders kept at Cross-Lake and Norway-House, and then, special grant would be given for children attending day school, to whom two meals and clothes were given, on receipt of detailed statement showing the expenditure incurred for same.\n\nConsequently having received $8000 we admit that this sum exceeds the expenses made for the children attending day school and being fed and clothed but the balance left $596.26 is far from being sufficient to cover the Grant per Capita which has been left unpaid from April 1st, 1930 to March 31st 1932.\n\nHoping this will be satisfactory, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nMartin Lajimodre,\nBishop of Keewatin\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nRight Rev. M. Lajeunesse, O.M.I., Bishop of Keewatin, visited the Department on April the seventh. We discussed the situation at Cross Lake, as outlined in official letter of January 29th, 1934. I pointed out to His Lordship the impossibility of making any further payments for the period April 1, 1930, to March 31, 1932. After some discussion, it was mutually agreed that this matter would be considered closed, and His Lordship stated that he would not again bring it up.\n\nI again requested him to forward us a receipt for approximately $600 worth of expenditures during the period in question, in order that we can satisfy the requirements of the Auditor General.\nNorway House, Man:\n21st March 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that on the 15th instant, I inspected that part of the Cross Lake Roman Catholic Indian Residential School, that is located at the Cross Lake Reserve.\n\nI found everything about the school premises in very good condition. The class room building is in good shape, well kept and well heated.\n\nThere were 22 pupils present in the class room at the time of my visit, 10 of which were resident pupils, the other 12 being day school pupils.\n\nThe teacher is efficient, and the discipline was good. The pupils are doing good work and showing progress.\n\nUnfortunately I did not see the Principal of the school; the Revs Henry Boissin, as he had gone to Norway House. When I returned to Norway House, he had returned to Cross Lake.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.

We did not insist very strongly during the past years, knowing that depression was handicapping your work, I earnestly hope that you will gratify us with favorable answer as soon as you can.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Bonusta,\nVicar-Apostolic of Keewatin.\nOttawa, August 27, 1936.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 21st instant, enclosing a petition from the Indians of Cross Lake, requesting that a residential school be erected, to replace the building destroyed by fire in 1930.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will have no funds to consider the re-establishment of the Cross Lake Residential School and the erection of a suitable building. Your Lordship will understand that, during the past four years, there have been no funds available for the replacement or repairing of our present school establishment. There are, therefore, many demands, and it will likely require a period of two or three years before sufficient funds can be available to place our present school establishment in an efficient state. I am quite unable to say, at present, when Parliament would be able to provide the funds required for the erection of a new residential school building at Cross Lake and the furnishings and per capita grant for same. However, the need at this point will be kept in mind. It will be necessary, therefore, to carry on under the present arrangements for school facilities for the Indian children of the Cross Lake Band.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Crerar,\nMinister of the Department of Mines and Resources.\n\nHonourable Sir:\n\nFollowing our conversation of this morning I would like to express to you my deep satisfaction and appreciation of your plan concerning the vocational training of Indian children. I think you have struck the right note. Education must be a development and not a distortion of natural talents and tendencies in children.\n\nIn the same line of thought I would like to supplement my remarks of this morning by saying that my opinion is that we should have at Cross Lake an institution which would be primarily a Day School but with accommodation for orphans, for destitute children and of those of the neighboring reserves, and which school adapted for about 65 children would suffice. This would be a center from which Indian crafts, agriculture and other useful trades could be taught. Since last year, in fact, agriculture has been specially organized for our former pupils by our Missionaries at Cross Lake.\n\nWhat seems to be of immediate importance is the examination of the site and the bringing in of some of the material such as sand, etc.... Hoping that we may be favoured with a suitable solution to our problem through your kindness and influence.\n\nI beg to remain yours sincerely,\n\n\"Martin Lajeunesse\" O.M.I.\nVicar-Apostolic of Keewatin.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOttawa, March 27th, 1937\n\nDr. H.W. McGill,\nDirector of Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nOn Monday, the 22nd instant, Bishop Lajeunesse, of The Pas, was in to see the Minister and discussed with him the question of providing educational facilities at Cross Lake in Manitoba. I am now enclosing herewith a copy of a letter he has written to the Minister. Mr. Crerar would like you to discuss this matter with him some time in the near future.\n\nC.W. Jackson,\nSecretary.\n\nEnclosure (1).\nOttawa, March 31, 1937.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McClellan,\n\nRe: Cross Lake School.\n\nI am returning herewith Mr. Jackson's memorandum of March 27th and also copy of letter received by the Minister from Bishop LaJeunesse, of The Pas, Manitoba.\n\nThe Cross Lake Residential School (R.C.) was destroyed by fire on February 25th, 1930. At that time the school had an enrolment of 110 pupils with a per capita grant allowance of $175. It would appear that, following the destruction of the residential school, an arrangement was made with the Church authorities, whereby they were allowed per capita grant of $175 for 40 pupils. Of these pupils, 10 are at Cross Lake and 30 are receiving instruction in a church-owned building at Norway House. In addition to this, a salary of $950 a year has been allowed for a day school teacher at Cross Lake. This day school has an enrolment of 36 pupils.\n\nI discussed the problem confronting the Church authorities and the Department at Cross Lake very fully with Bishop LaJeunesse, when he interviewed me at my office a few days ago. The last census report indicates that there are 635 Indians in the Cross Lake Band, and, of these, 145 are of school age. Of the total population at Cross Lake, it would appear that approximately 50% (320) are recognized as adherents to the United Church and 315 are listed as Catholics. However, in the construction of a new school on this reserve, we must be careful to keep in mind the fact that there are 791 Indians at Norway House, of whom 180 are shown as Catholics. If it is decided to establish\nestablish a residential school, accommodation would have to be provided for the orphan children from at least two or three reserves, and, in addition to this, accommodation for certain pupils whose parents may be unable to make provision for them.\n\nI suggested to Bishop Lajeunesse that we should proceed with the erection of an improved day school, just as soon as the money at our disposal will enable us to do so. I had in mind a three-roomed school, equipped to provide vocational instruction, with dormitory accommodation for approximately 50 pupils. I am not sufficiently familiar with the district to make any comment upon its agricultural possibilities. If the land is at all suitable for agricultural purposes, a small farm should be attached to the school. I think we would be well advised, also, to canvass the possibilities of promoting a fur industry in the district. It is not at all likely that we shall be in a position to proceed with the construction of the building this year. In my judgment, we should, however, before any action is taken, have a thorough investigation of the district made and a report prepared for the Department, indicating the present population, the character of the soil, and the fur-bearing animals indigenous to the adjoining territory. There is, also, the question of handicraft. I have no information before me that would indicate what progress, if any, has been made by this particular Band of Indians in the native arts and handicrafts. This matter, also, should be given consideration when the rebuilding programme is under review.\n\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nRe: Cross Lake School.\n\nI am returning herewith Mr. Jackson's memorandum of March 27th and also copy of letter received by the Minister from Bishop Lajeunesse, of The Pas, Manitoba.\n\nThe Cross Lake Residential School (R.C.) was destroyed by fire on February 25th, 1930.

Lajeunesse, O.M.I., Vicar Apostolic of Keewatin, The Pas, Man., has appointed Reverend Albert Chamberland, O. M. I., as Principal of the Indian Residential School at Cross Lake, Man. This appointment has been approved by the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Director,\n\nIn response to your request, I am submitting herewith certain comments and recommendations with respect to the rebuilding of the Cross Lake Residential School.\n\nThe Cross Lake Indian Residential School (R.C.) was destroyed by fire on February 25, 1930. At that time the school had an enrolment of 110 pupils with a per capita allowance from the Department of $175. The records indicate that, following the destruction of this school, an arrangement was made with the church authorities whereby they were allowed a per capita grant of $175 for 40 pupils. Of these pupils 10 are at Cross Lake and 30 are receiving instruction in a church-owned building at Norway House. In addition to this, a salary of $950 per annum has been allowed for a day school teacher at Cross Lake. The day school has an enrolment of 36 pupils.\n\nI have discussed the problem confronting the church authorities and the Department at Cross Lake very fully with Bishop Lajeunesse. His Lordship interviewed me at my office a few months ago.\n\nThe last census report indicates that there are 635 Indians in the Cross Lake Band and, of these, 145 are of school age. Of the total population at Cross Lake approximately 50% (320) are recognized as adherents of the United Church and 315 are listed as Catholics. However, in considering the erection of a new school at this reserve, we must be careful to keep in mind the fact that there are 791 Indians at Norway House, of whom 180 are Catholics. If it is decided to establish a residential school...\nschool, accommodation would have to be provided for the orphan children from at least two and probably three reserves and, in addition to this, accommodation for certain local pupils for whom the parents may be unable to make provision.\n\nI suggested to Bishop Lajeunesse that we should proceed with the erection of an improved day school just as soon as the money at our disposal would enable us to do so. I had in mind a school building consisting of two distinct and separate units - the first unit to consist of three or four classrooms with full basement accommodation and equipped to provide vocational instruction - net making, carpentry work, preserving of fruit, sewing, etc., and a second unit sufficiently removed from the first to escape fire hazards. In this second unit provision should be made for dormitory accommodation for approximately 50 pupils with living quarters for the members of the teaching staff. In this building, also, should be installed a furnace of sufficient capacity to provide heat for both buildings. The dining room facilities should be spacious enough to provide accommodation, not only for the resident pupils, but, in addition, accommodation for the day school pupils, who could be provided with a noonday lunch and by this provision encouraged to be regular in attendance at school.\n\nI am not sufficiently familiar with the district to make any comment upon its agricultural possibilities. If the land is at all suitable for agricultural purposes, a small farm should be established at the school. It would be well, also, to canvass the possibilities of promoting a fur industry in the district. The care of mink, for example, would provide worth-while and profitable instruction for the pupils.\n\nMay I suggest, before a final decision is reached with respect to the rebuilding of this school,\nthat a thorough investigation of the district be made by Inspector Hamilton, who might be accompanied by a capable builder or contractor. Inspector Hamilton should be asked to report upon:\n\n1. The selection of a centrally located and suitable site, close to an adequate water supply;\n2. The extent to which it might be profitable to utilize the building materials, stones, etc., that are available at the old site;\n3. The suitability of the district for farming operations and development of wild life;\n4. The approximate cost of a building such as I have roughly suggested.\n\nYou are aware that it is our intention to ask for a substantial appropriation this year with the object of promoting a health programme, designed to arrest and ultimately eradicate the ravages of T.B. amongst the members of our Indian population. We have abundant evidence at our disposal to indicate that Indian reserves have become centres of infection and are actually a menace, not only to the residents of the reserves, but to the White population as well. I feel confident we shall have the active cooperation of the church authorities in working out this programme. It is too much, however, to expect that we shall be able to provide the funds necessary for this programme on the one hand and continue to multiply the number of Indian residential schools on the other. I have no reason to think that the churches will expect us to proceed with a pretentious building programme until adequate provision has been made for the members of our Indian population now suffering from tuberculosis. I remind you of this for the reason\nthe reason that in my judgment the cost of erecting a school at Cross Lake should be kept down to the lowest possible figure. I have given it special consideration for the simple reason that the proposal does not represent a request for a new school but is simply a replacement, the claims for which have been sympathetically considered since the school was destroyed by fire 7 years ago but action on which has been deferred owing to the limited financial resources available for such projects.\n\nI am attaching hereto, for your information, copy of a letter, dated March 22, 1937, received by the Minister from Bishop Lajeunesse, and also envelope containing a number of photographs of the old building taken immediately after the fire.\n\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, Ontario,\nOctober 29, 1937.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\n\nI attach herewith memorandum from the Superintendent of Welfare and Training regarding the rebuilding of the Cross Lake Residential School. I would concur in Mr. Hoey's recommendations.\n\nIn any scheme under consideration, little dependence should be placed on the agricultural possibilities of the region which are quite limited.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, November 1, 1937.\n\nMy dear Bishop Lajeunesse:\n\nI have for acknowledgment Your Lordship's letter of October 20th, in which you express the hope that provision will be made in the Estimates now under consideration for the rebuilding of the Cross Lake Indian school.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to state that the claims advanced for a school at Cross Lake have been sympathetically considered since the destruction of the residential school by fire, seven years ago. The fact that action has been deferred can be attributed wholly to the limited financial resources available for such projects.\n\nThis year, it is my intention to ask for a substantial appropriation with the object of promoting a health programme, designed to arrest and ultimately eradicate the ravages of tuberculosis amongst the members of our Indian population. I feel confident we shall have the active cooperation of the church authorities in working out this programme. It is too much, however, to expect that we shall be able to provide the funds necessary for this programme on the one hand and to continue to multiply the number of Indian residential schools on the other. In view of all the facts, I am prepared to give special consideration to your request for a school at Cross Lake, for the simple reason that the proposal does not represent a request for a new school but a replacement, the need for which is apparent by the\n\nReverend M. Lajeunesse, O.M.I.,\nVicar Apostolic of Keewatin,\nBishop's House,\nThe Pas, Man.\nnumber of children of school age in the district.\n\nI do not feel that I can promise you definitely at this date that a school will be built by the Government at Cross Lake during the coming fiscal year, but I am prepared to submit, for your consideration and for any comment you may care to offer, a rough outline of an improved day school, which would be less expensive to construct and yet adapted to fully meet the needs of the Indian population.\n\nI have in mind an improved day school consisting of two distinct and separate units - the first unit to consist of three or four classrooms with full basement accommodation and equipped to provide vocational instruction, net-making, carpentry work, preserving of fruit, sewing, etc., and a second unit in which provision should be made for dormitory accommodation for approximately 50 pupils and with living quarters for the members of the teaching staff. The dining room accommodation in the second unit would enable the teachers in charge to provide a noonday lunch for the day school pupils and thus encourage regularity of attendance.\n\nIt is my understanding that the agricultural possibilities of the district are somewhat limited, but a small farm should be established at the school. This farm might well become a small game sanctuary for the encouragement of wild life. An experiment might also be made in the care of beaver or mink. The care of these animals would provide very useful and profitable instruction for the children in attendance at the institution.\n\nI regret to state that I have not at my disposal sufficient information to indicate the extent to which it might be profitable to utilise the building material.\nmaterial now at the old site. I do feel, however, that the new school should be erected on a site centrally located and with an abundant supply of water.\n\nI shall be glad to have Your Lordship's criticism and comments on this proposal.\n\nWith kindest personal regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOttawa, December 1st, 1937.\n\nDr. H.W.

Hamilton at his office, and was fortunate enough, at the same time, to meet Mr M. Christianson, the General Superintendent of Agencies. We discussed many matters concerning the Indian work in general, but one thing was discussed at some length, namely, Indian Education, particularly as it applies to the Indians of this agency, and the northern districts generally.\n\nAt the conclusion of our talk, Mr Christianson asked me to write to you, and give you the views I held concerning this particular phase of the Indian work.\n\nFirst of all, the problem of educating the children of the Indians who live in this north country, is entirely different from the problem of educating those who live outside on the prairies. The northern Indian has a distinctly different way of living and earning his living; and apart from the few traders, missionaries, and government officials, he comes into contact with but few of the white population.\n\nThe northern Indian does not really require very much education from a scholastic viewpoint. If he acquires a grade four standing, he has all that he needs in that way, and he can acquire this if he goes to school from the age of seven years until he is fourteen, or even thirteen, after which, his father or guardian, should take him in hand, and teach him how to earn his living.\n\nThe establishment of 'Residential Schools' in this north country, for the education of Indian children, is, in my opinion, a mistake. There are but three ways for the northern Indian to earn his livelihood, namely, Hunting, Trapping and Fishing, (apart from a little freighting he may get in the summer time), and none of these things can possibly be taught him at a residential school. The difference between the northern and the prairie Indian can here be noticed, as the prairie Indian usually returns to his reserve, after leaving the residential school, and begins to farm, having learned much of farming at the residential school, further. To build and equip a residential school, to accommodate say 100 pupils, would require a cash outlay of $150,000 at the very least. In addition, there would be the annual grant of $17,500. The same number of pupils could be given all the education -\n\nR.A. Hoey Esq;\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.;\neducation they will ever need, in at most, three, Day Schools situated right on their reserves, and three such schools could be established at very much less cost than one Residential school, and the cost of operation would be very much less. There are, in this agency, ten day schools, (two of which are but 'seasonal' schools), which accommodate approximately twice as many pupils as the Norway House Residential School, and at little more than half the cost, and the pupils of these schools get, as a general rule, all the education they need.\n\nWith regard to the sending out of pupils from the north country to residential schools where a higher education is given, such as Brandon, and keeping them there until they are eighteen years of age; this, in my opinion, is the greatest mistake of all. There are two or three instances of this here at Norway House. These pupils returned here after graduating from Brandon school. They have a better scholastic education than those who remained here and went to day school, but they have absolutely no idea about making a living in the bush, and their higher education is of no benefit to them whatever.\n\nThe ideal way to educate the Indian children of this northern country is through the day schools, situated on their reserves. They are thus with their own people all the time, and in addition to daily attendance at the day school, they are learning from their parents the rudiments of the methods they themselves will have to adopt after they leave school, to make their living. This gives them better all round equipment for a livelihood than can be acquired by attending the residential schools.\n\nThe foregoing are simply my own opinions of course, and are the conclusions I have arrived at after three and a half years of experience in the north. As already stated, they are forwarded to you at Mr M. Christianson's request, and I trust they may be of some little use to you.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nApril 8th,\n1936.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter, conveying copy of Report made by Mr. Lazenby concerning the education of Indians in Northern Reserves. I expect to meet all our workers in Manitoba at the time of the Conference in June and will take that opportunity of discussing the matters therein raised\u2014particularly the general problem of educating Indians for the method of livelihood which they must follow. I shall be glad to let you have a report on this on my return.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD.MT\nOttawa, April 6, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith, for your information, copy of a letter dated November 1, 1937, sent forward by the Minister to Bishop Lajeunesse, of The Pas, Manitoba. This letter, you will note, is self-explanatory. Bishop Lajeunesse replied to the Minister on November 15, 1937, and commented very favourably on the proposal submitted to him for consideration. It is just possible that we may have, in the supplementary estimates of this year, an appropriation of approximately $25,000 for the construction of the first unit of the school at Cross Lake. If this appropriation is available, we have in mind the construction of an educational unit to be known as an improved day school, consisting of three or four classrooms and, if possible, full basement accommodation.\n\nI am anxious to secure from you the fullest possible information with respect to a suitable site at Cross Lake; the location of the school; the amount of material - stone or brick - that may be still available from the foundations of the school destroyed by fire a few years ago.\n\nI should like you to express an opinion, also, with respect to the actual construction of the school: should tenders be called for or might it be more economical to build it with local labour, under the direction and supervision of a capable foreman? The suggestion has also been made that, if a grant of approximately $25,000 were made to the church authorities, they could proceed with the work of construction less expensively than this work could be undertaken by this Department. I want you to express your opinion very freely on all these matters.\n\nI should like to secure a definite statement from you with respect to the number of classrooms which, in your judgment, may be needed. If four classrooms, capable of seating approximately 35 pupils each, were erected, one of these, in addition to the basement, might be used for vocational instruction, sewing, hand loom weaving, crochet work, etc.\n\nThe feeling here is that most of the lumber and material necessary for the construction of a school will have to be shipped in, probably from Winnipeg. We have no definite information, however, on this point. It will be necessary for you to visit Cross Lake almost immediately to secure for us the information desired. I want you to feel perfectly free to express any opinions you may have in mind when forwarding the information requested.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nR. A. Eddy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nP. G.

(RG 10, Volume 6160, file 577-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No; 123-1-1 of the 6th April, which I received yesterday the 19th April, having reference to the proposed erection of an improved Indian Day School at the Cross Lake Reserve, and enclosing a copy of a letter on the same subject, addressed by The Honourable the Minister, to the Rt Rev: Bishop Lajeunesse.\n\nI have to-day dispatched a radio telegraphic message to you, advising that it is impossible to visit the Cross Lake Reserve by any method of travel now, until after the break up of the ice. The mail plane has ceased operations with yesterday's delivery of mail, and the ice conditions are now too bad to travel by dog team. I will, however, make the trip as soon as possible after open water.\n\nIn the meantime, until I can visit Cross Lake, I might reply to some portions of your letter.\n\nWith regard to a site for the school, at Cross Lake, there would be no difficulty of any sort.\n\nAs to material still available from the old school that was destroyed by fire, I may say that almost all the walls, of stone masonry, are still standing, about 30 feet or more high. These walls are very thick, and the razing of them would entail a considerable amount of labour, which will need to be considered in the cost, if this material is to be used in the construction of the new school.\n\nWith reference to the actual construction of the school, I would suggest that this be done by day labour, under the direct supervision of some capable and trustworthy foreman. If this method were adopted, the foreman would need to bring with him two or three experienced stone masons, and two or three carpenters, to do the actual building, and local Indians could be hired as labourers. In this case, it would be necessary of course to keep accurate record daily of the work done by each individual, and as there is no permanent Departmental employee located at Cre's Lake, this duty would have to be given to some other trustworthy person; probably the Priest in charge of the mission might look after this.\n\nI do not favour the suggestion that a grant of approximately $25,000\n\nR.A.Hoey Esq;\nSuptt of Welfare & Training\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.,\n$25,000 be handed to the church authorities, and allow them to proceed with the work of construction, because in the great majority of cases, the church officials are not business people, and they are more concerned with church interests in cases of this nature than they are with Indian Department interests, and at the conclusion of the project, the Indian Affairs Branch would almost certainly be asked to pay out considerably more funds than originally granted. I have learned this from experience.\n\nWith regard to the calling for tenders, and having the work done by contract; I do not think that the work could be done any more economically this way, than by day labour. With a contractor, it is of course all to his interest to get the job done as quickly as possible, and in this endeavour might possibly skimp the work in places, in order to make time. He would also no doubt want to bring his own crew with him, and this would deprive a number of the local Indians of much needed work. It would also be necessary to appoint an inspector of construction to oversee the work, which would be an added expense.\n\nWith regard to classroom accommodation: I am of the opinion that three rooms would be ample. According to the Minister's letter to the Bishop, the idea is, to provide for 50 resident pupils. The large majority of these would of course have to be recruited from other reserves of the agency, and there should be no difficulty in that. However, as to day school pupils, I may say that the highest quarterly average attendance attained during the past two years, was 20, and the average quarterly attendance for these two years, is 14.8. If classroom accommodation is provided for a total of 80 pupils, including the 50 resident ones, this should cover all the requirements I think, and three rooms, with the basement, would be sufficient, seating approximately 35 pupils each.\n\nThe lumber, sash, doors, windows, and other building materials for the construction, would have to be shipped in from Winnipeg.\n\nI would like, here, to mention a point that has probably not as yet been considered; and that is, that this new school should be erected here at Norway House, instead of at Cross Lake. At Norway House, the school would be within easy reach of the agency, and the doctor and the hospital; and could be visited much more frequently than if it were at Cross Lake. If the school were established here of course, all the materials for the building would have to be provided, as there would not be any stone from the old building walls to use. However, the Rev. Father Chamberland, who is the Priest in charge to act as Principal at Cross Lake has spoken to me about this proposed new school, and it is his desire to have it erected at Whiskeyjack Portage, which is about 15 miles from the old school site at Cross Lake in which case again, none of the stone from the old building would be available for use. Another consideration is freighting facilities. At Norway House, all through the navigation season, we have a weekly boat from Winnipeg; whereas at Whiskeyjack, to where freight for Cross Lake is shipped, there are only two boat trips a year made, by a small tug and barge, one trip -\ntrip is made about the second week in June, and the other about two weeks before the close of navigation in the fall. This point should no doubt be considered whether the school is built either at Cross Lake or Whiskeyjack.\n\nWith regard to the resident pupils, which will have to be recruited from all the reserves of the agency, there is no greater merit in having the school at Cross Lake than at Norway House. As you are no doubt aware, since the old school was destroyed by fire, the Cross Lake P.C. Indian Residential School has been operated in two separate units, one at Cross Lake, and the other here at Norway House. The pupilage allowed is 30. At Cross Lake there are 10 resident girl pupils, and here at Norway House there are 20 resident pupils; 10 boys and 10 girls. If the building were built at Norway House, on the present R.C.Mission site, there would be no difficulty in getting needed materials week by week as required, whereas, as stated above, there are only two trips a year made by boat to carry freight to Cross Lake, and unless everything needed were sent out on the first trip, the work might possibly be held up. There is no telegraphic communication with Cross Lake, and mail service but once every two weeks, and at Norway House there is radio telegraph, and a weekly mail service. In these circumstances, if there happened to be a shortage of material at Cross Lake, it would take considerable time to procure it. At Cross Lake, they have a new day school building, erected about two years ago. If the proposed new improved school were to be built at Norway House, I would recommend that dormitory accommodation for about 60 pupils be provided, and the same classroom accommodation as suggested if the school were to be built at Cross Lake, namely, three rooms, for about 35 pupils each.\n\nThe advantages of having this school at Norway House occurred to me, and I have simply presented them for your consideration.\n\nAs the mail service to and from Norway House has now been suspended until open water, this letter will not reach you for some weeks after writing.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.C. Kennedy,\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to Mr. R.A. Hoey's letter No; 125-1-1 of the 6th April, and my reply thereto of the 20th April, regarding the proposed new improved Indian day school, which it is proposed to construct at the Roman Catholic Mission at the Cross Lake reserve, I beg to advise you that I returned last night from a visit to the Cross Lake reserve.\n\nI spent a day at the R.C.Mission with the Rev. A. Chamberland O.M.I., the Priest in charge, and with him, went over the ground carefully.\n\nAs stated in my letter of the 20th April, there are still the masonry walls of the old school building standing, some of the materials of which could no doubt be used in the construction of the new school. These walls are about 30 feet high, I should judge, and are over two feet thick. There is one portion of these walls, which were the walls of the chapel portion of the old school, which are in very good condition, with the exception of two small cracks in the masonry. The outside measurements of this portion are 36' X 60', and one end adjoins the walls of the main building. Father Chamberland suggested that probably these walls might serve as they are, for one of the units of the new school, provided the two cracks mentioned were properly repaired, which would not be difficult. However, I think that a more expert opinion than mine should be secured before definitely deciding that these walls were sound enough to make use of as they are. There is a basement under this chapel portion, which is of course full of rubbish at present. There is stone in the old walls, sufficient to build both units of the proposed new school, and all the foundations, as well as one can tell at present, are still sound. Apart from the stone, there is no material left from the old school which could be used in the new one.\n\nThe site at Cross Lake is good, being on the lake shore, and of course close to an ample supply of good water. There is a very good lot of buildings, such as barn, machine shed, workshop, hen house, etc., and all these are in first class condition. There is also a small acreage of land cultivated, but sufficient to take care of their needs for garden purposes, grain for the animals and fowl, and so on.\n\nAll materials such as windows, doors, roofing, flooring, hardware etc., would have to be shipped in; from Winnipeg which is the nearest shipping center.\n\nIn my letter of the 20th April, I mentioned a suggestion\u2014\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.;\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6160, file 577-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nthat consideration might be given to Norway House as the location for the new school. I discussed this matter with Father Chamberland, but he could not, of course make any definite statement without the sanction of his Bishop. However, both Norway House and Cross Lake have each a number of advantages that the other lacks. Norway House has by far the better shipping and communication facilities. From Winnipeg, the freight rate to Norway House is 60\u00a2 per 100 lbs, whereas the rate to Cross Lake, via Whiskeyjack Portage, (usually but twice a year), is between $1.25 and $1.50 per 100 lbs. Norway House has weekly freight and mail service throughout the summer. Cross Lake has but two freight deliveries a year; one in June and one in September and mail service every two weeks. Norway House has radio-telegraph service, and Cross Lake has none. At Norway House, however, they already have outbuildings, and a small acreage of farm land under cultivation. At Norway House they have some buildings, but there is practically no land that can be cultivated excepting small patches for gardens. It would be impossible to operate a farm, even a small one, in connection with the school at Norway House, but this is possible on a small scale at Cross Lake. The raising of cattle would be out of the question at Norway House, there being no pasturage or land to cultivate. However, it is the consensus of opinion here that the Indian schools would be better off as far as health is concerned, if the cows were done away with, and Drimilk or Trumilk used. At the present time, the United Church Residential School at Norway House keep a few cows, but all the milk they get is boiled before it is used. I am of the opinion that all these cows are T.B. infected, and Dr Turpel has expressed this opinion many times. If the new school were to be established at Norway House, it would be much better from the Agency and the Medical standpoints also.\n\nThis letter, and my letter to Mr R.A.Hoey of the 20th April, contain, I think, all the information requested in Mr Hoey's letter of the 6th April. If any further information is required I shall be glad to be advised.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.Lazenby\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, June 10, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HOEY:-\n\nRight Reverend M. Lajeunesse, O.M.I., visited the Department on May 26th and made enquiries regarding the possibility of our proceeding with the Cross Lake School. I told him that, as far as I was aware, an amount would be included in the supplementary estimates.\n\nHe pointed out that for the past 10 years the Reverend Sisters at Cross Lake Mission had been residing in a very poor building and therefore Bishop Lajeunesse would appreciate if the building in which it is intended to provide dormitory accommodation would be built first. He further recommended that the school be built on the site of the former school as he considered there was a quantity of material there that could be used and, at the same time, there is a good farm. He also mentioned that a barn had been erected a year or so before the fire and that this barn is in good condition.\n\nBishop Lajeunesse called at the office again on May 30th and stated that in the meantime he had an interview with the Honourable the Minister, to whom he expressed the above suggestion. Honourable Mr. Crerar advised him to bring his suggestions to your attention.\n\nToday (June 10th) the attached letter, dated April 20th, was received from Indian Agent Lazenby.

It would be necessary to have definite information as to the size, dimensions and layout of the existing foundations before plans could be prepared on this basis.\n\nWith reference to the chapel portion of the old building, the outside dimensions of which are 36'-0\" x 60'-0\", the foundations might be used for four classrooms, approximately 17'-0\" x 24'-0\" with accommodation for 24 pupils in each, provided this unit is not required to have inside communication with any subsequent development. It is noted in regard to the chapel portion of the building that whereas Mr. Lazenby states in his report that the outside measurements of this portion are 36'-0\" x 60'-0\", the plans of this building on file in this office show the dimensions to be 36'-0\" x 67'-0\".\n\nWith regard to.....\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nWith regard to carrying out this work by day labour, it is understood that there is Indian labour available in the district but that all skilled and experienced workmen will have to be brought in from outside the district.\n\nIt will obviously be necessary for an inspection to be made of the existing walls and foundations by a Departmental representative, experienced in construction work, and further information should be obtained regarding materials and labour, and particulars regarding building conditions and requirements in order that this work might be properly carried out.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch should also be asked to complete and forward to us a copy of our Building Data Form in connection with the proposed building.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nT.S.

It is considered that the foundations of the old buildings might be used for the new if they are adaptable to requirements; also that an inspection will have to be made before anything definite can be determined as to what material will be required.\n\nWill you kindly have prepared a copy of the building data form in connection with the proposed building.\n\nDirector.\nMr. Macdonald,\n\nThis form goes back to your personal file.

Jackson,\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nEnclosures.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 9, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nWith reference to Mr. Jackson's memorandum of February 6 I am returning herewith snapshots of the Cross Lake R.C. residential school.\n\nDirector.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPP\nSir,\n\nAt the request of Councillor William Thomas Towers, No; 320 Norway House Band, I am writing to the Department to see if anything might be done, to have the case of George Paynter reviewed, with the object of securing this boy's freedom from the Stoney Mountain Penitentiary on parole.\n\nThe boy George Paynter, was convicted, I understand, in August 1930, of setting fire to the Cross Lake Roman Catholic Indian Residential School, which resulted in the deaths of 12 of the pupils of the school, and the Sister Superior. I understand also, that the boy's preliminary hearing was held at Norway House, and that he was committed for trial. The trial was held in Winnipeg, and the boy was sentenced to life imprisonment, since which time he has been confined in the penitentiary at Stoney Mountain, Manitoba.\n\nThis boy, George Paynter, lost both parents when very young, and was adopted by William Thomas Towers at the age of 5 years. When 7 years of age, he was sent to the R.C. Residential School at Cross Lake, where he attended for approximately nine years. He was 16 years of age at the time of the burning of the school in February 1930. Another pupil was concerned in the burning of the school, with George Paynter, but was given a short term of imprisonment only, and released. This boy's name, I am told, was Nelson Hughes.\n\nWilliam Thomas Towers, the guardian of George Paynter, is, I may say, a very fine type of Indian. He is at present one of the Councillors of the Norway House Band, and has been a Chief. He also received the King's Coronation medal. He is a good living man, industrious very honest and dependable, and if George Paynter were allowed to return to him, he would be under good influence.\n\nWilliam Thomas Towers informs me that when George Paynter was at home from the school on holidays, he was always obedient, and never any trouble. If the boy's case were reviewed, his age at the time of the offence might be taken into consideration; also that he has now served almost eight years of his sentence.\n\nWill you kindly advise me if anything might be done in the above matter,\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nP.G. Lezenby\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept' of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa,\nApril 27, 1939.\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 18th instant with reference to George Paynter who was given a life sentence in 1930 for setting fire to the Cross Lake Indian residential school.\n\nVery careful consideration has been given to the contents of your letter but at the present time the Department is not favourably disposed to make representations to the Justice Department for Paynter's parole.\n\nThe offence which he committed was extremely serious and the results appalling; besides, he has only served a comparatively short time in view of the sentence that he received. It is extremely doubtful if the Justice Department would look with favour on any application for parole.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nP. G. Lazenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nNorway House, Feb. 2, 1940.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT ON NORWAY HOUSE FOR JANUARY 1940.\n\nCROSS LAKE RESERVE\n\nI also inspected the new R.C. Residential school building at this reserve and the United Church day school.\n\nP. G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nFORGET THE TARGET FOR PICTURE\n\nDONE OVER.\nOttawa,\nMay 23, 1940.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nPrevious to the completion of the new Cross Lake Indian Residential School it was understood that some of the pupils for whom institutional care is necessary were accommodated in a building owned by the Church authorities at Norway House.\n\nIt is presumed that these children have already been transferred to the new Cross Lake School. If not, they should be taken there immediately as the Department will not consider allowing any further grant for pupils living in the building at Norway House. We will, of course, continue allowing salary for the teacher of the Jack River R.C. Day School.\n\nI am writing to Indian Agent Lazenby and instructing him to make certain that all Catholic children in the vicinity of Norway House who require institutional care will be sent to the Cross Lake Indian Residential School. It is understood, of course, that as many as possible of these children should continue attending the Jack River R.C. Day School. The Agent is also being informed that he should point out to the Indians that children being sent to Cross Lake are really receiving preferred consideration due to the fact that the latter school is fireproof.\n\nI should appreciate an acknowledgment of this letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRt. Rev. M. Lajeunesse, O.M.I.,\nBishop of Keewatin,\nThe Pas, Man.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nMay 23, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhile it is presumed that the children who have been accommodated in the Church-owned building at Norway House have now been transferred to the Cross Lake Indian Residential School I am communicating with Bishop Lajeunesse advising him that if this action has not been taken it should be done at once.\n\nAll Catholic children who require institutional care should be sent to the new Cross Lake Residential School. It is understood, of course, that parents who are in a position to support their children should keep them at home and have them attend the Jack River R.C. Day School.\n\nThe Department does not anticipate any difficulty in having children requiring institutional care in the vicinity of Norway House go to Cross Lake but you should point out to the parents of the Catholic children that those who are sent to that school are receiving preferred treatment in view of the fact that the new school is fireproof.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. P. G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nNorway House, Man:\n14th May 1940.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that Rev. Henry Boissin O.M.I., the Priest in charge of the Jack River R.C. Mission and school, has been to the office today to consult with me regarding a proposed rearrangement of the pupils.\n\nAs you are aware, for some years past the pupils of the Cross Lake R.C. Indian Residential School have been divided between Cross Lake, where there were 10 resident pupils, and Jack River school at Norway House, where there have been 20 resident pupils.\n\nFather Boissin suggests that, since the new R.C. Residential School at Cross Lake is in operation, the Jack River School be allowed to retain 20 girl pupils only, without any boys, and that the boy pupils now at the Jack River school be disposed of as follows:\n\nPupil No; 124 - Alex Ross\n\" 133 - William Ross\n\" 134 - John Wm McKay\n\" 135 - John James Menow\n\" 136 - David Menow\n\nall to be transferred from the Jack River School to the Cross Lake School. The first three of the above five pupils belong to the Cross Lake Band, and that is where their homes are. The other two belong to Norway House Band, but Father Boissin advises me that their parents are willing to have them go to the Cross Lake School.\n\nFather Boissin also recommends that the following three pupils be discharged;\n\nPupil No; 119 - John James Menow Aged 14\n\" 131 - Abel Taylor \" 13 past\n\" 128 - Tom Harper \" 13 past\n\nIf the above suggestion of Father Boissin's is approved, he will recruit enough girl pupils to replace these boys, and bring his pupilage again up to 20 as authorized, and have none but girl pupils in residence, and the Jack River R.C. Day School will carry on as previously.\n\nWill you please advise me if the Department will approve of the above. The 20 pupils at Jack River School will of course be in addition to the pupilage allowed for the Cross Lake R.C. Residential School at Cross Lake, and will form a part of that school as before.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDep't of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6160, file 577-1, part 2)\nCross Lake, March 19th, 1941\n\nDear Sir;\n\nIt is the first opportunity I have this year to report about our Ex. Pupils Club. I should say, I think, that it has shown some improvements. Their garden, although this year's crop has been a failure all around, has yielded more than the previous summer. Three new houses have been built, and completed. Two have been started. The members have kept their good will and we expect them to make more efforts to improve their condition. However when one deals with the Indian problem, he has to keep in mind, that not only one aspect of their mentality, but to a certain extent all their nature have to be changed. It is evident that this can not be done in a couple years of training. One can not expect astonishing and immediate results. If there is any progress, even if hardly noticeable, we should be satisfied, because it is a step forward, a greater aptitude to receive more education, more training and thus to come to a better living.\n\nI have kept in mind the idea of having a small carpenter shop for our alumni. This project starts to be realized at present. We use the old Day School for this purpose and the tools you have supplied. This, if properly managed, should bring them to make furnitures for their homes, toboggans, snow-shoes, etc. We have to bring ambition in their heart. We have to keep them busy. The more they will work, the more they will like to work and the more they will be fitted to do so.\n\nThere is lots they can do by their own means. They need somebody to push them to do it, to tell them how to do it, and encourage them while they do it.\nBrother Menard has done very much in this regard so far. To meet adequately this problem it would require all his time, what he can not do, at the present time, although he is doing a great deal. If circumstances permit later, I would be only too glad to see him look after this question more extensively.\n\nIn a close future the number of our ex-pupils will amount to a couple hundred and over. We have this year more than seventy-five children from this reserve. You can see what opportunity we will have to train them. I am well convinced that the good done by the school will avail to very little if there is no post-school adapted training. When a graduate is leaving school and goes back home, in a very short time he is not different that the ordinary Indians. I believe that the real work has to be done after school time, I emphasize this and I am sure it is important.\n\nNew problems will have to be faced within twenty years. Twenty years ago the Cross Lake population was around four hundred. It is close now around eight hundred. This means that in a same period of time the population normally should be up to twelve hundred at least. The trapping ground will be the same, if not smaller as the Provincial Government has started to lease to white trappers trapping grounds around the country where our Indians are trapping. As probably it will be the same case for the surrounding reserves, you can see what will happen, and the gravity of the question. We should foresee this situation and act accordingly.\n\nI am very pleased to hear that the Department is going to establish muskrats farms around this settlement and in many other places. It is a very wise, and vital undertaking, and should be given an immediate attention. The soonerest will be the better. These farms should provide a good amount of earning to the Indians. However, in the course of time if the number of these farms increases considerably the prices for the muskrats will drop probably. Nevertheless it will always be a great source of revenues.\n\nI am confident that in these farms the beavers being well protected will multiply rapidly. To my opinion, if this happens and I believe it will, it should help very much the Indians. There will be always a good demand for beaver and the prices should keep high.\nThese sources of revenues are going to be the most important ones, but at the same time gardening, home industries, etc. will prove very helpful to them. They have to be increased and encouraged.\n\nWe have already try this with the Ex-Pupils and it is our intention to keep on. We are studying also about the goats. Doctor Corrigan has expressed us his great wish to see us experimenting with them. I have written to Rev. Father Brochet of Pine Falls to find out what are the results he has with them and the possibility to have the Indians keep them in a profitable way. I did not get the answer yet, but as soon as he replies to my letter, I will decide and let you know. So far I am inclined to think it would be a very useful animal for the Indians.\n\nI am sending you a requisition for building materials and also for some tools. I am fully aware of the war conditions in which we are, but I would be very obliged if you could buy these necessary materials and tools.\n\nI feel very thankful for what you have done in the past. I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\nAlbert Chamberland O.M.I.\nPrincipal\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 3, 1941.\n\nDear Father Chamberland:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of March 19, in which you summarize the progress that has been made in the promotion of an ex-pupil association at Cross Lake.\n\nThe report on the whole is to me very encouraging, particularly the vocational training for which you appear to have made provision. I was interested to learn of the substantial increase that has taken place in the Indian population at Cross Lake during the last 20 years. You point out that this steadily increasing population must of necessity create problems with which we shall have to deal from time to time. You will be glad to learn of the progress made in the promotion of areas suitable for the propagation of muskrats in the Saskatchewan delta, and it is my hope that attempts will be made to develop somewhat similar areas at other reserves and, in addition to this, a number of beaver sanctuaries, where such sanctuaries can be established with prospect of success.\n\nI have not had a report at any time within the last year from Father Brachet in respect to the success he has had in establishing a goat herd at the Fort Alexander School. It is my hope, however, that this project has been successful and that you, too, will be able to establish a herd at Cross Lake. If the Indians are prepared to destroy dogs on the reserve, other than those absolutely necessary for the transportation of goods, I feel confident that goats would prove a very valuable asset to a great many of our Indian bands -\n\nRev. A. Chamberland, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nCross Lake, via Norway House, Man.\nbands. In any event, you are likely to hear from Father Brachet in due course.\n\nThe Minister is constantly reminding us that the courses provided at our residential schools should become increasingly more practical and more vocational in character, and it is gratifying to learn that the course provided at Cross Lake is being brought into conformity with the Minister's wishes. I am sending forward with this letter a summary of a report submitted by me to the Director for the month of November, 1940. This report indicates that remarkable progress has been made in the organization of worthwhile vocational projects in the province of British Columbia, and it is my hope that you will find this report interesting and suggestive.\n\nThe supplies referred to in your communication will be purchased and sent forward to you in due course.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nAugust 1, 1941\n\nThe Honourable T. A. Crerar,\nMinister of Mines and Natural Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nHonourable and Dear Sir:\n\nIn compliance with your wishes expressed during your recent visit here in The Pas, I am now exposing the conditions of tuberculosis in which the Indians of Norway House and neighborhood are suffering and I wish to offer you our services for the foundation of a sanatorium at that place.\n\nIn the five reserves coming under the jurisdiction of the Norway House agency (Norway House, Cross Lake, Oxford House, God's Lake and Island Lake) there are about four thousand (4,000) treaty Indians that are actually deprived of all medical care in what regards tuberculosis. During my visit in that district this summer, I was told that whenever a patient was found suffering from this disease, there was nothing further that could be done for him. He was obliged to return to his home to die a miserable death after having spread the germs of his disease among his own people at home and neighborhood.\n\nThe idea of having a sanatorium in this central district in the North does not originate with us; it was Dr. Turple who first expressed the thought. Dr. Corrigan also recognizes such a necessity.\n\nThe main reasons rendering such an institution indispensable can be grouped as follows:\n\n1. The hospital at Norway House is already too small to accept ordinary cases and is actually unable to offer further accommodations for contagious cases as tuberculosis.\n2. In having a separate building as a sanatorium for these cases, the same doctor could look after both groups of patients, hence a reason of economy on this point.\n\n3. Owing to the weekly air mail service existing between Norway House and other points, considerable travelling expenses could be saved thereby.\n\n4. Norway House is also central and can be supplied at low cost by water transportation over Lake Winnipeg.\n\n5. Indians suffering from tuberculosis will easily come to Norway House which has ever been their centre for obtaining provisions and other supplies, while they would never go to Winnipeg where they would die of lonesomeness.\n\n6. In the summer, travelling to Winnipeg from Norway House is not too costly and in the event of some patient requiring special surgical care, he could always be sent if necessary after being prepared and disposed to while at the Norway House sanatorium.\n\nWhat we have to offer in co-operation with you in establishing such an institution is this:\n\nSince the re-opening of the Indian Residential School at Cross Lake, we are no longer allowed to have any treaty children at the school at Norway House. Because of this, our school at Norway House is practically vacant. It is only being used as a day school, which we could easily otherwise provide by a separate building. Such a move would leave the actual school totally and immediately convertible into a sanatorium for tubercular cases. In fact, we could immediately have accommodations for fifteen patients without a single cent being disbursed by the Government for constructions.\n\nWe believe this undertaking so necessary and so urgent that we are willing to receive T.B. patients for whatever retribution the Department of Indian Affairs\nWill judge reasonable. The basis for such estimations can well be that of the expenses per capita incurred for the maintenance of the Dynavor Sanatorium. All we ask is a little help to begin this work.\n\nWe hope, Honourable Sir, that this summary of information will enable you to understand the situation at Norway House and that despite our hard times you will be able to find means and ways to remedy existing conditions among the above mentioned Indians for what we think is a minimum initial cost and which can easily be effected this very summer.\n\nsigned: Martin \"ajeunesse, O, M.I.\nVicat Apostolic of Keewatin\nMEMORANDUM\n\n5th August, 1941\n\nThe Deputy Minister.\n\nI am attaching hereto a letter addressed to the Minister by Bishop Lajeunesse in which he suggests that a sanatorium be established at Norway House and offers to set aside for this purpose the former residential school at that point on the understanding that the per capita allowance would be equivalent to the cost of maintenance of patients at the Dynevor Sanatorium.\n\nIn addition to reporting on Bishop Lajeunesse's representations from a medical standpoint, the Minister would like to have some information as to the construction and condition of the Roman Catholic school at Norway House and the number of day school pupils that have been attending the school.

I have had to delay in answering your letter until a report could be obtained from officers of the Indian Affairs Branch in Manitoba.\n\nI fully realize that there are many cases of tuberculosis among the 4,000 Indians of the Norway House Agency who are not receiving treatment.

When this has been accomplished, and when more funds are available, it is the aim of the Department to extend this control campaign to the more remote areas. At the same time there are actually 82 Indians under treatment for tuberculosis in the Norway House Indian Hospital. If funds are available, officials of the Indian Affairs Branch would like to enlarge this hospital as the need for more treatment is recognized.\n\nAt present the Department is treating over 90 Indian patients for tuberculosis in Manitoba.

I attach herewith a plan of the school building supplied by Acting Indian Agent Roberts.\n\nIt is a wooden building situated on the Jack River, seven miles from Norway House Indian Agency. The only means of transportation is by water in summer and dog team in winter. It would be difficult for the doctor at Norway House to take charge of patients located in this building. There were 36 pupils in attendance last year, 22 being treaty Indian children and 14 non-treaty and white children. Of these 19 were residing in the institution last year, of which 12 were Treaty Indians and 7 were half-breed.\n\nAt present the institution is staffed by 6 Grey Nuns, the priest in charge, his assistant, and two lay brothers.\n\nThe average cost of medical services for the Indians of Norway House area is $20,000 per annum. This will probably be higher as Doctor Corrigan is treating more tuberculosis patients than were cared for formerly.\n\nDirector of Indian Affairs\nTo be returned to Indian Affairs when signed\n2nd page re-written.\n\nOttawa, Ontario\nOctober 8, 1941\n\nDear Bishop Lejeune:\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letter of August 1, in which you propose the establishment of a sanatorium, using the former Roman Catholic Residential School, situated on the Jack River, near Norway House.

I understand that the church buildings are situated on Jack River approximately seven miles from the Norway House Indian Agency. As the only means of transportation is by water in the summertime and dog team in winter, it would be difficult for the Doctor at Norway House to take charge of and properly look after the patients in that building if it were turned into a sanitarium.

Martin Lajeunesse, O.M.I.,\nVicar-Apostolic of Keewatin.\nOttawa,\nJune 16, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRev. M. LaJeunesse, O.M.I., Vicar-Apostolic of Keewatin, visited the Department recently and discussed with the officials of the Welfare & Training Service the possibility of increasing the pupilage at the Cross Lake Indian Residential School. In view of the fact that the Medical Officer at the Norway House Agency had expressed the opinion that the Cross Lake School was overcrowded, the Bishop suggested that the overcrowding at Cross Lake could be overcome by again placing children in the building owned by the Diocese of Keewatin near Norway House. This particular building has accommodation for approximately 25 children and was used for several years following the destruction of the Cross Lake Residential School by fire some years ago.\n\nThe Bishop pointed out that the overcrowding at the Cross Lake Residential School was due to the large number of children on the Cross Lake Reserve for whom educational facilities are necessary. By placing 25 children in the building at Norway House the number accommodated at the present Cross Lake Residential School could be reduced to 100. At the present time the authorized pupilage at Cross Lake is 100. The Bishop asked that the pupilage at the Beauval Residential School, which is also under his jurisdiction, be reduced from 100 to 80 and the\npupilage at Cross Lake increased from 100 to 120. This would not involve any increased expenditure on the part of the Department.\n\nI feel that the Bishop's suggestion is worthy of favourable consideration and I, therefore, recommend that the Bishop's request be approved.\n\nFor your information I enclose a letter which has just been received from Bishop La Jeunesse.\n\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs.

McGill\n\nRe Over-crowding at Cross Lake Indian Residential School. Your File 123-1-13\n\nPlease refer to your memorandum of the 16th instant in the above matter.\n\nI have had an opportunity of discussing it with the Minister and he approves of steps being taken to remove a number of the children from the school and permitting them to be temporarily transferred to the building owned by the church in the vicinity of Norway House. It should be distinctly understood by the church that this is only a temporary arrangement and is to take care of the present situation only so long as the Department is unable to provide day school accommodation at Cross Lake.\n\nIt is somewhat unfortunate that the crowding at the school should have been permitted. Since the receipt of your memorandum I have had an opportunity of reading Doctor Corrigan's report of March 15th and I note that when the school was re-opened Doctor Corrigan pointed out to Father Chamberlain that the enrolment was exceeding 80.\n\nYour attention is again drawn to the letter written by the Minister to Bishop Lajeunesse of 17th March, 1938. It is somewhat unfortunate that we did not proceed with the building of the day school first rather than the residential school. However this was not done because it seemed more convenient at the time to make use of the foundation and walls of the old building which had been destroyed by fire.\n\nThe need for day school accommodation should also be kept in mind and plans made to construct the new buildings as and when funds are available.\n\nThe letter Mr. Phelan received from Bishop Lajeunesse is returned herewith.\n\nChief Executive Assistant.\nOttawa,\nJuly 3, 1945.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your recent visit to the Department and also your letter of June 8, addressed to Mr. Phelan, the Minister has approved of transferring a small group of children from Cross Lake to the building that you have available at Norway House, in order to avoid crowding in the Cross Lake Residential School. From July 1, 1945, we are reducing the pupilage at the Beauval Residential School from 100 to 80 and increasing the pupilage at the Cross Lake Residential School from 100 to 120.\n\nIn preparing the quarterly returns, the names of the children at Norway House should be included on the regular return from Cross Lake.\n\nI am directed to advise you that the permission to transfer children to the building at Norway House is only a temporary arrangement and is to take care of the present situation only as long as the Department is unable to provide day school accommodation at Cross Lake.\n\nI trust that the authorization given in this letter will permit you to avoid any overcrowding at Cross Lake during the coming academic year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRt.

Moore,\nActing Superintendent of Medical Services,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Moore:\n\nI have just returned from Cross Lake, where I held tonsil clinic in the school, where I operated on twenty-five children. While there I saw one of the pupils die of tubercular meningitis. This is the third student who has died at the Cross Lake School of tubercular meningitis in the past four months. The student I mention was a little girl seven years old, whom I had seen on my visit in March, and concerning whom I left instructions that she must be kept in bed. I find that my instructions regarding the other children whom I asked to be kept in bed had not been carried out.\n\nI asked that all children from the Reserves other than Cross Lake call at Norway House on the way home for summer holidays to be x-rayed. For some reason this could not be arranged for the God's Lake children, but I did see those from Island Lake and Poplar River. I would recommend that some of these children should not return to school, as they are suffering from tuberculosis.\n\nI feel that I must ask for a very definite ruling on the part of the Department as regards the Cross Lake School, otherwise I must refuse to take any responsibility for the health of these children, and I feel that the Department should protect itself by making such a ruling. As I wrote you in a previous letter, I had always believed that the dormitories at Cross Lake School were designed for 80 children, and yet during the past year they accommodated 100. Aside from the fact of what they are supposed to accommodate, I know that 100 is away too many, as in order to get 100 children in these dormitories, the beds must touch side by side and head to foot. I believe that this question should be settled immediately, and that Mr. Lazenby be instructed to take it up with the Principal either at Treaty time, or at the earliest possible, and by that\nI do not mean writing a letter and forgetting about it. I have taken up the matter of overcrowding with the Principal myself, and he has signified to me that he intends to continue with 100 children, unless he received definite instructions from the Department to the contrary. He states that his school cannot operate on the present grant, and continue to make money, unless they have 100 children.\n\nFurthermore, I would recommend, in fact I feel I should insist, that all children entering this school should be x-rayed, in order to protect myself and the Department. I have brought over from Cross Lake enough children whom I had x-rayed a year or two years ago, to know that many of them must have developed tuberculosis in the school during the past year.\n\nI would also recommend that no children from Island Lake be allowed to enter this school, or the Norway House Boarding School. As I have told you before I believe that the Island Lake people have very little immunity to Tuberculosis and I do not believe they should be brought out and mixed with people who have practically 100% infection.\n\nCould you please give me an early reply.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCameron Corrigan, M.D.\nOttawa, July 13, 1943.\n\nDear Bishop Lajeunesse:\n\nI enclose, for your information copy of a report which has just been received from Dr. Corrigan with reference to tuberculosis amongst the children attending the Cross Lake Residential School.\n\nI feel certain that you will regret as much as we do the condition that has developed, and I also feel that both yourself and the Principal of the School will co-operate with the Department along the lines suggested by Dr. Corrigan.\n\nIn view of the medical officer's report, the Department wishes not more than 90 children to be kept in residence at the Cross Lake Residential School during the academic year 1943-44.\n\nYou will also note the medical officer's report regarding children from Island Lake. In view of his statement, the Department feels that no children from this reserve should be allowed in the Cross Lake Residential School during the coming academic year. A copy of this letter is being forwarded to the principal of the Cross Lake School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRight Reverend M.

I leave it to the Rev. Father Principal of Cross Lake Residential School to protest against them.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Vicar-Apostolic of Keewatin]\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nI received last night the copy of the letter that you sent to Bishop M. Lajeunesse on the 13th of July. I wish also to thank you sincerely for the copy of a report sent to the Department by Doctor Corrigan in reference to tuberculosis amongst the children of Cross Lake Residential School. As this report of Dr. Corrigan contains some exaggerations and false assertions, I feel that it is my duty to protest against such a statement by retracting some affirmations which to my opinion could not be proved by Dr. Corrigan, as they are merely the effects of his prejudicial ideas, seeing nothing else but tuberculosis all over.\n\nI am just as much if not more interested than Dr. Corrigan to see that tuberculosis will not spread in the school and I told the Doctor that the children were not catching tuberculosis in the school, but on their reserves where they spend two months with people contaminated with disease such as T.B. They come back to school after holidays with that sickness and only waiting for a cold or an epidemic to awake and develop the germs of T.B.\n\nI told the Doctor, that according to my opinion, it is impossible to free the school from such cases and if the Department wants to avoid such deficiency, he should start first by cleaning the Reserves and then this great problem would be easily solved for the schools.\n\nIn his report, the Doctor says that in the four past months, three children died in the school of Tubercular Meningitis. To my knowledge, only two died of that sickness. The girl that died in February, died of kidney trouble. Then, Mary Dixon, who died of Tubercular Meningitis at Norway House Hospital, was sick when the doctor was here in May. He ordered the child to be sent immediately. Regarding this girl, a year ago in May, we sent her to Norway House Hospital, as she had swollen T.B. glands on the neck. In the summer, the doctor advised me to discharge her and so I did. Last fall, he sent her back to school by the last plane, with those glands still running. If he had sent her straight home, as it was understood, maybe we would not have lost the little Martha Rivers who also died of T.Meningitis. This child was in bed in March when the doctor was here, and we kept her in bed nearly all the time until we removed her from the infirmary where Mary Dixon started to develop T.Meningitis.\n\nIn February, there was an epidemic on the Reserve, and of course nearly all the children had it too. Some remained very weak and ran a temperature for a long time. When the doctor came in March, he said that some of the children should be kept in bed for three, four and six months. I told him that I was not keeping a hospital or a sanatorium, and that I was going to send him to Norway House Hospital. He replied that he had no room for them. I suggested to send some of them to The Pas Hospital. As he did not want this to be done, we kept the children in bed until we thought they were well enough to be up. The epidemic on the Reserve lasted from February until April and there was no doctor and no nurse on the Reserve to look after these people; so the consequence was that the children of the school were sick twice. The nurse of the school had not enough time to look after the Indians of the Reserve.\n\nIn July, 1942, the Chief and the Indians sent a petition to the Department asking for a graduated mess on the Reserve, but the petition was not taken into consideration by the Department, and the result was that with this epidemic last winter, some weak children of the school were sick and developed T.B. in the school.\n\n(1) To the Hospital!\nIn his report of July 1943, Doctor Corrigan asked that all children should be X-rayed. I wished this to be done a long time ago. It was impossible to have the God's Lake children sent to Norway House to be X-rayed before going back home; but these had been X-rayed before entering the school. Only a few of our own children of Cross Lake had been X-rayed before being accepted in the school, as it is not very handy to have them sent to Norway House just for that purpose; though I feel that the Department should have some arrangements made to this effect. But if this cannot be easily done, seems as if there is another way of finding out if a child has active T.B. or not.\n\nI think that when the doctor fills the Physical Examination on the Application Form for admission, should at least take the ordinary means to examine the children. Since I am here, I have never seen him use a stethoscope to examine children's chest as he seems to have faith only in the X-Ray. I think that at least if this ordinary precaution was taken, it would help avoiding children to be accepted and who are already contaminated. Moreover, last summer, the doctor accepted some children whom he thought had T.B. but believed that the best place for them after all was in school. Why, now, does he seem to blame the school and says in the last paragraph of his report that we have practically 100% infection here? If he thinks there is so much infection, he must not blame me for over-crowding the school, which is false too.\n\nThe pupilage of the school authorized by the Department, was 100, and we never had that number yet. Dr. Corrigan, I believe, had in his mind that the dormitories were made to accommodate only 80, and this is why he still believes and insists that the pupilage should be reduced to 80. At present we have 95 beds in the dormitories and it is not true as he states in his report that the beds must touch side by side, head to foot. They were touching head to foot when he came in the dormitories, but this had been done to have a space of eight feet in the center. He never measured the dormitories to find out if there was a sufficient number of cubic feet for the number of children we had. I am sure that we have enough cubic feet and flooring to accommodate at least 96 children.\n\nI told Dr. Corrigan that it was impossible to administrate this school with only 80 children, and that, so as not to have a deficit at the end of the year, we had to continue to operate with 100. He states that I said it took 100 children to continue to make money. We are not making money even with 100 children but he takes that number to make both ends meet. It is the same expense to run the school for 100 or for 80. So if the Department cuts the pupilage to eighty children, it means that we will be at least $3000 short every year. So our dormitories can easily accommodate 95 children. I hope the Department will not reduce the pupilage to 80, and by so doing, oblige us to suffer a deficit of $3000 yearly.\n\nI am also anxious to have all the Cross Lake children X-rayed before they are admitted to the school and also will suggest that we have the clinic again soon and that all the Indians of this Reserve be examined by X-Ray too.\n\nRegarding the Island Lake children, I am very willing not to accept any new ones in the school, but suggest that those that are already accepted should come back after summer holidays, provided that they do not have active T.B.\n\nDear Mr. Hozy, you may be assured, that my great and most sincere desire is to cooperate with the Department and that it has never been my intention to keep T.B. children in the school, being aware of it. In fact, I have discharged some whom I thought could be a danger of contamination to others.\n\nHoping that these well meant remarks may have enlightened you in some way concerning the present condition of our school, I feel confident that the Department will agree as to not reducing the pupilage as was suggested by Dr. Corrigan, as he will not be the one to carry all the worries of administrating the school, or to pay for the deficit at the end of the year.\n\nI would be most grateful to you and would appreciate most highly, an answer from you before school re-opens.\n\nWith kind personal regards, I remain,\n\nVery Sincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6160, file 577-1, part 2)\nOttawa,\nAugust 13, 1943.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to Dr. Corrigan's report about the condition of the children of the Cross Lake Indian Residential School. The contents of your letter have been fully discussed with the Acting Superintendent of Medical Services, Dr. Moore.\n\nThere appears to be some doubt if the dormitories in the school have sufficient air space for the number of children that have been enrolled.\n\nThe information that we have on file in this office has been taken from the annual report submitted by you and it is stated that the size of the boys' dormitory is 47'6\" x 30' x 12' and that the girls' dormitory is the same size. Multiplying these figures gives the cubic content of the two dormitories as 34,200 cubic feet. As you are aware, the Department has always considered that approximately 500 cubic feet of air space is required in dormitories in Indian residential schools. This would mean that the dormitories at Cross Lake have only a cubic air space sufficient for 68 pupils. Possibly the information we have regarding the size of the dormitories is incorrect and I would, therefore, appreciate your advising me by return mail if our information is correct and, if not, you should let me have the dimensions of the dormitories. In the latter event, of course, you should state the length, width and height of the dormitories.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. G.E. Trudeau, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nCross Lake, Man.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to yours of August the 13th received recently I must say that the sizes of the dormitories of the school are exactly those you have taken from the annual report. I have remeasured them again and they are 47'6\" long by 30' wide and 12' high.\n\nWhen Doctor Corrigan was here at Treaty time in the beginning of August I showed him again the dormitories and he was surprised to how much room there was between the beds, though there were 94 beds in the dormitories. He could not help ask me what we had done to the dormitories. I replied it is very simple. We just have change the disposition of the beds and it makes all the difference that you see.\n\nShortly after Treaty I went to Norway House and Dr. Corrigan showed me the paragraph of The Act of Public Health for the Province of Manitoba. It is stated in this Act that 200 cubic feet of air space are required in halls or sleeping places for each child under twelve years old and 400 cubic feet for adult over 14 years. Then Dr. Corrigan took his pencil and start to figure how many children could be accommodated in our dormitories. As most of our children are under 12 years he found out that more than 150 children would have enough cubic feet of air space. He was amazed in front of these figures as we never had more than 97 children in the dormitories. He never said anything else about this subject as he must have recognized that before making reports to the Department he should have based them on facts and not on what he thought it was.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG.E. Trudeau, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, September 21, 1943.\n\nDear Doctor Corrigan:\n\nI am sending forward herewith copy of a letter received by this Branch from the Principal of the Cross Lake Residential School.\n\nYou are no doubt aware that in response to certain representations made by you to the Department, the enrolment at this school has been reduced from 100 to 80. In view of this fact and the difficulty the church authorities are likely to experience in financing the institution with the present enrolment, it would be appreciated if we could have from you an expression of opinion with respect to the statements made by the Principal, particularly the statements contained in the last paragraph of his letter.\n\nAn immediate reply will be very much appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nDr. Cameron Corrigan,\nc/o Mr. A. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n586 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nSeptember 21, 1943\n\nDear Doctor Jackson:\n\nThe amount of air space necessary per pupil in dormitories of residential schools in Manitoba has become a matter of controversy, and I would appreciate it if you would forward me information regarding the cubic air space required per person. For instance what space do you require in the dormitory or the institution of correction such as the Portage Home for Boys?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP. E. Moore, M.D., D.P.H.,\nActing Superintendent of Medical Services\n\nF. W. Jackson, Esq., M.D.,\nDeputy Minister of Health,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nLM\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nI have your letter of September 21st, file 123-1-1, together with a copy of Father Trudeau's letter.\n\nIn the first place I would like to quote you the following:\n\nPart III, Division 14, Section 189(a) and (b) of the Regulations under the Public Health Act of the Province of Manitoba:\n\n(a) All rooms in dwellings or other buildings used for sleeping purposes shall contain not less than 400 cubic feet of air space for each adult and 200 cubic feet for each child under 12 years of age occupying the same and in addition provision shall be made for continuous air change or circulation. There shall also be provided in all rooms occupied for sleeping purposes a floor area of at least 40 sq. ft. per person.\n\n(b) The medical officer of health shall require a floor area of not less than 40 sq. feet per person in any room occupied for sleeping purposes when in his opinion such is required to safeguard the health of the occupants of such premises.\n\nFrom these figures it is easy to see that on the basis of floor space each dormitory should accommodate 37 or 38 children. However, I believe we are safe enough with 40 in each dormitory. When you work it out on the basis of cubic feet and take an average of 300 cubic feet, as the children range in age from 6 to 15 years, you will find that you have cubic feet enough for 56 children, due to the very high ceilings.\nHowever, it would be a physical impossibility to put 56 children in these dormitories. However, the cubic feet should not be considered in this matter because I believe the Department itself has always insisted on 500 cubic feet per child. Therefore, I feel that we must stick very closely to the Health Act and insist on 40 sq. ft. to the individual. I explained this to Father Trudeau when he was at Norway House and it was probably unfortunate that I was not very good in mathematics that day. However, this is a fact I think he should not have taken advantage of. In dealing with Indian children who are so susceptible to tuberculosis I feel that we should take every precaution to guard them against this disease, and I believe that adequate accommodation is one of the easiest methods. Further than that, I believe that for the good of the Department and in order to protect ourselves, we should insist upon this regulation. I feel that another epidemic of tuberculosis occurs in the Cross Lake School with a similar number of deaths as there were this spring, it could well destroy the School and the confidence of the Indians in the Department. Please believe me when I say that there is no malicious intent on my part in any of this and that I have only the best interests of the School at heart.\n\nDuring the last Treaty at Cross Lake many of the parents of the pupils of the Cross Lake School came to me and wanted to know why so many children had been sick, and why some had died in the School. I find it very difficult to protect ourselves in these cases.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCameron Corrigan, M.D.\nSeptember 24th, 1943.\n\nP. E. Moore, M.D.,\nA/Superintendent of Medical Services,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Dr. Moore:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of September 21st.\n\nThe policy of this department in respect to accommodations in dormitories is that we try to follow out the provisions of the Health Act which states in section six of division one, part five of the regulations as follows:\n\n\"The minimum floor area of any bedroom shall be sixty square feet and the minimum height of the ceiling, eight feet.\"\n\nWe believe that in institutions where there is a chance of communicable diseases amongst the inmates there should be a greater floor space area \u2014 at least seventy feet and in those parts of the institution at Portage la Prairie where we have reason to believe that there is communicable diseases, such as tuberculosis, we try to insist on at least seventy square feet. In many of our ordinary wards at Portage la Prairie at the present time, due to a shortage of staff, where we have had to close wards and place patients in other wards, there has been some irregularity in the standards but I should say that our area is not less than fifty square feet of floor space.\n\nTrusting that this is the information you require, I beg to remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF.

The building throughout was in excellent condition in every way, and all the furnishings of every kind very well kept. There are three class rooms in operation at this school, and all three teachers were doing excellent work.\n\nIn the primary room, which consisted of beginners and grade 1, the reading and arithmetic done by the pupils both in their scribblers and on the blackboard was very good. The beginners were being taught reading from the large 'Joe and Ruth' charts, and they could point out any word on the chart the teacher asked for. The grade 1 pupils did their reading clearly and distinctly, and the teacher even had them read backwards. These pupils are making good headway.\n\nThe next class room I visited consisted of grades 2, 3, 4 and 5, all boys. The reading by all grades in this room was very good. Arithmetic both mental, and done on the board was also very good.\n\nThe third class room consisted of grades 2, 3, 4 and 5, all girls. The work of these pupils also was very good in every way.\n\nThe discipline throughout the school was excellent, and all the pupils were clean and well dressed, and everything about the school was very satisfactory.\n\nP. G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nThe Honourable T.A. Crerar,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Crerar:\n\nWhile I am sincerely reluctant to add in any way to the many and heavy burdens you have to bear, increased as they are by prevailing war conditions, I feel impelled to ask if you will try to inquire into the case of the young Indian, George Paynter, who was sentenced to life imprisonment for the part he is alleged to have taken in the burning down of the Cross Lake Indian Residential School \"fourteen years ago.\" His case has recently been brought to my notice, in a letter written to me by Miss Mary L. Kennedy, daughter of Captain Kennedy, one of the early and prominent pioneers of the Red River Settlement. Her letter, written while a patient in the Winnipeg General Hospital, reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"I have had a visit from the Rev. -- Wood, Methodist Missionary to the Stony Mountain Penitentiary. He wished to have my slant on George Paynter, a lifer in the penitentiary. He burned the R.C. School at Cross Lake fourteen years ago, when thirteen lives were lost, one a nun. I visited this school two years previously, a very fine institution, and addressed the children. George (16) was captured two years later. Originally he was from Norway House, United Church. His mother died when he was three years, and he had a ragged life. The Norway House United Church School was full at the time, so the Indian Agent said he must go to the R.C. one at Cross Lake, 50 miles distant. There he was immediately re-baptized, and discriminated against. He tried to run away several times, was brought back, and cruelly beaten. Finally he said he would escape if he had to burn the school\u2014which sadly enough succeeded on a second attempt. There was an accessory, who, I am sure, engineered the mischief. Both boys were captured. George had a life sentence\u2014usually twenty years. The other boy was released years ago. I saw him, and I am sure he was the real culprit. Mr. Wood was so impressed with George's personality, that he called to find out from me all I could tell about him.\"\n\nI know nothing more of the case than what is embodied in this quotation, but, in view of the opinions expressed by Mr. Wood, \"Methodist Missionary to the Stony Mountain Penitentiary\", and by Miss Kennedy herself, it has seemed to me that some effort might and should be made to secure his release.\n\nAs it has occurred to me that you might desire Inspector Hamilton of the Indian Affairs Branch in this city, to look into the matter, I am taking the liberty of sending him a copy of this letter.\n\nAlthough .......\n\nIndian Affairs.

Phelan.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan,\n\nI have just received a letter from reverend Father Rivard in charge of the Roman Catholic mission at Norway House in which he informs me that there are about 200 Catholic Indians in his mission and that 45 children attend the combination Day and Residential School operated in connection with the mission. Fourteen of these are boarders, and the balance are day pupils. I understand that since the school was established, biscuits have been supplied for the noonday meal of the children, but no sugar or tea was ever received. No allowance either is given for fuel. It would be very much appreciated if help could be given along these lines.\n\nSo far, only 25 aviator uniforms were given to the school; there were no overcoats or army clothing; if any of the above are available, it would be much appreciated if you could send another consignment to Norway House. This military clothing is very useful to the school to train the older girls in cutting and sewing, and supplies the poorer Indians with needed apparel.\n\nThrough their missionary, reverend Father Rivard, the Indians have asked for two barges which they could use very profitably for the transportation of cordwood, hay, lumber and horses. These Indians live on a strip of land fifteen miles long, and their only method of transportation is the lake and the river. Part of the Indians are on one side of the lake, and the others live along both banks of the river. They, therefore, have to use both the lake and the river for the transportation of all the goods which they buy and the cordwood and lumber which they sell. The building of these\ntwo barges should not be costly as the Indians have a sawmill or at least one which could be used for this purpose. Father Rivard is informed that help of this nature was granted to the Indians of Cross Lake. This is a matter which deserves consideration, for anything that can help the Indians to earn their own living should not be lightly refused when a request for it is made.\n\nWould it be possible for you to look in the case of the D'Arcis children whose mother is an unmarried Treaty woman. I understand that there is no one at the present time looking after the welfare of these children. They certainly can be considered as orphans and waifs. If a favorable decision could be arrived at in the immediate future, these children could be accepted in the Norway House School for the September quarter.\n\nSeveral of the Norway House Indians have gardens in which they raise most of the ordinary vegetables, and their potato crop is generally very good. Their only place for storing the above is the mission root-house. Whilst the missionary is willing to help, the space available is small, and only a few of the Indians can be accommodated. The construction of a large cooperative root-house is something which should be studied and if found feasible be placed on the agenda as a post-war expenditure. Nothing will help more that the cultivation of gardens to make our Indians self-supporting, and anything that will develop such a spirit should be fully encouraged.\n\nHoping that you will be able to give favorable consideration to the above matters, I remain,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6160, file 577-1, part 2)\nEXTRACT FROM MEDICAL REPORT OF DR. CAMERON CORRIGAN\ndated February 26, 1945.\n\nDuring the late fall and early winter there was an epidemic of Catarrhal Jaundice. It must have been very wide-spread as the Missionaries claimed it was practically 100%. However, I know this is not true. As far as I can learn there were no deaths. I believe practically all the children in the Cross Lake Boarding School were infected. I am not surprised at this, as I find the population of this school has again risen to 96 pupils, which means the dormitories are overcrowded. I do not understand the need for this and strongly condemn it.\nWELFARE AND TRAINING\n\nDuring my visit to Cross Lake Reserve in January, I inspected the Cross Lake R.C. Residential School, and a special report on this matter has already been forwarded to the Department. At the time of my visit, the U.C. Day School was closed, owing to the teacher being in Norway House Hospital for an operation. This fact also was reported to the Department by special letter. Arrangements had been practically completed for the construction of a New United Church Day School at the Cross Lake reserve, but unfortunately this project has had to be abandoned for lack of funds.\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nI wish to submit the following report on the schools of the Norway House Agency, inspected in June, 1945.\n\nCross Lake R.C. Indian Boarding School\n\nThere are 95 pupils enrolled and all but the Cross Lake pupils had left before my arrival.\n\nThis was my first visit to the new school and I was greatly impressed with the very excellent building.\n\nThe dormitories were spotless, well aired and very bright. The beds were quite close together but with all the windows I am sure the children have plenty of fresh air. The bedding was clean and there was abundance.\n\nThe classrooms were very bright and the walls nicely decorated. The desks, although in use for some years, were almost without a scratch. I am certain from the books seen that the Sisters do very excellent work in the classroom.\n\nI examined the work done in the sewing-room and must admit that the girls do splendid sewing. They make dresses, knit all kinds of garments and do very excellent patch work and darning.\n\nThe kitchen and dining rooms were in excellent order and the girls receive a good training in cooking and baking. The children seen were in good health and I am sure are well cared for and well fed.\n\nThis school is situated in an isolated area and the Rev. Father is greatly concerned and rightly so about his one engine and generator. If the engine should fail at any time the school would be without light or water - in fact, it could not continue to operate. I think a second unit should be installed. There is plenty of room, consequently no additional expenses will be required.\n\n(over)\nfor building purposes. The total cost would be for the engine generator and wages for someone to see that it is properly installed. I think the Department should give this request serious consideration. If the school were close to a railroad I would not make the recommendation; but a bad break in equipment at this isolated point would be serious and perhaps repairs could not be secured for weeks. There are often weeks when communication to the outside is impossible and this is especially bad at freeze-up and again in the spring during break-up.\n\nThe hot water tank which hangs by the furnace also must be renewed. I understand Mr. Lazenby has the particulars and is submitting the necessary requisition. This should be ordered and sent forward at once.\n\nThe school has a large garden; which this year was planted late and of course was not up when I was there. The Rev. Father keeps some very fine Holstein cows, a flock of hens and some pigs. The school is under excellent management and the children appeared very happy. The operating of such an excellent school in this remote area is a great credit to the Church and Government. The Rev. Father Trudeau is interested in his work and is assisted by an excellent staff of Sisters.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nW Bryce, M.P.\n\nAs we have heard and chance to talk about this meeting that they are going to have in Ottawa and we heard that you are going to talk for us this committee I have something to tell you to bring before the meeting. We are Indians we are mistreated in this Indian Act about the schools. Let say Indian act. That Catholic child should go in a Catholic school and protest in school. This Indian act is not just at all. We wish the government should take all the schools away from the church there in Cross Lake.\nFather principle is putting the protestant children in a day school and he does not want us to let our children in a protestant day school. He said he will put no out of church. The Catholic government that put the day school in the Reserve and was ruined by a protestant I had put my children in it. The Father had mad lotsa talking about it fighting me. I let my children in a protestant day school. I was nine years in a Boarding school all I learn prayers. The children that went in that school they have no arduous education. I have children I put them in school when the government will run the schools himself and if he will take all the\nSchools away from the church. We could all see the children that did not when in a Catholic school. They have English to talk and good education and here in Cross Lake Boarding School they make the children learn to pray and make them learn their Creek language to write.\n\nI hope that the government will hire the school that he had give the Indian children we don't blame the government for it was the once that run the school to the priests and the sisters.\n\nPlease talk to us and try succeed to take all the schools away from the church. I hope you will come an answer me soon.\nI hope that the Indian act will by law should be changed this coming year.\n\nNext year if the Catholic run the day school again I will put my children in a protestant day school. I will not care if he put me out the church as long my children will not learn jargon. I want them to learn something that will help them future so long.\n\nTo talk good English.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBella Ross.\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\n\nOTTAWA, April 16, 1947.\n\nMr. T.L.

He deals at some length with conditions on the reserve and in residential schools. One statement he makes is as follows:\n\n\"... And here in Cross Lake Boarding School they make the children learn to pray and make them learn the Cree language, to write.\"\n\nAs English is the only authorized language in our Indian schools for all provinces exclusive of Quebec, it would be appreciated if we could have your comments concerning his statement about the Cree language.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

(RG 10, Volume 6160, file 577-1, part 2)\nDear Sir:\n\nTwo days ago I received your letter of May the 10th dealing with the complaint of Bello Ross that in the Cross Lake Boarding School: \"...they make the children learn to pray and make them learn the Cree, to write\".\n\nFirst of all I do not see anything wrong in teaching the children how to pray as a good education has to be based on religious convictions. The Manitoba School Programme which we follow here allows us half an hour a day for teaching of Religion and we do not take more time every day for the teaching of catechism. I must say that we teach them their prayers in Cree which is their own language so they won't be at a loss to pray with their parents when they go back home. During this half hour we also teach them to read the Cree syllabic as written in their prayer books. When children reach higher grades they are taught their prayers and catechism in English.\n\nIn the classrooms they are taught English and nothing else than the English language is authorized, and so the same during their recreation periods. In fact the teachers do not know the Cree, consequently they could not teach what they don't know.\n\nHoping these information are satisfactory, I remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nG.R.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nWhile at Norway House recently Cpl. Rae of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police spoke to me regarding Indian boys starting fires. Cpl. Rae mentioned the following boys, all pupils of the Cross Lake School - R. Blacksmith, age 13, James MacKay, age 12, Jack Millar, age 8, Joseph Ross, age 11.\n\nApparently R. Blacksmith and J. MacKay started a fire the latter part of September in the basement of the school at Cross Lake. The fire was discovered by one of the staff and put out. Jack Millar and Joseph Ross also started a fire in the wood pile near the school but it was put out by one of the hospital staff. I understand that Blacksmith and MacKay are the instigators of these fires.\n\nThis is the first time this matter has been brought to my attention. We probably did receive a Police report but evidently it was overlooked. The Mounted Police have laid a charge against these boys and intend to have the Provincial Magistrate try them around the middle of December. Would you please advise me if you wish them to go ahead with this case.\n\nI talked the matter over with Father Trudeau and he felt that if these boys were sent to different schools it would do them more good than prosecuting them. However, I feel that MacKay and Blacksmith should be sentenced to a short term and then sent to another boarding school where they would not be able to return home for some time. Will you please advise me by return just what action you wish me to take regarding\n\n-over-\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6160, file 577-1, part 2)\nabove matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S.

Contrary to Sec. 3(1) Juv. Act.\n\nAct, the writer has to report that on the morning of the 26-9-49, Father TRUHAN, Principal of St. Joseph's Indian Residential School at Cross Lake, Manitoba reported that the optionally noted juveniles had intended to set a fire to the school in question in the early hours of the morning of the same date.\n\n2. TRUHAN stated that Sister St. Marcel had reported same to him and that further information would be received from her as she had already questioned all the boys and had obtained most of the necessary information.\n\n3. Sister St. Marcel was contacted and the following information received. She stated that she was awakened by a commotion in the boys dormitory about 2:30 a.m. of the same morning. She quickly dressed and entered the room in question, noticing, as she entered that all, except 6 boys, were out of their beds, some were getting dressed, some were already dressed and waiting. She went into the centre of the room and asked the boys what was going on. None of the boys answered, then she told them to get dressed and get back into bed. The boys looked frightened she stated but did as they were told. She was still at loss to know why all the commotion until she asked one of the smaller boys what had happened. The small boy said that Henry Rivers BLACKSMITH and James HOKAY had woke them up and told them to get up, get dressed and get ready to run away if they did not want to get burned. The smaller boys were under the impression that there was already a fire and quoted they were frightened even after the Sister told them there was no fire. The boys went back to bed and Sister St. Marcel stayed up the remaining part of the night to prevent a recurrence of the previous disturbance.\n\n4. The writer requested to see the optionally noted boys and they were called from their class room by Sister Superior. The boys were questioned and each boy told what he knew only blaming it onto the other. They were then brought together and then they admitted that they, jointly, had planned to start a fire at the time concerned, 2:30 a.m. of the 25-9-49, and then run away before anyone found out about the fire. They admitted that, had the Sister not entered the room when she did, they would have gone down into the furnace room and started the fire as there was a lot of wood piled there along with a lot of paper and scrap wood.\n\nP.T.C.\nThey also stated that they did not want to see any of the boys burned so they woke them up and warned them about a fire. On questioning the other boys from the dormitory, they all stated that it was Blacksmith and McKay who told them to get ready and run away. Thus the two boys also admitted too.\n\nIt should be stated here that in the evening of the 26-9-49 at approximately 6:30 p.m., Sister St. Alfred came to the writer with Blacksmith, stating that she had caught him going into the dormitory with his cap in his pocket, something that was very unusual and unreasonable. As Blacksmith was the big instigator in several attempted runaways amongst the boys and also the leader on the occasion the boys did run away from school, she thought another attempt was to be made. The writer questioned the boy about the cap but the boy stated that he had forgotten to leave it in the cloak room downstairs. It was learned later that both the above mentioned boys had their caps in their pockets, only that McKay had passed unnoticed at the time.\n\nThe writer patrolled from Cross Lake, Manitoba to Norway House, Manitoba on the 26-9-49, and reported the contents of above report to the Constable in charge of Norway House Detachment who then suggested the following Radio-phonogram be sent to Father Thibault, Principal of the Residential School at Cross Lake, Manitoba.\n\nBEGIN:\n\nREFERENCE FILES SUGGEST YOU EMPLOY NIGHTGUARD.\n\nEND.\n\nCost of same will be shown on P.35 for period September 1st to 30th, 1949.\n\nCrown Attorney Davies will be present at Norway House, Manitoba on the 7-10-49, this matter will be discussed and further report submitted to conform with the undermentioned diary date.\n\nS.U.L.\nS.O. 8-11-49.\n\nThe C.C., 3rd Division,\nR.C.M.P. Police, Winnipeg.\n\nFORWARDED, 12-10-49. This report and the cross reference file noted at para. 1 deal with the alleged attempt to set fire and destroy the St. Joseph's Indian Residential School at Cross Lake, Manitoba by the above mentioned juveniles.\n\nIt will be noted that the matter will be referred to Crown Counsel, Mr. S.J. Davies, for his instructions.\n\nK.M. Lockwood, for\nC.C., Sup. Sub/Division (AOD).\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6160, file 577-1, part 2)\nAdvertising to the above, the writer has to report that on the 26-9-49, Father TRUDEAU, Principal of the St. Joseph's Indian Residential School at Cross Lake, Manitoba reported that the captionally noted boys had started a fire in a woodpile behind the school, presumably with the intention that the fire should set fire to and destroy the school.\n\nHe stated that at approximately 5:30 p.m. of the 25-9-49 one of the farm hands came into the school dining room to report that there was a fire in the woodpile behind the school. Father TRUDEAU and Brother Mabard ran into the engine room and pulled out the fire hoses and immediately forced water into the section of woodpile that was burning. The fire was extinguished with little effort as the wood being very wet, did not get a head start. About one quarter of a cord of wood is all that was damaged.\n\nTRUDEAU stated that the boys were questioned and the captionally noted boys along with another boy, Joseph ROSS, aged 12 years, also from the school, admitted their knowledge of the fire and admitted to having been the instigators.\n\nThe three boys were questioned and all seemed to give the same story regarding the fire. The boys stated that COOK suggested to ROSS they start a fire under the woodpile. ROSS was to light the fire and COOK said he would stand by and watch for any intruders. ROSS told COOK to give the match to MILLER. COOK and ROSS told MILLER to start the fire and they would watch for anyone coming along and warn MILLER if someone did come. MILLER readily took the match from COOK and started a fire with some kindling and pushed the fire well under the woodpile to make sure that the wood would get a good start. COOK and ROSS were standing close by watching MILLER. When the fire started they ran into the school as the bell had rang, which was the dinner bell and meant that the boys were to be already lined up.\n\nOn further questioning it was learned that the boys had in mind the fact that if the woodpile got burning hard enough, it would start the school burning too. This was due to the fact that there had been a lot of unrest amongst the boys in the school. Boys kept running away quite regularly and no amount of talking to by parents, the Principal or the writer would have any effect whatsoever. They would promise at each time they were returned to the school never to run away again but within a week there was sure to be another attempt or two made.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cross Lake, St Joseph's School for the Quarter ended 30th Sept. 1942.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: 2nd Oct. 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cross Lake St. Joseph's School for the Quarter ended 31st December 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 31st December 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated at Norway House this 16th January 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereon.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cross Lake, St. Joseph's School for the Quarter ended 31st December 1942.\n\nDated 31st December 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated at Norway House this 16 January 1943.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet; paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cross Lake St Joseph's School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 7th 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated at Norway House this 21st April 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cross Lake St Joseph's School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 7th 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated at Norway House this 24th April 1943.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cross Lake St Joseph's School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 7th 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated at Norway House this 24th April 1943.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cross Lake, St. Joseph's School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1943.\n\nPrincipal: G.E.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cross Lake St. Joseph's School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 12th 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Cross Lake this 15th August 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I A 403\nReg.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cypress Lake St Joseph's School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 12th 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated at Norway House this 16th August 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's Cross Indian Res. School for the Quarter ended 31st December 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 31st Dec. 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated at Norway House this 10th January 1944\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's Cross Lake Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended 31st December 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 31st December 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated at Norway House this 10th January 1944\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

(RC 10, Volume 6260, file 577-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's Cross Lake Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended 31st December 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: 31st December 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated at Norway House this 10th January 1944\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The annual per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's Cross Lake Ind. Res. School for the Quarter ended 31st March 1944.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated 12 April 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated at Norway House this 19 April 1944\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's Cross Lake Ind. Res. School for the Quarter ended 31st March 1944.\n\nPrincipal: G.B. Trudeau\n\nDated: 12th April 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated at Norway House this 19th April 1944\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's Cross Lake Ind. Res. School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 27th 1944.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated at Norway House this 4th July 1944.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's Cross Lake Ind.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Josephian Cross Lake Residential School for the Quarter ended 31st December 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 30th December 1944.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Gross Lake St. Joseph's Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 29th 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated at Norway House this April 1945.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's Cross Lake Ind. Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagin No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's Cross Lake Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall any claim be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CROSS LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended...December 31, 1951.\n\nPrincipal...[Signature]\n\nDated...December 31, 1951.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at...this...19...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY/GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|----------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 198             | Frank Trout     | 14  | 1        | Cross Lake    | 1                 | Carpentry, farming      | 15/10/43                   | 92         |\n| 200             | Henry Hamilton  | 15  | 1        | \"              | 1                 | & gen. work             | 1/1/44                      | 92         |\n| 202             | Matthew Ross    | 12  | 1        | \"              | 1                 |                         | 9/2/44                      | 92         |\n| 206             | Simon Garrick   | 13  | 1        | \"              | 1                 |                         | 17/8/44                     | 92         |\n| 207             | Joe Adams       | 14  | 1        | \"              | 1                 |                         | 1/4/45                      | 92         |\n| 214             | Alla Papamakis  | 14  | 1        | \"              | 1                 |                         | 3/4/45                      | 92         |\n| 215             | Eddie Yellowback| 14  | 1        | \"              | 1                 |                         | 5/2/45                      | 92         |\n| 218             | Didymus James   | 14  | 1        | God's Lake     | 1                 |                         | 3/9/45                      | 92         |\n| 220             | William F.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CROSS LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1951.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: December 31st, 1951.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CROSS LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1951.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 31st, 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFonds No. I.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings therein.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SS.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577\u20132, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The quarterly per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the Quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CROSS LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended 31st March 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 2 April 1950.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Murray House this 5th April 1950.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as far as the space allows thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cross Lake Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended 31st December 1949.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: 3rd January 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nthis 3rd January 1950\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CROSS LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended 30th Sept., 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 1st Oct., 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 25th Oct., 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CROSS LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended 30th Sept., 1949.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated 1st Oct., 1949.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at this 25 October, 1949.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

(RG 10, volume 6260, file 577-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Gross Lake Insian Residential School for the Quarter ended 30th June 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 2nd July, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nR. 3008\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAME OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DAYS OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|---------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n|                 |               |     |     |      |                |                         |                           |            |\n| 0172            | Myrthle Hamilton | 15  | 1   | Gross Lake | 14 4 15 9 4 | 21 17/14 3 |                         |            |\n| 0173            | Jane Miller   | 14  | 1   | \"     | 1             | 1                       | 2/1/40                    | 91         |\n| 0184            | Christie McKay | 14  | 1   | \"     | 1             | 1                       | 4/12/40                   | 91         |\n| 0185            | Mary Ann Scott | 14  | 1   | \"     | 1             | 1                       | 1/9/41                    | 91         |\n| 0186            | Elizabeth Cook | 15  | 1   | \"     | 1             | 1                       | 1/9/42                    | 91         |\n| 0187            | Greta Beardy  | 14  | 1   | \"     | 1             | 1                       | 1/9/42                    | 91         |\n| 0191            | Mabel Ross    | 14  | 1   | \"     | 1             | 1                       | 1/9/42                    | 91         |\n| 0192            | Therese Paupanakes | 14 | 1   | Norway Hse | 1             | 1                       | 1/9/42                    | 91         |\n| 0193            | Mila Monias   | 14  | 1   | Cross Lake | 1             | 1                       | 1/9/42                    | 91         |\n| 0194            | Margaret J.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Grass Lake Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended 31st March 1949.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: 31st March 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated:

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cross Lake Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended 31st December 1948.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: 4th Jan 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. IA-408\nR. 3609\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS     | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS ON STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|--------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 153             | Tommy McKay        | 15  | 1   |      | Gross Lake     | 1                 | 1                       | Carpentry, farming       | 200        | 1/8/40 92/52                                                                                     |\n| 152             | Raymond Menias     | 15  | 1   |      | Gross Lake     | 1                 | 1                       | Gen. work                | 75         | 1/4/40 31/16 Discharged 31st Oct.                                                              |\n| 169             | Billy Scott        | 15  | 1   |      | Gross Lake     | 1                 | 1                       |                         | 200        | 25/9/40 92/52                                                                                 |\n| 171             | Joe Menow          | 15  | 1   |      | Norway House   | 1                 | 1                       |                         | 200        | 5/9/40 92/52                                                                                 |\n| 172             | Paul Menow         | 14  | 1   |      | Gross Lake     | 1                 | 1                       |                         | 200        | 5/9/40 92/52                                                                                 |\n| 178             | Walter Richard     | 15  | 1   |      | Gross Lake     | 1                 | 1                       |                         | 200        | 23/9/40 92/52                                                                                 |\n| 179             | Daniel Hamilton    | 13  | 1   |      | Gross Lake     | 1                 | 1                       |                         | 200        | 28/12/40 92/52                                                                               |\n| 185             | Joe Blacksmith     | 13  | 1   |      | Gross Lake     | 1                 | 1                       |                         | 200        | 1/9/42 92/52                                                                                 |\n| 186             | Donald Golomb      | 13  | 1   |      | Gross Lake     | 1                 | 1                       |                         | 200        | 1/9/42 92/52                                                                                 |\n| 187             | Wm S.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577\u20132, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cross Lake Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended 31st December 1948.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: 4 January 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403 R. 3608\n| REGISTERED NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|------------------|----------------|-----|-----|-----|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 213              | James McKay    | 10  | 1   |     | Gross Lake     | 1                  |                        | 1/1/45                    | 92         |                                                               |\n| 214              | Allan Paupanakes | 10 | 1   |     |                | 1                  |                        | 1/4/45                    | 92         |                                                               |\n| 215              | Eddie Yellowback | 10 | 1   |     |                | 1                  |                        | 5/2/45                    | 92         |                                                               |\n| 216              | Ronald Cook    | 12  | 1   |     |                | 1                  |                        | 1/3/45                    | 92         |                                                               |\n| 217              | Norman James   | 13  | 1   |     | God's Lake     | 1                  |                        | 1/9/45                    | 92         |                                                               |\n| 218              | Didymus James  | 11  | 1   |     |                | 1                  |                        | 1/9/45                    | 92         |                                                               |\n| 219              | Joe G.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Grease Lake Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended 31st December 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 4th January 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Gross Lake Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended 31st December 1948.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated 4th January 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nthis Jan 21 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n\nR. 3608\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS ON STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0204            | Annie Monow    | 13  |     |      | 1              |                    |                          |                           | 200/1/9/43               | 92/52                                             |\n| 0205            | Mary Ann R.

(RQ 10, Volume 6260, file 577-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's Cross Lake Ind.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging if No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days' attendance of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Joseph's Cross Lake Ind.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's Cross Lake Res. School for the Quarter ended 31st March 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 31st March 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Noway House, Man. this 3rd April 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nRep.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be signed and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's Cross Lake Res.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's Cross Lake Res. School for the Quarter ended 31st December 1947.\n\nPrincipal: J.E. Tindall, M.A.\n\nDated: 31st December 1947.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nE.B.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's Cross Lake Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's Cross Lake Res.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's Cross Lake Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's Cross Lake Res.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's Cross Lake Res. School for the Quarter ended 31st December 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: 31st December 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: Norway House\n\nthis 10th January 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. All Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's Cross Lake Res. School for the Quarter ended 31st December 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: 31st December 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Norway House, Man. this 10th June 1947.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's Cross Lake School for the Quarter ended 31st December 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: 31st December 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Norway House, Man.\n\nthis 10th January 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in the quarter of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pasting it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagin No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's Cross Lake Res.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's Cross Lake Res.

(RG 10, Volume 6266, file 577-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cross Lake St. Joseph's Res. School for the Quarter ended 31st March 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 30th March 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Norway House this 3rd April 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReq.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's Cross Lake Res. School for the Quarter ended 31st December 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 31st December 1945.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Norway House this 7th January 1946.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's Cross Lake Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph\u2019s Cross Lake Res. School for the Quarter ended 30th September 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 5th October 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 29th October 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-5, part 1)\nThe Secretary of Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am returning to you the sketch plan for the Norway House School.\n\nI am glad you have prepared it in order to have this school graded in the class A, because it was my intention to have it under that qualification.\n\nI have marked down with pen few changes that I suggest to you. First it is about infirmaries. According your plan the both infirmaries for boys and girls have the same entry although separate door. Such disposition will necessitate a perpetual gardian when boys and girls will be in the same time in infirmaries, as they can meet easily at the entry. In the way I suggest they will be more isolated, specially if you agree with the particular designs in the passage. The door of that partition could be locked and prevent any communication.\n\nA private room for the Rev. Sister Superior is needed and I think you have forgotten about it. I design a part of the sisters dormitory but it does not suit very well on account of the door inside of sisters dormitory. It can do however if you cannot find a better way of doing.\n\nDo you think it would not be better to have W.C. for each infirmary? Supposing a contagious case in the Insolated Infirmary the patients in the other infirmary would not be allowed to go W.C. in the same infirmary and consequently they will have no closet for their use. It is a remark. If you think it is sufficient as it is I do not object.\n\nI also make suggestions for the use of the church basement. I\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-5, part 1)\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nSee the laundry where I design it, on account of the sight which will be on the girls yard instead of the boys side. In such schools, we have always to look for isolation between boys and girls.\n\nOut of these remarks, I think everything is all right.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n+ O. Lehardeboisier,\nBishop of Keewatin.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Boarding School. The remainder of the plans are under way and will be sent you next week and the specifications will go forward in due course. In the meantime these plans will enable you to commence work on the building.\n\nAs the Department was informed that the building would be erected on solid rock the minimum excavation will be provided for. It will be noted that the basement walls are at present six feet above the ground. If desired the building might be raised one foot to allow a greater height for the side entrance under the porch.\n\nChanges shown in the wing occupied by the Chapel were made so as to give a proper amount of light to the rooms in that portion of the main building to which the wing is attached.\n\nI shall be glad to have an acknowledgement of the receipt of these plans.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRight Rev.

I would state that the drawings are in course of making and the completion of them is delayed owing to my desire to have particulars concerning nature of site and soil on which the buildings may be built.\n\nYou are doubtless aware that the plans prepared for these buildings at the Chief Architect's office were handed to me as a basis of working up new plans which were considered desirable. I would like to have the changes, which will be embodied in the new plans, approved by an authorized official before passing the work to state of completion. You might help me by giving instructions to some one in the Winnipeg branch, to act in this matter with me.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The land is covered with small spruce and scrub.\n\nThe site for the Roman Catholic Boarding School at Norway House is on the Nelson River, an elevation of 20 feet above the water and a distance of 200 feet from the river. The ground is clay covered with a coat of black earth.\n\nIf you should require any additional information kindly apply to Mr. J. R. Bunn, Inspector of Indian Agencies, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nI have to request that you will forward your preliminary sketches to this Department, in order that they may be approved before you undertake to complete them.\n\nI may say for your information that in 1910 a standard was set of which I think you should be informed as follows:\n\nMinimum sanitary equipment:\n1 lavatory basin for each four pupils\n1 cast iron enameled bath for each 8 pupils and 1 shower\n\nHerbert E. Matthews, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nPublic Works, Canada,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nshower bath for each 15 pupils\n\nIn addition to adequate staff equipment and house, domestic and laundry.\n\nI w.c. for each 10 if inside ones are used, and at least one in each dormitory for emergency use.\n\nThe accommodation required is on a minimum basis of 500 cu. ft. air space for dormitories and 250 for class-rooms and recreation rooms, etc.\n\nVentilation is on a basis of 3 changes per hour and foul air to be taken from floor.\n\nHospital accommodation should be equal to one-fifth of domestic accommodation and in addition isolation infirmary for each sex, with nurses' rooms.\n\nSick room to have lavatory basin and w.c., also similar provision for isolation infirmary.\n\nThe accommodation to be provided should be class-rooms, dormitories, recreation rooms, necessary staff accommodation, dining-rooms, kitchen, dairy, laundry and cellar rooms.\n\nSleeping gallery (outside) should also be provided and fire escapes.\n\nThe Norway House Methodist School building should have accommodation for 80 pupils and a staff of 10, with provision for principal's quarters in the building.\n\nThe Roman Catholic School is to accommodate 55 and staff of 8.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am sending today to the Chief Architect, Department Public Works, Ottawa, three sheets of blue prints from drawings prepared at this office for the Roman Catholic Boarding School at Norway House Manitoba. The work will doubtless be passed on by the Chief Architect, and go through a course of development in his office. We have followed the general lines of the layout shown by the original plans from the Chief Architect's office and trust that the slight changes which we have made will be found as tending to improvement. We also assumed that the \"Standard\" particulars for this class of building as set forth in your letter 321298/5 dated November 8th 1912, had been taken care of in the original plans and for this reason we have not gone thoroughly into these particulars.\n\nYou have perhaps been informed that the reasons why the drawings for this building together with drawings for two other buildings proposed for erection at Norway House were referred to me for revision here, that it was believed that with the revised plans there would result in a saving in cost of construction and produce buildings suitable for erection in the extreme North West of Manitoba. I found that the plans for the Roman Catholic School admitted of improvement on various lines but that the plans for the other buildings were apparently satisfactory and any reduction in cost of these latter buildings would have to be made by reducing the size or equipment or restricting the specifications.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Plans for this building as prepared at your offices, together with plans for two other buildings, projected for erection at Norway House were handed to me about two months ago by the Hon. Robert Rogers, with a request that I make changes to same with a view to reducing the cost of erection and bring them to conform to requirements which appear to be necessary in the cold North-West outlying district.\n\nThe plans of the Roman Catholic School that I was given, appeared to me to admit of some improvement in various particulars while those of the other two buildings seem to have been worked up on lines which would produce satisfactory, economical construction, and, assuming that the lay out and equipment is approved by the officials directly interested in these buildings, I consider that a reduction in cost may best be arrived at by a reduction in size and equipment of each building, or by a careful adjustment in the specified materials.\n\nThe drawings for the R. C. school are respectfully submitted for your consideration and I hope that what we have done here will be of assistance at your office in developing the plans to form a good basis for contract. We have done very little in the way of elaboration.

These items were of a structural nature and although it would be assuming too much for me to guarantee our plans to be absolutely free from liability in extras, I may say that after they have passed the careful scrutiny requisite for the proper preparation of specifications, they may be brought to a high degree of completeness.\n\nI hope that the drawings which were delivered to you from this office through the Department of Public Works, may meet with your approval.

Three thousand six hundred dollars ($3,600.00) of this amount is my estimate of cost for the superstructure of the Chapel.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-5, part 1)\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nIn June, last, the Department called for tenders for the erection of a boarding school building and a hospital at Norway House and a boarding school building, on the same plan, at the Pas. These plans were prepared by Mr. Burritt, Architect of Ottawa, and the estimated cost of the school, if erected in the Province of Ontario where labour and materials would be readily accessible was $28,000.00 to $30,000.00. The Department received only one tender for the school at Norway House from the Jones Contracting Company for $52,451.00 and the hospital for $15,735.00. The estimated cost for the latter building was $6,360.00 in the east. No tender whatever was received for the building at the Pas.\n\nIn view of the fact that the tender received for the Norway House buildings was much above the estimated cost, even allowing for conditions as they exist at Norway House, the late Superintendent General thought it well to\nsubmit these plans to an architect in Winnipeg with a view to having him make changes to reduce the cost. They were given to Mr. Herbert E. Mathews, Architect, Public Works, Winnipeg, Canada.\n\nLast year also a per capita grant was promised the Roman Catholic church for a boarding school at Norway House and they were to erect their own buildings, which would come under Class \"A\" of the contract. They said they wished to use the plan of the Fort Frances Boarding School as a basis and the Department agreed to furnish them with plans and specifications. Mr. Chene prepared plans based on this with such changes as they asked for and these were sent out to them in sections as they were completed. The Department understood that this work would be done by them by day labour and the plans and specifications were not, therefore, so elaborate and detailed as they would have been had there been intention of calling for tenders. The Roman Catholics commenced their work there, but in the meantime they made representations to the late Superintendent General, when it was decided to provide the cost of erecting the building without the Chapel but including the basement of this building, and an amount of $32,000.00 was provided in the main estimates for 1913-1914. The plans and specifications prepared for\nthe Roman Catholic school building were also handed over to Mr. Mathews at the same time as the Methodist school plans, with a request, as he states in his letter of the 30th ultimo, that changes be made \"with a view to reducing the cost of erection and bring them to conform to requirements which appear to be necessary in the cold North-west outlying district.\" In his letter of November 30th, above referred to, Mr. Mathews writes as follows:\n\n\"The plans of the Roman Catholic School that I was given, appeared to me to admit of some improvement in various particulars, while those of the other two buildings seem to have been worked up on lines which could produce satisfactory, economical construction, and, assuming that the lay out and equipment is approved by the officials directly interested in these buildings, I consider that a reduction in cost may best be arrived at by a reduction in size and equipment of each building, or by a careful adjustment in the specified materials.\"\n\nYou will thus see that the plan of the Norway House building appears to be satisfactory and that a reduction in size and equipment or an adjustment of the specified materials is the only way in which any reduction in cost can be arrived at.\n\nIt would not appear practicable to reduce the size of the building, but any reduction that might be made in\nthe cost of equipment or specified materials which would not detract from the value of the building might be allowed and I would suggest that Mr. Mathews be informed accordingly.\n\nThe changes in the plan for the Roman Catholic Boarding School are apparently unimportant and Mr. Mathews might be asked to complete these plans and prepare the necessary specifications.\n\nWhen the plans for the Roman Catholic school were prepared provision was made for a large chapel, which was to serve the purpose, not only of the school but of the reserve. The Department, as before stated, will not be responsible for the superstructure of the chapel, the cost of which the church will bear. The Department will, however, have to erect the basement, as there is provision therein for the heating apparatus and other accommodation necessary to the school proper. Mr. Mathews has given an approximate estimate of the total cost and the proportion that the Church and Government should bear, Department $46,000, Church $3,500.\n\nAs it will take sometime to complete these plans and specifications and as it would be well to have tenders called for so that work could be undertaken early during the coming summer an early decision should be arrived at.\nOttawa, January 15, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of November 30th, last, enclosing blue prints of plan prepared by you for the proposed Roman Catholic Boarding School at Norway House, Man., I beg to say that these have been examined by the Department and are satisfactory. I have to ask you, therefore, to be good enough to complete the plans and prepare the specifications with the least possible delay. The original tracings with specifications should be forwarded to the Department when completed. I would draw your attention to the fact that it has not yet been definitely decided where this school is to be located. You will be good enough not to state on the plan that it is situated on the Norway House Reserve and it should bear the stamp of the Department of Indian Affairs, not the Department of Public Works.\n\nYour remarks that you do not consider it practicable to reduce the cost of the Methodist building unless by a reduction in size and equipment are noted. The Department does not wish the size to be reduced, as there is now only accommodation for the number of children for which it is desired to make provision. However, in preparing the specifications for both of these buildings any changes that you can make in the specifications, either respecting materials\n\nHerbert E.

A location of the buildings is omitted from the drawings and specifications at your request.\n\nWe have endeavored to make the plans and specifications complete for a practicable building proposition. Our information is that the building sites are (quite properly) to be high and dry and on that account we have not provided for waterproofing the foundations nor for weeping drains. The concrete walls and floors provided for the building ought to keep water out under ordinary conditions and we feel justified in taking it that extraordinary conditions will be avoided when building sites are selected. You will understand that the taking care of rain water and sewage without a proper system of sewers may prove an expensive proposition and may not be handled in a general way with satisfaction.\n\nIn preparing my estimate sent to you on December 26th 1912 placing the cost of the Roman Catholic Boarding School for Norway house at Forty-six thousand dollars, we did not figure on the installation of an acetylene gas lighting system or a water works system because we were then of the opinion that these items which we had noted to be utilities at the Fort Alexander School, were there provided by the Church Authorities.\n\nWe have kept a copy of blue prints and several copies of specifications of work sent out today. We presume that your Department will look over our work and make the copies required for the purposes of receiving tenders and for forwarding to the several locations for exhibit to prospective bidders. We trust that you will find our work to be right, and awaiting further instructions, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-5, part 1)\nJ. D. McLean Esq.,\nSecretary Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nre plans of Roman Catholic Indian Boarding School.\n\nIn looking over our prints from original tracings sent to you yesterday for Roman Catholic Indian Boarding School, we have discovered several omissions and inconsistencies which we would request you to correct on the tracings before putting out any prints.\n\nFirst, on the Basement plan, in the Boiler room and Laundry, portions of the outside wall are noted to be of brickwork and not of concrete as the main wall bodies, the object being to provide ways of entry for boiler and storage tank which may not be brought to the building before it is erected. Notes on the Basement plan will draw the Builders attention to these provisions but the notes on plan should have been supplemented by others on elevations and this has not been done, in fact, I find that \"concrete\" has been written where the plan note calls for brickwork.\n\nSecond, in the matter of ventilation, we have provided for ducts on plans and in specifications but are short in markings for registers on plans. The omissions noted are: One in Pupils Dining Room and one in Boys Play room on basement, and one in each of Senior Boys and Girls class rooms, Junior Boys and Girls class room and Senior Boys Dormitory on First floor. Registers 16\" x 24\" should be marked at the ducts in rooms stated keeping in view the various departments served by the different ducts.\n\nAttention to these matters at this juncture is certainly desirable and I would be glad if you make the corrections.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.

S. G. I. A.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-5, part 1)\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nRegarding your inquiry as to the difference in cost between the construction of a school building at Norway House and Cross Lake I beg to say that it is a very difficult matter to give even approximately an estimate, as the transportation rates are so high and uncertain. The material has to be taken down in York boats, or, if by small steamer, frequent portages have to be made.\n\nFrom the best information I have been able to obtain from the records of the Department it would appear that it would cost from 15 to 20 per cent more to build a boarding school at Cross Lake than at Norway House. The lowest tender for the Methodist School at Norway House, including the hospital, was $76,578.00. Deducting about $20,000.00 for the hospital would leave $57,000.00 for the school building. This would bring the cost of a school building at Cross Lake up to about $70,000.00. We would hardly be able to use the same plan.\nplan for Cross Lake as for Norway House, as it is next to impossible to get much of the material called for by the specifications for the Norway House School into Cross Lake.\n\nA much less expensive building would suit all the purposes of Cross Lake and it would not be necessary to make provision for so many pupils. When Father Magman brought up the question of establishing a school at Norway House in 1908 he asked for a building with accommodation for 30 pupils and if they had one with accommodation for 50 this would be about all the pupils they could recruit. It would be next to useless to call for tenders for a building at Cross Lake, as the Church would be the only people who could build there.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-5, part 1)\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Chene,\n\nIt is desired that you should as soon as possible modify the plans and specifications of the school building at Cross Lake, Manitoba, so as to reduce the cost materially, having regard to a reasonably substantial building.\n\nD.
