He is bringing into the fold a host of perfect equality with thieves and ruined gentlemen of all grades of society. It is to be hoped he may prove a martyr to his principles.\n\nThe Emigrant speaking of the Manitoba and Northwestern Railway, says: \"Its northern terminus will be Prince Albert, 450 miles west of present main Saskatchewan River. At present there are 150 miles of this road under operation, leaving 300 to be built. Fifty more miles will be in operation this fall. At the rate of fifty miles a year we shall have to wait five years before we hear the sound of the new horse whistling.\"\n\nBecause Senator O'Donohoe sold himself to the Conservative party for a banquet\u2014a deal paid more than he was worth\u2014and the banquet is not forthcoming, the Irish Canada does want its co-religionists disfranchised. We would recommend our Catholic friends to accede to the proposition at least so far as Senator O'Donohoe and Pat Boyle are concerned. It would go a great way in stopping the \"present truculent system\" inaugurated and carried on by O'Donohoe, Boyle & Co.\n\nThe bill respecting fishing by foreign vessels lately passed by the Dominion Parliament provides that any vessel which, after having entered Canadian waters, fails to comply with the laws of Canada or the United Kingdom, shall forfeit tackle, rigging, apparel, furniture, stores and cargo. Under this bill it will not be necessary to prove specific offenses.\n\nJames E. Steen, Secretary of the Winnipeg Board of Trade, in a recent article on Northwestern Trade, gives a good account of the Northwest containing 244 and upwards of business concerns, and says there are 249 other points throughout the Northwest with less than 25 traders in each. Since Prince Albert is not included among these figures, the impression likely to be created that we belong to the latter, and we beg to call Mr. Steen's attention to the fact that there are plenty places of business needing trading facilities in Prince Albert, and that while we would like to have railway connection, we are not like some other places in the Northwest, unable to exist without it.\n\nThere is not a doubt that the Northwest has a great future before it. The Pacific Railway has provided the main outlet and the imagination which is necessary, but the fertility of its soil will be the great attraction which will draw settlers to it. No doubt settlers will have some hardships to endure, and no doubt many will be fitted for agricultural life and these will fail. But on the whole, the settlers are pleased with the country and confident of their success in it. Their hardships are not so severe as those of the early settlers in Ontario, and the whole period through which they must pass will be short. The Ontario pioneer was forced to clear his land before he could cultivate it, and he had to make a living out of it before he could hope to live in anything like comfort. The Northwest settler has just to take over a year or two and then all is plain sailing before him.\n\nHamilton Spectator.\n\nWhile Canadians have been staggered on many occasions by the lamentable ignorance which some prominent journalists display of Canada and Canadian affairs, it is a pleasure to us to be able to find one (the Editor) able to speak intelligently and truthfully of \"how they manage it in Canada.\" In its issue of May 11th, review the history of Canada under consideration, giving the causes which led to the union, and concludes: \"It only remains to be said that by federation the struggling colonies of North America have been united, and the prosperous backwoodsmen thereafter have seen a success both politically, socially and commercially, and that the Dominion is now making rapid strides in the development of her resources, which, when they come to play place her amongst the nations of the world, always, we hope and believe, under the British flag, of which her sons are admittedly so proud.\"\n\nMISTAKEN SYMPATHY.\n\nSays Le Presse: \"Louis Riel was hanged on November 16th. His newborn infant died in its mother's arms. This will be the turn of the mother, who has already lost her son, surely. Surely the vengeance of the Orange lodges incited by Sir John Macdonald and by the French Canadian press, which has been the bane of the country, is by this act glutted. Is not the ruin of the unfortunate race of French and Catholic halfbreeds, which they have determined to root out of the North-west, simply because it is French and Catholic, now complete? Whilst the wretched widow was lying in agony on her deathbed, thinking of him who is no more, and of her poor fatherless child left friendless in the world, the Parliament of Quebec, urged by our Ministers to show its devotion to Sir John and Sir Hector, refused to express the slightest regret over the death of Red River, the death of a race which had finally been doomed to dishonor its memory.\"\n\nThis is very touching, but is not likely to awake much sympathy in the hearts of those who knew the late lamented deceased, chief of the Metis. There is no cause for a vote for poor outraged humanity can fail to have sympathy for his mother, wife and children. It is, fortunately, seldom that a family in the Northwest become bereft of both husband and father, an act which makes a protector, as was Louis Riel. He was the personification of beggary of allness, while at the same time he was a tyrant, who exercised the most outrageous and atheistic powers to force his brother Metis to join him in the endeavor to defy the Government, and he more than any other man, is responsible for the ruin of the French half breed race. We do not sympathize with him. Well, we mistake very much the temper of the French of Lower Canada if they are to be influenced by such appeals to vote against Sir John Macdonald. We only intervene with regard to Riel was not hang him when he first rebelled. It would have saved a great deal of trouble, and the Metis of the South Branch would have been spared the humiliation which he brought upon them.\n\nBut the strongest feature in this endeavor to arouse opposition to the Government of Sir John Macdonald is the course pursued by the Globe. We can understand the Globe opposing Sir John Macdonald grounds. That is its business. But when we find a prominent journalist shedding tears of sympathy for a creature who richly deserved hanging, we confess it astonishes us. His Le Globe is a daily newspaper to shout for the murdered people of Frog Lake, no tears of sympathy for the gallant boys who laid down their lives in defense of their flag? Has it no tears of sympathy for the widows and orphans of those brave parents whose sorrow was brought about by the machinations of Riel and his lieutenants? No, apparent none. It is too busy shedding tears over the death of a man who damaged his own house by burning it, friends, a curse to his people, and who deserved as richly to die as the murderer of Hon. Thomas D'Arcy McGee. The needs of the Liberal party must be great when its organs are unable to seek such tactics as these.\n\nCol. Schreiber, representing the Dominion government, on June 8th landed a party of 80 lumbermen at Wood Mountain with a large party to establish head-quarters, and make preparations for the opening of their ranch, which is located in the immediate vicinity of this post. They have run on route from Hay River, and will be here in a few days to be followed in a short time by an additional ten thousand. They propose to bring in a total of twenty-six thousand acres of land, and a house of seven hundred thousand acres for twenty-one years. They express themselves highly satisfied with the country as a grazing district.\n\nThe police patrol which has been established along the boundary is doing excellent service in the suppression of horse stealing and crimes of a similar nature.\n\nThe mail arrived at Prince Albert on Tuesday last, bringing in one passenger, Mr. Marsh, a student of Knox College, who will be engaged in the duties at Carrot River, and teach in the college there during the summer.\n\nHARDWARE BOOMING\n\nIn order to enable parties to build cheaply, I will sell building material at the following low rates for cash, viz:\n\nNails, $6.50 per keg,\nHair, 250 per bale,\nTar Paper, $6.25 per 100 lbs\nBarbed Wire, $11\n\nNOTE\u2014Special figures to contractors.\n\nT.J.

This was effected at a loss made by the Government at Ottawa to secure the passage of a reciprocity treaty with the United States; That the people of Nova Scotia and people of the west are opposed to such treaty, as expressed by the Tory party; That the award of four and a half millions received from the sale of the lands of the Dominion of New Caledonia, the largest part of which belongs to Nova Scotia, has been taken to pay the interest on the national debt; That the works from which we receive most advantage; That the total disregard of our privileges, rights and interests, and the vast extravagance in increasing the public debt and annual expenditure of the Dominion has shamed the patriotism and energies of all the people, and render it utterly impossible that we can any longer remain a part of the confederation.\"\n\nTHE AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE.\n\nA Buffalo Ranch to be Started.\n\nThe Winnipeg Sun says: \"Major Bell, the famous Bell farm, is the Queen's own sheep ranch. 'Every thing on the farm looks splendid,' he said. 'I never in any previous year saw anything to equal the condition of the sheep. They will be shipped out in two weeks.'\n\n\"What about the proposed agricultural college?\"\n\n\"Well, Prof. Tanner, who is to have charge of it is now in England to obtain students and experience in agricultur- al studies so that it will be quite a large institution. Prof. Tanner and an assistant will conduct the college and instruction will be given in practical and theoretical farming. A small sum will be charged students for board and room. If successful it will be a great success and will be the means of inducing many young Englishmen and others to come to Canada and settle here, receiving a thorough training in the old college.\"\n\n\"I noticed in the Sun last night,\" continued the Major, \"a paragraph about a man in Texas who was starting a buffalo ranch. I thought it was a good and excellent idea. I was specially interested in it, as a number of acres near my place would make a good buffalo ranch near Winnipeg. We have purchased Capt. Robson's herd of buffaloes and will start a fine farm there. We will get some good cows or fine bullocks and cross them with buffaloes, and will try to bring to the country a superior breed of thoroughbred cattle.\"\n\nTERRITORIAL NEWS.\n\nFORT MCLEOD.\n\nFrom the Gazette.\n\nChurch destroyed.
