But nothing more has been done by the trustees as yet towards carrying out the instructions they received. What were the reasons for the delay we do not know, but we have heard that most of those attending at present are still in school at the end of January. This being the case, the sooner the trustees proceed to business the better, or they find themselves without school accommodation at the end of the year.\n\nCOLONIZATION SOCIETIES.\nThe settlers of Saskatchewan recently held a public meeting at which they passed a resolution asking the Temperance Colonization Society to take advantage of the offer made by the Government to secure lands of the Society off the lands held without school accommodation at the end of the year.\n\nAn ordinance is now on foot to incorporate a new town called Regina. The town will have a mayor and council elected by the voters.\n\nMERCY.\nIf every government showed a disposition to be merciful to a wronged foe\u2014if over the perquisites of mercy was exercised to the fullest extent consistent with expediency, we think that our present rulers would have so acted. But within reason, we cannot deny that there is a feeling in this district that the government went too far when it respected Dumont, Dumas and Garneau\u2014who were scarcely known to bands\u2014by making them what right which that had forfeited by taking up arms against the government, and it is possible that this may prove to be the case. However, we trust that all will be well when the new legislature takes into account how the people feel about such conduct from the government.\n\nThe reason why was the manner in which the government treated its opponents. In its recent issue, the Edmonton Bulletin\u2014a recent issue\u2014endeavors to show how the policy of the government with regard to both the rebels has been taken. Not only has the government attempted to intimidate, but it has also used its influence to prevent any party from obtaining justice through the courts.\n\nCOLONIZATION SOCIETY.\nSome days ago, a public meeting was held to discuss the question of providing increased school accommodation for the schools in the parish. At this meeting, the trustees promised to build a schoolhouse. But nothing more has been done by them in carrying out the instructions they received. What were the reasons for the delay were not known, but we have heard that most of those attending at present are still in school at the end of January. This being the case, the sooner the trustees proceed to business the better, or they find themselves without school accommodation at the end of the year.\n\nA special meeting of the Council was held on Wednesday evening. All the members present except His Worship the Mayor were present. The attendance was good and the award made to the member who made the best speech.\n\nSHERIFF'S SALE OF LANDS.\nUnder the provisions of an order in the Saskatchewan District Court, Prince Albert, the sheriff is empowered to sell lands belonging to the Natives of the district for failure to pay taxes.

Among them we noticed Mr. Edmondson, Mr. Harvey of Prince Albert District, and Mr. Gowan of Winnipeg.\n\nThe Cobille arrived at the east end of the lake about three o'clock in the afternoon, and then the steamer started for the Northwest, to the delight of all those eastern bound. Learning that the steamer was going to visit the Portage on Friday, we boarded on Thursday evening after bidding farewell to our friends who came from Winnipeg. We were very much pleased with our stay at Grand Rapids having been very pleasant establishment and our great desire to revisit again.\n\nThe Cobille started early on Friday morning, and after getting a few miles out on the lake had to stop for a while owing to the very high sea and anchored about a mile from our place of starting, and remained there until about two o'clock when we again set sail. We were not only a short time when the sea again got very rough, but the wind also began to blow, and the steamer became cumbered. At first it seemed quite pleasant, but what a sudden change! However, the steamer was able to keep her course, and, after turning pale, and violent waves were made for the coast, the steamer again took up her course at first, but the scene changed, and among the rocks we hung up the sight, and the steamer was obliged to go back to the Cobille. We were finally convinced of the truth of the old saying, \"There's no place like home,\" and Capt. Bell, aware of the Cobille, thoroughly understands the good old ship, and also thinks from the way she acts when she gets into trouble, that he thoroughly understands the Captain who has been navigating her for over 10 years. We had only been away seventy-five miles when we had to anchor again, and we remained there till the following morning. We had dinner before us, and a dreadful storm arose, the thunder crashed loud and long, the lightning flashed and the rain fell in torrents, and the Cobille pitched and rolled so that tables and chairs were overturned, and we thought that we would be thrown either off the deck or into the sea, but we were saved by the rocks to the west of us, driven out into the open sea, and racing along the coast, we were glad and thankful for the sea, but with both anchors set, little distance was made like the compasses of Quicksand and slow as the snail's pace, under the command of her brave and noble skipper, to weather many a gale and storm as we plowed through the night.\n\nSunday morning opened dark and cloudy, but the steamer continued her course more traversing the treacherous waters of Lake Winnipeg. The day was most agreeable, though being no clergyman on board, I could not say how long as best we could.\n\nEarly in the morning the steamer began to land, and the North-West men, being Canadians and the North-West men, then the boys all seemed so happy and with one accord cried, \"Out of town!\" and then the steamer would have a smile in the old old days.\n\nAbout 8 p.m., we met the Princess near Pembina House with whom a number of passengers on board, taking up the pleasure of Lake Winnipeg, probably they would have been very disappointed if we experienced the day previous.\n\nIt was here that a happy smile passed over the faces of our boys when for the first time they entered the steamer, and they looked upon that which cheers the weary and makes the poor feel rich. Here they met the Princess, who was waiting when she saw one of the waiters from the Princess, six feet six, carrying a large bundle of newspapers into the lower deck of the Cobille, but as she still thirsted and their mouths still watered, they reached Selkirk to taste fine buns and cakes.\n\nThe delay at this place was an impulsion upon the brave wanderer of passes, who had been delayed for some time, in reason of coming there to spend another weary day on water. We do not attach any importance to this, but it is a fact that it is higher authority. After a long delay, again separation, but being unable to get a boat, we returned to another one again east. The Monday we had a pleasant view and reached Selkirk, where we were obliged to remain for a day in consequence of freight under way.\n\n---\n\n**HARDWARE.**\n\n**AMMUNITION!**\n\n**SHOT,**\n\n**ALL SIZES OF**\n\n**SHELLS and**\n\n**WADS.**\n\nDupont's Celebrated Ducking Powder.\n\nLoaded Shells always on hand.\n\n---\n\n**J.
