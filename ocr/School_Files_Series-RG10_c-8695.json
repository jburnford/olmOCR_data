In addition, the pay list for excavating the cellar is not receipted by the workmen.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. T. Johnson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDept. of the Interior,\nOTTAWA.\nNorth Battleford,\nNov. 19th 1934.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe thank you for your letter of the 14th inst., reference to a proposed pipe-line to be constructed near here.\n\nWe have no machine for trenching in the City. It is the general practice nowadays to use manual labour for this work. In Saskatoon, a far larger city than North Battleford all trenching is done by hand.\n\nWe estimate that the cost of digging such a trench as you specify would be approx. 65\u00a2 per linear foot, using manual labour. This cost of course would vary slightly with local and soil conditions. The above estimate covers both the digging and backfilling.\n\nYou would be quite safe as far as the cost is concerned, in laying the pipe at a depth of nine feet. This is the usual practice here.\n\nWith reference to your 2\" pipe, we do not know the kind of pipe you propose using, but would strongly advise you against using galvanised iron pipe, as with average soil conditions in this region the life of such pipe is only from ten to fifteen years.\n\nShould this work be proceeded with, we would be in a position to materially assist you in the matter of your labour requirements, and would provide proper supervision of the work if you so desired. This is a branch of work of which we have considerable experience, and would suggest to you that proper supervision and experienced labourers would produce material savings in the cost of such a project.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(signed) M. Nowley.\n\nSupt. of Water works.\n\nO. H. Hoover, Esq.,\nEngineer-in-Charge,\nCalgary, Alta.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the proposed development of the spring at Thunderchild Indian School I enclose herewith copy of a letter from Mr. Hoover, dated the 23rd instant commenting upon one received from the Superintendent of Waterworks, City of Battleford, dated the 19th instant.\n\nThese are supplied for your information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nEnc.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDecember 17, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Murison:\n\nYou are, no doubt, aware that the Department has been acting in conjunction with the Dominion Water Power and Hydroelectric Bureau of the Department of the Interior in obtaining a water supply for use of the Thunderchild Indian Residential School. The Canadian National Railways, from whom the water supply was obtained, by a pipe-line from their water tank at the station at Delmas, near the school, have closed down this plant but have allowed the school authorities to operate same. It was considered advisable, a year ago, to endeavour to install a water supply system of our own for this school. The authorities of the Dominion Water Power Branch were consulted. They reported that water was not economically available from the Saskatchewan river, because of the distance, the difference in levels, possible impurities of the source and the cost of maintenance.\n\nThe Dominion Water Power Bureau recommended the drilling of a well and the installing of storage tanks in the basement of the school - the power for pumping water to be supplied by a gasoline engine and windmill used as auxiliary power. It was considered by them that an ample flow of water, sufficient for the needs of the school, could be obtained at a depth of from 250 to 300 ft. They estimated the cost of drilling the well, installing the pressure tanks and carrying out the alterations required to the basement; supplying windmill and gasoline engine to be approximately $8,700. They were authorised to proceed with the work. The\n\nV. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nwell has been drilled to a depth of 735 ft., with no water available, and the entire cost to date has been approximately $6,300.\n\nThe Dominion Water Power Branch now recommend that a pipe-line be installed from a spring located near the river and from which it appears that a plentiful supply of water can be obtained. It will be necessary to install the pipe-line a distance of 1\u00bd miles. They have estimated the cost would be between $9,000 and $16,000, according to how the work is carried out.\n\nThe Department has spent considerable money in endeavouring to obtain a water supply, without result. We have no funds available to carry out the scheme which is now proposed by the Dominion Water Power Branch to install a pipe-line from the spring; and, in the meantime, the school authorities will have to carry on their present arrangement for obtaining a water supply from the Canadian National Railway System. We understand this is costing the school authorities approximately $100 per month to operate.\n\nI shall be pleased if, upon the occasion of your next trip to the Battleford agency, you will visit the school, inquire into the water supply and submit a report, stating your opinion as to what should be done to provide this school with an ample supply of water. Any suggestions or recommendations you care to make will be appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nRe Thunderchild Indian School\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to my letter of 23rd ultimo regarding the well situation at the above named School, I wish to inform you that Father Allard, on his own initiative, requested the C.M.Miners Construction Company Limited, of North Battleford, to supply him with a rough estimate of excavating and back-filling a 9' trench 7500 feet long (not including cost of pipe or laying). They have not seen the location.\n\nThe Company stated that a rough estimate for this portion of the construction would be about $5500 for excavation and backfilling, or about 75\u00a2 per running foot. Including pipe, the cost would therefore be about 1.10 per foot, which is not much different from Mr. Fetterly's original rough estimate.\n\nMr. L.A. Riches, of Unity, phoned me on Dec. 6 by long distance stating that neither he nor the other three men who had constructed the basement had as yet received their cheques. I informed him that the accounts were sent to Ottawa on November 21 but that the transmission of the cheques occupied a short time. No doubt they have received their wages by this date.\n\nThe above is given for your information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEngineer-In-Charge.\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nRe Thunder Child Indian School\n\nFor your information I am enclosing a copy of a letter from Mr. O.

They are very thorough and competent in the discharge of their respective duties. The children presented a healthy and well nourished appearance. The health of the children at this school has been remarkably good during the present winter.\n\nA farm is now being operated. Last season their crop consisted of 2,500 bushels of oats and 600 bushels of wheat. A half section of land has been rented on the Battle River for summer pasturage. In addition to the land farmed on the school property, the Principal rents land in the neighborhood for the purpose of growing green feed for the stock.\n\nThe livestock consists of 27 head of cattle and 4 work horses. They have 17 cows regularly milking. The children are given all the milk they care to drink. They have in addition 25 hogs and have been able to provide their own beef and pork requirements. The poultry consists of 80 fowl.\n\nThey grew an ample supply of roots and vegetables during the past season for their requirements.\n\nThere are 105 pupils enrolled at this school. Recreation is provided for them. I noted a good skating rink as well as a toboggan slide. The school is a frame building.

INSPECTOR'S OFFICE,\n\nREGINA, SASK., 31st January, 1935.\n\nALSO TO DATE OF THIS LETTER\n\nDear Doctor McGill:-\n\nReferring to your letter No. 105-1-5, dated the 17th ultimo, in regard to the water supply at the Thunderchild Residential School, I beg to advise you that I visited this school on the 14th instant and when there made careful enquiry into the whole situation.\n\nAs stated by you the water supply is now being obtained from the Canadian National Railway's tank at Delmas, the source of supply being a pipe-line to the Saskatchewan River. It is necessary in connection with this system to operate an engine and pump at the River, and the services of a man to take care of this unit are necessary. The Railway Company furnish the coal for the purpose of heating the station at the River and the water tank at Delmas. The School is paying all the expenses of operating the unit. I am informed by the Reverend Principal that the Railway Company, when handing over this unit to him, stated they would only take water from this tank in cases of emergency and would not use it as a regular source of water supply. Apparently this arrangement has not been carried out, in as much as the Reverend Principal states that practically all trains stop at Delmas and take water, and this necessitates a great deal of extra pumping and expense. The water is by no means pure and the system apart from this is expensive and unsatisfactory.\n\nThe water supply obtained generally in Delmas and by the white farmers in that area is procured at a depth of 32 feet where there is a seam of quick sand. During wet seasons this seam of sand was saturated with water and a fair supply was obtained, but of recent years owing to continuous lack of moisture the supply of water in this seam is limited and is becoming less as time goes on. I could hear of no instances where water had been obtained in this locality in deep wells.\n\n- I also enquired into -\n\nH. W. McGill, Esq., M.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nI also enquired into the question of the spring referred to in your letter. This spring is situated about 8,000 feet from the school in a north-westerly direction. The spring is a splendid one. I believe there is water enough flowing from the spring to fill a 10\" pipe and the quality of the water is excellent. The spring itself is 80 feet below the level of the school, but the surface level of the ground above the spring would be about 40 feet below the level of the school. The spring is on the farm of a man named LeVallee and in order to reach it it would be necessary to run the ditch across the farm of Mrs. Duville. The Reverend Principal states that she has no objection to running such a ditch. He also stated that Mr. LeVallee would give the use of the spring free of cost on condition that the Department would pipe the water into his house, a distance of about 75 feet.\n\nThe only equipment required in order to tap this spring would be the necessary piping from the school to the spring, and my suggestion would be to place the pump house on the high ground at the top of the ravine and dig a well to tap the spring. The necessary storage water tanks are installed at the school. They have a suitable engine and also a wind-mill. I am satisfied that if we were permitted to get this work done on a competitive basis, the outlay necessary to complete the installation should not reach $10,000.00. This should be the outside cost and it could probably be done for a great deal less. The soil between the school and the location of the spring is a sandy loam, free from stones, which would make the digging of the ditch a comparatively easy matter. I looked over the ground and it is fairly level and is not rolling. There may be the odd hollow which would not offer any difficulty.\n\nFrom what I could gather when on the ground, I feel that it would not be advisable to endeavor to obtain a water supply at this institution by sinking a well and the cost of obtaining water from this spring would in the end be more economical. There is no doubt in my mind but that a more than ample supply of water can be obtained from the spring and such an installation would be permanent. I have been visiting this school for over fourteen years and it is strange that the existence of this spring was never brought to my attention until now. Had it been, I would surely have reported in connection with it. I was advised -\nit. I was advised that in the early days of the school a good supply of water was obtained in a shallow well, and I had the idea that possibly this seam might be tapped by a large dug well. However I now find that the Railway Company had the same idea and carried it into effect, but they found that the seam did not furnish sufficient water for their requirements and they therefore laid their pipe-line to the River.\n\nThe only suggestion I can make is that the school will have to carry on with the present arrangement until such time as funds might become available. I would again state however that I do not think it would be advisable to spend any more money in endeavoring to obtain a water supply by sinking a well in view of the information that I was able to gather.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

Murison,\nInspector,\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\nUnity, Sask.\nFeb. 2, 1935.\n\nO.H. Hoover, Esq.,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs I have not received a payment for the last hundred and sixty five (165) feet, that is from five thirty five (535) to seven hundred (700) feet for drilling well at Thunderchild School at Delmas, Sask.\n\nI would like to know when this is to be paid and how much they intend to pay. Kindly let me know what information you have had from Ottawa regarding this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(signed) J.T. Rahrick.\nRe Thunderchild Indian School\n\nSir:-\n\nWith further reference to the letter of Nov.13,1934, signed by A.F.Mackenzie, Secretary to the Indian Department, regarding the drilling of the well at the above-named school, I beg to advise you that I have just received a letter from Mr.J.T.Rahrick, dated Feb.2, 1935, two copies of which are enclosed for your information and possible action.\n\nReferring to Mr.Fetterly's report dated Nov.3, 1934, I will quote two paragraphs from the bottom of page 1, in which Mr.Fetterly discusses the 535' to 700' depth.\n\n\"I asked Mr.Rahrick what he \"hoped\" to obtain for the drilling from 535' to 700'. He states, incidentally, that the actual depth is over 700'. He also evidently considers that the official depth is 535', not 500', as he received word to stop when he reached 535'. This appears only fair, as a matter of fact.\"\n\n\"He stated that he thought that a 50-50 basis should be considered and named $600 gross. A 50-50 division would amount to $660 (165' x \u00bd of $8.00). I wished to obtain his idea of a fair deal\".\n\nMr.Fetterly or I did not wish to make a definite recommendation at the time to the effect that Mr.Rahrick should receive this amount, or a portion of it, but we nevertheless thought that he should receive some consideration. If he had struck water at any point between 535' and 700' we should have been the gainer, entirely at his risk.\n\nConsequently, when I received your letter of\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nNov.15, I decided to allow Mr.Rahrick to make the first move after he received his cheque. He has done so in the accompanying copy of his letter.\n\nIt should be noted that Mr.Fetterly did not give him any encouragement whatever of possible payment at the time of the interview, before the well was deepened. Meanwhile, I am today simply acknowledging receipt of his letter and also am stating that a copy is being sent to you for your information (and possible action). I will not as yet acquaint him of your decision to decline payment until I have heard further from you on the matter.\n\nRegarding possible development of the spring described in Mr.Fetterly's Report dated Nov.15,1934, I wish to call your attention to the second paragraph of Conclusions, Page 5, regarding completion of plans.\n\nMr.Fetterly's time has been fully occupied on Water Power activities since November and consequently he has not had opportunity to prepare plans for development of the spring.\n\nI would understand from the last paragraph of Mr. Mackenzie's letter that the Indian Department seriously considers the spring as a source of supply. As a matter of fact, it is the only supply as far as I know, except the river itself. Father Allard, on a visit here on Jan.21 stated that water supply was costing him $125 per month as he is also supplying most of the trains of the Can.Nor.Ry. passing through Delmas, and doing it through a system which may break down at any time.\n\nI hesitate to instruct Mr.Fetterly to prepare detailed construction plans until I have had definite instructions from you, because of the great amount of routine water power work on hand and in prospect. The cost of development of the spring is difficult to determine without detailed plans and without knowledge of the proposed method of excavating the trench whether by hand labour or by contract. The rough estimate given in the Report of Nov.15 was $9,000 to $16,000. In view of the estimate of the C.M.Miners Construction Company,Limited, of North Battleford, for excavation of the trench together with backfilling ($8500) I would tentatively place the total price at nearer the former figure than the latter.\n\nOn receipt of instructions from you on the matter, Mr.Fetterly will begin to prepare plans in order to be ready to start work in the spring. This will of course include securing of a permit from the Saskatchewan Government for the spring and arrangement for easement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEngineer-In-Charge\nFebruary 11, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith copy of a letter dated the 6th instant from Mr. Hoover with reference to the drilling of the well at Thunderchild Indian School, together with a copy of a letter from Mr. J.T. Rahrick, the well driller, dated the 2nd instant, in which the latter requests payment for drilling of the well depth from 535 feet to 700 feet.\n\nAs you will recall, it was stated in Mr. Hoover's letter that the well driller was notified to stop work when he had reached the 535 feet level and that he continued to the lower depth on his own responsibility. Mr. Rahrick has received payment for the cost of drilling down to the 535 feet level. If you will refer to Mr. Hoover's letter of October 9, 1934, copy of which was sent you on October 13th, it appears to have been made clear to Mr. Rahrick to go beyond the 535 feet level was to be entirely on his own responsibility and he is stated to have accepted the situation as explained to him.\n\nI do not think the Department is under any obligation to pay for the drilling beyond the authorized depth, but if it is decided that some consideration should be given to Mr. Rahrick for his conscientious efforts to obtain a supply of water, a certificate might be obtained from Mr. Hoover stating what he considers a fair compensation for this additional drilling.\n\nI shall be glad to receive your instructions in this matter.\n\nEnclos.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nfor M.F.C.\nOttawa, February 15, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, enclosing copy of a communication from Mr. O. H. Hoover, Calgary, also copy of a communication addressed to Mr. Hoover from Mr. J. T. Rahrick, Unity, Sask., requesting payment for the drilling of the well at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School from the 535 ft. depth to 700 ft.\n\nIn this connection I would point out that Mr. Rahrick drilled the well from the 535 ft. depth on his own responsibility, after having received instructions to stop the work when he reached the depth mentioned. The Department can accept no responsibility for payment for the drilling of the well beyond the depth of 535 ft. We understand, from Mr. Hoover's letter of October 9, 1934, that it was made perfectly clear to Mr. Rahrick that he was not to drill the well beyond the 535 ft. level.\n\nIt will not be necessary for your engineer to take any action at the present time in preparing detailed construction plans for the development of the spring and the piping of the water to the school. It is very doubtful if we will have funds during the coming fiscal year to pay the cost of the work, unless same can be obtained from the Public Works Construction Appropriation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nFebruary 15, 1935.\n\nDear Mr. Murison:\n\nI have your 302-11A R.C. of the 31st ultimo, regarding the providing of a water supply system for the Thunderchild Indian Residential School. I wish to thank you for your full report, in connection with obtaining a supply of water from the spring, situated approximately 7,300 ft. from the school, and the steps you would advise be taken in having the work carried out.\n\nThe Department will have no funds to cover the cost of the work in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the coming fiscal year. However, an effort will be made to obtain the amount required to cover the cost from the Public Works Construction Appropriation. At present, I am unable to state if same will be available for the purpose. The school authorities will have to carry on with the present arrangement for obtaining water from the Canadian National Railways tank at Delmas, until such time as funds become available for the development of the spring and the piping of the water to the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nBattleford  \nFebruary 15th 1935\n\nSir:\n\nRe water supply at the Thunderchild Boarding School.\n\nAt the request of Rev Father Allard, Principal of the School I, yesterday inspected the intake of the supply from the river. As a protection against frost, Father Allard had the section from high water mark to the point where the intake was well under water; covered with manure. He now thinks that this will possibly be a source of contamination. He tells me that the same precaution was taken last year and he noticed at that time a red deposit on the bottom of containers after water standing over night. I asked him why if he was in doubt, he did not use clean straw instead of manure to cover that section of piping. They find that they can get a sufficient supply of water by pumping on three days of the week. When pumping stops the water naturally drains back from the pump to water level leaving the pipe empty. The joints have been leaded so that there is small chance of seepage getting into the pipe. However I advised the Father to have the manure removed at an early date and as the water rises any contamination will be washed down stream. I feel that the Department has all the information they require on the water supply for the school, and am reporting this phase at the request of the Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary  \nDept Indian Affairs  \nOttawa.\n\nMedical Officer\nOttawa, February 21, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, regarding a probable source of contamination in the water supply which is obtained from the pipe-line of the Canadian National Railway, for use at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School. If the intake is well under water, there should not be much danger of contamination from the manure covering, which the Principal has had placed over a section of the pipe, as a protection against frost. It is noted the joints in the pipe have been leaded, so that there is small chance of seepage into the pipe.\n\nI may say that the Department is giving consideration to the installing of a pipe-line from a spring, which has been found near the bank of the river, a distance of approximately 7,300 ft. from the school. It is a matter of obtaining funds for this proposed undertaking. In the meantime, it is hoped the school will be able to carry on with their present system of obtaining water. It is noted you have advised the Principal to have the manure removed, and this should overcome any danger of contamination to the supply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. P.

J. M. UHRICH,\nMinister of Public Health\n\nR. O. DAVISON, M.D.\nDeputy Minister\n\nREGINA:\nThos. H. McConica, King's Printer.\nRevised March, 1935\nSewage Disposal for Rural Homes in Saskatchewan\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nMany rural residences are now equipped with electric light and power and all the labor-saving devices and conveniences which were at one time thought to be available only for the urban population. There has, however, been a tendency to postpone the installation of modern plumbing fixtures pertaining to sewage disposal. This bulletin provides information on the type of sewage disposal system best suited to the local conditions.\n\nExperience has shown that a system of sewage disposal which could be left to run itself on a farm in the eastern provinces will not prove satisfactory when installed in Saskatchewan. The soil in much of the greater part is stiff, non-absorbent clay, where creeks or watercourses are almost unknown and where the frost can be relied upon to penetrate six feet deep.\n\nIn the \"Plumbing and Drainage Regulations\" issued under The Public Health Act reference is made to the construction of sewage disposal systems for isolated buildings.\n\nIt is with a view to supplementing these regulations and to removing the repeated requests for information regarding the proper method of constructing and operating a sewage disposal plant for a rural home on the prairie that this bulletin has been prepared.\n\nIn order that the information which follows may be a true statement of experience in constructing and operating sewage disposal plants in Saskatchewan, an investigation was made by officials of the Department of Public Health of the systems of sewage disposal actually used in 17 farms in different parts of the province.\n\nThe conclusions arrived at as a result of this investigation are embodied in the following pages and in the revised drainage and plumbing regulations.\n\nSEWAGE TREATMENT\n\nSewage from a farm house, that is, the waste water from water closets, baths, sinks and wash tubs, may be disposed of in one of three ways:\n\n(1) By discharge into a watercourse; (2) by discharge into the subsoil; (3) by discharge on the ground surface.\n\nNecessity for Treatment.\n\nEach of these methods of disposal requires some form of preliminary treatment to remove a proportion of the solids, otherwise a serious nuisance will be created.\n\nCesspools.\n\nThe cesspool is an attempt to combine treatment and disposal of the sewage and it accomplishes neither. A cesspool, as one usually finds it, consists of a covered pit, the ground on the sides being either of brick, wood or concrete. It is not a well, but with nothing but water for a bottom, the purpose being to allow the liquids to soak away into the ground.\n\nThe solids in the sewage settle to the bottom of the cesspool and choke any porous soil in the immediate vicinity, absorption and the cesspool quickly becomes stagnant and offensive. The construction of cesspools as above described is no longer authorized by the regulations issued under The Public Health Act.\n\nSeptic Tanks.\n\nThe septic tank is the simplest and most practical form of treatment to reduce the suspended matter and to render the sewage capable of final disposal with the minimum of nuisance.\nWhat the Septic Tank does.\n\nThe function of the septic tank is to assist and to expedite the natural processes of decomposition and purification.\n\nTwo simple changes take place in such a tank:\n\n1. The first is the settlement of the solids to the bottom, the grease and lighter particles floating to the top.\n\n2. The second is the rotting of the settled solids.\n\nThis is brought about by the action of a certain type of bacteria which multiply in the solids and in the scum which forms on the surface of the tank.\n\nThese bacteria thrive without oxygen and break up the solids into liquids and gases which are then discharged from the tank.\n\nThe statement has often been made that sewage after passing through a septic tank has undergone a \"ninety per cent\" purification and responsible citizens have averred that the effluent from a septic tank should be fit to drink.\n\nLet these illusions once and for all dispelled.\n\nThe effluent from a septic tank is just as dangerous to health as the raw sewage which is discharged from the house.\n\nA septic tank removes the greater part of the solids from the sewage, but it does not destroy or remove any disease organisms which may be present in the sewage as it enters the tank.\n\nNor is the effluent free from offence. If allowed to pond on the surface of the ground it will create a nuisance.\n\nA septic tank will not continue to operate indefinitely without attention.\n\nAlthough the purpose of the tank is to liquefy the solids, a certain amount of solid matter and residue will accumulate in the tank and will require removal once or twice yearly.\n\nLocation of Septic Tank.\n\nThe excavation necessary for the tank may be greatly reduced if advantage is taken of any fall which there may be in the ground surface.\n\nThe soil pipe should be led from the house at the point nearest to the site of the tank.\n\nToo frequently the plumbing is completed without any consideration being given to the position of the tank and disposal area, resulting in the latter being sited to suit the soil pipe.\n\nIn view of the low temperatures of our winter it is necessary to consider every means by which the contents of the tank may be protected against frost and for this reason the septic tank may in some cases be constructed close to the house. (See figures 3 and 4.)\n\nThe basement or foundation wall of the house must under no circumstance be used as a wall for the tank, behind the tank wall, if it has a minimum thickness of 9 inches of concrete, may be built against the tank wall.\n\nIn such cases every precaution must be taken to make the tank absolutely watertight.\n\nThe inside of the tank should be finished with a coating of cement mortar in the proportion of 1 of cement to 1 of sand.\n\nThe tank should not be situated under a window or near to a door.\n\nConstruction of Septic Tank.\n\nThe dimensions of the septic tank should be 6 feet 6 inches in length by 3 feet in breadth by 4 feet in depth. (See figure 5.)\n\nThis size of tank should be used in all installations for 12 persons or under.\n\nFor larger installations the capacity of the tank should be equal to 24 hours flow of sewage estimating the latter at 30 gallons per head per day.\n\nThe depth of the tank below water level should never be less than 4 feet.\n\nThe width of the tank should be in the direction of flow and should be about one and one-half times the width to give uniform flow through the tank and to ensure that the outlet is reasonably distant from the agitation caused at the inlet.\n\nThe inlet to the tank should be baffled by discharging the sewage through a T pipe which should extend into the tank about 18 inches.\n\nThe effluent from the tank should be drawn off at a similar depth below the surface, through a T pipe to prevent the discharge of any scum.\n\nThe gases which are formed by the bacterial action in the tank escape through the inlet T piece along the inlet pipe and through the soil pipe to the root of the house.\n\nAn air vent must be provided for the tank. This should be a concrete slab with cap or manhole cover and frame of sufficient size to permit of the tank being inspected and cleaned out.\n\nWrought iron steps let in to the wall of the tank should be placed immediately below the manhole.\n\nFINAL DISPOSAL OF THE EFFLUENT\n\nThree methods of disposal have been referred to and these will be discussed separately.\n\nDISCHARGE OF EFFLUENT INTO A WATERCOURSE\n\nThe surface water supplies of Saskatchewan are very limited and they are all liable to be used as sources of domestic water supply.\n\nIt is contrary to the provisions of The Public Health Act to discharge any liquid waste, including the effluent from a septic tank, into a stream, river or lake, unless a certificate has been issued by the Minister of Public Health authorizing the effluent in question may be discharged without injury or risk to public health.\n\nSuch a certificate would, generally speaking, be granted subject to the construction of filters or some form of secondary treatment which would render the effluent free from offence.\n\nAny person contemplating sewage disposal by this method should communicate with the Department of Public Health when a special investigation will be made of the circumstances.\n\nDISCHARGE OF EFFLUENT INTO THE SUBSOIL\n\nThis method is the most common form of disposal of a septic tank effluent. It is applicable only to a limited quantity of liquid, such as that represented by the flow from a residence of average size.\n\nIts success depends almost entirely on the porosity of the ground.\n\nThe subsoil throughout the greater part of this province is a non-absorbent clay, and in view of adoption of this method of disposal in Saskatchewan must therefore be attended by regulations.\n\nThe discharge of sewage or of a septic tank effluent into the subsoil within the limits of any city, town or village where sewerage is carried away by means of regular sewers, contrary to The Public Health Act, under the written authority of the Minister of Public Health has been obtained.\n\nThe Use of an Absorption Field.\n\nThe effluent from the septic tank overflows into a \"doubling\" or syphon chamber which gradually fills to a certain level and discharges its contents at intervals by means of an automatic syphon into a series of open-jointed field tiles laid under the surface of the ground.\n\nThe liquid is thus gradually absorbed by the subsoil or soaks through to the underlying strata.\n\nIt must be obvious that if the ground is not porous, that is, if there are no indications of drainage, or if it is already waterlogged, this means of disposal cannot be adopted with success.\n\nIt has frequently been asserted that a clay subsoil may be made to absorb a septic tank effluent by placing the tile pipes in a bed of broken stone or other coarse material.\nStatements like this are entirely misleading.\n\nThe ground is sandy and will absorb a certain amount of liquid. Its capacity to absorb the effluent may certainly be increased by surrounding the tile pipes with broken stones or gravel. But if a 6-inch diameter hole drilled in the clay is filled with stones or gravel, and if it is made so that the water can flow through it, it would be futile to enlarge the hole to 18 inches diameter and to line it with stones as a means of making the water soak into the ground. The effect would simply be to increase the capacity of the hole for holding water.\n\nSimilarly the construction of an artificial absorption bed in a clay subsoil is equivalent to providing a reservoir to hold the sewage and will serve as a matter of time until the trench becomes waterlogged and sewage backs up into the septic tank.\n\nUnderground Filtration.\n\nIn other parts of the Dominion where nature has been more generous with her waterways, the system of subsurface distribution is used extensively in conjunction with a surface outlet for the effluent.\n\nIn some cases the field is not underdrained and the subsoil is used as a filter instead of an absorptive bed. The septic tank effluent after filtering through a few feet of sand or gravel is collected by underground pipes and distributed in the subsoil. The soil oxidizes the sewage before discharge and an indifferent effluent is discharged into a watercourse or on the ground surface.\n\nUnfortunately this method is incapable of general application in this province, owing to the difficulty of obtaining a surface outlet.\n\nAbsorption Field systems in Clay Subsoil\n\nThe treatment and the disposal of a septic tank effluent are two distinct and separate problems which must not be confused.\n\nThe treatment involves the action of the purifying bacteria in the soil does not present a problem of disposing of several hundreds of gallons of liquid daily.\n\nThis is the real difficulty which presents itself on the prairie\u2014the disposal of the treated effluent\u2014and in the absence of a porous subsoil it is only throwing time and money away to construct an absorption field.\n\nDesign of Syphon Chamber.\n\nIf the ground is suitable for an absorption field a syphon chamber should be built to discharge the effluent on the bed intermittently.\n\nThe syphon chamber should be constructed along with, and should form a second chamber of the septic tank. (See figure 1.)\n\nThe capacity of the syphon chamber should be such as to cause the field to be flushed about three times in the twenty-four hours.\n\nTaking the daily flow of 200 gallons this would mean a flushing capacity in the syphon chamber of 600 gallons or 10 cubic feet, or a chamber 2 feet long, by 3 feet wide, by 17 inches deep.\n\nA syphon chamber of these dimensions will be suitable for systems constructed for 12 persons or under.\n\nThe action of the automatic syphon which does the sewage on to the field is as follows:\n\nThe U trap is filled with water and as the sewage flows into the syphon chamber air is introduced into the bell which covers the long leg of the U.\n\nThe sewage is prevented from discharging by the weight of the liquid in the short leg of the syphon. When the surface of the sewage level has fallen enough in the syphon chamber the air pressure forces the end of the syphon over and the pressure of the air contained in the short leg and part of the sewage in the latter is forced out.\n\nThis starts the full flow through the syphon which continues until the sewage in the syphon chamber falls to the under side of the bell when air is again admitted, the pressures are equalized and the flow ceases.\n\nAn overflow pipe from the syphon chamber is necessary in case the syphon should fail at any time. This overflow also acts as a vent pipe to provide air for the syphon. Vent holes should also be left in the wall which divides the septic tank from the syphon chamber, if this wall is raised up to the level of the drain main. A manhole similar to those specified for the septic tank should be set in the cover of the syphon chamber, and specified size iron steps may be provided to facilitate inspection.\n\nConstruction of an Absorption Field.\n\nIf the effluent were to be discharged into the subsoil directly it left the tank, the ground surrounding the house would be fouled.\n\nA fire-clay pipe with tight joints should therefore be laid with a fall of 1 in 100 from the syphon chamber to a point at least 25 feet from the house where a distribution chamber of sufficient size is constructed.\n\nFrom this manhole the effluent is run through open-jointed tiles and absorbed by the ground. (See figures 1 and 2.)\n\nAs a general rule 50 feet of field tile should be provided for each person in the house or 100 feet for a household of six.\n\nIn silty soils or sand or gravel the amount of tile per person may be reduced to 40 or even 30 linear feet.\n\nThe lines of tile should be laid 4 feet apart with a fall of about 3 inches in 100 feet.\n\nThe field may be conveniently excavated by means of a trench and corner.\n\nOpen tile drains should be laid on and surrounded by a 6-inch layer of broken stone, brick, or gravel to prevent clogging during the absorption process and to prevent the entrance of sand or earth at the open joint of the pipes. If gravel is available loose the stones should be covered to advantage with a nine-inch layer before the tile is placed in position.\n\nCare must be taken in backfilling the excavation, in order that the pipes and their surrounding bed be not disturbed.\n\nTrees or bushes should not be grown over absorption beds as the roots may penetrate the openings between the tiles and obstruct the flow of sewage.\n\nDepth of Tank and Absorption Field Below Ground.\n\nThe changes in the provincial plumbing and drainage regulations which has hitherto required all lateral sewers to be laid has been amended with the issue of this bulletin, and drainage of basements will in future be optional.\n\nAny additional expense incurred by draining the basement is justified, however, by the sanitary advantages obtained, and it is recommended that basement drainage be provided in all cases.\n\nWhere there is a good surface fall available the field tiles may, subject to the conditions stated above, be laid on the surface. Where full advantage may be taken of the action of the soil bacteria, namely 16 to 20 inches below the surface.\n\nRolling ground is, however, the exception rather than the rule in this province and in the average instance it will be found that the field tile must of necessity be laid at least three or four feet below ground level.\n\nThe regulations which have hitherto governed the installation of septic tanks in this province required all absorbent systems to be constructed at a depth which would prevent them being frozen or seven feet below the ground surface.\n\nWhile the deep system is the only one which this department can guarantee against failure during the winter months, investigation has shown that septic tanks and absorbent fields may be operated at shallow depths if certain requirements are rigidly observed.\n\nThese requirements are as follows:\n\n(1) The absorbent field, whether shallow or deep, must be constructed in ground which will absorb water. The more absorbent the soil, the less danger there is of the field freezing.\nThe surface of the liquid in the septic tank must not be higher than the original ground level. In instances where connection has been brought from the house above the ground line, in an effort to provide a shallow absorption field, the practice has invariably been accompanied by the freezing of the liquid in the tank.\n\nThe septic tank and all pipe lines, manholes and field tiles must be covered with a layer of dirt or concrete set in thin slabs during the winter months.\n\nThe tank and absorption field must be kept in continuous use throughout the winter. If the house is left vacant for a few days the system will freeze and be rendered useless until the frost goes out of the ground.\n\n**DISCHARGE OF EFFLUENT ON THE GROUND SURFACE**\n\nWhen the ground is incapable of absorbing liquid, the only practicable system of disposal is to pump the effluent from the septic tank and remove it to some distant point where it may be discharged on the ground without giving offence.\n\n**Sewage Pump Well.**\n\nThe effluent from the septic tank should flow into a pump well which is designed to hold at least one week's flow of sewage. (See Figures 3 and 4 and accompanying table.)\n\nIn a household of six the minimum capacity of the pump well would be 1200 or 1360 gallons, or a tank 6 feet by 6 feet by 6 feet deep.\n\nThe liquid may be pumped from the tank by hand or by power as desired.\n\nIn towns and villages the owner should provide a tank-wagon and undertake the regular pumping of the sewage effluent.\n\nIn rural districts the effluent should be discharged on the ground at a point as far removed from the house as practicable and in no case nearer to the house than 100 feet.\n\nDuring the winter months this distance should be considerably increased for the frozen effluent will accumulate on the ground and cause a serious nuisance when the frost goes.\n\nA planting of trees or shrub with good surface drainage makes a suitable area on which to discharge the effluent.\n\n**Location of Sewage Pump Well.**\n\nThe sewage pump well and septic tank should be situated at least 50 feet from the house.\n\nThe drain from the house to the tank should be four inch vitrified pipe with cement mortar joints laid carefully at a grade of 1 in 40 or a fall of approximately \u00bc of an inch to the foot.\n\n**Vegetable Gardens.**\n\nThe question has often been asked \"Is it safe to eat vegetables which have been grown on soil irrigated by a septic tank effluent?\"\n\nIt is only safe if the vegetables have been cooked.\n\nVegetables which are eaten raw such as radish and lettuce should not be grown on areas which may receive a sewage effluent.\n\n**Distance of Sewage Pump Well and Absorption Field From Water Supply**\n\nIt is impracticable to state any minimum distance from an underground water supply at which it is safe to discharge sewage on or into the soil.\n\nThe sewage disposal system and the well should be as far removed from each other as possible and in no case should a septic tank effluent be discharged on or into the ground within 100 feet of a well or other water supply.\n\n---\n\n**OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS**\n\n**Septic Tank.**\n\nThe scum which gathers on the surface of the tank should not be disturbed unless it exceeds 12 inches in depth, when part of it should be removed.\n\nThe scum, by excluding light and air from the liquid, provides the conditions under which anaerobic organisms multiply on its under surface and in the solids which settle to the bottom of the tank.\n\nWhen the solids in the base of the tank reached a depth of 18 inches they should be removed and ploughed into the ground.\n\nThis will necessitate pumping out the tank once or at the most twice yearly.\n\nNOTE: It regular yearly attention is not given to the cleaning of the tank, the accumulation of sludge will become so great that the work of removing it becomes dangerous. Any person who is required to enter a septic tank for the purpose of removing sludge, should have a rope attached to him and there should be two men on the ground surface at all times present.\n\nBefore starting the system the syphon must be filled with water. The manhole cover on the syphon chamber should be lifted occasionally and the action of the syphon examined.\n\nIf the flush is not acting properly the bell of the syphon should be removed, the syphon filled with water and the bell replaced.\n\n**Sewage Pump Well.**\n\nA float with indicating rod projecting through the roof of the pump well can easily be arranged to show when the well requires emptying.\n\nThe float should be arranged to rise higher than a level which is six inches below the overflow pipe of the septic tank.\n\nAny solids or scum which may be present in the pump well should be removed when the septic tank is being cleaned out.\n\nCare should be taken to prevent fouling of the ground below the pump discharge. A watertight chute or pipe should be used to convey the liquid to the wagon or to the point at which it is discharged on the ground.\n\n**Absorption Field.**\n\nThe cover on the distributing manhole should be lifted at regular intervals and the operation of the system noted.\n\n**Protection Against Frost.**\n\nNot later than October 1 of each year all pipe lines, field tiles, manholes and tanks which are less than seven feet below the surface should be covered with a layer of damp pressed straw 12 inches thick.\n\nThis layer should extend 4 feet on each side of tanks and pipes.\n\nManure must not be used for this purpose; not only is it insanitary but it will not protect the ground sufficiently against frost.\n\n**GENERAL CONCLUSIONS**\n\nThe conclusions arrived at from a study of the information embodied in the foregoing pages may be stated briefly as follows:\n\n1. The cesspool is an obsolete and unsatisfactory method of sewage treatment or disposal. The construction and cesspool is contrary to law.\n\n2.

AND OF SYPHON CHAMBER SHOWN IN FIGURES 1, 2 & 4.\n\n---\n\nScale: \\( \\frac{1}{2} = \\text{one foot} \\)\nCast Iron Pipes should be used in place of fire-clay inside all concrete structures and under walls. If the sewer line is laid close to the surface cast iron pipes should be used under any roadways or ground that is subject to traffic.\n\nConcrete should be mixed in the proportion of 1 part of Portland cement to 6 parts of clean pit-run sand and gravel, or 1 part of cement to 2 parts of sand and 4 parts of broken stone.\n\nGravel should be free from alkali and soft water should be used.\n\nConcrete if mixed by hand on a board should be turned over three times dry and three times wet.\n\nWalls and floors should be trowelled to a perfectly smooth finish with a coating of one part of cement to one part of sand.\n\nDistribution Manhole may be constructed of 24 inch or 30 inch diameter concrete pipes set on end, if these are available locally.\n\nReinforcing. The roof slab covering the septic tank, syphon chamber and sewage pump well should be reinforced with iron rods, heavy fence wire, strap iron or any similar material which may be available.\n\nIt is advisable to reinforce also all concrete walls and floors to prevent cracking.\n\nManhole Frames and Covers should be of cast iron. Covers over septic tank and syphon chamber must be airtight. If made on the ground from concrete, covers should be provided with lifting rings and should be sufficiently light to be easily removed.\nGOVERNMENT OF THE PROVINCE OF SASKATCHEWAN\n\nDEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH\nDIVISION OF SANITATION\n\nREGINA July 23, 1935.\n\nMr. S.

It is not possible to make an accurate estimate of the cost, but I do not think that it would exceed $150.00; the tank has been in use 12 years without cleaning and this would have to be done first.\n\nI wrote to the Dept of Public Health for a report and recommendations from their inspector and was advised, July 23rd that it would be forthcoming, but to date have had no further word from them and the Tank should now be put into shape for various reasons.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian agent.\nOttawa, August 14, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, regarding the request of the Principal of the Thunderchild Indian Residential School for assistance to have the septic tank placed in good condition.

I enclose an encumbrance certificate, authorizing an expenditure to the above mentioned amount. After the work is completed, please forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the labour, and also for any materials that may be required. You should state, on each copy of the voucher, that the expenditure was incurred under authority of E. R. No. 3601.

He will wire you later, giving the exact time of his visit and the Department would appreciate if you would arrange to go to the school at the same time. You should inspect the present water system with a view to determining if it will be fairly adequate for the next year.

No. 3601.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nMister W. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Mister Murison:\n\nEach time you were kind enough to visit our school, you had the opportunity to see by yourself its scantiness for the number of children accommodated therein. I did realize it myself as soon as I took charge as Principal, and it already appeared to me that such a state could not subsist any longer - that two halls, (12' x 32' x 9') could not be suitable refectories for 120 children. That dormitories where children are packed two by two are neither hygienic nor decent, That a school like ours, must be granted with an infirmary so that, in case of serious illness or mortality, the dormitories would not be used in its stead.\n\nNaturally my first thought was to beg the Department of Indian Affairs for a new addition to the house. But as you are well aware, dear Mister Murison, there was also the \"Water Question\" and I felt that this one should come first.\n\nLast winter, as the Department had already gone to some expense to provide us with a water supply, and as it would cost still more to make of it a success, and, as on the other hand, it pained me to see the children every day in such an uncomfortable state, I ventured to begin by myself the much desired enlargement. During two weeks I lived the lumberman's life, in shanties, a hundred miles away, to have logs cut and 21,000 feet of lumber sawed. With this lumber, piled and dried during the summer, I undertook, in September, a two story addition, 18' x 40', which I have just completed.\n\nThis new construction, as you may ascertain during your forthcoming visit, which, we hope, will be soon, provides more ample space for refectories and dormitories and suitable accommodation for an infirmary.\n\nUnfortunately the money question has to be considered and, when anyone unexperienced in building enters upon such an enterprise he is doomed to face a deficit. Such is my case, and although the wood work and lumber did not exceed my estimates, these were found to be short for the plumbing and steamfitting. True it is that I took the occasion to better the old system found to be defective on many points, and that I wanted, by so doing, to prevent any accident but, accordingly, the bill, although not exaggerated\nfor the work done, is above our present means.\n\nMay I then be allowed, dear Mr. Murison, to appeal to your most benevolent patronage to obtain for us from the Department the financial we so badly need.\n\nPlease find enclosed the account of M. Holliday covering the cost of plumbing and steamfitting of this new addition.\n\nThanking you sincerely for past favors and with great hope to find in you a sympathetic and, if in your power, a faithful helper, I remain,\n\nDear Mr. Murison,\n\nYours sincerely & gratefully,\n\nJ.H.O. Allard, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal\nSir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith copy of a letter which I received from the Reverend Father Allard, O.M.I., Principal of the Thunderchild Indian Residential School, with which he forwarded an account in favor of Mr. M. A. Holliday, of Battleford, amounting to $953.42 for work performed in connection with installing plumbing and radiation in an addition to the school which was built during the fall. As this was the first intimation I had had regarding this addition, I delayed reporting to the Department until I had an opportunity of visiting the school and making enquiry into the whole matter.\n\nI proceeded to the school on the 25th ultimo. The new addition is 16 ft. by 40 ft. with a full sized basement, cement walls and floor, and two stories above the basement. This addition provided a Sisters' refectory, a small working men's refectory, an enlargement to the girls' and boys' dining rooms, and a girls' dormitory. It also provides a passage which makes it possible for the pupils to pass to the classrooms without having to go through the kitchen, as was necessary before this addition was built. There is no doubt but that the increased space provided by this addition has added greatly to the convenience and accommodation.\n\nAs will be noted from the Principal's letter, when he undertook this work he did so with the idea of financing it himself, but it ran into more money than he anticipated and he now finds that he is unable to meet the total cost and has asked me to submit this account to the Department with the request that they pay it.\n\nI am enclosing Mr. Holliday's account for your perusal and\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nperusal and consideration end, if it is decided to accede to\nthe Principal's request, the account could be sent to Indian\nAgent Macdonald who would issue the necessary voucher. I exam-\nined the work and am satisfied that the services as outlined in\nMr. Holliday's account have been performed. I wish however to\nmake it clear to the Department that I was not a party in any\nway responsible for the action of the Principal in undertaking\nthis work. I was not consulted and the first intimation I had\nthat the work was performed was the receipt of his letter appeal-\ning for assistance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nSir:-\n\nReferring to Departmental letter No. 105-1-5, dated the 3rd September last, with reference to the water situation at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School, I may advise the Department that I met the Reverend Langlois, O.M.I., at Onion Lake on October 3rd when we discussed the water situation in connection with this school. The Reverend Father at that time informed me that he had every confidence in my judgment in connection with the matter and would leave the question in my hands. I had already visited the school and looked over the situation and again en route from Onion Lake to Regina I made a second visit.\n\nAfter conferring with the Reverend Father Allard, Principal of the school, it was found that there would be no necessity for asking the Department to incur any expenditure in connection with the water system this year. The Railway Company had agreed to keep the pumping unit in a proper state of repair and that they would be responsible for any expenditure in connection with its upkeep. Shortly after my visit the pumping engine broke down and the Principal telephoned me, requesting that I take the matter up with the General Superintendent of the C. N. R. I did so by wire and received a telegram from him that the matter would receive preferred attention. It appears however that there was some difficulty in obtaining the parts and these only arrived at the school on the 25th ultimo. I expect that by this time the repairs should be completed. In the meantime the water requirements were met by hauling with tanks, which was very unsatisfactory.\n\nI again visited the spring which is mentioned in my report of January 31st, last, and looked over the ground. I am satisfied that more than an ample supply of water for the requirements of the school could be obtained by tapping this spring and piping the water.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\npiping the water therefrom. The contour of the ground between the school and the spring does not appear to me to offer any great difficulty in laying a pipe line. I am still of the opinion that if the funds could be obtained to carry out the work, that this would be the most satisfactory solution to the water supply question at this school.\n\nI would advise carrying on with the present arrangement until such time as funds are available to undertake the work of obtaining a water supply from the spring. This would appear to me to be the best prospect of providing a permanent solution to the water difficulty at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nOttawa, December 11, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your 302-11A R.C. of the 4th instant, enclosing copy of a communication which you received from the Principal of the Thunderchild Indian Residential School, together with an account amounting to $953.42, covering the cost of work performed in connection with installing plumbing and radiation in an addition which was recently built to the school.\n\nIn this connection I would point out that your letter gave the first intimation the Department has received that an addition was erected to the school building - the work having been carried out by the Principal, on his own authority. While this addition will, no doubt, provide more accommodation and better facilities at the school, yet, I would point out that, as the Principal undertook the work without any reference to the Department and, also, as the school is the property of the church authorities, he is responsible for payment of all costs. In this connection I enclose, for your information, copy of a circular letter that was sent the Principals of all Indian residential schools and the authorities of the churches associated with this Department. The circular letter definitely set forth the obligation of the Department in the payment of accounts for work undertaken without authority having been obtained from the Department. I would refer you, especially, to the second last paragraph.\n\nIn any event, the Department has no funds available to pay the account of M. A. Holliday, and the same is returned herewith. You should forward it to the Principal of the School and inform him that he will have to be responsible for payment.\n\nThe Department has noted, especially, that you were not in any manner consulted by the Principal before he undertook the work in erecting the addition.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nEncl.\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, December 11, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your 302-11A R.C., dated the 4th instant, with reference to the water situation at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School. It is noted that, after conferring with the Principal, it is found there will be no necessity for any expenditure being incurred by the Department in connection with the water system this year and that the railway company will keep the pumping unit in proper state of repair.\n\nIt will not likely be possible to provide the funds required to install a pipeline from the spring, as reported by you in your letter dated January 31st, 1935. In preparing our Estimates for the coming fiscal year, the Honourable the Minister of Finance directed that no additional expenditure be incurred and that the appropriation asked for be kept to the lowest possible point. It is hoped, therefore, that the school authorities will be able to carry on under the existing arrangements, made by them with the railway company, for the supply of water required for use at the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

J. H. O. Allard, O.M.I., Delmas Sask.\n\nfor Salary of A. Geib Night Watchman Thunderchild Residential School for Quarter ending March 31st, 1936.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 105-1-5 dated Sept. 24th, 1935.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS.J. Mclean\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nThunderchild Indian Residential School\nDelmas, Sask., July 16, 1936.\n\nThe Honourable T.A. Crozier,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nMr. Minister,\n\nOn November 8 last, I requested Mr. W. Murison, Inspector of Saskatchewan Indian Reserves, to kindly endeavour obtaining from the Department some financial assistance which was urgently needed to meet part of the expenditures incurred for most urgent repairs to our school.\n\nI was advised by Mr. Murison in his reply of January 7 of the Department's refusal and the reasons therefor. I had anticipated these reasons, Sir, and I was under the impression that I had dealt with them sufficiently in my letter of November 8, by showing the urgent nature of such repairs and the great sacrifices we had to make to reduce their cost. The purpose of this letter, however, is not to criticize the Departmental decision, but to ask for your help in some other repairs which are actually urgent and which we cannot undertake ourselves and which might leave the Department open to rather violent criticisms by the Indians.\n\nOn several occasions I have called the Departmental Agents' attention to the lack of a proper infirmary. Our refectories and dormitories are too small and a large number of our pupils have to sleep two in a bed. This is the reason why I caused an addition to be built to the old building in the hope that the Department would agree to dividing the expenses. Unfortunately, such an addition has not provided for beds, mattresses, pillows and sheets for which we have no money available. So that in spite of the sacrifices we have imposed on ourselves, our pupils still have to sleep two in a bed, which is neither hygienic nor moral.\n\nWith respect to our water supply the Department is in possession of several letters from Mr. Macdonald, your agent, and Mr. Murison, your Inspector, Dr. Norquay and myself, in which we outlined the lack of proper water facilities for our schools. The drinking water given to our pupils is pumped directly from the Saskatchewan River by the Canadian National Railway and is not fit for consumption, and which, undoubtedly, would be condemned by any health inspector. It is to be feared that should there occur any serious diseases or deaths, an investigation would have to be held.\nAnother impending source of trouble, Sir, is the lack of proper fire protection. The two outside staircases of our school are more in the nature of fire traps than fire escapes. They are built of wood and so old that we will not use them even for fire drills. If a fire should occur during the night, there would probably be losses of lives.\n\nSome two years ago, when Dr. McGill, Superintendent of Indian Affairs, visited us, I drew his attention to the matter. He had promised me at the time to see to it that the conditions be improved, but nothing has been done so far. I wish hereby to withdraw my responsibility in that connection.\n\nWe are also in great need of some house where we could give shelter to the Indians coming to visit their children. The shack now in use for that purpose is not fit for human beings, particularly during the winter. When the school was founded, such a need was not so pressing since most of the reserves were situated close by. Since, however, these reserves have been sold and the Indians are now living 50 to 60 miles and even 70 miles from here, that they must stay two or three days when they come.\n\nIt is true, Sir, that the Delmas Indian school is the property of the church. This is always the argument when we ask for assistance, but to my mind, this should not be a reason wherefor the Department should refuse assistance and the Indians of our reserves should meet with the same treatment as those of other localities. Very much to the contrary, the church has been able to build a school and keep it at the cost of great sacrifices when the pupils were few and the reserves at close vicinity, thus relieving the Department of an enormous burden, is it not somewhat the Department's duty to show them more generosity towards the school now that circumstances have changed, that Indians realize better the importance of instruction, that recruiting is more expensive and that the church can no longer support the charge. Your representatives at Battleford and Regina will tell you that we have done nothing to meet the situation and that we have made great sacrifices to keep this school going. May I hope, Sir, that you will give this letter your kind consideration and share in meeting the expenditures caused by these improvements which will facilitate the functioning of the school and give no ground to criticism.\n\n(Complimentary closing)\n\u00c0 l'\u00c9minable T. A. Gr\u00e9er, Ministre de l'Int\u00e9rieur et des Affaires Indiennes\n\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMonsieur le Ministre:\n\nLe deux novembre dernier, j'\u00e9crivais \u00e0 monsieur W. Marison, Inspecteur des Agences Indiennes de la Saskatchewan, lui demandant de nous aider \u00e0 obtenir du D\u00e9partement un secours financier dont nous avions grandement besoin pour rencontrer une partie des d\u00e9penses encourues par des r\u00e9parations absolument urgentes \u00e0 notre \u00c9cole.\n\nDans sa r\u00e9ponse du sept janvier, monsieur Marison me communique le refus du D\u00e9partement et les raisons de ce refus. Ces raisons, monsieur le Ministre, je les avais pr\u00e9vues et je croyais y avoir suffisamment r\u00e9pondu dans ma lettre du deux novembre en montrant l'urgence de l'am\u00e9lioration et les grands sacrifices que nous nous \u00e9tions impos\u00e9s pour en diminuer le co\u00fbt. Tout de m\u00eame, mon intention, en vous \u00e9crivant aujourd'hui, monsieur le Ministre, n'est pas de critiquer la d\u00e9cision du D\u00e9partement, mais de solliciter votre appui pour d'autres am\u00e9liorations aussi urgentes que nous ne pouvons entreprendre nous-m\u00eames et dont l'absence expose le D\u00e9partement \u00e0 des critiques assez vives de la part des Indiens.\n\n\u00c0 plusieurs reprises j'ai fait conna\u00eetre aux repr\u00e9sentants du D\u00e9partement l'absence de salle d'infirmierie, l'exigu\u00eft\u00e9 de nos r\u00e9fectoires, de nos dortoirs et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de coucher un grand nombre d'enfants deux par deux dans le m\u00eame lit. C'est cette raison qui m'a fait entreprendre une addition assez consid\u00e9rable \u00e0 l'ancienne b\u00e2tisse, esp\u00e9rant que le D\u00e9partement consentirait \u00e0 en partager la d\u00e9pense. Malheureusement cette addition ne nous a fourni ni lits, ni matelas, ni oreillers, ni draps et nous n'avons pas d'argent pour en acheter, de sorte que, malgr\u00e9 les sacrifices que nous nous sommes impos\u00e9s, nous sommes encore oblig\u00e9s de coucher les enfants deux par deux, ce qui n'est pas tr\u00e8s hygi\u00e9nique ni tr\u00e8s moral.\nQuant \u00e0 notre syst\u00e8me d'aqueduc, le D\u00e9partement est en possession de plusieurs lettres de Monsieur Macdonald, votre Agent, de Monsieur Morison, votre Inspecteur, du Docteur Moray et de moi-m\u00eame, exposant la triste situation de l'Ecole vis-\u00e0-vis son approvisionnement d'eau. L'eau bue par nos enfants, pomp\u00e9e directement de la rivi\u00e8re Saskatchewan par le Canadien National Railway pour ses locomotives, n'est pas une eau potable et serait certainement condamn\u00e9e par tout inspecteur de sant\u00e9. Si des maladies s\u00e9v\u00e8res, avec mortalit\u00e9, se d\u00e9claraient, une enqu\u00eate serait \u00e0 craindre.\n\nUne autre source de troubles \u00e0 craindre, Monsieur le Ministre, est notre manque de protection contre le feu. Les deux escaliers ext\u00e9rieurs dont est munie notre \u00c9cole \u00e0 cette fin, sont plut\u00f4t des trappes \u00e0 feu que des escaliers de sauvetage. Ils sont en bois, et tellement vieux que nous n'osons pas m\u00eame nous en servir pour \"Fire Drills\". Des pertes de vie s'en suivraient tr\u00e8s probablement si nous avions le malheur d'avoir un incendie l\u00e0-bas. Il y a deux ans, lors de son passage \u00e0 Delmas, j'avais attir\u00e9 l'attention du Surintendant des Affaires Indiennes, le Docteur W.H. McGill, sur ce danger. Il m'avait promis d'y rem\u00e9dier, mais rien n'a encore \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. Je tiens par les pr\u00e9sentes \u00e0 d\u00e9gager enti\u00e8rement ma responsabilit\u00e9 sur ce sujet.\n\nEnfin, Monsieur le Ministre, nous aurions grandement besoin d'une maison convenable pour h\u00e9berger les Indiens lorsqu'ils viennent visiter leurs enfants. L'esp\u00e8ce de \"Schack\" qui est actuellement \u00e0 leur disposition n'est pas propre \u00e0 \u00eatre habit\u00e9e par des \u00eatres humains, surtout en hiver. Lorsque l'Ecole fut fond\u00e9e, ce besoin \u00e9tait moins urgent; la plupart des R\u00e9serves \u00e9tant \u00e0 proximit\u00e9. Mais deux de ces r\u00e9serves ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 vendues depuis et les Indiens repouss\u00e9s \u00e0 cinquante, soixante et m\u00eame soixante-dix milles d'ici, il leur faut n\u00e9cessairement s\u00e9journer deux ou trois jours \u00e0 l'Ecole lorsqu'ils y viennent.\n\nIl est vrai, Monsieur le Ministre, que l'Ecole Indienne de Delmas est la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'Eglise; c'est une remarque qu'on nous fait parfois lorsque nous demandons du secours, mais il me semble que ce n'est pas une raison pour que cette \u00c9cole soit priv\u00e9e de la protection du D\u00e9partement et que les Indiens de nos R\u00e9serves soient moins bien trait\u00e9s que ceux d'autres localit\u00e9s. Au contraire, si l'Eglise a pu b\u00e2tir elle-m\u00eame cette \u00c9cole et l'entretenir au prix des plus grands sacrifices lorsque les en-\nLes enfants \u00e9taient peu nombreux et les r\u00e9serves \u00e0 proximit\u00e9, d\u00e9livrant ainsi le D\u00e9partement d'un fardeau qui lui incombait, ce dernier ne doit-il pas se montrer d'autant plus g\u00e9n\u00e9reux envers cette \u00e9cole maintenant que les circonstances sont chang\u00e9es : que les Indiens comprennent davantage l'importance de l'instruction, que le recrutement est plus dispendieux et que l'Eglise ne peut suffire \u00e0 boucher le budget. Vos repr\u00e9sentants \u00e0 Battleford et \u00e0 Regina vous diront que nous n'\u00e9pargnons rien pour faire face \u00e0 la situation, que les sommes que nous avons vers\u00e9es et les sacrifices que nous avons faits pour mettre cette \u00e9cole sur un pied de subsistance sont consid\u00e9rables.\n\nPermettez-moi, Monsieur le Ministre, de compter sur votre bienveillant patronage pour obtenir au plus t\u00f4t ces am\u00e9liorations qui contribueront au bon fonctionnement de l'Ecole et nous mettront, ainsi que le D\u00e9partement, \u00e0 l'abri des critiques de nos Indiens.\n\nDaignez, Honorable Monsieur, croire \u00e0 tout mon d\u00e9vouement et tout mon respect et ne voir, dans cette lettre, qu'un vif d\u00e9sir de succ\u00e8s pour l'\u0153uvre que le D\u00e9partement et mes Sup\u00e9rieurs m'ont confi\u00e9e.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

McGINN\n\nThe attached unsigned letter (July 16) from Thunderchild I.R. School, Delmas, Sask., is referred for return with translation and report covering the matter referred to -\n\nW.J.F. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\nJuly 28th, 1936.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General\n\nI have your memorandum of the 21st instant, enclosing letter received from the Principal of the Thundershild Indian Residential School.\n\nThis school is, approximately, three-quarters of a mile from Delmas, Sask. It is conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church, the Principal being Rev. J. H. O. Allard, O.M.I.\n\nThe Thundershild Residential School is owned by the Oblate Order and is a very old building. Last November, the Principal forwarded through Inspector Murison's office an account for $550.42, covering the cost of plumbing and radiation in an addition which the school authorities had recently built to the school. Due to the fact that the Department had not been consulted before the work was started and the further fact that there were no funds available in our appropriation for meeting this expenditure, the account was not paid. This explains the Principal's reference in the second paragraph of his letter of the 16th instant.\n\nNo request has been received for beds, mattresses, pillows and sheets mentioned in the third paragraph of the letter. Funds for these could be obtained from our appropriation this year if you wish to supply them. I am inclined to feel that they are required, in view of the fact that the school authorities\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General\n\nbuilt a new addition to the school last year, as mentioned above.\n\nThe water supply at this school has been a cause of considerable concern for some time past. At the present time, and for the past few years, the school has been obtaining their water from the Canadian Pacific Railway, who pump water to Delmas for the use of their engines. At one time, Delmas was a fairly large railway centre but, about two years ago, the Canadian Pacific Railway curtailed their work at this point and, as a consequence, were not so anxious to pump water as they did not have any great use for it. However, this was taken up with the railway authorities and the previous arrangements with the Thunderchild Residential School for supplying water were continued. The school has complained on several occasions of the cost to them of this system of obtaining water. There is no doubt that they are justified in this regard but, at the same time, it appears impossible to obtain water from wells. In 1934, the Department expended a very large sum of money in an endeavour to find water but, although one or two wells were dug to a considerable depth, no water was obtained. It has been reported that an adequate supply of water can be obtained from a spring but this would involve an expenditure of at least $10,000. The Department has not given any consideration to this latter proposal due to the lack of funds and the additional fact that, if at any time it was decided to replace the old building by a new building, the location of the school would probably be changed.\n\nNo recent request has been received; nor have any funds been provided, for fire escapes or a house to shelter Indians coming to the school to visit their children. The fire hazard at this school has been recognized for some time and an allowance is made for a night watchman's services during the period November 1st to April 30th, each year.\n\nI return the original unsigned letter received by you, also a translation. A copy of this letter was forwarded direct to the Department and was signed by the Principal, Rev. J.H.O. Allard.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nMODERN CONVENIENCES\n\nTHE GREAT ENGINEERING TRIUMPH\nAlthough exceedingly compact in design, this Delco-Light is sturdily built. It has a capacity of 800-watts, 32 volt, direct current. It is obtainable in battery charging, or, with Sentry Box, fully automatic in operation. Regular Delco-Light batteries, including Delco-Light Ironclads, are used with the plant.\n\nDELCO-LIGHT IRONCLAD BATTERIES\nThe new Delco-Light Ironclad 1,000 cycle battery may be had in nine and thirteen plate sizes of 50 and 200 ampere hour capacity. Delco pasted plates, 500 cycle batteries with seven and thirteen plates of 80 and 160 ampere hour capacity are also available. All batteries come in glass jars unless rubber cells are especially ordered.\n\n1500-WATT DELCO-LIGHT\nBoth 32-volt and 110-volt direct current models are available in the 1500-watt Delco-Light plant. Both battery charging and automatic combination battery charging and automatic manually operated and hand-cranked models are available. Delco-Light plants may be connected in parallel, giving a great variety of capacities.\n\nMARINE-TYPE DELCO-LIGHT\nA compact, water-cooled, 800-watt Delco-Light has been designed especially for boat installations on either fresh or salt water. Ask your Delco-Light man or write directly to us for full information.\nRev. Father Allard,\nThunderchild Indian School,\nDelmas, Sask.\n\nDear Father D'Allard:\n\nOur Service Manager inspected your equipment this week and found your batteries used up. The sediment is up to the plates, causing short circuits in many cells and of course, reducing the efficiency of the battery to practically nil.\n\nThere is a large sediment space in the batteries, sufficient to hold all the sediment and this space is not filled. The readings are accordingly very low and much of the current put into them by the plant, is wasted.\n\nA new set of the same capacity would cost as follows:\n\n56 Cell KXG-7 Delco Standard Battery $410.00\nLess Allowance for old jars -60.00\n\nPrice F.O.B.

Murison,\nInspector of Saskatchewan Indian Reserves, to kindly endeavour\nobtaining from the Department some financial assistance which\nwas urgently needed to meet part of the expenditures incurred\nfor most urgent repairs to our school.\n\nI was advised by Mr. Murison in his reply of\nJanuary 7 of the Department's refusal and the reasons therefor.\nI had anticipated those reasons, Sir, and I was under the impression\nthat I had dealt with them sufficiently in my letter of November\n2, by showing the urgent nature of such repairs and the great sacrifices\nwe had to make to reduce their cost. The purpose of this letter,\nhowever, is not to criticize the Departmental decision, but to ask\nfor your help in some other repairs which are actually urgent and\nwhich we cannot undertake ourselves and which might leave the Department\nopened to rather violent criticisms by the Indians.\n\nOn several occasions I have called the Departmental\nAgents' attention to the lack of a proper infirmary. Our\nrefectories and dormitories are too small and a large number of our\npupils have to sleep two in a bed. This is the reason why I\ncaused an addition to be built to the old building in the hope that the\nDepartment would agree to dividing the expenses. Unfortunately, such\nan addition has not provided for beds, mattresses, pillows and sheets\nfor which we have no money available. So that in spite of the\nsacrifices we have imposed to ourselves, our pupils still have to sleep\ntwo in a bed, which is neither hygienic nor moral.\n\nWith respect to our water supply the Department is\nin possession of several letters from Mr. Macdonald, your agent,\nand Mr. Murison, your Inspector, Dr. Norquay and myself, in\nwhich we outlined the lack of proper water facilities for\nour schools. The drinking water given to our pupils is pumped\ndirectly from the Saskatchewan River by the Canadian National Railway\nand is not fit for consumption, and which, undoubtedly, would be condemned by any health inspector. It is to be feared that should there occur any serious diseases or deaths, an investigation would have to be held.\n\nAnother impending source of trouble, Sir, is the lack of proper fire protection. The two outside staircases of our school are more in the nature of fire traps than fire escapes. They are built of wood and so old that we will not use them even for fire drills. If a fire should occur during the night, there would probably be losses of lives. Some two years ago, when Dr. McGill, Superintendent of Indian Affairs, visited us, I drew his attention to the matter. He had promised me at the time to see to it that the conditions be improved, but nothing has been done so far. I wish hereby to withdraw my responsibility in that connection.\n\nWe are also in great need of some house where we could give shelter to the Indians coming to visit their children. The shack now in use for that purpose is not fit for human beings, particularly during the winter. When the school was founded, such a need was not so pressing since most of the Reserves were situated close by. Since, however, those reserves have been sold and the Indians are now living 50 to 60 miles and even 70 miles from here, that they must stay two or three days when they come.\n\nIt is true, Sir, that the Delmas Indian school is the property of the church. This is always the argument when we ask for assistance, but to my mind, this should not be a reason wherefor the Department should refuse assistance and the Indians of our reserves should meet with the same treatment as those of other localities. Very much to the contrary, if the church has been able to build a school and keep it at the cost of great sacrifices when the pupils were few and the reserves at close vicinity, thus relieving the Department of an onerous burden, is it not somewhat the Department's duty to show them more generosity towards the school now that circumstances have changed, that Indians realize better the importance of instruction, that recruiting is more expensive and that the church can no longer support the charge. Your representatives at Battleford and Regina will tell you that we have spared nothing to meet the situation and that we have made great sacrifices to keep this school going. May I hope, Sir, that you will give this letter your kind consideration and share in meeting the expenditures caused by these improvements which will facilitate the functioning of the school and give no ground to criticism.\n\n(Complimentary closing)\nTHUNDERCHILD INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nHonourable T.

I presume that in view of the suggestion made in the fourth paragraph of your memorandum of the 28th ultimo that he could be asked to furnish information regarding the number of beds, mattresses, pillows and sheets required, this could receive further consideration when the information is received.\n\nW.J.F.

Sir:\n\nYour letter of the 16th ultimo addressed to the Honorable the Minister has been referred to this Department for reply.\n\nRegarding the supplying of a number of beds and mattresses, I have to say that the Department will be favourably disposed to arranging for the purchase of this equipment. I would request that you supply the size of the beds and the number of each size required. Institution beds are manufactured in the following lengths: - 5', 5'4\" and 6' and are 38\" wide. You might also state the number of pillows required. I might add that the Department does not supply sheets.\n\nWith reference to fire protection, I would request that you advise the Department of the type of fire escapes required, in order to provide adequate escape for the pupils in case of fire. I would suggest that you consult Mr. Agent Macdonald, and it will, no doubt, be possible to obtain an estimate of the cost of supplying and installing the fire escapes.\n\nI regret that there are no funds available for the cost of a house to be used as a shelter for the Indians who come to the school to visit their children.\n\nRegarding the installing of a water supply system for the school, I have to say that no funds are provided for this purpose in our Appropriation for the current fiscal year. It is hoped that the school will be able to carry on the existing arrangement for the obtaining of water from the Canadian National Railway system.\n\nMr. Agent Macdonald is being forwarded a copy of this letter, and you should consult him regarding the information asked for in connection with the beds required and the fire escapes.\n\nI may add that the Department has requested Mr. Inspector Hurison, Regina, to obtain prices for the supplying of batteries for the electric light plant, and it is hoped that the order for these will be placed at an early date.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

The Clerk at the Battleford Agency replied to this letter stating that he understood that the present batteries are about six years old, but did not state their condition. Reverend Father Allard came personally to the office during my absence and informed Miss Wylie that he had had the batteries examined by an expert who stated that they might give out at any time. Father Allard during my absence obtained quotations from the Electric Equipment Limited, Saskatoon, and the Sterling Mills Limited who are Agents for the Lemery-Dennison Electric Limited.\n\nThe battery required is a 56 cell, 7 plate, 80 ampere hour battery. The Electric Equipment Company of Saskatoon submit a quotation of $410.00 and will give an allowance of $60.00 for the old batteries, bringing the net cost to $350.00, F.O.B. Battleford. The Lemery-Dennison Electric quote $324.30 F.O.B. Toronto. In their quotation they do not state what they will allow for the old batteries, but it is expected that they would allow about the same as the Electric Equipment.\n\nThe Reverend Principal favors the Electric Equipment in as much as he is assured of their interest and service in connection with the operation of the batteries.

Pratt.\n\nBuild 1100\nadditions & improved\nwooden structure\nEX'D.\n\nOctober 13, 1936.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nI have Mr. Pratt's memorandum of the 8th instant, regarding the erection of a new residential school building at Battleford or North Battleford, to replace the present school at Delmas, Sask., known as the Thunderchild Indian Residential School, in the Battleford Indian agency.\n\nWith reference to this matter, I would say that the present building at Delmas is a church-owned institution, erected in 1900, and is of wooden construction. Alterations and improvements have been made from time to time, but the building is unsuitable, is badly arranged inside, and it would be a waste of money to remodel and make further repairs. Besides, there is a very considerable fire hazard and the water supply is inadequate. An effort was made two years ago to obtain a water supply by drilling a well, but the scheme had to be abandoned as no water could be obtained after drilling to a depth of over 700 ft.\n\nThere is nothing official on our files regarding the rebuilding of the school at or near\n\n- Battleford\nBattleford, but the matter has been discussed with the church officials during their visit to the Department, and they have urged the erection of a new building.\n\nIt is the opinion of all authorities concerned, viz.: the officials of the Department and the church authorities, that a new school building is needed, to replace the present old, unsuitable building at Delano, and that the proper location would be at or near Battleford. However, no funds are provided at the present time to acquire a site and erect the new building. If a new building is erected, it would require accommodation for 150 children. The cost would be in the vicinity of $130,000.00, plus cost of site.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nOTTAWA, Sept. 26th 1926.\n\nTo Messrs.

This year we have been obliged to refuse the admission to several applicants.\n\nNaturally this increase entails higher expenses and calls for better equipment. To face the situation we would greatly appreciate help from the Department along the following lines:\n\n1. Three sewing machines: a heavy one (Jailor Machine) for the making of coats, overalls, etc., estimated at $71.40; and two of ordinary type (family machines) for making dresses, underwear, etc., estimated at $91.80.\n\n2. A potato digger. For the maintenance of our pupils a yield of a thousand bushels of potatoes would be required yearly. It is utterly impossible to raise such a crop without some machinery, and a potato digger is an indispensable implement.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, School Files,\n(667-10, Volume 6557, File 655-5, part 3)\nSir:\n\nI beg to forward attached, letter from the Rev J.H.O.Allard, O.M.I., Principal of the Thunderchild Residential School, requesting assistance as follows.\n\n2 Sewing Machines, Ordinary,\nL \" Heavy for Tailoring.\n1 Potato Digger,\n1 Manure Spreader.\n75 Gals Paint,\n15 \" Varnish.\n50 \" Raw Linseed Oil.\n25 # Lamp Black.\n\nThe approximate value of all this material would be $950.00.

A. Holiday, of Battleford, for installing three fire escapes at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School.\n\nIn looking through the files at this office I find that on August 24th last Mr. Inspector Murison telephoned Mr. H. Crabtree, of Regina, representative for the Dominion Bridge and Iron Works, of Winnipeg, asking him to get in touch with yourself regarding a quotation. I have again taken the matter up with Mr. Crabtree and it would seem that this matter had been overlooked. However he said he would communicate with you immediately. When you receive his quotation I would ask you to forward it to the Department, keeping a copy at your office, and forwarding one here for my file.\n\nI am forwarding a copy of this letter to the Department, together with Mr. Holiday's quotation and I am asking them to advise you whether the order is to be given to him. It may be that the Department will await the Dominion Bridge Company's tender before placing the order.\n\nThe copy of Department letter No. 105-1-5, dated August 20th addressed to the Principal, has apparently not been received here. The only letter I find on file is your No. 251-308, dated September 2nd last.\n\nYours truly,\n\nC. P. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nS. L.

P. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies Saskatchewan.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 10, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your 302-11A R.C., of the 5th instant, enclosing copies of correspondence exchanged between yourself and Mr. S. L. Macdonald, Indian Agent, Battleford, Sask., regarding the installation of fire escapes for the Thunderchild Indian Residential School. The quotation from Mr. M. A. Holliday, Battleford, for installing the fire escapes, was also received.\n\nIn this connection I have to say, as our appropriation for the current fiscal year has now been practically assigned, it will not be possible to provide the expenditure required in installing the fire escapes. Funds for the purpose are being included in our Estimates for the fiscal year 1937-38, and I would suggest, therefore, that this matter be brought to the attention of the Department early next summer. At the same time, full particulars should be given as to the type and, if possible, a sketch showing where the fire escapes will be installed on the building. After this information is received, instructions will be issued from here, regarding the names of the firms who should be asked to quote for supplying and installing the escapes. Please inform Mr. Agent Macdonald accordingly.\n\nThe Department is providing a grant towards payment of the salary of a night watchman, and it is hoped that he gives efficient service and that there will be no danger of fire occurring during the period the furnace is in operation this present winter and the coming spring months. Agent Macdonald should instruct the Principal to see that there is no rubbish or inflammable material kept near the furnace or stoves.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\n\nC. P.

This plant had been completely repaired and put in order last summer and I expected to have a good service from it all winter. Just before Christmas, it was again put out and we had no light for some days. I sent to Saskatoon an engineer to know about this deficiency. They said there that the plant was far too small for our requirements and that it would never give satisfaction; on the contrary, it would give trouble. In fact, we have at school 170 bulbs using 6750 watts per hour. Our plant can produce only 2500 watts per hour; it is easy to see that we cannot rely on this plant. Moreover, this plant is obsolete, being a 1918 model and we cannot even find repairs.\n\nI had a correspondence with the Lister Diesel generating plants, and from their information, it is sure that we need a 4.5 Kilowatt-hour plant. They have this in stock, but they ask for $1294.00 for the complete plant. The school could not pay for this amount and I ask you if you could not spare $500.00 in our favor that we may buy this plant at once. The school would pay the balance up to $1294.00.\n\nI did not ask for any money this year to be employed at school for improvement and I hope to obtain from you these $500.00.\n\nAn early and favorable reply will be much appreciated as we need badly another plant.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Joseph Angin,\nPrincipal.\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR MCGILL\n\nThe Thunderchild Indian residential school is located near Delmas, Saskatchewan, in the Battleford Indian Agency.

J. Angin, Delmas, Sask., for April Night-Watchman Thunderchild Indian Residential School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 105-1-5 dated October 5th, 1938.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa\n\nForm No. I.A. 518\nMr. Mc Donald,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford Sask.\n\nRe. Indian School Delmas Electrical Alterations.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs requested by your office, I have made an inspection trip to the above mentioned Indian School at Delmas Sask., and carefully checked over the entire system of wiring in the School, and Barn, and outer buildings.\n\nIn the main school building, we have an overloaded condition existing with reference to the sub circuits, and the entire building is supplied by two circuits, in many of the rooms drop cord has been used, and installed behind and through wood work with no additional insulation provided, in one room I saw an electric plate of 600 watts connected to drop cord that has a capacity of only 300 watts, something similar to this occurs in the basement of the building in the wash room, where we have three washing machines operating at the same time, and supplied with drop cord and brass key sockets over a cement flooring.\n\nIn the Barns, Chicken House, Toilets, Summer Larder, Ironing Room, and Meat house, there is a decided lack of proper fusing of circuits, weatherproof solid wire has been used into these buildings, no strain insulators used on the outside to take care of the wind swing on the feed wires. The pole line from the Main building has not the proper spacing between wires, has been patched with rubber covered inside wiring which is not allowed, and the entire outdoor system is supplied by two wires only, which constitutes an overloaded condition.\n\nIn going from Room to Room in the Main building, I was constantly met with irregular practices of wiring, that will not let me patch up the system without a very considerable amount of rewiring, to bring this system up to anything like present day installations of safety from fire hazards. I might here make the suggestion that the control board from the Generator Plant in the Engine Room, be moved to a point of more accessibility in case of Fire, as it is now situated, where there to be a fire in this room, a person could disconnect the system without having to pass through the fire to reach the board. There are no sub-circuit fuse protections provided in the Engine Room, and the entire building is supplied by only two circuits inside.\nI would suggest that the multifarious circuits running at all angles through out the grounds outside be overhauled and straightened up; we can use a great deal of the material already in service and a little new material added, also the outside circuits be grounded and protected from lightning. Also in the Main building that ceiling outlet boxes be installed behind the present outlets, and all splicing and taping be done in these boxes, at present there are no soldered joints, no rubber tape used on the splices throughout the entire system.\n\nI have tabulated the materials I would require to make the necessary alterations to this system, and believe that it can be made very much neater, more efficient, and safer from fire hazard, also cut down a great deal on line losses, at a cost of $158.00 materials and labour supplied. We are fully qualified to make these alterations, being licensed and bonded in the Province and this City since 1929, and working at the trade since 1923. We can further guarantee a very decided improvement to the system if this step is taken by the Department.\n\nThanking you for the opportunity of making the inspection, and submitting an estimate to your office for this work, I trust we may be favoured by your considerations, I beg to remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMAY 1 1939\n\nREGINA, SASK.\nTHE SASKATCHEWAN POWER COMMISSION\n\nREGINA.\n\nRectory.\n\nDefects:\nService, 2 black wires, conduit not continuous to switch.

I am now in receipt of a letter from Mr. Macdonald stating that there is no registered electrician on our list, but that he had consulted Mr. Cruickshank, President of the Federal Committee, who recommended the Potter Electric Shop.\n\nI am now attaching the Saskatchewan Power Commission's report, together with report from Potter's Electric Shop, for your attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept' of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nTR/FMo\nOttawa,\nMay 9, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 1st instant with reference to the electric wiring at the Thunderchild Indian residential school.\n\nI note that the Potter Electric Shop quote a price of $1365.00 for material and labour. This appears rather high but it is quite possible that the electric wiring in this building is in bad condition.\n\nAs you are aware the Thunderchild school is Church-owned and in our current year's appropriation we provided an amount of $1100.00 for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment.\n\nI presume that the Principal of the school has also been informed of the report of the Saskatchewan Power Commission. Is the Principal prepared to pay any costs for the rewiring of the school over and above the amount that is available in our current year's appropriation? In that event please let me know and I will then supply you with the names of other firms from whom quotations might be secured.\n\nIn the event of the Principal agreeing to pay the extra amount required over and above our grant it should be distinctly understood with him that no further payments for repairs and improvements or purchase of new material at this school can be made during the current fiscal year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. Thos.

Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent, Battleford.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your file in connection with lighting system of the school and may say that I am not prepared to pay part of the expenses incurred, chiefly at the beginning of the financial year.\n\nI am not under the impression that the lighting system be so defective as we have replaced completely the lighting motor with a Lister Diesel, and that we can now regulate the current very easily; with the Delco motor we had before, it was impossible to regulate the current.\n\nOn another hand, Mr. Inspector Robertson states that the school, in case of repairs to the lighting system, could not obtain any other improvement during the fiscal year. I know however that Ottawa asked for suggestions to have a shop built on the grounds of the school, and if even nothing is done in this connection, I would suggest that the money that has been appropriated for the Thunder child School be used for a better purpose, for instance, to supply an extractor and a washer for the laundry. The small Maytag machines we have for the laundry are far too small and light, and do not give satisfaction. The machines that could give satisfaction would be an extractor and a washer designed in the Stanley Brock Catalogue and that are in use in all the other Indian Schools.\n\nHoping this will meet with your approval, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) Rev. Joseph Angin, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal\nDear Sir:\n\nRef: Your 105-1-5 of May 9th, Electric Wiring,\nThunderchild Residential School.\n\nOn May 15th I wrote Mr. Macdonald, Agent, and asked him to take\nthe matter up with the Principal of the Thunderchild School. I am now in\nreceipt of a reply in which he says that the matter has been taken up with\nthe Principal and his letter is attached. Mr. Macdonald goes on to say:\n\n\"It is evident from his point of view that fire danger is a minor\nconsideration, and with that building, which is a fire invitation at best,\nit is hard to understand his attitude. Apparently a workshop and new washing\nmachines are of more importance.\n\n\"These buildings are Church property, but even so, on my recom-\nmendations, large amounts have been expended during the last few years, re-\nflooring the whole place, a new barn and deep drilling for water, on advice\nof the water power engineers, fire escapes, etc., but now when it comes to\nlife protection and the Department is willing to go half way, they are not\nthere. Apparently the only thing is to drop it and let the Provincial Fire\nInspectors shut down on them and start something.\"\n\nIt will be noted in the Principal's letter that he states he is\nnot prepared to pay part of the expenses incurred, and he is not under the\nimpression that the lighting system is so defective.\n\nI might say, with regard to the Provincial authorities, that I\nhave received another letter from them, under date of May 19th, which reads\nas follows: \"With reference to our letter of April 19th, we will kindly\nask you to advise us if the defective wiring in the Delmas Indian School\nhas been corrected.\"\n\nWith regard to the Delmas School, as Mr. Macdonald states, this\nbuilding is a fire invitation at best. Apparently the Provincial authorities\n\nconsider the...........\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nconsider the condition of the present wiring very serious. As the Principal is not willing to contribute anything to the rewiring of this school, I would suggest that the matter be taken up with the Provincial authorities and see if it would not be possible to have the school building itself rewired, or at least the wiring put in such a condition that the fire hazard from that cause would be avoided, with the appropriation we have for this season, as it appears to me the correcting of this condition is of vital importance.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos.

This includes funding for the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation and the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission.\n\nThe report also highlights the importance of recognizing the contributions of Indigenous peoples to Canadian society, including their role in education. It calls for increased funding for Indigenous-led education programs and the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.\n\nThe report concludes by urging the federal government to take immediate action to address the legacy of residential schools and to ensure that Indigenous peoples have full access to quality education.\nThe Board concurs in the above report and recommendation, and submit the same for favorable consideration.\n\nR.

On these reserves, under proper supervision, community farming would succeed, but proper supervision is needed first. All the Indians of these three bands are anxious to farm and are making requests for horses for the purpose, but I do not think this, only, will solve their difficulties, as distributing horses about the reserves, with no supervision and no direction of their efforts would be useless. On these two reserves, as education is a problem, day schools, with the right kind of teachers, would be the best beginning, in my opinion. At the present time the Indians of these reserves are asking for farming instructors, but there are a number of children not being educated, and there is no school for them to attend. These children are the ones to whom we must look for the future of their reserves and education, along proper lines, on their own reserves, in daily contact with their parents and the other Indians of the reserve, would be beneficial for their future welfare, and contact with them, and with the right kind of teachers, would be beneficial to the parents, as well.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander.\nAgent.\nThe conduit system shall be permanently grounded by means of suitable ground rod and clamps.\n\nThe frame of generator shall also be grounded and bonded to conduit system so that no potential difference can exist.\n\nWiring between generator and switchboard shall be in conduit.

Where wires leave conduit they shall be supported by means of suitable porcelain insulators to the point where they are attached to batteries.\n\nPlans have been drawn for basement, ground and first floor only. The second floor is very similar to first except that there are only 20 outlets. The floor area is practically the same as that of the first floor.\n\nEach outlet shall be finished with an approved chain pull socket, so that individual control of lighting is possible.\n\nI shall be pleased to do this work as per these specifications and plans enclosed for the sum of One Thousand Dollars, providing the school Officials let their caretaker act as helper on this job, also that they will provide board and room for a licensed Journeyman electrician until the completion of the contract.\n\nYou will please find enclosed the plans I have had drawn for this work.\n\nAnd hoping to be favoured with this work at an early date, I am\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.

The last information I had from the Department was that the quotations on the requiring were being obtained.\n\nI might point out that all electric wiring comes under Provincial inspection. The Provincial authorities notified us some time ago that the present wiring was unsafe and practically demanded that those conditions be rectified. This is a matter that, in my opinion, should not be delayed. Our Department has been notified the wiring is uncertain. Should a fire occur, we would be subject to severe censure, and should there be any casualties, we would be held strictly responsible by the people of Canada.\n\nI am, however, referring your letter to Ottawa for their consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos.

Father Angin, had stated that he was not prepared to have this done now as he could not meet this expense at the beginning of the fiscal year. It renders the situation rather difficult for the Acting Principal. Father Angin is absent at the present time, he has gone to his native country, France, and will be here only on the 9th of Sept. It was his wish, when he left, that this question be not definitely settled until his return, and the Acting Principal cannot accept the responsibility after the instructions received from the Principal. Cannot this matter be postponed until his return? It would be preferable since it will entail expenses and responsibilities for him to deal with.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Signature Illegible)\n\nActing Principal.\nRegina, August 12, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am attaching copy of a letter from the Acting Principal, Thunderchild Indian Residential School, together with copy of my reply.\n\nI may say that the Provincial authorities are pressing to have this work done and upon receipt of notice that tenders were being asked for, I advised them that our Department was taking action in this matter.

Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Yours #105-1-5, Sept. 14th, re Wiring Thunderchild Indian Residential School.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Mr. Ostrander that Mr. Halliday has been at the school to arrange for the commencement of this work and was informed by the Reverend Principal that he had no understanding with the Department regarding supplying of board for the man working at the rewiring, or the supplying of a helper by the school as required by Mr. Halliday in his tender to the Department for the work.\n\nMr. Ostrander goes on to say that the Reverend Principal will supply board for the men while at work but that he will not supply a helper and asks for definite instructions in this regard as soon as possible as he does not want any misunderstanding in connection with the payment of wages to the helper which will be needed.\n\nWill you kindly advise in this matter.\n\nI might point out that the Reverend Principal, last spring, with regard to the rewiring of this school, stated that the money might be used for more useful purposes in spite the fact that the Provincial authorities had condemned the wiring as dangerous.\n\nI would also point out that we are not receiving the co-operation from this school we should.\n\nLast spring when I asked Mr. Macdonald to take up with the principal the matter of Manual Training, etc., Mr. Macdonald advised that so long as the present principal is in charge we can hope for very little improvement. Dr. Wall has also spoken to me of the lack of co-operation by this principal and I would recommend that an effort be made to secure his replacement.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThsp.

A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nSome months ago the authorities of the Hydro Electric Commission in Saskatchewan visited the Thunderchild Indian residential school and condemned the electric wiring. As you are aware this school is by no means fireproof and in view of the condition of the wiring as reported by the Hydro Electric Commission the Department considered that it was in the best interests of the pupils and the members of the staff to minimize the danger of fire by rewiring the whole building.\n\nWe obtained a very reasonable quotation on this work from Mr. M.A. Halliday of Battleford, Sask. One of the conditions on which he quoted us such a reasonable figure was that the school would supply the board for his men while he was working and also give him the assistance of one of the school staff without pay. The Department feels that this was a reasonable request and I was, therefore, very much surprised to hear from Inspector Robertson this morning that the Principal, Rev. Father Angin, refuses to allow any member of the staff to help Mr. Halliday unless this staff member is paid wages.\n\nI am at a loss to understand why Father Angin is not prepared to co-operate to the fullest possible extent with the Department in providing a very much needed improvement at the Thunderchild school.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would take up the matter with him at once and you may inform him that unless he is prepared to do so the Department will be obliged to forgo wiring the building. I hope, however, that such\n\nRev. J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\naction will not be necessary as I feel assured that you will immediately communicate with Father Angin with a view to having him assist the Department in this work in the manner indicated above.\n\nI might add that Mr. Halliday is ready to commence work at once and immediate action is, therefore, necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nAttention Mr. R.A. Hoey\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge yours of the 30th instant regarding the proposed electric wiring to be done at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School.\n\nSince receiving your letter I have been in communication with Rev.

The Department cannot understand why he charges a 5% surcharge amounting to $50.00. Further consideration of the account will be withheld until you explain this item.\n\nI am also informed that when Mr. Holliday had completed his contract he took away with him the old electric light fixtures, cable, lights, globes etc. Please let me know why he took such action as there is no mention of his intention to do so in his tender of July 10, 1939.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

I am making no recommendation in the matter, but the facts are as stated in Mr. Holliday's letter, enclosed herewith.\n\nRegarding the complaint of the Principal, that the old fixtures were taken by Mr. Holliday, I have only to say that I have seen the material which was brought in by Mr. Holliday, at the suggestion of the electrician, who informed him that the inspector for the Power Commission would make objection if he found a lot of old wire and other materials on the job, when he came to inspect, and the material was brought in to Battleford and stored. The Principal claims that Mr. Holliday took lights and globes, which Mr. Holliday denies, but has agreed to send him six new ones without charge, to satisfy him. Please advise me as to the disposal of the old material which was brought in by Mr. Holliday.

Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent,\nIndian Agencies,\nFederal Building,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn confirmation of our conversation of recent date regarding the Thunderchild Indian School, Delmas, on January 9th, 1940 we received a notification from the Electric Shop Limited, Lloydminster, notifying this Branch that the electrical installation of the residential school had been rewired. Upon an inspection being made of the premises a report was sent to the Electric Shop, form K No.4226. Copy of same is being attached for your information.\n\nOn August 5th, we received a letter from the Electric Shop Ltd., as follows:\n\n\"Regarding the changes necessary at the Thunderchild Indian School, Delmas, we have communicated with the contractor for whom we subbed this work and are still awaiting word from him or from the Indian Department. We might mention that the biggest item on your form K for this job, the two pump motors, were not included in the specifications of our contract with the Dept. and were not noticed until the rewiring had been completed and we were tearing down the old wire, when, rather than leave the school without water service we made a temporary hook-up and advised the school engineer to that effect before leaving. We can, of course, go to Delmas and cut off these motors but we do not wish to take such arbitrary action without hearing from them.\"\n\nWe advised the Electric Shop not to cut off the motors at the present time, as we were taking the matter up with the Department of Indian Affairs.\nIt would be greatly appreciated if you could assist us in any way regarding the wiring of the two pump motors, as the two motors will have to be wired in conduit, each motor to be on a separate circuit and controlled by enclosed externally operated switches.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Chief Inspector.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 5, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to letter dated August 19 which you received from the Saskatchewan Power Commission.\n\nLast year extensive repairs were made to the wiring of the Thunderchild Indian Residential School but apparently the following additional repairs are necessary:\n\nOld wiring basement: 2\u00bd H.P. motors to be wired in conduit on separate circuit and controlled by externally operated switches.\n\nNew work, basement: No circuit to have more than 12 outlets connected.\n\nToilet upstairs: Remove pullchain drop light and install ceiling receptacle.\n\nEngine room: Bond outside conduit to grounded conduit.\n\nThe work at this school was done last year by Mr. M.A. Holliday, Battleford, Sask. As the above-mentioned repairs will involve considerable expense quotations should be obtained from him and from Milne Electric Co., North Battleford, and B. Prince & Son Ltd., Battleford.

I must say that the set bought in 1941 was bought by the School Management. It was bought to replace a smaller type of batteries which was too small for the School. Why was it bought by the School and not by the Department I do not know. Rev. Father Angin, then Principal, might have thought that, during the war, it would be preferable that he himself, do the buying.\n\nTrusting that this will give you the required information.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) G.L.

Angin.\n\nType W 17, 56 cell, 110 Volt Globalite battery is the set required.\n\nI wish you would advise me when major repairs to building or equipment are required, who is responsible for payment, the school authorities or our branch.

When I visited the school yesterday, Rev. Father Rousell informed me that he had received set of new batteries from the Globelite Co., Winnipeg, Manitoba, costing $590.00 after adjustment, as batteries supplied during 1941 were guaranteed for seven years and only apparently lasted five.\n\nI advised Father Rousell that he had no authority to order these batteries, as I had submitted his requisition to you, and more than likely purchase would be made through the Purchasing Agent. He stated that he was afraid batteries now in use would not last much longer, and he did not wish the school to be without lights. He had invoice made out as follows:\n\nThunderchild Indian Residential School,\nDelmas, Sask.\n\nC.S.Bell\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 13 November 1946.\n\nMr. C.S.

We will then submit the matter to the Purchasing Agent but we are not able at the present time to give definite assurance that the amount will be paid.\n\nBernard F.

U. B. Delmas, Saskatchewan.\n\nWe would be glad to accept an order for shipment \"on arrival\", but must point out that delivery would be very indefinite. Actually, we have not as yet been able to procure a Voss Washing Machine with a DC motor, and it has been a very considerable time since we have been able to procure this type of Bungalow Water Heater. However, if you favour us with your order, we would be glad to give it our very best attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE J. H. ASHDOWN HARDWARE CO. LTD.\n\nQ. H. FALLIS/JB\n\nSALES MANAGER\nReferring to your letter No. 105-1-5 (W.T. 1) dated May 13th, in connection with purchase of washing machine and water heater for the Thunderchild Indian Residential School.\n\nFor your information I am enclosing quotation received today from the J.H. Ashdown Hardware Co., Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, after I had taken the question up with their North Battleford Branch.\n\nI immediately got in touch with the Principal of the Thunderchild School and he considers the washing machine quoted will be too small for school requirements. He requires a machine with at least 25 gallon capacity, and would much prefer to wait until the Besty Company could furnish a No. 6A Electric D.C. washer if same could be delivered about the end of August.

Father Cabana, Principal\n\nSchool: Thunderchild Residential\n\nPost Office (nearest): Delmas\n\nExpress Office (nearest): C.W.R.\n\nProvince: Saskatchewan\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that I have examined this requisition, and that the articles asked for by the teacher are necessary and are such as are in use in the Provincial Schools.\n\nIndian Agent\nThunderchild Residential School, Delmas, Sask.\nOctober 14, 1947.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRegarding the School Main Building not only an enlargement would be necessary. I consider that it would be urgent to replace the old building with a new one and the reason for this is.\n\nThe present building is 47 years old and has already been subject to several modifications and has been enlarged at five different times. It would be practically impossible to make another addition in a convenient and satisfactory manner.\n\nThe present condition of the house does not even give the comfort that reasonably could be expected. i.e. During winter, although the heating system is an excellent one we are badly protected against the cold which introduces itself through the dilapidated walls.\n\nRegarding the size, the measures of the following rooms give a good idea of the existing situation.\n\n| Room          | Dimensions     | Capacity |\n|---------------|----------------|----------|\n| Girls' Dormitory | 49 x 35 x 7 ft. | 47 girls |\n| Sewing Room   | 24 x 16 x 8 \"  | 30 \"     |\n| Play Room     | 36 x 24 x 9 \"  | 60 children |\n| Refectory     | 24 x 24 x 9 \"  | 60 \"     |\n| Class Room    | 26 x 18 x 9 \"  | 30 \"     |\n| Kitchen       | 24 x 18 x 9 \"  |          |\n\nIt is to be noted that there are presently only two class rooms while four are necessary; the Primary and the Junior class are held in the Play Rooms. No Infirmary either, and much less is there one little corner for isolation should there be a case of the kind.\n\nAlthough all the difficulties have not been mentioned the present letter speaks loud enough to convince of the need of a new Thunderchild Residential School able to accommodate the two hundred children who would appreciate the benefit of it.\n\nTruly yours,\n\nJ.B. Balana, O.M. Principal\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Thunderchild Indian Residential School\n1948-1949 ESTIMATES\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan,\n\nI am enclosing a letter addressed to the Department by Reverend Father Cabana, O.M.I., the new Principal of the above school.\n\nThe list of requirements for this institution for the coming year is large but it has apparently been neglected and a large appropriation seems quite in order for the coming ESTIMATES.\n\nIn case the Principal's demand for a new school cannot be granted, I would suggest the construction, during the coming year, of a four-room class building which could form part of the new school set-up. As this building would only be used for class purposes, it need not be fire-proof and, therefore, could more easily be constructed and at less expense than a more elaborate building.\n\nI am of the opinion that the next most needed improvement is in the laundry. This laundry is the most poorly equipped of any that I have seen in any Indian residential schools. There is no steam, no washing machine and wringer. The washing has to be done by hand with the exception of a few small Domestic machines which are completely inadequate for the large quantity of clothes in a residential school which has an enrollment of 120, with a staff in proportion. The coming estimates should provide for a steam boiler, a washing machine, a wringer and possibly a flat ironer. These machines would put the school on a basis parallel to most of the schools of the Department.\n\nI already mentioned to you over the 'phone, the necessity of providing this school with a proper size cooking range and hot water tank.\n\nThe other items asked for are as necessary but particularly the bedsteads and mattresses. As far as kitchen equipment is\nOct. 24/47.\n\nThe Secretary, Cont'd\n\nRe: Thunderchild\n1948-1949 Estimates\n\nconcerned, this is in accord with the suggestions and recommendations made by the dietitians whom you sent to inspect your schools.\n\nThe best solution of this whole school problem at Delmas is naturally the immediate construction of a fire-proof school and I cannot insist too much on this point, because the opinion of the Principal bears out my own personal views. But as stated previously, if this is found impossible for the present year I hope that you will at least provide for the construction of a four-room class building, as such structure could form part of a new school plant.\n\nI, therefore, hope that you will try to give the Thunderchild Institution all the consideration that it deserves when preparing your estimates for 1948-1949.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O. Flourde, O.M.I.\n\nEncl.\nThunderchild Residential School,\nDelmas, Saskatchewan,\nOctober 1, 1947.\n\nTo the Minister\nIndian Department,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nBy the present, I beg to ask a special salary:\n\n1. From September 1st 1947 to June 30, 1948, an amount of $70.00 per month at least for the carpenter and shoemaker, as instructors for the boys' manual training.\n\n2. From October 1st to June 30, a salary of $40.00 per month for the night watchman.\n\nI beg to draw your attention to the fact that these salaries are not sufficient, really, to support a family at the cost things are presently; a raise would be greatly appreciated.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nThunderchild Res.

Mr. J. A. Glen,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAt a meeting of the Board of Trade of Battleford, I was directed to write you with reference to the proposed Indian school to be built to replace the one quite recently burned at Delmas, Saskatchewan.\n\nIf there are any changes in location to be made, we would certainly appreciate your kind consideration of a building site within the townsite of Battleford which would also give you farm land in connection with a proposed school. Facilities as to water and lights could likewise be arranged.\n\nThe Board of Trade feels that an Indian school at this point with Reserves all around would be an ideal location.\n\nYour kind consideration in this matter and a reply would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanking you, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. T. Dewan,\nSecretary.\nOttawa, January 28, 1945.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have now answered your letter of January 21, concerning the replacement of the Thunderchild Indian Residential School, recently burned.\n\nAs you are probably aware, we lost a school by fire at Lee La Range last year. It will be necessary to have a thorough educational survey conducted in northern Saskatchewan before a definite decision can be made as to where the new school should be located.

J.A. Glen, K.C.\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\nOttawa.\n\nSir;\n\nIn view of the recent unfortunate destruction of the Indian Residential School at Delmas, Sask., by fire, and the possibility of the necessity arising for changing the location, I have been instructed by the Council to offer a suitable site in the Townsite of Battleford, a site accessible to both Electric Light and Water supply, with sufficient arable land for grounds and garden.\n\nIn Battleford four main Highways meet, and the Railways are within easy distance of Sweet Grass, Poveshuks & Little Pines, and the Red Pheasant and Stoney Reserves.\n\nPlease do not take this letter as a suggestion for moving the School from Delmas, but simply as drawing your attention to the fact that a suitable site here is available should any change be considered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.C. Adams,\nTown Clerk.\nMissionnaires Oblats de Marie Immacul\u00e9e\nAdministration Provinciale\n9118-110 Ave\nEdmonton - Alberta\n\nJan. the 24th 1948\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nDirector\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa Canada\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey,\n\nYou have already received the sad news of the destruction by fire of the Thunderchild Indian School at Delmas, Saskatchewan. Fortunately the children have been drilled and, although they were all in the dormitory already, every one could leave the building without any one being burnt or hurt in the process.\n\nThe problem of rebuilding is one which I am sure, you will take to heart without any loss of time as we have no building of any kind where we can house those children and provide for their education.\n\nYou know that this school was already too small and that a large number of children were asking for admittance, when we could not provide room for them. The crowded situation of the school will enable you to press for the building of an institution large enough to house from 150 to 175 pupils.\n\nI, therefore, leave this whole matter in your hands, knowing that you will do your very best to provide a new school with the least possible delay.\n\nI wish to thank you for anything that you may be able to do to expedite this building project.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. Boucher o.m.i Provincial\n\nJAN 28 1948\n\nP.M.\nHonorable J.A. Glen,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa Ontario\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nThe sad news must have reached you by now of the burning to ground of the Thunderchild Residential School at Delmas, on Jan. the 13th last. The Oblate Fathers have been in charge of this school from the start, and, as the Superior Provincial of said order, I am writing you today to request that you do everything possible to have this Residential School rebuilt at the earliest convenience.\n\nI was in the vicinity when this total destruction occurred. The Principal and the good Sisters in charge of the upkeep and instruction in this school are not only in favor, but insist that the missionary work performed by them for so many years now, be continued. They are very anxious that a new school be rebuilt, in order that they may continue their missionary work amongst the Indians.\n\nThe Indian Chiefs, speaking in the name of the majority of the Indian population on their reserves, have come to me in order that I may ask the Indian Department for a boarding school. In fact, there is no doubt in anybody's mind around here, that only a Residential School can accommodate and give the necessary education to the widely scattered children of the Indian Reserves of Red Pheasant, Pundmaker, Sweet Grass, Meadow Lake and Waterhen.\n\nI am therefore confident that the Department will decide and start shortly, as everybody expects, the construction of a fire proof residential school, where priest and sisters will continue their important work of education and instruction of this Indian youth.\n\nI am writing you, Honorable Sir, with the hope that you will use your influence, which is strong, to the effect of obtaining a favorable decision in this matter, at the\ncoming session. All of us hope to see a new school built for our Indian children by next Fall.\n\nThanking you very kindly for the interest you will be taking in this important and vital matter for our Indians, I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Signed) A.

Neary\nSupt od Welfare and Training\nIndian Affairs\nOttawa Canada\n\nDear Mr Neary,\n\nNo doubt that you understand my feelings in writing you about the destruction by fire of the Thunderchild Indian Residential School at Delmas. I was in the vicinity when the accident occurred and I could see myself that everything has been done to save the building and to put all the children in safety. We have succeeded with the aid of the agent Mr Bell to place about 25 orphans in the schools of Duck Lake, Onion Lake and Lestock, but we are at loss to find a suitable place to continue our work. So I have already sent letters to the Minister and to Mr Hoey pressing them to take measures without delay so to rebuild that Residential School.\n\nI am sure that you are going to do your best to support our demand. The Indian Chiefs have come to me the next day and they ask for a boarding School. I told them to send their request in due form to Mr Hoey.\n\nThe principal will send you his report of the whole thing. It is a fact that this school was too small. We could not accommodate every children of age to go to school. So we should have room in the new building for 150 or 175 children. I know that the rumour is strong in favor of day schools; but I am sure that the Indians around here are not in favor. They prefer their boarding schools...\n\nI wish to thank you for the interest that you will take in that important and vital matter. All we want is the good of our Indians, and we are absolutely convinced that the Residential School is the only way to give them education and instruction.\n\nYours truly\n\nA. Boucher o.m.i.

Further to the above, on the 11-2-48 A. Dron, of the Fire Commr.'s Office, Saskatoon, called at this office and suggested that the two Indian boys, Alfred Moosomin and Sandy Standinghorn referred to in para. 1 of Cutknife Det. report herein, dated the 21-1-48, should be interrogated in regards to their alleged threats to burn the school. On the 12th and 13th inst. patrol were therefore made to Red Pheasant and Sweetgrass Indian Reserves where the two boys were located and interrogated at length.\n\n2. Alfred Moosomin admitted that he might have said that he was going to burn the school, but stated that so had some of the other boys who attended the school. He could recollect no names, but intimated that this was just idle talk and said just for fun. He stated that after the fire they had been lodged in another school building for the night and that after they had gone to bed Sandy Standinghorn, age 10 years, had told him that he had set the fire, that two older boys, Oliver Longneck and Ernest Bear, had given him a can of gasoline and some papers and forced him, under threats of a beating, to go and set the fire. He had then gone to the basement and set the fire in a cupboard. Alfred Moosomin, who is 14 years old, denied any implication in the setting of the fire.\n\n3. Sandy Standinghorn admitted that he had threatened to burn, also that he had told Alfred Moosomin that he had burned the school, but that he had said this just for fun and that he did not think Alfred had believed him at the time. He went on to mention four other boys who had said that they were going to burn the school; these were Emil Longneck, Fred Moosomin, Robert Ahtyman and Evans Clay, all ranging in ages from 10 to 14 years of age.\n\n4. It will be noted that each youngster interrogated in this connection names some other Indian boy who either has said that he set the fire or was going to set fire to the school. Apparently in the manner of boys that age they had boasted about having set the fire in order to gain attention and recognition from their school mates. All of those mentioned with the exception of Robert Ahtyman and Evans Clay have been interrogated either by the police or Mr. Dron. It is not considered that any useful purpose would be served in pursuing this matter any further at the present. Should any information considered to be of any value be forthcoming in the future, the necessary action will be taken.\n\nCONCLUDED HERE\n\nLARGE, Possum, J. A/Sgt.\n1/0 N.

The attic, although not in use at the present time, can, with very little expense, be made into a dormitory. The building is hot air heated.\n\n2) A frame house 20' x 24', two storeys and basement.\n\n3) Garage 30' x 35', two storeys. This building will require a few windows and the walls must be winterized. This can be done with rough lumber and Ten Test.\n\n4) Two very well built large granaries which may be used as sleeping quarters for some of the staff.\n\n5) The house garage 20' x 20' can be converted into a laundry.\n\nTo enable our Church authorities to carry on these plans, the following articles of furniture, bedding and laundry will be required:\n\n1) 30 Complete beds including mattresses, pillows, blankets, sheets, pillow cases, towels.\n\n2) 30 Desks, with class material.\n\n3) Kitchen stove and utensils with refectory outfit.\n\n4) Laundry equipment, which should include steam boiler, washing machine, dryer and wringer, and one small ironer.\n\n(over)\nOttawa, March 1, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nThunderchild Indian Residential School\n\nYou will recall that the above Residential School was recently destroyed by fire. It is understood that Father Plourde, Superintendent of the Indian Welfare and Training Commission of the Oblate Order, and Reverend Father Boucher, Oblate Provincial for Alberta and Saskatchewan, recently visited the Minister and discussed with him the establishment of a temporary residential school in the buildings now at Dalmas, Saskatchewan. These buildings were not destroyed when the main structure was burned.\n\nWe have now received a letter from the Reverend Father Plourde, reading as follows:\n\n\"It is our intention to continue to operate the above school and we have for this purpose the following buildings, all situated on the school ground or south boundary:\n\n1) A brick house 30' x 30', two storeys and full basement. The attic, although not in use at the present time, can, with very little expense, be made into a dormitory.

This can be done with rough lumber and Ten Test.\n\n4) Two very well built large granaries which may be used as sleeping quarters for some of the staff.\"\n5) The house garage 20' x 20' can be converted into a laundry.\n\n\"To enable our Church authorities to carry on these plans, the following articles of furniture, bedding and laundry will be required:\n\n1) 30 complete beds including mattresses, pillows, blankets, sheets, pillow cases, towels.\n\n2) 30 desks, with class material.\n\n3) Kitchen stove and utensils with refectory outfit.\n\n4) Laundry equipment, which should include steam boiler, washing machine, dryer and wringer, and one small ironer.\n\n5) Furthermore, the principal will need about 10,000' of building lumber and Ten Trestle, and ordinary building material such as nails, paper, etc.\n\n\"It is our purpose to provide at the present for 30 girls, and, if we find it possible later on, we shall add between 20 to 30 boys to the above number of children.\n\n\"I hope that you will be able to issue the necessary authority to proceed with the above plan.\"\n\nWe have been advised by Mr. Indian Agent Jones that we can obtain the beds, mattresses, blankets, pillows, folding tables and folding benches from the Provincial Government at Prince Albert. These supplies are available at War Assets Corporation prices. It is also understood that the other items are in fairly good supply. Therefore, authority is requested from the Minister for the following:\n\n(a) the establishment of a temporary residential school with a pupilage of 30 to replace the former Thunderchild Residential School,\n\n(b) the inclusion of $4,000.00 in the supplementary estimates to purchase the necessary supplies for the operation of this temporary school.\n\nDirector.\nCONTINUED...........itself, with the use of some diesel fuel from the barrel standing nearby. The fire set thus may have smoldered until about 7:20 P.M. before becoming noticeable. Also there is the possibility that these two boys were smoking in the room where the fire started, and when they heard Sister Gerard-de-Liesse coming down the stairs disposed of their cigarettes, in the vicinity of the box of straw, or the cupboard, without putting them completely out. If the fire was set by these boys, this latter possibility seems more logical, as a fire set in this manner might smolder from about 6:40 P.M. to 7:20 P.M. before breaking into flames, whereas if the fire was set deliberately it seems likely it would take much less time to become noticeable. These older boys were apparently permitted to smoke on the school premises, and were likely occupied in this manner when the sister came downstairs.\n\nThe oil smoke noticed by Father Sabana may have been caused by deliberate use of diesel fuel in starting the fire, but also could have come from fuel and oil burning in the vicinity of the barrels after the fire got under way.\n\nEnquiries have been made in an effort to prove the above theories, but there is no evidence to either disprove or substantiate them, nor does any other cause for the fire present itself. The two boys, Alfred McCormick and Andy Standinghouse, mentioned in Cutknife C.R., as having threatened to burn the school, were accounted for by Sister St. Isidore, who was in charge of the boys on the evening of Jan.15th. Also, Father Sabana, who has had two previous schools on fire when principal of same, was present at this residence from 8:30 P.M. until 7:30 P.M., when summoned to the school by a telephone call regarding the fire. His story in this regard is corroborated by Fathers J.A. Navarro & T.Bouchard, who were with him during the evening.\n\nReference para. 7, boys over 15 years of age were, according to Father Sabana, allowed to smoke but only in a shed located on the school grounds some distance from the school building.\n\nIt is requested that Oliver Longmore be interrogated in this connection by Cutknife Det., bearing in mind the strange possibility that he and Ernest Blair were clandestinely smoking in the basement.

In the meantime I notified the Sisters who were in the chapel. ENDS.\n\nSTATEMENT of Sister YVONNE-du-Sacre Coeur.\n\nBEGINS. At about 6:45 P.M. Jan. 13th as I was going down to do my work in the basement I met Ernest BEAR and Oliver LONGNECK at the foot of the stairs. I asked them what they were doing there and Oliver told me he was looking for his mitts. I told them to go upstairs, where they were supposed to be, and went into the pantry to do my work. Jane TOOTOSIS, Leona TOOTOSIS & Mabel MOOSOOMIN were with me. We went up after our work was done at about 7 P.M., and went to wash the floor in the rectory. We were through in about twenty-five minutes, and I sent these girls to the basement to empty their water pails. Later after the fire Leona TOOTOSIS told me that when they had emptied their pails in the basement she had smelt smoke, but had not mentioned anything to me. I did not notice anything wrong when I was down before, although we were working in a different room from where the fire started. ENDS.\n\n4. Mr. A. Castagnier, and other sisters at the school were interviewed in this regard, but could add nothing of value to the above statements. Mr. Castagnier is the janitor of the school, and general handy-man. He stated that he had tended the furnace fire at about 6:30 P.M., and had left everything in order. He advised also that the barrel of diesel fuel had a pump on it, whereas the other barrel of oil was locked.\n\n5. From further enquiries it was learned that the reason the four boys mentioned in paragraph 1. were suspected of being responsible for the fire, was because Ernest BEAR and Oliver LONGNECK were seen in the basement at about 6:40 P.M. by Sister Gerard-due-Rosaire, and could give no satisfactory reason for their presence there. Edwin TOOTOSIS was also suspected because he had not been seen during the time shortly prior to the fire, and could not be found by Sister St. Joseph Edmond. Joseph GLADUE was named as a possible suspect with the other three, because the four of them were always together. Nothing further that would definitely implicate these boys could be learned.\n\n6. Ernest BEAR and Joseph GLADUE were interviewed by Mr. Dron, with the assistance of our Meadow Lake Det., but nothing of value in this regard was learned. Both boys were able to account for their actions, and could give no information of value herein.\n\n7. From the above information it is believed possible that LONGNECK or BEAR could have been responsible for the fire, either intentionally or by accident. BEAR was seen by Sister Gerard-due-Rosaire at the foot of the basement stairs at about 6:40 P.M. accompanied by another boy whom she believes was LONGNECK. These boys could have set the fire at that time; either in the cupboard mentioned, using the straw and packing from the box of window panes, or in the box (P.T.O.)\n3 Cont'd: Sister St Walburg was the one who told Edwin Tootoosis that this was third school that had burned while the principal was in charge.\n\n4. Simon Tootoosis, younger brother of Edwin, was also questioned as to any knowledge he might have, but he was one of the group of small boys who smelled smoke when they were removing their skates and had taken no individual part in the affair. He was alleged to have told the Sister there was smoke and been told there was nothing wrong, to go to bed. He did not tell the Sister of the presence of smoke.\n\n5. Edwin Tootoosis is an intelligent boy, speaks good English and the fact that he is only in grade five after eight years of schooling has no bearing on his intelligence. It appears from his bearing and knowledge that he is one of the leaders of the children.\n\n6.

N.Battleford S/Div.\nCONTINUED.\n\nSTATEMENT of Sister St. Joseph Edmond.\n\nBEGINS: At about 7.05 P.M. of Jan. 13th when I went to the boys recreation room to give the names of the four boys I wanted at 7.30 P.M. for rehearsal I could not find Edwin TOOTOSIS. He was not at the rink where the other boys were skating, and did not come in till about 7.25 P.M. from outside. As soon as they were all in the classroom, boys and girls, I closed the door to begin to tell them about the rehearsal, when Sister St. Salomee ran by and called me, saying that there was fire in the basement. I immediately sent the children back to their respective recreation rooms and ran down to see what was to be done. In getting to the fire I crossed the whole basement. I passed the furnace, but saw everything was in order there. From this door I could see that the fire seemed to be in a cupboard on the north wall in which the men kept their tools. The inside of the cupboard was all in flames, and the flames were beginning to creep along the beams. I ran back to the laundry in the other room and began to fill pails with water, but the smoke prevented me from getting at the fire. The smoke was very dark and thick, and I had to get out into the open air to avoid choking. Just as I reached the top of the stairs I met Father Cabana, who had come from the rectory. I told him it was impossible to get down the stairs I had come up on, and he went down another stair to see the furnace. When I saw the flames in the cupboard there was too much smoke in that part to see everything. I could see that everything seemed alright in the engine-room, and that the motor was stopped. I couldn't see the fuel oil barrels, or the box with window panes, as the smoke was too dense. The other end of the room was clear, and I could see the work bench, and the mens toilet. ENDS.\n\nSTATEMENT of Sister Gerard-du-Rosaire.\n\nBEGINS: At about 6.40 P.M. Jan. 13th I went down to the basement of the school to slice bread as usual for the following day. At the foot of the basement stairs I met two boys, one was Ernest BEAR, but I do not know who the other one was. I asked Ernest what they were doing down there, but he turned away and didn't answer me. I told them to go up, and went on my way. I didn't follow them to see where they went. ENDS.\n\nSTATEMENT of Sister Saint Wilfrid.\n\nBEGINS: At 7 P.M. Jan. 13th I was called by Sister St. Salomee who told me that Ernest BEAR and Oliver LONGNECK were missing from the recreation room, where they were supposed to be. Sister Gerard-du-Rosaire who heard this conversation told me they had been in the basement. She was sent down at once to see if they were still there, but before she left Sister St. Salomee advised her that the boys had returned to the room. At about 7.25 P.M. I went to the junior boys dormitory to put them to bed. Mostly all the boys were ready to go to bed, when Simon TOOTOSIS, who had been lagging behind came up and told me there was smoke downstairs. I paid no attention to him, but a moment later Ernest BEAR came running up to say there was fire in the basement. I gave\n\n(P.T.O.)\nDelmas Residential School - Burning of,\nDelmas, Saskatchewan.\n\n1. At the request of Mr Dron, Investigator, Provincial Fire Commission Office, Edwin Tootoosis (Tr Ind) of Poundmaker Indian Reserve, late resident pupil of Delmas Residential School, was interviewed and the following signed statement was obtained:\n\nCut Knife, Sask Jan 20 '48\n\n\"I am 13 yrs of age. I have been going to Thunderchild Residential School, Delmas for the past eight years. I am in grade five. On the day of the fire (Jan 15th) after dinner, school started at one o'clock and was on till four. I was in school all the time. After school I skated until supper time, six o'clock. After supper I was skating again. I did not go into the basement of the school that day at all. The last time I was in the basement was when we hauled wood for the laundry. I think that was on Saturday, before the fire.\n\nWhile I was skating the night of the fire, William Wright of Moosomin (Cochim) Reserve called me to go to the big classroom to practice for a play. I went right to the classroom. I had my sweater on but no coat. Sister St Joseph Edmond was in charge of the play and was in the classroom all the time. When the fire was reported I ran out and got my coat and cap and lined up outside with the boys. Then the sister sent me for the engineer who lived not far from the school. I went to his house and told him and came back with him. I then went to the ironing room and the children were warming themselves. This is a separate building. I then went with some other boys and helped the men save things from the south part of the school. Some of the children heard Alfred Moosomin (Red Pheasant or Stony Reserve) and Sandy Standinghorn of Sweetgrass Reserve, threaten to burn the school. This was about a month ago (after Alfred Moosomin was brought back when he ran away). This was after the sister had scolded him and he was mad. Sandy was a bad boy and got into lots of trouble. The children threatened to tell on these boys and they got scared.\n\nSgd Edwin Tootoosis\".\n\nMr Dron requested interviewing this boy as he was alleged to have been smoking in the basement shortly before the fire and was alleged to be missing when the fire was in progress. His story covers his time before the fire and after the alarm.\n\nThis boy also stated that the principal permitted the boys to smoke and that this was the third school burned, while he, Father Cabana, was principal. One of the Sisters made the last assertion to Edwin Tootoosis.\"\n16-1-48\n\nWith reference to the above this date Mr. Dron, Provincial Fire Commission Office, contacted this office and advised that the above named residential school, owned by the Dept. of Indian Affairs and operated by the Roman Catholic Church, had burned at about 7:30 P.M. of Jan. 13th, 1948. Further that he had been sent out to determine the cause of this fire, and through investigation was of the opinion that same may have been set intentionally. Mr. Dron stated that his investigation indicated that the following named Indian boys could be suspected; Ernest BEAR, 15 yrs.; Joseph CLAUDE, 14 yrs.; both of Meadow Lake, Sask., and Oliver LONGNECK, 15 yrs.; Edwin TOOTOSIS; 15 yrs., of Poundmaker I.R. He requested assistance in interviewing the last named boys.\n\n17-1-48\n\nThis date the writer patrolled per P.C.8537 to Cutknife, Sask., in company with Mr. Dron, but due to road conditions LONGNECK & TOOTOSIS could not be contacted. TOOTOSIS was later interviewed by Cpl. Blair, Cutknife Det., as indicated in his report in the above regard.\n\n24-1-48\n\nIn view of the above report by Mr. Dron the writer patrolled this date per P.C.8537 to Delmas to investigate this matter. The following statements were obtained in this regard;\n\nSTATEMENT of Father John B. CABANA:\n\nBEGINS: I state I am the principal of Thunderchild Indian Residential School at Delmas, Sask. About 7:30 P.M. of Jan. 13th, 1948 the Sisters at the school phoned me at my residence and reported a fire in the basement of the school. I rushed over to the school, which is about 300 ft. from the residence and went into the basement right away. There was a lot of smoke in the basement and I couldn't get near the fire. The smoke smelled like oil smoke, and the fire at that time was burning in a cupboard on the north wall. This cupboard extended from the floor to the ceiling of the basement, and was used to store tools in. There was one barrel of diesel fuel, and one barrel of lubricating oil standing by the cupboard. Also there was two boxes of window panes, with straw and cut paper packing, standing next to the oil drums. The fire seemed to be coming from the cupboard. I left this room then and checked the furnace by an outside door, and found everything in order there. The light plant, which is in the basement was okay also. By that time Armon BLAIS had arrived from Delmas and we tried to put the fire out. However the fire extinguisher wouldn't work, and the small glass fire bombs we had were not much use.

With reference to the above and to previous C.R.'s in this connection, this date, Oliver Longneck, 15 year old Indian boy of Sweetgrass I.R., and former student at the captionally noted school, now attending the Duck Lake Residential School for Indians was interviewed regarding his knowledge of the circumstances under which this fire occurred and the following statement was obtained:\n\nBEGIN: \"I, Oliver Longneck am 15 years of age. I have only been at this school in Duck Lake for a short time, previous to this I was attending the Indian Residential School in Delmas, Saskatchewan for approximately 8 years. I am now in grade 6. On the day of the fire (Jan.13) I attended the days classes which end at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. At this time I went to the barns to milk the cows which we finished around 5:00 o'clock and then done the regular chores in the barn finishing around 5:45 p.m. From here I went to supper which I finished around 6:30. After supper I went down to the basement with Ernest Bear to find my mitts which I had left in the basement. We looked around in the washing room and then Sister Gerard\u2014de Rosaire came down into the basement and told us to go upstairs. A few minutes later Sister Yvonne\u2014de\u2014Sacre Coeur came down the stairs and I asked her if she had seen my mitts. She told us to go upstairs, which we did. I then went outside with Edwin Tootosis to play hockey where we stayed for about one half an hour. Ernest Bear stayed inside and as far as I know went to the recreation room. At about 7:15 in the evening I went to the recreation room to listen to the radio and about 15 minutes later Sister St. Jerome who was in charge of the recreation room told us that there was a fire in the basement and that we were to file outside.\n\nI have permission from the principal to smoke in the pump house but not inside the school and I was not smoking with Ernest Bear in the basement.\n\n(signed) Oliver Longneck\n\nThis boy emphatically denied having been smoking in the basement of the school on the night of the fire and further stated that there were no signs of any fire during the time that he and Ernest Bear were in the basement.\n\n2. Oliver Longneck is an intelligent boy, speaks very good English and is extremely well mannered. It appears from his bearing and knowledge that he is one of the leaders of the children.\n\n3.

MacKinnon, P.C.,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nMy dear Minister:\n\nFollowing my interview with you in the House yesterday afternoon with reference to the reconstruction of the Indian School at Dalmas, Sask., which was destroyed by fire on the 13th of January last, I find that I have taken this matter up first with the Hon. Glen, as well as with the Rt. Hon. J.J. Gardiner, in February last.\n\nMy initial representations by letter with these ministers have been followed up by numerous interviews with them. As it is now four months that this matter has been considered by the Department, it is felt by the Principal of this school, Father J.B. Casana, that some final decision should be rendered in the matter. In order to expedite matters I must say that the plans for the schools already built at Latoon and Lebrets could be used, and there would then be no delay in the drawing up of architectural plans.\n\nThere is more than 200 Indian youths at the Dalmas School, and should this school now revert to a day school rather than a residential school, it will mean that the progress made will be practically abandoned, owing to the fact that the day school will not be attended by the Indian children due to the nomadic attitude of their parents.\n\nAgain, to further delay the construction of this school means that the training which has been given these children in the past years, will be nullified almost entirely if this good work is not continued.\n\nThe Principal of this school has an experience\nof twenty-four years among Indians, is ready to continue his work if only the Department will authorize him to effectively do so.\n\nOnce again, it is felt that a day school rather than a residential school is an entire waste of money.\n\nMay I not ask your most sympathetic consideration of this case, and may I not hear from you with a final decision in the matter.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n(Signed) J.A.

Hoey,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Delmas Indian Residential School.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nMay I be allowed to bring to your attention once more the case of the above school for immediate consideration.\n\nYou will remember that the sum of $4,000.00 was allowed to provide for temporary arrangements and repairs to existing buildings so as to accommodate about thirty children. On learning of such arrangements, the Indians stated frankly and firmly that they did not want to send their children in a school accommodated in such buildings. As a result, the Principal has done nothing with the materials bought and with the furnishings provided with the $4,000.00 allowed, for this purpose, by your Department.\n\nI am informed that close to two hundred children, of school age, will be without accommodation this fall, unless some other arrangements are made to provide better accommodation.\n\nIf I am not mistaken, your Mr. Ostrander and the principal both agree on the feasibility of using the old school's foundation to rebuild a temporary building which will accommodate about sixty children and which can be put up for the sum of $20,000.00. When the new school is put up, this building would be of use as a recreation centre for both school children and visiting Indians. If you approve of this plan, I would suggest that the principal, in order to expedite the undertaking, be allowed to do the purchasing from approved lists of dealers of all materials needed and also be permitted to engage a master-carpenter and other help, so as to press the construction as rapidly as possible.\nI therefore hope that you will be good enough to give this plan your approval in the shortest time possible and notify Reverend Father Boucher, Provincial, of your decision by an air mail letter or a telegram. The utmost importance should be given to this offer, for unless it is approved, a very large number of Indian children will be without any school facilities of any kind for the coming two years.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nyours very truly,\n\nJ.G. Plourde, o.m.i.\nLEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY\n\nBattleford, Sask.,\nAugust 13, 1948.\n\nHonourable J.A. McKinnon,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. McKinnon:\n\nI was sorry that it was not possible for us to get together last Monday, due to reasons beyond your control. One matter about which I wanted to speak to you was that of the rebuilding of the School for Indians at Delmas, which was destroyed by fire last spring. The Oblate Fathers, who have had charge of this institution, are particularly anxious that it be rebuilt at the earliest possible date. They contend that the work which was done in the school, and which they hope to continue, was of vital importance to the welfare of the Indians. Having lived in this district all my life, and therefore having had an opportunity of observing the result of the work done, I agree with their contention.\n\nI should appreciate it therefore, if you would make every effort to see to it that provision is made for the rebuilding of the school as soon as conveniently possible.\n\nWith kindest regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(SGD) Paul Prince\nOTTAWA, August 17, 1948.\n\nMr. Prince,\nEsq.,\nBattlesford,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nDear Mr. Prince:\n\nIn Mr. MacKinnon's absence from Ottawa I acknowledge receipt of your letter of August 15th, on the subject of the rebuilding of an Indian residential school at Delano, Saskatchewan, which was destroyed by fire in January of this year. My understanding is that arrangements have been made for the operation of a school in a modified manner using certain buildings that were not destroyed at the time the main building was burned. The Department is giving careful consideration to the question of the future education of the Indians affected with a view to deciding whether provision should be made in next year's estimates for the rebuilding of the school during 1949.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nBill Robertson,\nSecretary.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nMINISTER'S OFFICE\n\nAugust 17, 1946.\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER:\n\nI am attaching an exchange of correspondence with Mr. Paul Prince, M.L.A. of Battleford, Saskatchewan, regarding the rebuilding of an Indian residential school at Delmas.\n\nFor A.G.

Glen, concerning a subsidy for the priest's school which was destroyed by fire in January, 1948.\n\nMr. Glen had advised us, on that occasion, that he would see to it personally that a subsidy be granted and, as you will note, all the children of that region, numbering 125, are at present without a school.\n\nUnder the circumstances, I should appreciate it very much if you would be kind enough to verify the said file and let know the reason for this delay.\n\nThanking you in advance, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nMarcel Boivin, M.P.,\nShefford.\n\nTranslation\nSept. 14/48.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nSeptember 14th, 1948.\n\nTO: Deputy Minister\n\nATTENTION: Director of Indian Affairs\n\nI am attaching a copy of translation of a letter which has been received from Mr. Boivin, M.P., by the Minister and which has just been acknowledged.\n\nWould you please let us have a report on the situation in regard to the school and what is proposed.\n\nMr. MacKay:\nFor report, please.\n\nA.C.L. Adams\nPrivate Secretary\n\nEnc.\n\nRec'd -\nSept. 18/48\nC. Harvey\nOttawa, September 21, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI desire to refer to Mr. Adams' memorandum of September 14th enclosing copy of translation of letter received from Mr. M. Boivin, M.P. This letter refers to the Thunderchild Residential School, located near Delmas, Sask.\n\nThe main building was destroyed by fire on January 13-14, 1948. The former Minister, Hon. Mr. Glen granted authority to the Oblate Order to continue operating this school with a much smaller enrolment than at the time of the fire. In this connection I would refer you to Mr. Hoey's memorandum of March 1st, 1948.\n\nLater Mr. Glen arranged for the inclusion in the supplementary estimates, 1947-48, of an amount of $4,000.00 for the purchase of necessary equipment (see Mr. Hoey's memorandum dated March 24th, 1948).\n\nRecently we received a request from Rev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I., General Superintendent of the Oblate Order, for an amount of $80,000.00 to erect a temporary building on the foundation of the former school. We are awaiting Father Plourde's return to Ottawa before submitting this request for your consideration.\nIn the meantime, we have requested our field officials to survey the situation thoroughly with a view to determining if it is absolutely essential to rebuild the Thunderchild Residential School.\n\nNo special provision was made in the current year's appropriation for this purpose.\n\nActing Director.\n\nPP/MGD\nAuthority given for an expenditure of $4000.00 for certain equipment. To utilize some of the remaining buildings for a small group of children.\nMissionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate,\nIndian Welfare and Training Commission,\nOffice of the General Superintendent.\n\nOttawa, August 13, 1948.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Delmas Indian Residential School.\n\nMay I be allowed to bring to your attention once more the case of the above school for immediate consideration.\n\nYou will remember that the sum of $4,000.00 was allowed to provide for temporary arrangements and repairs to existing buildings so as to accommodate about thirty children. On learning of such arrangements, the Indians stated frankly and firmly that they did not want to send their children in a school accommodated in such buildings. As a result, the Principal has done nothing with the materials bought and with the furnishings provided with the $4,000.00 allowed, for this purpose, by your Department.\n\nI am informed that close to two hundred children, of school age, will be without accommodation this fall, unless some other arrangements are made to provide better accommodation.\n\nIf I am not mistaken, your Mr. Ostrander and the principal both agree on the feasibility of using the old school's foundation to rebuild a temporary building which will accommodate about sixty children and which can be put up for the sum of $20,000.00. When the new school is put up, this building\nwould be of use as a recreation centre for both school children and visiting Indians. If you approve of this plan, I would suggest that the principal, in order to expedite the undertaking, be allowed to do the purchasing from approved lists of dealers of all materials needed and also be permitted to engage a master-carpenter and other help, so as to press the construction as rapidly as possible.\n\nI therefore hope that you will be good enough to give this plan your approval in the shortest time possible and notify Reverend Father Boucher, Provincial, of your decision by an air mail letter or a telegram. The utmost importance should be given to this offer, for unless it is approved, a very large number of Indian children will be without any school facilities of any kind for the coming two years.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nwould be of use as a recreation centre for both school children and visiting Indians.

It is true that it would be possible to rebuild a temporary building on the old foundation, but I have some doubt that it would be a wise course to follow, planning a suitable building to comply with the lay-out of the old foundation.\n\nThere has been some mention of an amount of $20,000.00 being sufficient to accommodate 60 children. I am sure that $20,000.00 will not be sufficient to provide all that is necessary in dormitories, kitchen, laundry, and classroom space and equipment for 60 children. We must also bear in mind that fire regulations in Saskatchewan for institutions where sleeping accommodation is provided have become very strict. How far we must go toward meeting provincial requirements is not for me to decide, but I must say that we have been subjected to considerable criticism in connection with some of our residential schools with regard to fire hazards. This fact must be kept in mind in planning even a temporary building for residential purposes.\n\nThere has been a strong move lately on the part of the Indian parents of the Battleford area to have day schools in preference to residential schools. This applies particularly to the Sweetgrass and Poundmaker Reserves, from which the majority of the pupils of the former Thunderchild School were recruited. This fact also must be borne in mind when making a decision as to the replacement of that school.\n\nOf course there are some children in that area whose home conditions suggest that a residential school would serve better. There is also the question of transportation and the distance to travel to and from a day school. With this in mind it is my opinion that those parents who are determined to have the services of day schools should be reminded that they are expected to do everything possible on their part to promote regular attendance at a day school without expecting the Department to assume full responsibility for the transportation. On most reserves it is impossible to locate a day school in such a position that all children of school age can attend without difficulty during the winter. However, I believe that the parents of the children on both Poundmaker and Sweetgrass Reserves would be quite prepared to assume this responsibility if they were given day schools.\n\nWith the erection of the day school at the Meadow Lake Reserve, which has just been authorized to immediately commence, the number of children of school age without accommodation will, I believe, be somewhat less than 200, but...\nless than 200, but certainly much in excess of 60, which it is proposed the temporary building will accommodate.\n\nI am in favour of the erection of a small residential school to replace the former Thunderchild Residential School. I would suggest that it be made to accommodate about 75 pupils who, for some reason cannot regularly attend day schools, but I believe that it would be in the best interests of all concerned to plan on a well constructed residential school next year rather than to at once commence the erection of a temporary building to accommodate 60 pupils, as which would never be very satisfactory. The old foundation and excavation will save us little in the construction of a good school and I believe that the idea should be discarded. To plan the erection of a new building to comply with an old foundation is not considered economically sound, as the small amount saved would not justify the erection of a badly planned building. After giving the matter considerable thought I am doubtful that any money would be saved by using the old foundation.\n\nJ.P.B.

Letters have been received from Mr. M. Boivin, M.P., and Mr. Paul Prince, M.L.A., Battleford, Sask., concerning the rebuilding of this school and on September 21 I submitted a brief summary on this situation to you.\n\nWe have now received a report from Mr. J.F.B. Ostrander, our Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies for Saskatchewan, concerning the proposal made to advance $20,000.00 to the Oblate Order for the reconstruction of this school. For your information I am attaching a copy of this report, wherein you will note that the Indians on the Sweetgrass, Poundmaker and Meadow Lake Reserves have been requesting the establishment of day schools on their reserves. Mr. Ostrander feels that these requests must be taken into consideration when we are deliberating the re-erection of this school.\n\nTherefore, it is my intention to have the Survey Officer of the Education Division visit both the Sweetgrass and Poundmaker Reserves during the next fortnight, with a view to ascertaining the feasibility of operating day schools for the Indian children living there. Authority has already been granted for the erection of a day school on the Meadow Lake Reserve.\n\nActing Director.\nCONFIDENTIAL.\n\nOctober 21, 1948.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n304 Post Office Building,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nThunderchild Indian Residential School.\n\nDear Mr. Ostrander:\n\nUpon my return to Ottawa, I immediately forwarded your report of September 30 on the proposed rebuilding of the Thunderchild Residential School, through the office of our Director, to the Deputy Minister. Please find attached a copy of my covering note.\n\nI have just now received this memorandum back and opposite the last paragraph Dr. Keenleyside has written \"Approved\".\n\nI have also recently had a visit from Reverend Father Boucher, O.M.I., Provincial of the Oblate Order for Alberta and Northern Saskatchewan. He was naturally enquiring as to the progress made with regard to the rebuilding of this school. I advised him that there was little likelihood of anything being done this year towards the erection of a temporary building. It would seem that your suggestion of erecting\n\n(a) a small residential school to accommodate 75 to 100 pupils,\n\n(b) day schools on the Poundmaker, Sweetgrass and Meadow Lake Reserves,\n\nwould be a satisfactory solution.\n\nWe both realize that there are some children on these reserves whose home conditions suggest that a\nresidential school would provide more adequate educational facilities than a day school. There are also homes which will be located at such a distance from a day school as to prevent the children walking. If Major Clark is still with you, I would appreciate your showing him this letter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard N. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nSIMMONS LIMITED\n4700 ST.

What are our plans in connection with this school?\n\nMr. McKay:\nFor report, please.\n\nA.C.L. Adams,\nPrivate Secretary\nOttawa, February 8, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nReport re Replacement of Thunderchild Residential School.\n\nOur officials question the suitability of Delmas, Saskatchewan, as the location for a new residential school with a pupilage of 150, as suggested by the local Missionary.\n\nThe pupilage at the burned school was 120. These children were mainly drawn from the following reserves:\n\nMeadow Lake,\nMoosomin,\nFoundmaker,\nRed Pheasant,\nSweetgrass.\n\nIt is felt that many of these children could be served by day schools. The present building costs of residential schools and the high per capita rate required to maintain children in them are such as to render the education of children in such institutions a very expensive undertaking.\n\nTherefore we feel that residential schools should be built only where there is no possibility of educating the children with day schools and only with a pupilage adjusted to the requirements of the population to be served and of economical operation.\n\nWe are just now finishing the construction of a one-room day school and attached teacher's residence at Meadow Lake. A qualified and experienced male teacher has been hired.\nand this school will open in the near future. This should provide adequate educational facilities for the children of this reserve who can walk to the school. We intend to erect similar buildings this year on the Poundmaker and Red Pheasant Reserves. Arrangements were made some months ago to have the children from the Moosomin Reserve attend a nearby provincial school. The residents of Sweetgrass Reserve have for years been requesting a day school and the site for a school on that reserve has been determined. If our plans are put into effect, there will therefore not be, in the area formerly served by the school at Delmas, enough children to warrant the building of a residential school for 150 pupils.\n\nWe have had some correspondence with our field officials concerning the pupilage of the proposed new residential school. The following extract from a letter from Mr. Ostrander, dated September 30, 1948, is pertinent:\n\n\"There has been a strong move lately on the part of the Indian parents of the Battleford area to have day schools in preference to residential schools. This applies particularly to the Sweetgrass and Poundmaker Reserves, from which the majority of the pupils of the former Thunderchild School were recruited. This fact also must be borne in mind when making a decision as to the replacement of that school.\n\n\"Of course there are some children in that area whose home conditions suggest that a residential school would serve better. There is also the question of transportation and the distance to travel to and from a day school. With this in mind it is my opinion that those parents who are determined to have the services of day schools should be reminded that they are expected to do everything possible on their part to promote regular attendance at a day school without expecting the Department to assume full responsibility for the transportation. On most reserves it is impossible to locate a day school in such a position that all children of school age can...\"\nattend without difficulty during the winter. However, I believe that the parents of the children on both Poundmaker and Sweetgrass Reserves would be quite prepared to assume this responsibility if they were given day schools.\n\n\"With the erection of the day school at the Meadow Lake Reserve, which has just been authorized to immediately commence, the number of children of school age without accommodation will, I believe, be somewhat less than 200, but certainly much in excess of 60, which it is proposed the temporary building will accommodate.\n\n\"I am in favour of the erection of a small residential school to replace the former Thunderchild Residential School. I would suggest that it be made to accommodate about 75 pupils who, for some reason, cannot regularly attend day schools, but I believe that it would be in the best interests of all concerned to plan on a well constructed residential school next year rather than to at once commence the erection of a temporary building to accommodate 60 pupils, and which would never be very satisfactory.\"\n\nI concur in Mr. Ostrander's recommendation that a small residential school, with a pupilage of 75, be erected to replace the Thunderchild Residential School and that the remaining children attend the day schools erected or to be erected on their home reserves. A sum of $200,000.00 is included in our 1949-50 Estimates for the reconstruction of this school and if you concur, I will request that plans be prepared at once for a small residential school with a pupilage of 75. We are writing to Mr. Ostrander with regard to Superintendent Bell's recommendation that this proposed new school be located near Battleford, where electricity would be available, rather than at Delmas, which is quite isolated.\n\nI would prefer to avoid any commitment to a new residential school if at all possible. If it is absolutely necessary to build such a school I would be prepared to agree to your recommendation. Please hold off the rush to decide again before deciding.\n\nDirector.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. School Files. (Act 10, Volume 6337, File 663-5, part A)\nMarch 21st, 1949\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE MINISTER:\n\nProposed Indian Residential School at Delmas, Saskatchewan\n\nA sum of $100,000 is included in the 1949-50 Estimates to commence construction of this school, the estimated cost of which is $200,000.\n\nAlthough the old school, which was destroyed by fire in 1948, had a pupilage of 120, the construction of day schools on reserves in the area from which this pupilage was drawn removes the need of a residential school of such capacity. The new day school for the Meadow Lake Reserve is nearing completion and our 1949-50 programme calls for the construction of similar schools on the Poundmaker and Red Pheasant Reserves. Many of the pupils of the old residential school were recruited from these reserves.\n\nThese circumstances suggest that a residential school with accommodation for 75 pupils would meet our requirements. However, if it is so desired, plans for a school to accommodate 100 pupils will be prepared, with a view to keeping the cost within the amount provided in the Estimates. It would be possible to justify a school of this size but our educational advisers are not prepared to recommend a school for 120 pupils.\n\nThe Church authorities will be able to handle the school, financially, on the basis of 100 pupils.\n\n(sgd) H.L.

Boucher, M.P., spoke to you about the proposal to reconstruct the Indian residential school at Delmas. This matter has been occupying the attention of the Indian Affairs Branch for some time and with your approval, it was decided to construct certain day schools in this general vicinity which would reduce the pressure on the accommodation required in any residential school that might be constructed. It is the opinion of the officers concerned that there will be no necessity for a residential school with accommodation for more than 75 pupils. The effort of the interested church to obtain a larger school is based on their hostility to the programme of substituting day schools for residential schools. This programme, however, has the support of all other educational authorities, is in accordance with the views of Parliamentary Committee, and has been adopted for some time as departmental policy.\n\nWith regard to the particular situation at Delmas, I think that all that it is necessary to say to Mr. Boucher is that all of the children of the vicinity, who will not be taken care of in day schools, will be provided for in the residential school which is to be constructed. Our present estimate of this number is that it will not exceed 75.\n\nH. L. KEENLEYSIDE\n\nH.L.

OSTRANDER\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nWith reference to the matter of the proposed re-establishment of the Thunderchild Indian Residential School at the Battleford Agency, and your letter of the 28th ultimo, File 663-5 (E) on the subject, I am enclosing herewith a rough plan of the arrangement of the buildings on the \"Speers\" farm, near the Town of Battleford. This farm contains 900 acres of land under cultivation and is on the Battle River, approximately 2 miles north-west of the Town of Battleford. There is an excellent well on the farm 4' in diameter and 25' deep, with cast-iron cribbing, fed by a spring. This well has supplied water in the past for 100 head of cattle and all household requirements, and is excellent water. Of course the Battle River, which runs through the farm, could be put to use if it was found that the supply of water in the well was not sufficient. However, I do not think that this would ever be necessary.\n\nThe power line of the Saskatchewan Power Commission supplies electricity.\n\nNumber of acres under cultivation - 900 acres, of which approximately 125 acres can be irrigated.\n\nThe fences are in good repair, and the land is all fenced.\n\nAbout 50% of the fencing is with page wire. The other 50% is with two strand barbed wire.\n\nEnclosed with the rough plan of the distribution of the buildings is an aerial photograph showing most of the farm, the buildings, and the Battle River, also #5 Highway, which is the main highway between Winnipeg and Edmonton.\n\nI believe that the land in question is situated perfectly for the site of an Indian residential school. However, I believe that the suggested price is too high, and perhaps might be reduced somewhat if an official of the Department is given authority to actually commence negotiations. The price quoted is $50.00 per acre for 160 acres of land which can be irrigated, or $8,000.00; $35.00 per acre for 740 acres which can be irrigated, totalling $25,900.00, or a total price of $33,900.00. I sometimes think that negotiations for a purchase of this kind can be carried out better through an independent person who is not known to be negotiating on behalf of the Government, as there seems to be a natural tendency to lay it on a little heavier if the Government is paying. If it reaches that point may I make the suggestion that this course be followed.\n\nThe buildings are not all in a good state of repair, by any means. The barn, root house, garage, and hen house, with some repairs, could be made very useful for an Indian residential school. The other buildings are of little value to us, but all could be temporarily used until funds were available to replace them with more suitable buildings. The barn has been kept in normally good repair.\ngood repair, as the farm has been operated as a dairy, and the barn was regularly inspected as to sanitation, etc. It will be noted that there is a fairly large house, 29' x 42', with a lean-to 12\u00bd' x 42', and a smaller house which would serve as a residence for some other member of the school staff. The blue print which is also enclosed shows the area of the farm, in red, and its proximity to the Town of Battleford. This blue print has been borrowed, and I would ask that it be returned to me when it has served its purpose.\n\nAs regards a definite recommendation, I do not recommend the purchase of the farm at the tentative figure quoted, but I do recommend that negotiations be commenced in the manner indicated to ascertain what would be the lowest price the owner would accept.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nMay 26, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\n\nThunderchild Indian Residential School.\n\nThe attached letter from Mr. Ostrander does not indicate whether you have had an opportunity to read it.\n\nI had a visit yesterday from Father PLOURDE and from Father Boucher, the Oblate Provincial for that part of Saskatchewan in which the former Thunderchild School was situated. They advised that water was now available near the former school site at Dalmas and that, if the cost of the farm near Battleford proved too high, they were willing to have the school re-located at Dalmas.

River -\nLet us say there will be around a mile long of pipe line of 3 inches to install into the ground,\n\nLet us remark that the power line of electricity just cross the river at that point, and that it would be very handy to use for pumping the water.\n\nBut we might be able to strike a good vein of water in digging a well behind the school - if we want to try.\n\nThere is the only serious obstacle to rebuild at Delmas - and very likely we could solve the problem satisfactorily.\n\nAnyhow, the most important reasons to rebuild the Indian Boarding School at Delmas are already stated and it would be worth spending a little for water system and safeguard the spiritual and material welfare of the Institution as a whole.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

MacKay,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. MacKay:\n\nReverend Father A. Boucher, O.M.I., Provincial of the Edmonton Province, under whose jurisdiction the school at Delmas is operated, and myself have had occasion to see Mr. B.F. Neary, Superintendent of Indian Education, re the site of the new Delmas Indian Residential School.\n\nWe both took occasion to mention the question of water and electricity. As far as the latter is concerned you may be pleased to know that the Saskatchewan Provincial Hydro now goes through the village of Delmas. The trunk line is only a few hundred feet from the site of the old School.\n\nYou are aware that the C.N.R. at Delmas supplied the School with water from its own system. Unfortunately, they now have a different water supply 10 to 15 miles distant from Delmas. This change was made necessary because the pipeline had to be renewed and the C.N.R. found it more economical to change the site of its water supply.\n\nHowever this water line from the Delmas Station to the River is now available if you should decide to build the new School on the old site. Of course it is likely that the old pipeline will have to be replaced, but we believe that this can be renewed cheaply enough. Moreover we are given to understand that there is a spring a short distance from the School that might be developed into a supply sufficiently large to take care of the water needs of the new School. We are of the opinion that this should be investigated.\nYou will find attached a rough sketch of the grounds and old water system in use until the school burned down.\n\nOur missionaries believe that the old site should be selected if the water question can be solved satisfactorily. Building the new School close to Battleford does carry some advantages, but we have found in our missionary work that the proximity of a city is not advantageous for a School from the moral point of view. Moreover we are informed that there is quite a large halfbreed group in the suburbs of Battleford which would be detrimental to the proper training of our Indian pupils, particularly our young girls.\n\nThese reasons incline all of us to the opinion that, if it is at all possible, the old site should be kept.\n\nHoping that you will give this question your ordinary thorough attention, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.O.

Present plans are that the new school is to be situated at Battleford.\n\nAs M.L.A. for this constituency, representations have been made to me by the people of Delmas in which they urge that the school be re-built on the former site. They are, as a consequence, anxious to know the reasons why there has been a change in the location. I wish you would advise me of the reasons on which the decision to build the school at Battleford is based, in order that I may pass the information on to them.\n\nI wish to point out to you that in so far as I am concerned, I have made no representations with regard to the building in question as I feel that the decision rests with your Department, after due consultation with the Oblate Fathers, who's responsibility it is to operate this school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(sgd) P.

As you are aware, Hydro has recently been brought into the Delmas district, and we understand that this difficulty has now been removed.\n\nWe have been in constant touch with the Oblate Order concerning the rebuilding of this school, and you can rest assured that when a final decision is reached, it will be erected on the site which we are convinced is to the best interest of the staff and pupils of this proposed residential school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDeputy Minister.\n\nDictated by Col.

It would seem that an engineer should be sent, as soon as possible, to Delmas to make a thorough survey of this water situation. I am arranging, therefore, through the Director of the Lands and Development Services Branch to have a competent engineer visit Delmas and report on availability of water for our purposes. I am sending him a copy of the sketch map attached to your letter.\n\nI understand that all buildings and property at the former school site at Delmas are the property of the Oblate Order. I feel that an important factor in deciding the site of this school will be the cost involved in securing satisfactory land and services. Therefore, it would be to your advantage in presenting your case for a relocation at Delmas to advise the Department as to the amount of money which you would\nrequire to purchase your land and buildings at this place. I will expect to hear from you concerning this subject.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, June 1, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR OF LANDS AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH\n\nProposed Thunderchild Residential School\n\nThis residential school, which burned down last year, was situated at Delmas Saskatchewan. This site was unsatisfactory because it lacked two essential services, namely, electricity and adequate supply of water.\n\nDuring the past year, the first difficulty has been eliminated by the fact that the Saskatchewan Branch Hydro system has extended its line through the village of Delmas.\n\nThe second difficulty, that of the water, still remains, but a proposed solution has recently been presented. Formerly, the school was operated with water from the C.N.R. tank at its station in Delmas. The railway obtained its water from the nearby Battle River and carried it by a water pipe to the tank. This pipe line now has to be renewed, and the C.N.R. has decided to change the site of its water supply to another station ten or fifteen miles distant.\n\nIt is the contention of the Oblate Fathers that the old pipe line can be replaced cheaply and that an adequate supply of water for this school could be obtained. They have also asked that we investigate the possibility of obtaining water from a spring which is a short distance from the school. They have forwarded a rough sketch of the school grounds and the old water system. I have attached this sketch to my memorandum.\nWe have had some considerable correspondence already concerning the relocation of this school. Originally, the proposal was made to have it situated near Battleford, Saskatchewan. However, if a satisfactory water supply can be obtained for a reasonable sum at Delmas, it would seem to be feasible to re-erect the school at Delmas.\n\nIt would be appreciated, therefore, if one of your engineers could be sent to Delmas, Saskatchewan, in the near future to carry out a thorough survey of the local water supply possibility and to report on the estimated cost of providing an adequate system for this proposed residential school of some 120 pupils and 20 staff members.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, June 1, 1949.\n\nPERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL\n\nMr. J.P.B.

They now point out that Hydro is available in the village.\n\nThey also claim that the water supply problem can be solved. Therefore, I have requested the Lands and Development Services Branch to send an engineer to Delmas, as soon as possible, and to prepare a thorough report on the estimated cost of providing an adequate water system. As you are aware, the C.N.R. has abandoned its pipe line from the river.\n\nI have also written to Father Plourde asking for a valuation on their building and property at Delmas.\n\nI feel that when the following facts are in front of me\n\n(a) the estimated cost of a water system at Delmas,\n(b) the value of the church-owned buildings and property at Delmas,\n\nthen we can carefully consider the relative advantages of these two sites.\n\nIf you have anything further to add concerning this problem, I would appreciate receiving your views.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nDirector.\n\nBFN/AM\nJune 3, 1949.\n\nReverend J.

S.\n\n1-3\n\nMr. McKay\nIndian Affairs,\nBooth Bldg.,\nOttawa Ontario\n416 Post Office Building,\nRegina, Sask.\nAugust 6, 1949.\n\nW.W. Perrie, Esq.,\nSupervising Engineer,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nEngineering & Construction Division,\nRm. 416, Post Office Bldg.,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nActing according to your instructions in regard to\nthe Thunderchild Indian Residential School, both Mr. W.J.\nKerr and myself proceeded to Delmas and made a survey and\ninspection of the school site. The following is the\nresult of our investigation:\n\nThe school is situated on the S.E. \u00bc Sec. 6, Tp. 46,\nRge 18, West of the 3rd M., adjoining the Hamlet of Delmas\non the North, approximately 20 miles West of the Town of\nBattleford on the C.N.R., laying between the North Saskatchewan\nRiver 1 mile North and the Battle River six miles South.\n\nThe school was burned to the ground nearly two years\nago, and all that remains at present are the farm buildings\nand rectory. The population of the school was 125 children,\n16 nuns, and 6 of a staff. The school served children\nfrom the following Reservations: Sweetgrass - 16 miles south,\nPoundmaker - 25 miles southwest, Redpheasant - 40 miles\nWest, Moosomin - 25 miles north, Meadow Lake - 125 miles\nnorth, and Thunderchild - 50 miles northwest.\n\nThe school farm comprises 210 acres, out of these 40\nacres are taken up in buildings, playgrounds etc. leaving\n170 acres for cultivation and pasture. Arrangements are\nbeing made to purchase the half section adjoining to the\nwest and north to the river.\n\nDuring the period the school was operated, the farm\naccommodated the following head of stock:\n\n- 15 milk cows\n- 25 beef cattle\n- 50 pigs\n- 4 horses\n\nWater Supply: From 1905 to 1935 water was obtained\nfrom wells supplemented by hauling from the North Saskatchewan\nRiver. This was superseded by obtaining water from the pipe\nline operated by the C.N.R. which passed close by the school\nproperty. This line is of 6 inch diameter, and was connected\nto the school with 1\u00bd\" W.I. pipe.\n\nThe 6\" line was installed in the year 1907 together\nwith 25 H.P. Fairbanks Morse gasoline engine, and pump. The\nwhole layout is now obsolete and will have to be renewed before\nwater can be obtained from the river. The line is badly corroded\nand leaks in several places. The railway has abandoned this\nset-up for a supply about 20 miles west.\nFrom the river to where the school supply line takes off, the difference in elevation is 255 feet and about 7,000 feet in length.\n\nConsidering the obsolete character of this water supply, and age of engine and pump, it is deemed advisable not to purchase as it would cost more to put it in operation than by constructing a new line with electric motor and pump.\n\nA Saskatchewan Power Commission Transmission line which serves the Hamlet of Delmas runs from the river south past the school site. A short lead from this line at the river to the pump house could be installed very reasonably together with transformer and motor and pump.\n\nThe supply from wells in the vicinity of the school is limited to approximately one hundred and twenty five gallons per hour, which is about twenty percent of the amount needed when the laundry is in operation. The school when in operation will consume around ten thousand gallons per day. The well which is located immediately north of the school site was investigated. A cribbing 6' x 5' has been set which is 5' deep and water coming within 1.7' of the surface (3.3' deep); according to our test this well would not produce over 100 gallons per hour. This water was analyzed sometime ago and the result was unfit for human consumption, as the supply was contaminated. This was possibly due to drainage from the Hamlet of Delmas which is located about 1,500 feet distant. We were unable to locate the old analysis and another sample of this water is being tested at the present time. The result of same will be forwarded when completed.\n\nAnother well was tested about 1,000 feet south east of the school on private property. The cribbing in this well is 2'6\" x 2'9\" and the well is 25 feet in depth. It has been in use for 30 years and has always maintained a depth of 2 feet. Our test indicated a rate of flow of 125-150 gallons per hour although local residents claim that from 10-12 barrels an hour have been taken out. Most wells in the community have sandy bottoms, but above mentioned well is located in a gravel bed about two feet in depth. A water sample was taken of this well also, and the result will be forwarded when received from the laboratory. Considering the small amount of water which can be obtained from the above wells, it is recommended that water be taken from the river where an assured supply can be looked for at all times.\n\nThe cost of this line from the river to the school site is as follows:\n\n| Item                                      | Cost     |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Clearing and Grubbing 1 acre               | $250.00  |\n| Excavation & Backfilling 2'x8'x            |          |\n| 7000'                                     | 4,150.00 |\n| Laying pipe 7000' @ .20                    | 1,400.00 |\n| Cost of pipe 7000' @ 1.00 per ft.          | 7,000.00 |\n| Motor & Pump 85% efficiency                | 1,500.00 |\n| (14000 gallons per day)                   |          |\n| Transformer & Installation                | 1,000.00 |\n| Cost of well                              | 1,200.00 |\n| Pump House                                | 800.00   |\n| Contingencies 10%                          | 1,730.00 |\n|                                           | 18,030.00|\n\nThis is based on using 4\" wood stave pipe, treated and wire wrapped; if iron or galvanized pipe is used add $5,600.00 in addition to the above.\nThe river carries a great amount of silt, and it may be necessary to install a silting basin so as to keep the pipe line clear and assure the school clear water. During the inspection it was learned that the Railway had a most difficult time to keep their pipe line clear during the spring and summer seasons.\n\nSewage Disposal: The ground immediately north of the proposed school drops at the rate of 2 feet in the hundred, and conditions for sewage disposal are ideal, as absorption is above medium; would recommend a No. 8 Septic tank, with 1,400 lineal feet of 4\" drains. The outfall would be in the farm land approximately 350 feet north of the school building. The soil is sandy and absorption fairly rapid.\n\nElectric Power: The power lines of the Saskatchewan Power Commission is located on the east side of the north and south road allowance, 400 feet from the school. As a matter of fact some of the remaining buildings are connected at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.J. Clark,\nEngineering and Construction Division.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOTTAWA, September 20, 1949.\n\nRe: Proposed Thunderchild Indian Residential School.\n\nReferring to the request of the Director of Indian Affairs under date of June 1st, 1949, for a report on the Water Supply available for the proposed Thunderchild Residential School, attached in duplicate is a report by Mr. Clark accompanied by one white printed copy of each of two plans showing the proposed site for the school, and a key plan of the surrounding area.\n\nYou will observe that Mr. Clark recommends water for the school be obtained as in the past, from the North Saskatchewan River.\n\nIn a covering letter Mr. Perrie states as follows:\n\n\"You will note that, in the event of a new school being erected upon the property owned at Delmas, power may be easily obtained from the Saskatchewan Power Commission and the matter of sewage disposal presents no difficulties. Water can not be obtained in ample quantities from either of the wells referred to by the Oblate Fathers as a possible source of supply. An ample supply of water can however be obtained from the same source as formerly, namely the North Saskatchewan River.\n\nMr. Clark's estimate of the cost of installing a pumping station at the river and piping water to the school site is, I believe, approximately correct, but as stated in his report some difficulties may be encountered because of silting in the river bed. These difficulties are met with at practically all points along the Saskatchewan River and must be contended with if water is to be obtained from that source. The amount of $1,730.00, which is estimated by Mr. Clark for contingencies, might not prove sufficient to overcome this difficulty and I would recommend that an additional $2,000.00 be estimated for this purpose, thereby increasing his estimate to $21,030.00.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands & Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nThe Director of Indian Affairs, in his memorandum of June 1, 1949, mentions that some consideration has been given to the relocation of this school in the vicinity of Battleford, Sask. This proposal would, if the school were erected in the immediate vicinity of Battleford, make it possible to reduce materially the cost of the school water supply but it is doubtful that any saving might be effected in the cost of electrical power or sewage disposal. The selection of such a site would, however, have certain disadvantages which cannot be ignored. The most important matters to be considered in this regard are:\n\n(1) The necessity of replacing the many buildings that are now in use at the present site.\n\n(2) The fact that the land generally, in the immediate vicinity of Battleford, is not considered as suitable for farming as that in the vicinity of Delmas.\n\nIn view of the above it is recommended that the proposed new school be erected upon the old school site.\n\nIt would appear that no difficulty is likely to arise in regard to the supply of electrical power or to sewage disposal. If, however, any troubles were previously experienced with the sewage disposal at this school, we should like to be informed so that any necessary remedial steps could be taken if it should be decided to proceed with the construction of a new school on the old site.\n\nWith regard to the estimated cost of the proposed water system we believe that the following items should be added to the cost of $19,030.00 as estimated by Mr. Clark:\n\n- Hypochlorinator: $500.00\n- Filtration gallery at intake etc.: $2000.00\n- Additional cost of pipe line to school: $2000.00\n- Concrete tank at school (10,000 gals): $1500.00\n\nTotal: $6000.00\n\nThe estimate for the water system will thus total $25,000.00, and unless it is considered desirable to separate the school from the farm, it is recommended that the school be rebuilt on the old site at Delmas.\n\nR.A. Campbell,\nfor Chief, Engineering and Construction Division.\n\nEncl.\nOttawa, October 18, 1949.\n\nReverend J. O. Plourde, C.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nLaurier Avenue East,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nThunderchild Residential School.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nYou will recall our previous correspondence with regard to the site at Delmas, recommended by you for the rebuilding of the above Residential School.\n\nWe have now received the Engineer's report on this site and it is on the whole favourable. However, the Engineer raises one point upon which you may be able to provide some information. I can best indicate this problem by quoting from his report as follows:\n\n\"It would appear that no difficulty is likely to arise in regard to the supply of electrical power or to sewage disposal. If, however, any troubles were previously experienced with the sewage disposal at this school, we should like to be informed so that any necessary remedial steps could be taken if it should be decided to proceed with the construction of a new school on the old site.\"\n\nIt would be appreciated if you could write to the former Principal of the school and let me know whether any difficulty was experienced with the former sewage disposal system.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR.\n\nThunderchild Residential School.\n\nPlease find hereunder a self-explanatory report from the Director of the Lands and Development Services Branch concerning the site for the rebuilding of the Thunderchild Residential School.\n\nThis report makes it very clear that the site recommended by the engineers is that of the former school at Delmas, Saskatchewan.\n\nTherefore, if you concur, I will write to Mr. Ostrander, sending a copy of this report and advising him of the decision of the Department to re-locate this school at Delmas and to advise him that no further action need be taken with regard to the Speers farm near Battleford, Sask. You will recall that this site was an alternate to the Delmas site.\n\nI presume that no change has taken place with regard to the priority to be given to the re-erection of this school and that a sum will have to be included in our 1950-51 Estimates for its construction.\n\nBERNARD F. NEARY,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nOctober 20, 1949.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor\nof Indian Agencies,\n304 Post Office Building,\nRegina, Sask.,\n\nThunderchild Residential School.\n\nPlease find attached a self-explanatory reply from the Lands and Development Services Branch covering the proposed Thunderchild School site.\n\nThis report makes it very clear that the site recommended by the engineers is that of the former school at Delmas, Saskatchewan. Therefore, no further action need be taken with regard to the Spears Farm near Battleford, Saskatchewan and you can inform those concerned accordingly.\n\nAs you are aware, a commitment has been made with regard to the re-erection of this residential school and it is understood that an amount is to be included in the 1950-51 estimates for its re-erection.\n\nBernard F.

As this school should have a pupilage of one hundred and twenty Indian children, it is felt that the plans now being prepared for the Tealin-Lower Post school would fill our requirements also at Thunderchild.\n\nTherefore, could the necessary drawings and specifications be prepared on this basis with a site plan indicating the re-location of the school at Dalmas, Saskatchewan.\n\nIt is felt that this school should be advertised for construction tenders during February or March 1950.\n\nDirector.\nMr. D.M. MacKay,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Thunderchild Indian Residential School.\n\nDear Mr. MacKay:\n\nAfter receiving yours of the 18th instant, I wrote to Reverend Father J.B. Cabana, Principal of the above school, to find out what were the present conditions as far as electric power is concerned. I also inquired whether any difficulty was experienced with the former sewage disposal system.\n\nI am pleased to report that the Saskatchewan Hydro is now serving the village of Delmas and would be glad to supply all the electric power which the school may need for its proper functioning.\n\nReverend Father Cabana states that there was a little trouble which was due to obstruction in the sewage system. After necessary remedial steps were taken, no difficulty has been experienced.\n\nHoping that the above information will be found satisfactory and that definite plans for the rebuilding of this school will be undertaken immediately, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O.

Conroy, LL.B.\nBarrister, Solicitor, Etc.\n\nNorth Battleford, Sask.\nSept. 26th, 1937.\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt., and to\n\nDept. of Pub. Health,\nRegina,\nSask.\n\nDear Sirs;\n\nThe Nuttunee-Indian-Sick-\n\nEdwin Nuttunee, an educated Indian living at Red Thosant, P.O. Sask., a member of the Red Thosant Band of the Cree Nation wishes that his daughter Ellinor Jean age 16 years, be given immediate hospital care in order to save her from death from consumption. The following are the facts:\n\n1. When she was 9 years old she was relinquished by her said father into the care of the St. Barnabas School at Onion Lake, Sask., and she has remained in the care of said school until last May.\n\n2. Last May the principal of the school brought the child back to parents a month before the school closed, telling them that the child had had a slight hemorrhage. This condition had been apparent for about a year and that the child had been receiving ultra violet ray treatment during the winter.\n\n3. The Father then made arrangements and had the child examined by the Tubercular Clinic the 1st Thursday in June here; the doctors recommended hospital care. Dr. MacQuay and Dr. Dunn both of Battleford, Sask., are familiar with the condition of the child.\n\n4. About Aug. 4/37, I wrote to Dr. Stone in your care, complaining that while hospital care was recommended nothing was being done and asking for hospital care for the child. This letter I showed to Mr. Macdonald, Indian Agent at Battleford, and he said \"that is right, I will write and attach your letter to one I will write.\" I have had no word since and no action.\n\n7.\nThe Father is very anxious about his child. He may lose her if care is not taken. The child was well when she went to the school and contracted the disease there. It is suggested that the child should not be now thrown back on the hands of the parents who have no knowledge nor money to care for her condition. In addition to that, they have other children, one little fellow, who may contract the disease from their sister. They do not know whether or not the sister can infect them, nor what to do nor how to do it. They know that there is care for sick white children and believe the same care should be afforded to Indian children. The little girl also plays around with other children on the reserve and she may be a focal point for infection of many of them. The Father has lost many of his relatives through the same disease, and fears for the welfare of his little girl.\n\nIn connection with this condition of illness amongst the Indians, I noticed in the Saskatoon Star of Aug. 11/37, that the Council of Weldon Municipality passed a resolution protesting against the maintaining of so many tubercular Indians on the James Smith Reserve which was resulting in the infection of the white neighbors. They also asked the Dept. to make a survey of conditions and to take adequate action. From this it would appear that something should be done at once if we are not to have the blood of people on our hands. I hope that you will give this matter your immediate attention and take early action. I am sending a copy of this letter to the Attorney General of the Province and a copy to Mr. Crorer, personally, so as to hasten matters.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nF.B. Conroy\n\n[Signature]\nSept. 20th, 1937.\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont. and to\n\nThunderchild Residential School,\nDelmas, Sask.\n\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.,\n\nDear Sirs;\n\n-Re Philip Armstrong's children-Red Pheasant Reserve-\n\nMr. Armstrong came to see me today and told me that he had taken his children from this School, because they were not making satisfactory progress with their studies, and because they were not being treated kindly.\n\nHe told me their names are James age 10 and Peter age 9. They have each been in the school 4 complete years and so far this year. They had been home on their holidays this Summer and when he took them back yesterday, they did not want to stay but wanted to go home with their Father. This of course was quite natural; But the Father tells me that the Sister Superior slapped both of them across the face with her hand to make them obey her and leave the Father. This indicated to the Father the kind of treatment the Children would receive in his absence, and this coupled with the fact that they are making practically no progress in their work, determined him to take them away and have them educated in a day school close by, and have them live at home.\n\nI saw the children and tried to get them to read from a boys story book which my boy who is 3 and who is just beginning his 3rd year in school could easily read; They could hardly understand what I was saying to them and looked to their Father and Friend to relay the question to them. The older boy did get some of it with great difficulty and the younger one could do but little. I would say that they know about as much as the usual white boy who has attended school 2 years. They asked me only if they did right in leaving. I said if what they told me was true, they were justified. The children will not go back. I am sending a copy hereof to all who appear interested in school conditions at Delmas.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. Conroy.\nOttawa, October 21, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 20th ultimo, in which you refer to the unwillingness of the children of Philip Armstrong to return to the Thunderchild Indian Residential School.\n\nI may state by way of comment that we have sent forward a copy of your communication to Mr. S. L. Macdonald, Indian Agent, Battleford, asking him to make a thorough investigation of the alleged grievances and to report to the Department at his earliest convenience. Just as soon as this report reaches us, we shall be glad to communicate with you again.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nP. R.

R. Conroy, Barrister, North Battleford, Sask. I am anxious that you should fully investigate the alleged grievances to which Mr. Conroy refers and let us have a complete report at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nOctober 25, 1937\n\nDear Mr. Conroy:\n\nI have delayed reply to your letter of September 20 in the expectation that I might have a more favourable reply to give you than seemed possible when the letter arrived. I wish that the Buttenee child were the only one for whom the Department had not been able to provide sanatorium care on account of lack of funds to pay for maintenance in an institution. The problem of Indian Tuberculosis has been, I think, the most difficult with which we have had to deal. It has been found impossible to reconcile the demands of the public for economy in government services with their demands for services of this kind in the individual cases.\n\nAt the end of the first half of the present fiscal year it has been found possible to allot funds for the maintenance in sanatorium for a limited number of tuberculous Indians, and you will be pleased to know that this case in which you are interested is one of those selected for institutional care.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Secretary\n\nF.

On his arrival here, he asked to see the Superior. He was accompanied by a gentleman, Mr. Wuttunee, I believe, and a lady.\n\nHe told me then, that he had written to the Department, asking authorization to take his children away from this school and place them at the day school at Red Pheasant.\n\nWhen I entered the parlor to interview Mr. Armstrong, I was accompanied by two other members of the staff: Sisters Sainte-Theresia and Sainte-Marie de J\u00e9rusalem. The older boy had already gone out of the house being unwilling to remain. I asked Mr. Armstrong if it was his will that the children would stay at school, and he answered in the affirmative until the answer from the Department would arrive, said he, stating that however the children themselves were reluctant.\n\nI then requested one of the older girls who was near by to go out and call Jimmy, without telling him why he was wanted. The boy came promptly at the call and sat by his father with his younger brother by his side. Not knowing if Mr. Armstrong was familiar enough with the English language to understand, I asked the gentleman who was with him to interpret to him that he need not worry about his children as they would be well looked after here. We then spoke to the two children who broke into tears. Turning to Mr. Armstrong, I gave him to understand that if he himself would leave immediately (sometimes the Indians stay in the neighborhood a few days when they take their children back to school, and this makes it all the harder for those more inclined to be homesick) the children would soon be consoled, at the same time I promised candy to the young one, chocolate to the older one.\n\nMr. Armstrong asked me to see that they would not escape and follow him when he left the house. I tried to persuade them to come with me where I keep a candy store; the younger boy only followed Sister Sainte-Theresia to the candy store, the older one remained by his father. It seems to me that this would emphasise that Mr. Armstrong's statement was erroneous when he reported that BOTH children had been slapped across the face. The young one not being there, how can he report on him? As Mr. Armstrong arose to go, the boy bounded after him. We tried to hold him back and he struggled fiercely to free himself. I held him by the wrists, the other Sister, by the arms. The boy was yelling so savagely that I put his own hand before his mouth. This scene lasted for a space of possibly one minute. Mr. Armstrong had made but a few steps towards the door, he was not yet out of the room, but hearing the boy scream in like manner, he took the boy away saying: come to the house, or some such sentence. He called for the other one who had gone with Sister for candy, without saying more, he took both children away. Not another word was said by us neither, and we have never heard from him since.\n\nHis daughter had arrived at school here three weeks previous to this event and, had she been willing to go, he would have taken her away too, for he had told her of his intentions; but seeing she was desirous of remaining here, he seemed to leave the matter for her to decide. Besides, the child stated that her father was greatly displeased with her because she manifested the desire to stay here.\n\nDelmas, Sask.\nOctober 27, 1937.\n\nWITNESSES\n\nS\u0153ur Sainte Adeline, sup\u00e9rieure a.s.v.\nS\u0153ur Marie-de-J\u00e9rusalem a.s.v.\nS\u0153ur Sainte-Theresia a.s.v.\nS\u0153ur Sainte-Lucie a.s.v.\nS\u0153ur C\u00e9line-du-Carmel a.s.v.\nS\u0153ur Marie-Alphonse, a.s.v.\n\nOCT 28 1937\nSASK.\nThunderchild Ind.Res.School,\nDelmas.Sask.\n\nReport of the Principal concerning Philip Armstrong\n\nOn the 19th day of September, which was a Sunday, about half past twelve, I heard that the boys of Philip Armstrong, Indian of Red-Pheasant, were come back to school. In fact, in leaving the school, I saw the two boys, Jimmy and Peter, who seemed to be of good humour. After shaking hands with them, I returned to the priest-house and there I met Philip Armstrong with another Indian. We had a talk on the schools, but Philip passed no special remark on our school; he seemed to be pleased to bring back his two boys to school. Finally, he asked me to give all the family their meal at noon and 2 gallons of gas and one quart of oil for the car. I gave him a note for the Sisters in order that all the family be fed at school gratis and I notified the farmer to give him gas and oil. So, afterwards, they went to school and I did not see them after.\n\nWhat happened at school has been related by Sister Superior. I was not present. I must say however that Philip Armstrong has been well treated at school, and what I heard from him when talking with me could not suppose that he would be so foolish.\n\nIt is only about 6 o'clock in the evening that I knew Philip Armstrong had taken back his boys to home.\n\nRev. Joseph Angin\nPrincipal\nBattleford, Sask.\nOctober 30th 1937\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Department letter from Mr Hoey, with letter attached from F.R.Conroy, re children of Philip Armstrong and the Thunderchild Residential School.\n\nAttached are Statements from the Principal Rev Jos Angin and also the Simter Superior covering the transactions at the School, giving the full account.\n\nPersonally, I would not credit any statement of Philip Armstrong as he is anything but reliable; it will even be noted from the statement of the Sisters, that they had to use an interpreter, while this Indian reads, writes and speaks perfect English, is an Ex-Pupil and served four years overseas, he is lazy and most of the time cannot even properly support his family and I think, that this is a case where the children should be returned to the School by Police if necessary, otherwise there will be more cases of the same kind.\n\nOne boy James has been attending the Red Pheasant day school but the other has not reported, I think that question of keeping them home and getting relief for them has a good deal to do with the reason for non-return to the Residential School.\n\nI might add, that this is just another sample of the interference of F.R.Conroy apparently leader of the C.C.F. in this district and seems to be part of a policy of annoyance to R.C.M.P. Police, City Police and all Government Officials.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian affairs Branch,\nDept Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nExcerpts from report of Inspector Campbell Innes,\non Thunderchild Residential School, February 22, 1937\n\nRemarks relative to the method employed by teachers -\n\nPupil activity is stressed. Each subject is a language development. Handwork is well correlated throughout. Instruction is reflected in work books in nice order. Neatness, accuracy and industry are encouraged.\n\nCondition of classrooms -\n\nRooms are bright, clean, neat and airy. They are very artistically decorated and reflect splendid handwork in Art.\n\nClassroom registers -\n\nThese are neat, accurate and up to date in all details.\n\nGeneral -\n\nThese Cree pupils to begin with are introduced to a speaking knowledge of English. Activity is well developed in connection with their expression in Reading, Arithmetic and Writing. Correct habits are kept foremost. Pupils are anxious to maintain good conduct.\n\nThe boys are developing their Art work in a quiet, enthusiastic manner. The work is exceedingly artistic and imitative. The boys are given instruction in farm operations during certain periods. The pupils are orderly and anxious to do well and appear to respond in a thoughtful manner. The teachers show excellent leadership. Silent study is emphasized and the response is given collectively and individually with equal ease.\nOttawa, November 10, 1937.\n\nRe: Children of Philip Armstrong\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMay I refer to your letter of September 20, 1937, and departmental reply thereto dated October 21, 1937.\n\nI may state that the Department is in receipt of a report from Indian Agent S. L. Macdonald, Battleford, Sask., in which he deals in detail with the complaint referred to by Philip Armstrong when he visited your office a few weeks ago.\n\nIt would appear from this report that Philip Armstrong, accompanied by his two children - Jimmie and Peter - called at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School on Sunday, September 19th, apparently with the object of having his children enrolled at the school for the academic year 1937-38. Mr. Armstrong first interviewed the Principal but did not intimate in his interview that the children were in any sense dissatisfied with the school. The Principal made arrangements to have the father and those accompanying him provided with a meal and also made arrangements whereby Mr. Armstrong was provided with two gallons of gasoline and a gallon of oil from the supply kept at the institution. Mr. Armstrong later interviewed the Sister Superior and told her that he had written to the Department, asking for the necessary authorization to take his children away from the residential school and place them at the day school at Red Pheasant. He stated, however, that he was willing to have his\n\nF. R. Conroy, Esq., LL.B.,\nBarrister,\nNorth Battleford, Sask.\nhave his children enrolled at the Thunderchild School until a decision had been reached by the Department. It would appear that, during the course of this interview, the younger boy left with Sister St. Theresia to obtain candy at the candy store, the older boy remaining with his father. When the time arrived for Mr. Armstrong to leave the school, the boy appeared anxious to leave with him. The Sister Superior, in an attempt to prevent this, held the boy by the wrists and for a moment or two put his own hand over his mouth in an attempt to keep him from yelling so vigorously. When the father heard the noise he returned, took the boy with him and later called for the younger boy at the candy store and, with them, left the school. The father made no comment upon what had taken place and a daughter already enrolled at the school remained in attendance. I was particularly interested to know that the Sister had to use an interpreter in her talk with Armstrong, despite the fact that the Agent informs me this man is an ex-pupil of the school, speaks English fluently and served four years overseas. This fact in itself may partially explain the reluctance or unwillingness of his boys to read successfully from the boys' story book during their visit to your office.\n\nI have made a careful study of the Inspector's reports on the work of this school and find these uniformly satisfactory. I have also made a careful check of the reports in an attempt to discover if any complaints reached the Department with respect to the administration of the Thunderchild school. No complaints from parents, pupils or from the inspectors have reached the Department at any time over a long period of years. I am enclosing herewith, for your information, an excerpt from a report on this school dated February 22, 1937, submitted by Mr. Campbell Innes, Inspector of Public Schools, Province of Saskatchewan.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR.

While we wish to deal fairly with this girl, at the same time I would point out that she had the advantage of several years' training, and is now 18 years of age. If she remains in the school for another year, it will mean that some willing pupil who properly requires institutional care will not be able to receive it.\n\nThe Department has no objection to the girl staying at Thunderchild for a few months longer in order that the principal and yourself may make some arrangements for her, but we are not prepared to approve her remaining as a grant earning pupil for another year. Possibly the school management could be willing to employ her. In any case, grant cannot be allowed for her after the end of December 19, 1938.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division\n\nS. L.

December 11, 1924.\n\nI feel that the Department at Ottawa should supply at least two more sewing machines and also six more cows. It would then be possible to maintain a herd sufficient to supply the milk demand and also a certain amount of meat. Milk diet is acknowledged by all to be the most essential. The lesson has not been as well learned in Canada as it might have been but special instruction in this line is now in vogue. Here is a good place to make a start.\n\nA new stable has recently been built. At present there are six cows but these are not sufficient to provide milk in proper quantities to eighty children and supply the demands for cooking.\n\nAlready 88 children on the roll.\n\nW. M. Veazey, Insp.\nDear Sir,\n\nUpon my asking to be authorized to increase the pupilage in our school from 90 to 120, your answer (Jan. 15 1925--File No. I05-I-I), as well as the answer of Mr. R. Ferrier, was that the question will be taken under consideration when we farm the land we have at Delmas, agricultural training is given to the children and ten cows are supplied at the school.\n\nI feel certain that the Indian Department is as solicitous as I am myself, of enabling as many children as possible to partake in the advantages of instruction and education, and still it seems that its policy is depriving quite a few children of such advantages, and that because we are not, as you may see by our financial report, in a position of complying with your wishes, of fulfilling your conditions on secondary lines. May I hope that the Department will help me? Under Inspector Murrison's suggestion twice I have asked money to be granted to us for the acquisition of six milch cows. Let me note that $2000.00 were voted by the Government in March 1924 in favor of this our school, and so far have not been entirely spent. So you cannot be surprised that I am begging The Department that part of the balance left over from these $2000.00 be applied for the purchase of cows, so that one of the conditions imposed on us for increased pupilage will be met with.\n\nConfident that my demand will receive favorable consideration, and be granted, I am\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n\"Principal.\"\n\n\"The Secretary\"\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, April 6, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, in which you ask the Department to assist in the purchase of milk cows for the Thunderchild Indian Residential School.

The Department is asking Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham for a recommendation and you will be further advised in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J. Portier, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nThundershield Res. School,\nDelmas, Sask.\nOttawa, April 6, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nYou will remember that the Department has promised consideration to an increased pupilage at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School, if the management undertakes agricultural training and supplies a suitable number of milch cows. The Rev. Principal has now asked the Department's assistance in the purchase of stock and, I believe, has referred the matter to Mr. Inspector Murison. Six milch cows should be supplied at once, and I should be pleased if you would let me have a recommendation concerning what help, if any, should be given by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant #105-1-4, with reference to the increased pupilage requested for the Thunderchild Indian Residential School, provided the management undertakes agricultural training and supplies a suitable number of milk cows.\n\nI notice that the Principal is now asking the Department for assistance in the purchase of stock. There is no record in this office that he has referred the matter to Inspector Murison. If he did this by letter a record would be on our files, but he may have explained about this verbally when the Inspector was at the school.\n\nIn connection with this matter I would point out that some time ago when the matter of buying cows for Old Sun's School and for the Crowfoot School was under consideration, you informed me on April 10th, 1924, letter #104-1-14, that the Department would not supply them. In the face of this it is pretty hard for me to recommend that the Thunderchild School should get cows. I am still of the opinion that, as a general rule, the schools should finance this matter themselves, but in cases where this is impossible it might be money well spent for the Department to assist them, as it is very desirable and necessary to have a sufficient supply of milk at our Boarding schools.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\nApril 28, 1925.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott.\n\nThe church authorities have on several occasions requested the Department to increase the pupilage at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School. Favourable consideration was promised if this institution would provide agricultural training. Mr. Commissioner Graham will report when such training is being given.\n\nWhen I learned the actual number of pupils that were at this school, I urged the management to supply more milch cows. As they have been under heavy capital expense lately in connection with an addition, they have approached the Department with a view to getting some help in this connection. I asked Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham for a recommendation concerning the supplying of six milch cows and he has replied in part as follows:\n\n\"Some time ago, when the matter of cows for Old Sun's School and for the Crowfoot School was under consideration, you informed me that the Department would not supply them.

I believe that we should send the authority to Mr. Indian Agent Macdonald, who would cooperate with the principal in the matter of the purchase. I consider that $450 should be allowed for the six animals.\n\nRussell T.

A few years ago, the Department had some correspondence with Rev. Father Guy in this connection. A barn was erected and a few milk cows purchased. Further, Mr. Commissioner Graham was authorized to provide the school with one or two teams of horses and some agricultural implements if farming was undertaken in earnest and a suitable instructor engaged.\n\nI should be grateful if you will make arrangements to commence instruction in farming at this school this spring.

I.,\nPrincipal,\nThunderchild Residential School,\nBelmas, Sask.\nSince I have resumed the duties as Principal of the Thunderchild Residential School, my first attention was given to the correspondence between the Department and Rev. Father Angin.\n\nA communication wanted that preparations and accommodations for beginning farm work should be effectuated without any further delay. Being well aware that farming is an essential part of an Indian boy's education, my views are, in this respect, fully in accordance with yours.\n\nHowever, I find that for the present year, the estimate given by Rev. Father Angin re agricultural implements and work-horses, is somewhat over-rated. A suitable farm is undoubtedly of the most urgent need. As to the implements I would be satisfied with:\n\nI Sulky combination plow.............16 in.\nI Disc harrow..................14 to 16 ft.\nI Seed drill........................20 discs.\nI Teeth harrow....................5 sections.\nI Binder\n6 Brush hooks.\n6 Axes..............................3 lbs.\n\nAs to the rest, I would prefer to have cancelled.\n\nThe Rev. Sisters have 50 acres ready for cultivation. Thirty more acres seem all what we can put under culture this coming spring as only four large boys are capable for the work. Besides, we have in all some 180 acres at our disposal on which we must reserve pasture land for our 16 head of cattle.\n\nTaking this into consideration, it seems evident that we need not have other implements than those stated above, neither the work horses, as we can most conveniently make arrangements with our farm supervisor for the use of his horses.\nShould you approve of such arrangements to begin with, in the course of the present year we would submit to you a more accurate estimate of other implements etc.\n\nMay we trust, that the Department will, as it always did in the past, use of its liberalties, on our behalf, and meet the rental payments to the Oblate Fathers.\n\nHoping that you will take the matter into consideration, and favor our request, I thank you in advance.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nPrincipal.\n\nHonorable Duncan Scott,\nDeputy Supt.-General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHandly know what he means?\nOttawa, March 25, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 20th instant, concerning the need of a barn and certain agricultural machinery at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School.

The Department has been assured that there is now 50 acres ready for cultivation and that an additional 30 acres will be prepared this year. The Rev. Principal has promised to make arrangements for extra horses, without cost to the Department. The Department has promised to erect a barn and an implement shed and to give some help with agricultural machinery. You may proceed with the erection of these buildings. The amounts in the estimates are $5,000 for the barn and $600 for the implement shed. If this is not all required, the Department will be glad to learn that you can effect a saving. When arranging for the new buildings, please be guided by general instructions of the Deputy Superintendent General's 1-1-5 of the 14th instant.\n\nAt a later date, you may make recommendations regarding the agricultural machinery that should be purchased.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

We would wish to put under cultivation this year a larger tract of land but we have none at our disposal. However, a party offers us the loan of a Half-Section, and this would be about what we would require.\n\n2. Last year we cancelled the order for horses as we believed we could easily have the use of those of the farm supervisor, but, after trial, experience has taught us that too much money had already been expended for this, and now, we feel that it would be much more satisfactory if we owned the horses. We would therefore express the wish that these be supplied by the Department. Bartles here in Delmas, have for sale teams that could easily handled by our boys and they have asked to be favored.\n\n3. The yearly rent of $100.00 for loan of land from the Oblate Fathers has been paid, and we trust that the Department will kindly refund same as well as take upon themselves to meet this yearly payment.\n\n4. When Inspector Hamilton inspected our School last fall our urgent need of a hen-house was called to his notice and he promised to use his influence in our behalf. We have, as yet had no result of the decision that may have been taken in this connection.\n\n5. We would also need beside the team of horses, a wagon, bob-sleigh, and set of harnesses.\n\nWith the confidence that the renewal of these requests will be favored with your consideration and approbation,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nMarch 18, 1931.\n\nDear Father Dubois:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to improvements at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School. When the Department increased the pupilage, it was my understanding that you were going to arrange for the extra land and its cultivation, without cost to the Department, with the exception of some help for agricultural implements. At that time, we built the new barn and allowed other minor improvements. I regret, therefore, that the Department cannot meet the cost of the extra land.\n\nAt the present time, funds are extremely limited, and I regret I cannot authorize the erection of a henhouse or the purchase of any farm machinery.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev. D. Dubois, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nThunderchild Residential School,\nDelmas, Sask.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nDelmas, 10th of June 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nA bull was granted by the Department two years ago to the Thunderchild Residential School.\n\nThe time is arrived to change that bull for another one.\n\nWould the Department send to this school a new bull this summer? and what to do of the present one.\n\nYours truly,\n\nV. Le Goff\nPrincipal.\nThunder Child Residential School.\nDelmas.\nSask.\nOttawa, June 16, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, regarding the obtaining of a bull for the farm in connection with the Thunderchild Indian Residential School, to replace the present old bull.\n\nIn reply I have to say that as this new animal is in the nature of a replacement, it is expected the school authorities will provide the cost of obtaining the new bull from per capita allowances or other receipts of the school. We have no funds for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. V. LeGoff, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nThunderchild Indian Res. School,\nDelmas, Sask.\nSir,\n\nThis school has never had for having any mower and rake of its own.\n\nEvery year it was necessary to make expenses for renting mowers and rakes.\n\nWould the Department be kind enough to furnish that outfit to the school, as it would be a heavy burden to the school to buy it itself, especially on account of the expenses already made this year for the renewing of the dormitories floors.\n\nTrusting the Department will hear favourably this request,\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nV.

Le Goff\nPrincipal\nThunderchild Residential School\nDelmas\nSask.\nOttawa, June 22, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, requesting the Department to supply a mower and hay rake for the Thunderchild Indian Residential School. The Appropriation for Indian Education is considerably reduced this year, and I regret that the Department cannot grant your request. As in the past, you will have to make arrangements to rent these implements for the haying season.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. V. LeGoff O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nThunderchild Indian Res. School,\nDolmas, Sask.\nTo R.A. Hoey, Esq.\nSupt of Welfare and Training,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn my last estimate for the year 1938, I asked for a potato-digger and a manure-spreader. I would be pleased to know if you can supply these 2 implements.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Joseph Angin,\nPrincipal.\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 7th instant provision was made in our current year's appropriation for the funds required to purchase a manure spreader for the Thunderchild Indian Residential School.\n\nIn view of the new purchasing regulations it will be necessary to arrange for the purchase of this machine through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nPlease let me have detailed information regarding the manure spreader that you require and, if possible, you should state the name of the manufacturer and the catalogue number in order that we may have the necessary information. Your reply should be forwarded through the office of your local Indian Agent to whom a copy of this letter is being sent.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to supply a potato digger.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. Jos. Angin, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nThunderchild Residential School,\nDelmas, Sask.\nMassey-Harris No. 8 Spreader\n\n(Continued)\n\nEven Distribution Over the Entire Field\n\nIn addition to its labor-saving advantages the mechanical spreader does a more even job of spreading the manure. The Massey-Harris No. 8 can be set to spread 6 - 8 - 12 - 16 or 20 loads to the acre. This gives a wide range and the field is blanketed with a light, medium or heavy layer, as is desired.\n\nThe wide-spread distributor serves two purposes. First, it provides an extra beater to further pulverize the manure and, second, it distributes it in a wide, uniform strip, 7 feet wide, behind the rear wheels. In action the blades whirl rapidly cutting and beating the manure as it leaves the beaters, finally spreading it in a well-pulverized carpet.\n\nPowerful, Effective Drive\n\nA heavy chain and sprocket with large teeth transmits power to the main beater. An improved type positive action lifter disengages the chain from the sprocket when the machine is thrown out of gear. This type of drive is very reliable and is built to give long service.\n\nSteel Apron with Star Ratchet Feed\n\nThe apron is made of angle steel slats and steel link chains\u2014it is strong and durable. The movement of the apron is controlled by a star type ratchet feed which gives a wide range of feeds and which is very positive in operation. Shields protect the drive and ratchet feed also distributor chain from manure and other foreign substances.\n\nConvenient Controls\n\nThe levers on the Massey-Harris No. 8 Spreader are easy to operate and are within handy reach of the operator.\nMassey-Harris No. 1 Pulper\nConcave Cylinder Type\n\nThose who prefer the concave cylinder type of root cutter and pulper will find in the Massey-Harris No. 1 a light running, compact machine that will give every satisfaction. It is strong and substantial and all wood parts are made from thoroughly air-seasoned stock.\n\nThe Massey-Harris No. 1 may be turned by hand or driven by power from either the right or left side as desired. Roller bearings in cages are used in the axle boxes to minimize friction.\n\nOne edge of the knives is sharpened for slicing; the other edge is for pulping. Slotted adjustment is provided for wear. Scrapers are arranged at each side to keep the pulp from lodging in the cylinder. The concave cylinder pulper takes up very little floor space.\nMassey-Harris No. 8 Spreader\n\nRight hand view of the No. 8 Massey-Harris Manure Spreader, showing the protective cover over the drive mechanism.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\n| No. | Loads per Acre | Width of Spread | Width of Tread | Front Wheels Height | Rear Wheels Face Height | Loading Height at Rear Wheel |\n|-----|----------------|----------------|---------------|---------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|\n| 8   | 6, 8, 12, 16, 20 | 7 ft.          | 68\u00bd in.       | 26 in.              | 4\u00bd in.                 | 36 in.                     |\n\nEasy to Load\n\nLoading the Massey-Harris No. 8 Spreader can be done quickly because there is no extra lifting. The top of the box is only 36 in from the ground at the rear wheel. You can readily see what a saving of back-breaking labor this will make.\n\nEasily Handled in Close Quarters\n\nBuilt narrow this spreader will pass through gates only 6 ft. wide and can be driven through average barn doors for loading right in the stable. Where this is possible the time spent in handling the manure is reduced to the minimum.\n\nThe type front axle steering gear gives a very short turning radius. This is appreciated when manoeuvring the spreader in small barn-yards or other close quarters.\n\nEasy on the Horses\n\nLight draft is a feature of the Massey-Harris No. 8 Spreader. Both beaters are mounted on self-aligning bearings, assuring easy and smooth operation. The box is wider at the rear than at the front\u2014the load moves freely and easily to the beaters. Strong, well-braced box construction preventing bulging of the sides is another No. 8 feature that makes lighter work for the horses. The wheels have wide tires and the rear wheels are lugged to give good traction. Alemite lubrication is supplied for all important bearings.\n\nSturdy Front End with Quick Turn\n\nThe No. 8 Spreader can be turned short in close quarters and the oscillating type front axle protects the box from jolts and jars when travelling over rough ground.\n\nShowing Short Turning Radius of the No. 8.\n\n(1) Seat tilted forward for loading.\n(2) Feed Control Lever.\n(3) Front Axle\u2014turning the special equipment.\n(4) Strong Channel Tire Front Wheels.\n(5) Strong Bracing of the oscillating front axle guide.\nMassey-Harris No. 1 Potato Diggers\n\n(Continued)\n\nNo. 1 Power-Take-Off Potato Digger\n7-Ft. 24-In.\n\nHere is Potato Digging Equipment which enables the grower of large acreages to take up his crop quickly and easily. It is a Massey-Harris No. 1\u20147-ft. 24-in. Digger specially adapted for operation with Tractor Power-Take-Off. As may be seen from the illustration the lever is convenient to the tractor operator when it is desired to operate the Digger as a one-man outfit,\u2014and the lever can be reversed so that it is just as easily and conveniently operated from the seat of the Digger where conditions require that two men be used on the job.\n\nThe drive for the Power-Take-Off is strong, yet flexible, insuring uniform and steady power to operate the Digger regardless of traction conditions. This enables the Digger to operate at high efficiency, giving clean, thorough separation in various soils. The draw bar is sturdy and rigid and the yoke has been designed to allow maximum clearance between it and the Digger. This Digger can be had with 1\u00bd in. or 1\u00bc in. spline connection for Power-Take-Off, as ordered.\nTo Philip Phelan, Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter No 105-1-14, of 15th instant, stating the Indian Affairs Branch is prepared to supply a manure-spreader to Thunderchild School and I am very grateful for this favor.\n\nThe implement I want is a Massey-Harris No 6 manure-spreader, furnished complete with a 2-horse hitch, priced $207.50, with a 10% discount, which will be $186.75 F.O.B. Delmas.\n\nI submit sketch of this machine with all specifications.\n\nI choose this Massey-Harris because of its built sturdy.

Joseph ANGIN -\nThunderchild Indian School, Delmas, Sask.\n\n3-8-44\n\n1. With reference to the above the following communication was received from the Rev. Joseph ANGIN, Principal of Thunderchild Indian School, Delmas, Sask.\n\nAugust 1st, 1944.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to let you know that in the period of July 5-15th about 20 hens have disappeared from the chicken coop and from July 19-26th 2 piglets. I suspect Mr. Laval Ayotte, one of my workers who has been engaged at school last April. Could you come to school and make an investigation in order to find the guilty one.\n\nYours truly,\n\nsgd. Rev. Joseph Angin.\nPrincipal.\n\n2. This date the writer patrolled per P.C. 8116 to Delmas where investigation was made into this matter. The Rev. Joseph Angin interviewed stated that he had made two trips to Edmonton during which he was away from the Indian school from July 5-15th, and July 19-26th, and is of the opinion that the above noted hens and piglets were stolen while he was away. The chicken coop and pig pens are located approx. 30 yards west of the main building of the Indian school where the Sisters and students reside. Rev. Angin stated that the chickens are permitted to run free during the day but are kept in the chicken coop at night, the pigs remain in the open pen day and night. When interviewed concerning his suspicion of Laval Ayotte Rev. Angin stated that nothing had ever been stolen from the school before Ayotte was hired last April and further that Ayotte had attempted to buy two of the small pigs from him but upon learning the price of same had stated that he could not afford to buy them. Rev. Angin stated that though there was thirty hens missing he could not be sure how many of these were stolen as dogs in the district had killed quite a number of hens during the past three months. The hens are the Rhode Island Red specie and the pigs are the white Yorkshire breed.\n\n3. Laval Ayotte was interviewed in this regard and volunteered the following statement.\n\n\"I am 42 years of age and have resided with my wife and family in Delmas since April last. I have worked at the...\"\nresides it would seem to be very difficult for anyone to steal and transport the hens and pigs from the grounds without attracting the attention of some of the persons residing at the school. All residents of the school were questioned in this regard however, but no one had noticed any unusual disturbances or any suspicious person around the chicken coop or passing through the grounds at any time.\n\n7. Further enquiries are being made in this regard and contacts throughout the district and Delmas have been asked to keep a sharp lookout for these hens and pigs and to report any information received to this office, it is therefore respectfully requested that Diary Date be set as indicated hereunder when a further report will be submitted.\n\nCARRIED FORWARD: D.D. 15-9-44.\n\nEXPENSES PER F.93 Aug. 1-15th.\n\nConst.\nA.L. Bothamley, Reg.No.1821.\nNorth Battleford Detachment.\n\nO.C. \"F\" Division,\nRCMP, REGINA, Sask.\n\nForwarded 9-8-44:\nI am informed by Cst. Bothamley that the hogs are from four litters born this spring, a few weeks apart. They are of various sizes. When counted early in July there were thirty hogs of all ages, and sizes. There are now only twenty-eight and there is no information as to how the two became lost.\n\nEarly in July Rev. Father Angin counted two hundred hens. He knows that several were killed by dogs as the birds range at large during the daytime.\n\nIt would appear possible that two pigs and all of the missing hens could be accounted for by natural loss and this phase of the investigation is not being overlooked in the further enquiries that are being carried out.\n\n(W.

Joseph ANGIN\nThunderchild Indian School, Delmas, Sask.\n\nAttached is copy of a North Battleford Detachment report dated the 6th ultimo dealing with the theft of chickens from Rev. Joseph ANGIN, Delmas, Sask. In view of the contents thereof it would seem the missing poultry and animals are the property of the school, therefore this report is forwarded for your information and record purposes. The investigation is continuing and further reports may be anticipated.\n\nfor Director, Criminal Investigation.\n\nTo:\nThe Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nEnc.\nTheft of Chickens from Rev. Joseph Angin - Thunderchild Indian School, Delmas, Sask.\n\n7-9-44\n\n1. This date, while in the Delmas district on other duties, further enquiries were made in this regard. Father Angin was again interviewed and he stated that the two pigs that he had believed were stolen have now returned and he is of the opinion now that they never had been stolen but had merely broken out of the pen and strayed away for a few days. Father Angin further stated that possibly more hens had been killed by dogs and coyotes than he had at first considered likely as he has since learned from farmers in the district that during the past summer the coyotes have been very bad and numerous chickens have been lost throughout the district due to this fact and he is therefore of the opinion that none of the chickens he first reported missing were stolen.\n\n2. Farmers in the district interviewed advised that they have lost quite a number of chickens to coyotes during the past summer and are of the opinion that the same probably happened to the chickens which had been reported stolen from the Indian School. As Father Angin now states that the 2 pigs believed to have been stolen have now returned and he is of the opinion that the chickens were killed by coyotes and not stolen, also that no information could be obtained concerning a possible suspect or any information indicating an actual theft, this file is being considered closed at this detachment.\n\nCOMPLAINT UNFOUNDED\nNO EXPENSES\n\nConst.\nA.L.

As previous to its closing this school was conducted under the auspices of your Society, when it was re-opened the teacher's salary was, in accordance with the former usage, forwarded to you and a Cheque No. 5667 for $56.50, was sent you on the 16th April last on this account. I should be glad if you would forward this amount to the teacher, Mr. Andrew Sibbald, Morley, Alta.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nRev. A. Sutherland D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nToronto.\nThis week the Field Agent of Society, N.Y., wrote to said office regarding if the Missionary Society could make a grant toward the salary of the teacher of School No. 2 on the Indian Reserve, which it appears had been re-opened by the authority of the Agent some time ago.\n\nWhen the building for the Boarding School on the Reserve was completed, it was a distinct understanding between us and the Department that the day schools should be closed, and all reasonable effort made to have the children of school age go to the boarding school. I am willing to the opinion that this is by far the best policy. If the boarding school is not large enough to accommodate all the children of school age, then a remedy should be sought by enlarging the building. Long experience leads me to the conclusion that the ordinary day school on the Indian Reserve is comparatively of little benefit, and by far better results can be secured by the Boarding school and Industrial Institute system. In the present case information from various sources leads me to the conclusion that No. 2 was not re-opened for the benefit of the Indian children, very few of whom attend, but rather for the benefit of white children in the neighborhood. It may be, however, that there are\n252894\n\n[Handwritten text not legible]\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Sutherland\n\nThe Honorable Gen. Superintendent General Secretary\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOTTAWA, 8th January, 1904\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant with reference to an application made to your Society for grant towards the salary of the teacher of No.2 school on the Morley reserve, which was re-opened about two years ago.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that as this is the first intimation the Department has received that your Society has been applied to for financial assistance, our local Agent will be asked to explain why such application was made, as the school is not carried on directly under the auspices of your Society.\n\nWith regard to the necessity for this school, I may say that there are over sixty children of school age in the neighborhood who would be unprovided for if the school had not been re-opened, and the enrollment has been as high as forty-seven, while the average attendance is quite sufficient to justify the school being kept on. It is not thought that this school interferes in any way with the boarding school, which has its full complement of pupils and the Department does not object to the attendance of white children so long as there is room for them.\n\nRev. A. Sutherland D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Mission Rooms,\nToronto.\nOTTAWA, 5th January, 1904\n\nSir,\n\nThis Department has been advised by Rev. Dr Sutherland, General Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society, that application had been made to his Society by you for a grant towards the salary of the teacher of the No.2 Morley school. The Department wishes to be furnished with an explanation as to why this was done as the school in question is not conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Missionary Society.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nH.E. Sibbald, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nMorley, Alta.\nSir,\n\nIn reference to your letter No. W6501 dated Jan. 8th, in which you ask for an explanation regarding No. 7 Day school, I beg to say that during my predecessor's time the day school were closed on account of poor attendance. I understood that there was an understanding between the Department and the Missionary Society at the time the schools were closed and the boarding school enlarged, that the children were all to go to the boarding school. The first year that I was here I asked in my estimates for an appropriation for fifty pupils, but only the forty were allowed. I then opened No. 7 Day school with the \u00a3300 grant, and engaged Andrew Sibbald to teach until I could secure someone else. He taught from January 1902 until August 1903.\n\nAt the time of Inspector McClelland's inspection he reported that Mr. Sibbald was too old to give the school the proper attention, and upon his retirement I found I could not get a teacher for the Government grant so I wrote to Dr. Sutherland asking if they would supplement, as in the case of day schools on other reserves.\n\nThe only way that the Boarding school could handle all the pupils is to make it a primary school and a feeder for the Industrial schools, so far the children are putting in their full time here and unless steps are taken to compel the children to be removed to Industrial schools the day schools will have to be opened.\n\nAt the time\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa.\nAt the time of the closing of the schools the Indians were off the reserve a great deal and they could not keep up the attendance, now it is different as the Indians are on the reserve nearly the year round.\n\nEven by the present system at the Boarding school if the Estimates would allow for fifty pupils, the rest could be accommodated at No. 7 Day school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nExd.\n\nOTTAWA, 31st January, 1904\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 6th instant regarding an application made to your Society for a grant towards the salary of the teacher of the Morley day school, I beg to say that the local Agent, who was asked for an explanation as to why he had applied direct to your Society, states that he found it impossible to get a teacher who was qualified to take charge of the school for the amount allowed by the Government, and that as the Indians are now living on the reserve nearly all the year round, there are quite enough children to maintain a day school without in any way interfering with the boarding school, which has its full complement of pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\n\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nRev. A. Sutherland D.D.\nGeneral Secretary\nMethodist Mission Rooms\nToronto.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 21st ultimo, No. 116861, referring to the day school at Morley, I beg to say that the matter does not appear to be very clear or satisfactory. As mentioned in a previous letter, it was the distinct understanding between us and the Department that when the new building for a Boarding School was erected, the day schools on the Reserve would be closed, and this unquestionably involved provision in the Boarding School for all the children of school age. There are Reserves, of course, where the day school is the only provision that can be made; but our experience has been that the ordinary day school gives the minimum of results, and where a Boarding School or Institute, is available, the Indians should be encouraged in every way to send their children. I respectfully suggest that the wiser course at Morley would be to enlarge the Boarding school building so as to accommodate those children that now go to the day school. This would be no financial gain to us, but rather the reverse. As it is now, the Morley Boarding school costs the Missionary Society over $2000 a year in addition to the per capita grant received from the Department; but we feel convinced that such an arrangement would be in the interests of the children on the Reserve. I may say, however, that information from Morley seems to show that in spite of all the commendable efforts of the\nAgent and the Missionary, the evils resulting from strong drink are increasing among the people to the detriment of their morals, and their social and industrial condition.\n\nAll this makes it still more important that the children be withdrawn as far as possible from contaminating surroundings; especially during the formative years of life, and this can be done only through the medium of Boarding schools and Industrial Institutes.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nA. Scott\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, 8th February, 1904\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant in further reference to the Morley day school; and in reply I beg to say that the Department considers that it is justified in maintaining this school, as the boarding school has all the pupils it can accommodate, and it does not see its way to make provision for enlarging the building so as to take in the day school pupils, even if this were thought advisable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, D.D.\nGeneral Secretary\nMethodist Mission Rooms,\nToronto.\nIndian Agent's Office, Morley, Alta.\n13th August, 1907.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to report that on the 5th of July the Indians called their usual annual meeting, to lay their grievances before the Rev. McDougall. I attended the meeting.\n\nThe next question was Day Schools. Again he was in sympathy with them, and promised he would do all in his power to have the day schools re-opened.\n\nThis as you are aware is against our own views. He did say there were places of children for both the Orphanage and Day Schools, but did not even advise them to fill the Orphanage to its fullest capacity, and wait developments as to the future requirements, but expressed to them plainly that the Day Schools should be opened at once.\n\nThe sympathy shown so openly by the Rev. gentleman and the Missionary, Mr. Ings, with the Indians simply means what it has always been, \"discontent\", and thus it will remain until something definite can be told the Indians plainly, and prevent this continual misunderstanding.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd. T.J. Fleetham,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg.\nOFFICE OF INDIAN COMMISSIONER\nWinnipeg, 2nd August, 1907\n\nSir:\n\nI enclose you copy of report referred to in Mr. Agent Fleetham's monthly report for July. I am exceedingly sorry that Rev. Dr. John McDougall, who occasionally does work for the Department in the matter of surrenders, should give advice to the Stony Indians at Morley, apparently at variance with the policy of the Department.\n\nIn regard to re-opening Day Schools on the reserve, a few years ago I had the day school near the Agency re-opened, and the Methodist Authorities objected to it, as it injured the attendance at the McDougall Orphanage. The same cause exists still, as the Orphanage is far from full. The Agent, I know, has done what he could to induce the parents to send their children to the Orphanage, but with indifferent success. If Rev. Mr. Ings, the Methodist Missionary on the reserve, and others of influence, would only help to fill the Orphanage, then when it would not hold all those seeking to attend it, a day school or two might be opened.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. D. Laird,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have a petition from the Indians of the Stony Agency urging the immediate re-opening of the old Day School on their reserve. Most of the Indian parents sign the petition. The population of school age numbers about 60 and the parents are very well disposed. They offer to put the old building in proper shape, and I understand would even try to do something for the salary of the teacher, should the Department refuse its help.\n\nConsidering that the Boarding School is now closed, I would strongly recommend the re-opening of the Day School and that as soon as directions can be given, I should even be obliged for a wire in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 23, 1909.\n\nThe Deputy Supt. General,-\n\nThe Indian Commissioner writes stating that he has received a petition from the Stony Indians, in which they ask for the immediate re-opening of the old day school on the reserve. They offer to put the building in proper shape.\n\nIn view of the fact that they have been without a school since the closing of the McDougall Orphanage, I would suggest that the Commissioner be given authority to have the day school re-opened temporarily.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, January 23, 1909.\n\nThe Hon.

The Department is particularly anxious to make of this a model Indian day school, but this will be an impossibility unless it has the hearty co-operation of yourself, the teacher and the missionary on the reserve, as well as of others interested in the welfare of the Indians. You are, therefore, urged to use your best influence with the Indians to impress upon them the advantages that will accrue to their children from the practical education placed thus within their reach. The Department, for its part, will be prepared, if good and efficient work is done in the school, to deal liberally with the teacher in the matter\n\nJ.

It is sincerely hoped that you will lose no opportunity of furthering the policy of the Department in respect to this school and that succeeding reports will show steady progress in all lines of the work. You will be good enough to communicate with the Missionary on the reserve and advise him of the gist of this letter, with a view to enlisting his sympathy and active support. If all these interested will only carry out the obligations devolving upon them as officers of the Department or workers among the Indians along other lines, there is little doubt that a creditable school can be maintained on this reserve.\n\nKindly acknowledge the receipt of this letter and forward a report on the school. A supply of Agent's report forms is being sent you and hereafter you will be good enough to report monthly as required in the case of day schools.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, April 13, 1908.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nThe Morley day school on the Stony reserve was reopened about February 1st last, and the Department is advised that there is a large attendance of children.\n\nIt is particularly desired to make of this a model Indian day school and the readiness with which the parents have taken advantage of its reopening augurs well for its success, provided the interest of the Indians can be retained. To do this it will be necessary to have the hearty co-operation of the Indian Agent, the Missionary, the teacher and all engaged in the work.\n\nThe Agent, Mr. Fleetham, has been written to and urged to do his best to carry out the wishes of the Department and I would be glad to have you communicate with the resident Missionary and impress upon him the need for his active sympathy and support, as in the past his attitude towards the boarding school was inimical, or at least appeared to be so.\n\nThis school was placed in the temporary charge of Mr. Nidrie and the Department would like to know if it\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nIt is the wish of your Society that his services should be continued. If so, he ought to be advised as to the policy of the Department and directed to carry it out.\n\nYou are at liberty to inform the teacher that, if good and efficient work is done, the Department will be prepared to increase his salary and in due time provide a modern day school building with the necessary equipment.\n\nIf Mr. Nidarie is to be retained, be good enough to advise the Department accordingly and furnish it with a memorandum of the instructions given him.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, April 21, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of a return from the Morley day school, showing the attendance for the time it was open during the March quarter.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased to note the favourable attendance and, in the absence of any agreement as to salary, has decided to pay you at the rate of $13.00 per capita per annum on the average attendance up to forty-two. This will give you a much larger salary than that usually provided for day schools in the Western provinces, viz., $300.00 per annum. The earnings for the March quarter based on the above rate are $126.00, and a cheque for this amount will be sent you.\n\nThe Department trusts that you will be able to maintain the good attendance and that satisfactory work will be accomplished in the class-room.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJohn Niddrie, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nMorley, Alta.\nIndian Industrial School\n\nat Brandon\n\nMEMO.\n\nSupt. of Dept. of Indian Affairs\n\nOffice of\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter re Morley Indian School has been received and forwarded\n\nWith Kind Regards,\n\n[Signature]\n\nB.M. Allwood\nThe Secretary\nDept Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI trust you will pardon the liberty I take in intruding upon your valuable time with this letter, and permit me to state that four weeks ago I was appointed teacher of this school by Hon. Mr. [illegible] and Commissioner, and commenced work.\n\nNow, in all my experience of eleven years' educational work amongst these people, have I seen such marked progress as during the last quarter. Whatever may have been the success or failures of the past, it is not my business to say, but most assuredly the present day school system is working well here, and the children are making rapid strides in their school work. Of course it was understood that this was only a \"temporary opening,\" but I should feel extremely sorry if the school was closed again at the end of the present quarter. Whether the Department thinks fit to employ me again after the 30th of June or not is perfectly immaterial to me, but I hope they will see fit to continue the good work now going on for the sake of these children. My work has been seriously handicapped through lack of school supplies. It is true some of my requisition have been filled, but neither into how far nor when have come to hand yet. My requisition was as modest as possible in the first place, as there was no certainty how long the school would be open.\nand I think in all honesty to the work, and fairness to myself\nand the institution should not be put down. Without being at all\negotistical I might say that I had somewhere about an accurate\nconception of what was needed, being altogether 20 years among\nthe people - 4 years of which were spent teaching the school\nsystem and 7 years in charge of the W. Douglas Exchange,\nhere at U. O. T.\n\nNow at present we urgent need of Daily Reports so that we\nmay make a correct record of attendance.\n\nApologizing for taking this liberty,\n\nI have the honor to subscribe myself,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Woodside\n\nTeacher\nOttawa, April 30, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st inst., and in reply I beg to say that the Department has no intention at present of closing the Morley day school. On the contrary, as you have already been advised, the Department desires to make of this a successful school, and is pleased with the start that has been made.\n\nYour requisitions for school material will receive due attention when received. An order has gone to the Stationery Office for the supplies last asked for by you.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJohn W. Niddrie, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nMorley, Alta.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of 8th inst.\n\nNo. 116861/1\n\nI would state I brought the matter as requested by you before the Missionary Rev. Mr. to Morley School and we both agreed it would be desirable to make a success of it, provided as you say the interests of the Indians can be retained, this is where the difficulty is going to be. This school as you are aware was re-opened at their request the first few weeks whilst the parents were home there was an average of 45 to 50 now it is decreasing owing to some families going North, some to Edmonton, and some South so that the average attendance for the month of April is down to about 25.\n\nAfter seeding is over you are no doubt aware there will be the usual migration of Indians to the different places throughout the country. Exhibitions, Fair, &c.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nSo it is very uncertain to state at present what will be done. Paying will follow and Indians with their families will be 10 to 14 miles from school house\u2014after heavy payment all Indians and their families with few exceptions will certainly leave the reserve for about three months.\n\nIt is a serious problem to solve. I think you can rely upon the missionary and the teacher anxiety the agent to do all that is possible but under the law I'm doing myself could suggest or advise anything being done in the way of providing suitable buildings and equipment until it is fully seen that the Indians do take more interest in the education of their children.\n\nIt would perhaps be well to let the school run as it is at present for the next few months say to September when the Department would see whether it was desirable to go to any large outlay or not. In the meantime we can only try and induce Indians to carry out your wishes.\nI don't know whether the Department are aware the school which is now there is on the north side of the Bow river and attended only by children of the Wesley Band.\n\nBearspaws and Chiriquay Bands are on the south side of the Bow river. These Indians did not ask for their old school to be reopened, but I presume if new schools are built, they will have to be considered as well as Wesley Band.\n\nTheir children of school age will probably be about the same number, and entitled to the same privileges.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. J. Fleetham\n\nIndian Agent\nNo. 3\n\nOttawa, May 7, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ult. in reference to the day school which has been reopened on the Stony reserve, and in reply I beg to say that, in order to overcome the difficulty in maintaining a regular attendance at this school owing to the migratory habits of the Indians at certain seasons, the Department is considering the advisability of providing a building which would furnish a temporary residence for the children whose parents are absent from the reserve at different seasons of the year, where they could be kept.\n\nThe Department would like to have your views on the feasibility of carrying out this suggestion. You should state about how many children it would be necessary to provide for and for what length of time. This arrangement would only be applicable to the school at present in operation.\n\nA day school might be established for the Indians on the south side of the Bow river, and it is taken for granted that a similar arrangement would have to be made there.\n\nT.J. Fletcham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorley, Alta.\nthere. You should also report as to the needs of these Indians, stating whether there is a building available for day school purposes and what provision would have to be made for them when their parents are absent from the reserve.\n\nThe Department is of opinion that, if the Indians were willing to adopt this suggestion, the regular boarding school could be advantageously dispensed with.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nsecretary.\nNo. 3\n\nOttawa, May 7, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ult., in reference to the day school which has been reopened on the Stony reserve, and in reply I beg to say that, in order to overcome the difficulty in maintaining a regular attendance at this school owing to the migratory habits of the Indians at certain seasons, the Department is considering the advisability of providing a building which would furnish a temporary residence for the children whose parents are absent from the reserve at different seasons of the year, where they could be kept.\n\nThe Department would like to have your views on the feasibility of carrying out this suggestion.

Floetham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMorley, Alta.\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter No. 16861 of April 25th, I have read, and now take the liberty of answering the same, and of calling your attention to certain statements contained therein.\n\nI cannot understand your statement which reads thus: \"In the absence of any agreement as to salary,\" surely there is no question of taking your word. When the Indians sent me to take the school, I was called at the Indian Office at Morley and made an application for the position of teacher to the Indian Commissioner at Winnepeg through your Agent here. One of the first questions he asked me was \"What salary do you want?\" The reply was $30 per month, which by the way taking everything into consideration was thought a very reasonable salary. Shortly after this I received a letter from your Agent at Morley informing me that the right would pay the teachers' salary and furnish school supplies. I also received one from the Indian Commissioner appointing me teacher and instructing me to take charge at once. Now sir do you not think that it would have been quite right and proper able to have informed me at that time that the $30 per month would not be paid, and not at this late date when I have been doing the work for 9 months? This seems to me quite unfair.\n\nThen again you inform me that the Department have decided to pay\nme at the rate of $2.00 per capita per annum on the average attendance up to 100 pupils. What may I say will follow me for doing so? If we do allow the Indians leave the Reserve, & cannot compel them to remain here, and if they are not at home the children will not be here to attend School.\n\nThen again your statement\u2014 \"This will give you a much larger salary than that usually provided by any schools in the Western provinces.\" I must again ask how to balance the fact that you are not aware of the fact that while this may be the amount paid by the Dept., in many cases it is not. In all these cases the different churches identified with the work contribute so much more. Some years ago right here at Morley our Indian Day School teacher was drawing $750.00 per annum and his quarterly average was not much over $60.00. In such districts matters the church gets forced to contribute nothing towards the support of their school, but that does not in the least alter the fact that it is an utter impossibility to secure the services of an efficient, hard working teacher in the North West for less than $600.00 per year, and even then there are few teachers who can be taken up the Indian Work, and all who would do so could not make a success of it.\n\nEleven of the pupils shown up on the Quarterly Return are ex-pupils of Morley Boarding School, where they eat the food $2.00 per head or annum or a total of $793.00 which was less than 50% per mo. Each for this eleven one $. So far as I can judge, and I do not speak unadvisedly, I am sure that the training they receive there fits them for life on the Reserve, and better than that they can\nI trust I may be pardoned for making this request but having had charge of the Worley Boarding School for seven years and now to that having taught this school for 14 years surely my opinion ought to be worth something. I am not asking so much to teach you twice that number.\n\nIn conclusion if the Indian Department are willing to pay me a salary of $600 per year, and patronise as their other teachers here at Worley receive. I am quite satisfied that I can keep the school full, and make a success of the classes, board work, teaching and writing also just as long as the Indians are on the Reserve, and as the Dept. Road to other half schools would have as large an average.\n\nIf this amount in salary will not be granted immediately ask the Indian Dept. to let me know at once.\n\nShave Sir the honour to subscribe myself\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nJohnson\nI trust I may be pardoned for making this request, but having had charge of the Morley Boarding School for seven years and given up that having taught two schools for 14 years surely my opinion ought to be worth something.

Niddrie, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nMorley, Alta.\nReferring to your letter of 18 May 1907\n\nNo. 116861 re Day School on the Story Reserve I would state,\n\nwith reference to the Department furnishing a temporary residence for children whose parents are absent from the Reserve, I must state candidly it would not be taken advantage of.\n\nIndians when they go off the Reserve alone take their families with them. To move this some of her boys Band including Anna Day's son a councillor who was the chief mover to have the Day School opened was the first to go to Kamawak's house and take his family taking along other as well thus decreasing the School average of attendance.\n\nThe Indians could have left their children at school age with some of their friends but would not do so.\n\nA Day School could no doubt be carried on with a fair attendance on both sides of the river for six months from 1 January to 30 June, but for the other six months the attendance would be almost nil.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nand that was my reason for stating in\nmy letter of 29 April last asking the\nDepartment to wait and see whether Indians\nwould take any interest in the education of\ntheir children by the 30th September or the\nquarter ending that date will show the\nactual state of affairs - for the quarter\nending 31st December the attendance will be\nnothing.\n\nAs far as the present school\nis concerned I heard that Mr. Macdonald\nthe teacher is likely to leave at the end\nof the June quarter. If this should prove\ncorrect you may consider the school\nclosed. When the children are on the\nreserve he can get them to school, but\nif he should leave I am afraid they will\nnot take to another teacher so easily.\n\nThe school house at present\nopened has been expanded a little, but\nstill requires more, the school on\nthe south side requires new door, windows\nand general repairs to the amount of\nperhaps $75.00.\n\nAt neither of these schools\nis there any accommodation for teachers\nto live in, a house near.\n\nIf you will allow me\nto express myself, I would certainly\nlike\nlike to see something done that would settle\nthe question of education, and my humble\nopinion is that eventually it will be\nfound owing to the migratory habits of\nthe Story Indians the Boarding school\nto be the best solution of the difficulty\nprovided of course the Church appoint\nthe very best man possible to act as\nPrincipal and Missionary (combining\nthe two positions) and having a first class\nCertificated Teacher (male) who could\nbe Assistant Principal.\n\nBy doing this it would\navoid all trouble and clashing between\ntwo members of the same Church as it\nhas hitherto been, and in time I firmly\nbelieve it would solve the School\nquestion on the Story reserve, it\nwould no doubt take some little\ntime but if the right man was\nfound for the position, it would\neasily come.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In your No. 1681 of May 23rd you state that the Department were considering my proposition, and \"that I would be definitely informed of their decision at an early date.\"\n\nNow Sir, as the present quarter is nearly gone, I am anxious to have your disposition in the matter of your earliest possible convenience. I may say that in my letter of May 23rd Salgo stated the terms upon which he was engaged by the Indian Commissioner through your Agent at Morley McAllister, to take up the work here. In the past history of this School, it was always considered advisable to teach right through the summer months, and have holidays in the fall, so the Indians all pitch off on a fall hunt, and take their children with them after beat of payment.\n\nAwaiting your reply\u2014\n\nShall be the honor to subscribe myself\n\nYour obedient servant\u2014John W. Macdonald\nTeacher\nthe accommodation of Indian children. We asked Mr. Smith to send the Indians out this matter. He did so, and found them to be very opposed to it. Children cannot ride or drive a distance of 7 to 9 miles to school every day, and in any case the people claim that they will not allow their children to go, but will pledge themselves to support this school because it is centrally located, and within easy reach of all. Then again this schoolroom is in very good condition. The building is $250 in a stone foundation, and roofed. Concrete outside would make it good for 50 years. The inside is lined, sealed, and painted\u2014all this I did before they came here, the Department supplying the local material, but did not allow me one cent for the work.\n\nNow Sir\u2014If Mr. Smith is in charge here it is with the distinct understanding that I am responsible only to the Department and your Agent at Morley, and that outsiders do not meddle with me, and my work. In all my years in the Indian work I have tried to carry out the best instructions to the letter, and if the Indian Agent counteracts me with me will build up this.\n\nWill you be kind enough to instruct the Agent at Morley to value the patronage asked for?\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJohnson Eddie Teacher\nSir:\n\nReferring to your No. 16861-1 of June 25th, I beg to state that I am very much dissatisfied with its contents. I cannot understand why the Indian Office should have sent through the Indian Agent at Morley anyone else but yourself as teacher last January at a salary of $600.00 and you should cut me down to $500.00. This seems to me quite unfair.\n\nI have been in the Indian Service for twelve years.\n\nI have talked with Mr. Joseph Houstall who recently visited this school, and also your Agent, Mr. Alexander Morley. They have advised me to stand out at the school until conditions that double pay decrees are issued to me, and until matters in regard to this school are more fully understood at Ottawa.\n\nThey reason for acting in double pay decrees is that a number of the Indians going away to Squawasset do not leave their children with me to attend school. And it is quite impossible for me to carry on this work any longer unless you are willing to concede this much\u2014\n\nOnce again,\n\n[Signature]\n\nNote: I have been talking lately about turning the Morley Hospital into a School-room.\nD C Scott,\nSupt Indian Schools,\nOttawa.\n\nNeddrie refuses position teacher Hospital School we held conference with Indians they object to Central School at Agency want Separate School building north and south.

We do not think present School fulfilling its mission and would advise closing it and opening Hospital School for whole reserve. Some objection raised to present building but satisfied only subterfuge writing fully suggestions.\n\nJ D Lafferty,\n\nP S Brice, T J Fleethat.\nCalgary, Alta.\nJuly 23rd, 1909\n\nD.G. Scott, Esq.\nSupt. Indian Schools.\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr Scott:\n\nAs my telegram will have advised you, we had a meeting with the Chief and Councillors re the location of a central school in the Hospital building. I inferred from those who spoke that the Indians wanted the present school continued on the north side, and the old school building opened up as a school on the south side; and were opposed to a central school, and further were opposed to this central school being in the Hospital building.\n\nThe man who was interpreter was also the most pronounced against the Hospital being used as a school. One of the chiefs was quite willing to fall into any arrangement adopted by the Government.\n\nThe sum total of the discussion as reflected by the few who spoke, was in favor of a school on each side in the old school buildings, and further was against a central school; and inferentially their objection to a central school was on account of the Hospital building being used for it.\n\nI spoke very strongly against the use of the old buildings for school purposes, and with a view of getting right down to the essence of their objections, I asked them: \"Will you all be willing to send your children to a central school if the Dept. erect a new school building near the Hospital?\" And for a moment I thought this would be satisfactory; when all at once the whole crowd arose and protested and admitted that their objection was not against the Hospital building being used as a school because it had been used as a Hospital, but they wanted the old slip-shod \"go-as-you-pleases\" school as in the old days. However the one outspoken expression by everyone and repeated again and again was that they wanted their children educated.\nI would not advise either the continuance of the present school as it is, or the opening of the old school on the south side as I consider it a waste of time and money for the small result attainable; and from the fact that I learned after the meeting was over that there were several men of considerable influence present who did not like to go against the crowd yet who were in favor of a good clean school in the Hospital. And further from the very strong sentiment evinced in favor of education I would recommend that the Dept. close the school on the north side and open the central school in the Hospital building, and I believe the result will justify such action.\n\nMr. Niddrie in response to a proposal to take the position as teacher in the Hospital school, sent me a communication before the meeting refusing unconditionally to do so, stating that he believed the Indians were opposed to the use of the Hospital as a school, and that they would not attend; and that he did not feel justified in running counter to what he believed to be the wishes of the Indians, and further that he had a letter from the Dept. (which he produced, dated June 26th.) offering him $500. to continue as teacher where he was for the coming year.\n\nHe attended the conference and I think was somewhat nonplussed when the Indians made it plain that their opposition was against a central school anywhere and not because it was the Hospital building.\n\nFrom my knowledge of the influence Niddrie has with the Indians there is no manner of doubt, that if you continue to keep open his present school, you will not get a child from the north side. But if that school is closed and we could get Niddrie to accept the position at the Hospital school, and I am in hopes that under these circumstances he will; then I think it would be a success.\n\nI think his first reason for refusal was your letter of engagement for another year, and he thought he was safe anyway, and secondly his preference for remaining out of the limelight of civilization living as he does now like an Indian in a little hovel beside the school, cooking for himself.\nNo teacher living as he does can have a proper or elevating influence on the Indians. If he accepted the new position convention would compel him to conform to his surroundings; and there is no one who would insure the success of the new venture as Niddrie would.\n\nIf he still refuses and you close the present school I do not despair of its being a success even in other hands, and I would still advise the same course, and some other suitable person employed, possibly a married man whose wife could cook he doing the chores as well. The nurse in either case remaining on for her own special work.\n\nI did not make any mention of collecting the children and driving them to school. As there was no objection raised to the proposition of a central school on account of distance, I thought it best to reserve this to be put in practice later on if it was found essential to secure attendance.\n\nIf Niddrie accepts the new position I think he ought to undertake much of the work now done by the Hospital assistant Christianson (and by this means his services dispensed with) such as milking, attending to stable, hens garden etc. As he would have so much spare time outside of school hours and you will have to pay him a good salary anyway, at least $500. and his board, and for this he ought to give his whole time to the service of the department.\n\nDr. Bryce and Mr. Fleetham are in full accordance with the views I have expressed.\n\nI will be glad to be of any service to you if you care to make use of me in any further negotiations or arrangements.\n\nYours sincerely\n\n[Signature]\nDictated - T.F.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nSince our conversation on Saturday last I have been thinking over the proposition of using the hospital building at Morley for school as well as hospital purposes. The more I think of it, the more am I persuaded that it would be a wise thing to try it provided the Department will supply two rigs for bringing the pupils to and from the school. It will require one for each side of the river. This will be very much better than building two schools and it would give a splendid opportunity of testing the principle of the improved type of day school, before building two separate places as requested by the Indians. I think this proposition ought to be very carefully looked into.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.

Fleetham, Indian Agent, Morley, to Mr. Paget - dated 8th Aug. 1906.\n\nDear Paget,\n\nYours of 3rd. instant received. Re Schools - my opinion is to wait and see whether Indians will send their children to the present Day School this fall. I am inclined to think they will nearly all go hunting, taking their families with them; of course they will return at Xmas. The plan I should adopt would be to open the two Day Schools, north and south, or if the Department would prefer it - open the Hospital as an improved School and tell the Indians straight you had provided them with a good school and it is to them to prove whether they are willing to take advantage of it. I believe they would eventually appreciate it. If this is done there must be no mistake about providing a real good teacher (man) with his wife to cook and provide for the children's meals.\n\nClose the Hospital as an Hospital as quickly as possible, for so long as Indians know it is still there for that purpose, no inducement will bring their children to the place. The Doctors' idea - both of them - is to use it partly as a school and partly as an Hospital; this will not do, and as far as consumptives are concerned amongst Indians you cannot keep them even if they are in Hospital away from their people, and as they get plenty of fresh air at home, you cannot do much more for them. My advice is - close the Hospital and let the Nurse and cook go, and when Indians see it is closed for that purpose, I think they will not further object to the school.\nExtract from letter of T.J. Fleetham, Esq.\n\nThere is still no reply from the Dept. re School matters and I hardly think they will spend a lot of money on the old Day Schools when there is the Hospital which would make an ideal improved Day School, right here and fixed up, it is a grave problem to solve the school question.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd.) T. J. Fleetham.\nExtract from letter from J. A. Markle.\n\nWhere the Day School is now located on Stony Reserve in my opinion is best location. It is over 2 miles N. W. of Hospital and by far the greater number of children who have attended this school live beyond this from 2\u00bd to --miles from Hospital. The attendance when Indians come surprised me I must admit that. Looks as though Miss Lang looking for a snap for they are figuring on getting a cook to wait on her & one Teacher and Christianson to cut, split and carry in wood, provide water, attend cow &c., about same expense as was Hospital. Then there is no proper class room providing Middrie pupils all attended Hospital School. Indians say will not send children to Hospital Day School as too far from their homes etc. My own notion is that a reliable, sober, married Policeman placed in Hospital would do more good to Indians than a Deaconess &c. Would be splendid quarters for a Policeman then fix up present Day School building which is near a big bunch of Indians, at least Middrie had a large attendance for 9 months end. 30th Sept. 30. There were on roll March 60; June 64; Sept. 61; Then South of track said to be about as many more children. If this true 2 Day Schools required. They would be 3\u00bd miles apart or thereabouts.\nDear Sir:\n\nWill you please allow me to call your attention to the fact that sometime ago I accepted the position of Teacher at this School at the salary which you offered me namely $500.00 per annum, under conditions that double rations be issued to me, on account of the fact that different Indians going away left their children with me to enable them to attend school regularly.\n\nSo far I have heard nothing of the issue of these rations, I am very sorry and must ask you to pardon me for again troubling you in this matter. Will you kindly instruct your Agent at Moosonee accordingly. I might point out the fact that even with a double issue of rations $500.00 per year is not a small sum for the work I have to do here.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTeacher\nOttawa, October 1, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the issue of rations to Mr. Hiddrie, teacher of the Morley school, I beg to say that the Department has decided to issue to him two rations while the school is in operation, to be reduced to one while the school is closed for holidays or from other causes. The object in granting this extra ration is to provide food for children left in his care, as he states is frequently done.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nT. J. Fleetham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMorley, Alta.\nOttawa, October 1, 1908.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of August 30, last, and in reply I beg to say that Mr. Agent Fleetham has been instructed to issue one ration to you while the Morley school for holidays or from other causes is closed, and two rations while the school is in operation.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJohn W.

He is to arrange it on his return to Brandon.\n\nOttawa, 18th October, 1909.\nExtract from letter of Rev. T. Perrier, dated at Brandon, Nov. 10th, 1909.\n\nHow would it do to put in a married man as teacher to the Hospital building at the end of this year, and have Miss Lang act as nurse with headquarters at the school? What salary would the Department pay for such a teacher? And what duties would be required of his wife?\n\n(Signed) T. Perrier.\nOttawa, November 16, 1909.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th inst. with reference to the engagement of a teacher and his wife on the Stony reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has received a communication from the Associate Field Secretary of the Woman's Missionary Society of the Methodist Church asking for the retention of Miss Lang's services in this field. In reference to the situation, therefore, the Department begs to submit the following remarks.\n\nIn the first place it is thought that the work contemplated on this reserve might be performed to advantage by a teacher and his wife. The teacher, who should have proper qualifications, would engage in the school work and his wife would act as Field Matron. The duties of the latter would embrace regular visits to the homes of the Indians; the inculcation of habits of thrift and industry; instruction in the principles of the treatment of common ailments; the teaching of plain sewing; and practical demonstrations in the methods of preparing\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nPrincipal,\nBrandon Industrial School,\nBrandon, Man.\nplain and wholesome meals. For these services the Department would be prepared to pay salaries of $600 and $300 per annum respectively, in addition to free quarters.\n\nOn the other hand if, as proposed, Miss Lang's services are retained it is thought that it would not be necessary to engage a married teacher. Neither would the funds at the disposal of the Department permit the payment of adequate salaries to three persons for this work. Miss Lang is now paid $400 per annum. It might be preferable to appoint another lady for the school work, leaving Miss Lang free to act as Nurse and Field Matron. For a competent teacher the Department would provide a salary of $400 per annum, including free quarters for both and two rations from the Agency store-house. If deemed expedient to arrange for the giving of a simple midday meal to the children the Department would also be willing to provide reasonable assistance to prepare it.\n\nYou will be good enough to give this matter your early consideration and it should be borne in mind that, if the present school is to be closed, Mr. Hiddrie ought to have reasonable notice that his services will not be required after a date to be agreed upon.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nSecretary.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 16th\n\nto No. 116861. The two propositions\nare clearly stated and one of them\nought to prevail. And in my judgment\nthat one is the better of the two.\n\nI have written the Secretary of the W.M.S.\nand also to Miss Lang. In the matter.\nAnd if this Society is willing to give\nMiss Lang for this work and she is\nwilling to assume it, we will\nsend in one of the best lady teachers\nwe can get. This would give the\nday school a fair trial. The building\nis comfortable and a noon day\nmeal can be served if thought advisable.\nIt might be necessary to provide\nsome means of transport for the pupils\nto and from the school, and yet if\nthe parents wish to send their children\nthey can provide money to tide.\nI would not want for the success of this school with Miss Lang and a first class teacher in charge for two reasons.\n\n1st The almost utter indifference of the people to the necessity of their children being educated.\n\n2nd The fact that they roam over the country from 20 to 200 miles and take their children with them. And it is just possible that another reason will be forth coming and that will be we will not send our children to that building \"it is a hospital but a school\" will likely be said.\n\nHowever it will be a fair honest attempt at a day school in trial. It might be just as well for the department to notify Mr. Reddy that other arrangements will be made for the school after the summer holidays.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, November 29th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the Department has decided to make a change in conducting the school on the stony reserve and to try the experiment of engaging a lady teacher to work with Miss Lang as nurse and field matron, and to use the hospital building as a school-room. The Methodist Church has not, however, made a nomination for the position of teacher and the Department is not prepared to state definitely when the change will be made, but has notified Mr. Niddrie that his services will not be required after a date to be settled later, it being understood, however, that no change will be made before December 31st, next.\n\nI may add that Mr. Niddrie has not been advised as to the changes contemplated in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nT.

I have received in reference to Mr. Reddick's appointment at Morley, was happy to hear from you. If the Department make no mention of him, I suppose he has taken off. I should think he is engaged for one year. I can see the justice of giving him due notice to quit, yet at the same time while I was not aware of this and the Department were urging for his services of and Miss Peragine is engaged to commence duties Jan. 17th. What shall be done to have no injustice fall on Miss Peragine? I have written her that she will not be required until March 1st.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo in further reference to filling the position of teacher of the Morley day school. It is observed from your letter of the 22nd November that you continue to be doubtful as to the success of a school opened in the Hospital building, and as the Department is by no means anxious to make arrangements which may be found in a short time to be unworkable, it would seem well to reconsider the proposed action. Moreover, the Indians have expressed their unwillingness to allow their children to attend a day school if established in the Hospital. As Miss Peregrine has not been engaged by the Department it would be well that you should inform her that her services will not be required. Late reports received from our Inspector show that Mr. Nidrie has been doing fairly well under the circumstances and it is thought best to improve the conditions under which he is working and retain his services for the present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. STEWART\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nPrincipal,\nBrandon Industrial School,\nBRANDON, Man.\nOttawa, January 14th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of December 20th, last, and previous correspondence I beg to inform you that the Department has decided to continue the operation of the Morley Day School in the present building under your charge. Steps will be taken to repair the building and also to provide more suitable quarters for yourself.\n\nAlthough the success which has been met with at this school during the past season has not been what might be desired, the Department is of the opinion that, if the buildings and surroundings are put in proper condition, and if you will take hold of the work with renewed vigour, much good may be accomplished. The Department will rely upon you to make every effort to induce the Indians to send their children regularly to school, as very much depends upon your influence with the parents, and it is to be hoped that future returns will show a decided improvement in this respect. The Department realizes the difficulties that you, in your position as teacher, have to contend with, but trusts that you will lose no opportunities to advance the interests of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. STEWART\nAsst. Secretary.\n\nJohn W. Niddrie, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nMorley, Alta.\nSir,\n\nI have to advise you that the Department has decided to leave the Morley Day School in its present location under Mr. Niddrie's charge. The question of providing suitable accommodation for him and of making the necessary repairs to the school building will be taken up at a later date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Secretary.\n\nT. J. Fleetham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMorley, Alta.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to letter of the 15th No. 116861/1\n\nIn reply to your reference to my letter of Nov. 22nd is rather late. At this time I stated my convictions, but was willing to waive them if the department thought it wise to start the improved type of day school in a modified form.\n\nThis the department decided to do and in letter of Oct. 17th requests a committee at an early date. The salary support will all being decided on. It is too late to back the whole scheme. Plans by raising the question of policy.\n\nMiss Lang has been allowed to stay here with the distinct understanding of a lady teacher for a work companion. This would not have been done if it had been otherwise. Since the W.M.S. from church does not approve of the policy of only one lady in a field, they always have at least two. There is such a difficulty in securing suitable and competent...\nRev. T. Ferrier\nSuperintendent of Methodist\nIndian Schools and Hospitals in Canada\n\nBrandon,\n\nTeachers for our Indian schools. That\nthe church has always to engage the teacher\nbefore it can make the nomination, this\nis always the mode of procedure right up\nto the principals of our Industrial schools\nand the department sanctioning the nominati-\non.\n\nI engaged Miss Peregrine to go to Morley\nand to the store for service until March\n17th. This she agreed to before I\nmade the nomination. These teachers are\nsecured by advertising in our church papers\nwith the aid of our ministers where we\nset forth the missionary aspect of the work,\nand our applicants are corresponded with\nsometimes for months before we can secure\nthe promise of some suitable person, and\nit is only after the promise is made and\nthe engagement made, that I am in the\nposition to make a nomination, and\nit would not be possible to make similar\nhuman propositions in all such cases\nif we adopted any other mode of procedure.\nMiss Peregrine is engaged and that all\nher plans made to be at Morley tomorrow.\nI wrote her stating that she would not\nbe required until March 17th she has\nexplained pointing out the injustice to her\nfor had she accepted of a school in Oct-\nshe would have had two months\nservice in by March 1st. She has however\ngraciously submitted to the injustice\nand assured me she will be there for\nduty by March 1st.\n\nAnother thing must be remembered\nand that is: The time for teachers engagement\nis at midsummer & the beginning of the new\nyear. This being now past, since her resignation\nmay not be able to get a suitable situation\nuntil midsummer, therefore I cannot see a\nparty to place her in any such position.\nShe is engaged for work, and all being\nwell will be there for duty March 1st.\n\nIf the mode of procedure of engaging teachers\nbefore making the nomination is objectionable\nto the department, the department may be able\nto suggest some remedy for future actions,\nbut it cannot be applied to the case\nin question.\n\nYours Respectfully\n\nT. Berrier\nOttawa, January 1st, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant in further reference to the Morley Day School, and in reply I beg to say that the Department did not authorize the appointment of Miss Peregrine as teacher of this school in official letter of the 17th of December, last, to which you refer. You were advised of the amount of salary and perquisites the Department was prepared to allow and you were asked to nominate a competent, qualified teacher at an early date. On the 21st of that month you wrote the Department saying that you had secured the offer of the services of Miss Louise Peregrine of Branchton, Ont., as teacher for the school and that you had much pleasure in nominating her at a salary of $400.00 and board and transport. On the 30th ultimo you were asked to furnish information as to whether Miss Peregrine was a duly qualified teacher, her age and condition of her health, and told that the Department could not entertain the proposition to pay her transport should she be appointed to succeed Mr. Niddrie.\n\nIn your letter of the 30th ultimo to the Department you stated that Miss Peregrin was engaged to commence her duties on the 17th of this month and you asked what should be done to have no injustice fall on her, and that you had written her that she would not be required until March 1st. In reply you were told on the 10th instant\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nPrincipal,\nBrandon Industrial School,\nBrandon, Man.\nthat, as Miss Peregrin had not been engaged by the Department, it would be well that you should inform her that her services would not be required. The Department can assume no responsibility for the engagement of Miss Peregrin as it had not authorized her appointment.\n\nYou were told that the Department required specific information as to Miss Peregrin's qualifications, age and condition, without this information, which has not yet been furnished, it could not pass upon her fitness for the position, and until it does so she should not have been engaged. There can be no question of the Department's right to appoint teachers to schools which are wholly maintained by it and the correspondence shows most clearly its intention to exercise this right in regard to the Morley School.\n\nAs you have already been informed Mr. Niddrie is being retained at Morley and there is no vacancy for Miss Peregrin and she must not be sent there, as her services are not required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Secretary.\nConfidential\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have read with much surprise your letter No. 16861 of January 29th. In reference to same request state that to say the least, the position of teacher at this school is a very thankless and uncertain one. I have lived amongst these people for the last 20 years and been actively engaged in the Indian Work for more than 13 years, and spent the best energies both of body and mind without considering either expense or labor. You will see by your letter of November 29th. You will be interested to know how I have been engaged in the Indian Work. I have tried to carry out your wishes, but have been obliged to the extent of my power, but am sorry that sometimes I have met with very little respect, and no sympathy whatever from some of your representatives at Morley, and these are the very ones who are paid by the Government to support and help the teachers to carry out their work. Indeed I have every reason to believe that my efforts have been mis-represented to the Department. I assure you that I feel flattered or encouraged. The Indians sent me three times last winter to come and teach here, and offered by their own efforts to pay me $50\nI have been receiving from the Department the position conditions that I intended writing for your position, but before I had time to do so, your agent at Morley sent his former Mr. Grant to turn me off the Reserve. Of course, the Indians here would not have this offer accepted for me. To save any trouble, and because I had no wish to disturb anyone, I agreed to apply to the Indian Commissioner (then at Winnipeg) for the position of teacher under the recommendation of your agent at Morley at a salary of $50 per month.\n\nTen days after I wrote that my application was accepted, the salary would be paid, and to commence work right away. This I did, but you know how arrangements are made in regard to salaries. I have tried to be faithful in the discharge of my duties, and carry out all your instructions, and am satisfied that the school has made as good progress as any Indian Day School in the West, and the average has been good when the Indians are at home. Keep the Indians on the Reserve, and will guarantee to keep the school full. Furthermore, so long as I am in charge of this school, I will do my best to push the work along by honest persistent effort. I cannot say more. The little 16 x 12 hole I have been living in is not fit for a pig pen\u2014when the wind is high, I cannot keep a lamp burning in the evening\u2014I could build a good class house 18 x 22 rough cast outside and lined inside for $250 which would be a credit.\nTo the School. We do not want a high building that is an obstruction for we have high winds, and they strike us here with great force.\n\nNow Sir I have Considerable time on my hands outside of School hours, and on Saturdays, and would be glad to do the repairs needed here if you will afford me. Will guarantee the Workmanship and will be in a position to do it cheaper than you could have it done, by hiring a man in a stranger.\n\nWould you allow us when the Repairs are done to bring the new desks from the Orphanage School road. They are laying idle there, and ours are used up here.\n\nI have Sir the honor to subscribe myself,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Woodbury\nOttawa, January 27th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant in reference to school matters on the Morley reserve, and in reply I beg to say that the Department trusts you will continue your efforts here with the greatest vigour and that you will eventually build up a school which will be a credit to yourself and the reserve.\n\nMr. Agent Fleetham has been instructed to have the necessary repairs made to the school-house and also to have a dwelling erected for the use of the teacher. It has, however, been thought advisable to build one of larger proportions than suggested by you, in which more suitable accommodation will be provided. Mr. Fleetham has been asked to avail himself of your services to assist in the erection of this building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. BOWMAN\n\nAsst. Secretary.\n\nJohn W. Niddrie, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nMorley, Alta.\nThe Secretary Department of Indian Affairs Ottawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to yours of the 21st No. 116861/1 re the appointing of a teacher at Morley Station Reserve. If you make a further reference by your letter of Oct. 17th, you will see that you have asked me to make a nomination of \"a competent qualified teacher at an early date.\"\n\nIn harmony with this request on Dec. 21st and on behalf of the Methodist Church I nominate Miss Louise Peregrine of Brandon Ont., who has rendered five years of first class service as a teacher in the Canadian B.C. and her credentials can be in possession of the Department in due time.\n\nThe Methodist Church has made no other nomination for this position. Would you be kind enough to furnish me with the reasons why this nomination is not acceptable to the Department?\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. Ferrier\nOttawa, Feb. 3rd., 1910.\n\nReverend Sir,-\n\nIn reply to your letter of January 26th, I beg to state that the reasons for not approving of Miss Louise Peregrine's nomination as an Indian Day School teacher at the Stony Reserve are contained in Departmental letter of January 10th; to which I beg to refer you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev.

Her work as a teacher was highly satisfactory. She has great tact in dealing with pupils; keeps them interested in their work. I have had an experience of more than twenty-five years as a teacher in the Public Schools of Canada, and in my opinion she is equal to the very best. She is alert, pains-taking and thorough. Any school needing the services of a teacher will make no mistake in engaging Miss Peregrine.\n\nR.H.

Cairns.\nMiss Penquite,\u2014Having visited your school on several occasions I can assure you it gave me pleasure in recommending you as a capable and earnest teacher. You readily adapted yourself to the needs of your district; were quick to grasp the school situation, and were successful in your training of your pupils.\n\nThe government of your school was orderly and wisely secured, the methods of teaching well sound. The grounding in work was thorough.\n\nI regret you are leaving any inspectorate but hope the same cordial relations I observed existing between pupils and teacher may continue wherever you may be.\n\nT. Perrett\nInspector Schools R.W.T.\nI have much pleasure in bearing testimony to the excellent work done by Miss Louise Petytine while in charge of the school in S.S. No. 11, Beverly and an earlier. In the schoolroom she maintains good order among the pupils, exercise a wholesome discipline over them and is well acquainted with the most approved methods of instruction. I can therefore, with the utmost confidence in her ability commend her to the favorable consideration of any Board of Trustees who may require the services of a patriotic and efficient teacher.\n\nJ.

A reference to Mr Green's report in the Blue Book, will give you his opinion of her as a teacher during the five years she was at the Coqueletza Industrial School.\n\nPersonally I have no hesitation in saying that she is one of the best primary teachers that I have ever had the privilege of visiting in class room work. And it was for this reason that I considered the Department very fortunate in having the opportunity of starting the Morley School under the new arrangement with such a capable teacher.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[T.

Both the Indians been all at home, and had their not been so much sickness amongst the children, we of course would have shown a much larger attendance. As matters are at present those going away have no where to leave their attendance school. This makes it hard for the children when they return and resume their studies and very discouraging to the teachers who does his best for their advancement.\n\nI have this day made out requisition for School Supplies and sent it to Stone's Agency.

We visited the school, we also discussed educational matters with our missionary and the Indian Agent. The Commission appointed by our General Board to report on all matters in our Indian work in Alberta will not meet until the time of the Annual Conference. In the meantime I wish to draw the attention of the Department to the fact that the policy intended for the education of the Indians on this reserve ought to be decided on before any buildings are put up. For when that policy is agreed on it is more than probable that such buildings may be of no value.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nJ. Perrier\nOttawa, April 14, 1910.\n\nRev.

The substance of the further report was to the effect:\n\nThat nothing be done at present re.

As quickly as I am writing this from you to that I may make a proposal taking in new work. Could this suggested meeting be held some time this month? And could the Department call me there and have me present the fort side. If possible and myself will attend if possible let me hear from you at your earliest convenience to begin.\n\nYours sincerely,\nT. Perrier\nOttawa, January 13th., 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,-\n\nIn reply to your letters of December 6th and January 5th., addressed to the Superintendent of Indian Education, I have to inform you that while the Department approves of the procedure outlined, it is questionable whether action should be taken immediately. Undoubtedly foresight would be exercised if the individual parents on the Stony Reserve were to pledge their children for the school before it was erected in order that it might be accurately ascertained what the attendance would be, but at present there is no appropriation for a Boarding School at this point and it does not seem possible to say when funds could be obtained for the purpose. Large demands will be made on the Parliamentary appropriations in order to improve present buildings and to erect new ones. Of course, the work conducted by the Methodist Church would have been considered but at present it would seem premature to ask the Indians to pledge their children for the school unless the erection of a new building on the Reserve within a reasonable time could be promised. It is thought too that the future of the Red Deer Industrial School should be decided before long. It would hardly be possible to consent to erect Boarding Schools on the Northern Reserves, and at the Hobbs and Stony Reserve, and to continue to operate the Red Deer Industrial School.\n\nYou might present these facts to your Committee and communicate further with the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

D.of I.A.\nThe Stoney Indians are most anxious to have Day Schools on their Reservation. They will guarantee attendance of about 20 on each side of the river. Every Indian who addressed me at the conference I had with them spoke very strongly on this point. It seems to me that there is a movement of sentiment among the Indians all through this West towards Day School form of education and I certainly think myself that if it is possible to get the teachers and to make a special Treaty with each Band of Indians making School attendance compulsory that it will be much the cheaper and better method of handling these people.\n\nThe Morley Reserve is one that is very far from being either a farming or a stock range and unquestionably the Reserve should be enlarged if possible. It should be enlarged by the addition of half a township in which is now located the Sibbald Ranch to the East, the lease of which expires I understand in a year or so. My information with regard to this was got from the Indians and may not be very accurate, but can be verified by the Department of the Interior; and further enlargement of the Reserve can be made by the additional Reserve asked for at Kootenay Plains. With regard to this latter I feel\nup strongly that it is best to do this and get the Stoney Indians in a satisfied frame of mind, that I thus again refer to it.\n\nYours &c.,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Inspector.\nOttawa, October 15, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Campbell, Chief Inspector of Indian Agencies, states that the Stony Indians are most anxious to have a day school on their reservation.\n\nIn case the Department decides to re-establish a school there it would like to know what accommodation there is available for a school and teacher's quarters on the reserve.

STEWART\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nGlen Campbell, Esq.\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDear Sir,\n\nHaving seen something of the Indians at Morley, I am writing to ask if something could not be done towards setting up schools for them. There is a Methodist Institution which failed in its object; a big building empty & closed up, and a big section I heard doing no good.\n\nI think the schools should be taken to the Indians, not the Indians taken to the schools, the children get homesick, being used to a wild life, & the mothers...\ncome & take them home, & then it all has to be begun again.\n\nI think there should be government schools not sectarian, and to begin with, a few small schools should be scattered among the Indians, they live at great distances and they should be taught trades or useful things, many are quite skillful & would easily learn. They should have teachers interested & especially trained for that work.

In cases where Indians cannot be sent to boarding and industrial schools and there are a sufficient number of school age on the reserve to warrant the establishment of a day school, the Department is always willing to do what it can to meet the need in such cases.\n\nI may say that a day school was established on the Stony reserve but it did not meet with success and had to be closed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMiss Annie Fletcher,\nMorley, Alta.\n\nAsst.

Scott.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn April, 1917 Mr. Arnap and myself discussed with Mr. Scott in his office the situation at Morley, Alberta. It was agreed that we would try a new type of day-school using the building formerly a hospital as class-room. I presented this matter to the Methodist Alberta Conference the following May pointing out the necessity of making a change in the missionary before we could undertake the carrying out of the new policy. This was not done at that time. In the Conference during May last the Rev. A. D. Miller formerly a professor in the Alberta College was appointed to take charge of the missionary work. Mr. Miller is considered an expert rural work particularly along agricultural lines. We have also engaged a teacher to take charge of the class-room.\n\nI would like a fair supply of class-room material sent at once to the Rev. A. D. Miller and instructions for him to open the class-room in the building formerly used as a hospital. As there are a large number of school children on this Reserve I do not anticipate any difficulty in securing a large attendance.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndustrial School, Brandon.\nSeptember 10th, 1918.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your favour of the 3rd September with reference to the possibility of opening a school on the Stony Reserve. I note that this matter was discussed in the spring of 1917. It would have been well to have corresponded with the Department before engaging a teacher as it was not known here that you contemplated taking any action. The old hospital building is not available at the present time for school purposes, so the matter will have to remain in abeyance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nPrincipal,\nBrandon Industrial School,\nBrandon, Man.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the Methodist Missionary Rev. Mr Millar of Morley Mission has asked me to requisition for school supplies, saying it was his intention to open an Indian day School on the Stony reserve. I have not received any advice in this reference from the Department, also Mr Millar does not appear to know what supplies will be required, though in the event of a school opening the pupils would all be beginners.\n\nThe intention as stated by Mr Millar is to use one of the unoccupied Agency buildings, and devote a half day to the Indian children, and a half day to whites in a class room at the mission, this latter has already started; the teacher being a young lady without any former experience. For school (day) purposes the Agency is not convenient to the more closely settled districts of the reserve, the nearest family with children of school age being two and a half miles from the Agency.\n\nI will be pleased if the Department advise me in this connection.\n\nYours obediently\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOctober 16, 1915.\n\nDear Mr. Yeomans,\n\nReferring to letter to you of April 12th, last and previous correspondence, I have to say that as it is the wish of the Department to establish the day school in the old hospital building, you should ask Mr. Noble to vacate the premises. I am sure that the local organization of the Red Cross will understand that it is in the interests of the Indians to establish the school and I trust it will be possible for them to make other arrangements for their Red Cross work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan O.

I have not yet received these. If you will supply me with them, I shall be pleased to make out reports for the present and the preceding quarters.

I was here ready for work, and the opening of the school had been announced. Before I learned that the order for the school to be opened had been sent, the Flu was prevalent upon the reserve, and continued for some months. We did not think it wise to open the school at such a time; but did so as soon as it seemed at all safe for the children to donee.\n\nWe have had no guidance from the agent one way or the other, in this matter, and he did not at any time inform me that an order for the school to be opened had reached him.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFrances R. Court.\n(teacher day school)\nOttawa, June 24, 1919.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, in which you furnish an explanation as to why the quarterly reports of attendance of the Morley Day School have not been forwarded.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that a supply of quarterly report forms for this purpose are being sent to Mr. Agent Yeomans who is being instructed to see that you receive them. You should then prepare a return for the quarter ending March 31st, last, and also one at the end of the current quarter. These returns should be prepared by you in duplicate and sent to the agent who will certify the same and forward a copy to the Department.\n\nThe Department has been informed by the Reverend Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, of the reasons for the delay in the opening of this school which was on account of the epidemic of influenza that visited the reserve.\n\nThe agent is being instructed to give you every assistance in his power for the carrying on of the work as teacher in this school.

A supply of blank quarterly return forms are being sent you under separate cover and you will be good enough to see that these are handed to the teacher, who should prepare a return showing the attendance for the quarter ending March 31st, last, as well as a return at the end of the present quarter. As soon as you receive these returns you will be good enough to certify the same, if correct, and forward them to the Department without delay in order that the amount of grant due for salary can be paid.\n\nI may say that it is expected that you will give the teacher every assistance and encouragement in her work, also, that you will use your best endeavours to have the Indian parents send their children regularly to the school.\n\nIt is hoped that it will not be necessary to again draw your attention to the forwarding of the usual returns promptly, at the end of each quarter. If you had no return forms for this purpose on hand you should have requested a supply to be forwarded to you in due time.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nE. H. Yeomans, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMorley,\nAlta.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\nDear Sir,\n\nI write you at the request of Chiefs Jonas Beuganin, Hector Crawler, and others, Indians of the Stony Indian Reserve, to ask you to protest strongly to the Indian Dept., against an application made by our Board to have a store on their reservation.\n\nA movement seems to be in fact in some circles here, not entirely foreign to the I.O. officials or some of their wives under guise of the Red Cross society to let the hospital (recently used as a mission school) to the Board for store purposes. I am informed by these chiefs that this Board tried for some time, contrary to all decency and also to the rules of the Indian Department, with an Indian woman, in adultery on the reservation, and there is at least one child the progeny of such adultery here.\nThe Indians ask me to say that they do not want such men about the reserve; they have written the Indians to remove them and asked that be backed up by your protest to the Commissioners.\n\nThey want to have a school maintained and kept up, and suggest that if a school is kept there will be an increased attendance.\n\nThey say that it is only recently that they got rid of a party of not too good a character, who was allowed the privilege of a store in that building and who vacated only when the building was needed for school purposes. They are endeavoring to keep things right on the reserve. Written at request of the above named chiefs and Indians.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nRev. T.

I had also a letter from Mr. Miller, the missionary, stating that there is a move on foot to side-track the hospital building being used as a school this year. We certainly ought to have a school open at this point and give the people an opportunity to educate their children. I have been trying to secure a suitable teacher but would not like to send one in and have no building as happened a year ago.

Mr. Perrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, has written the Department regarding the non-attendance of Indian children at the day school at Morley. The return received for the June quarter, last, shows an enrolment of thirty-two pupils, with an average attendance of only three. Mr. Agent Yeomans was requested to use his best endeavours to have the Indian parents send their children regularly to the school. Unless a good attendance is maintained and the Indians take advantage of the facilities provided, the Department would not be justified in continuing the school.\n\nMr. Perrier in his letter, which is dated the 18th instant, states that Miss Court has, during the last week kept the school open for business, but has yet to see the first pupil and this in spite of the fact that several of the parents had promised me to send their children. Miss Court is much liked too by the Indian children and Mrs. Stocken, the clerk's wife who was for many years a teacher in Indian schools, declares that the children made great progress under her instruction.

The Agent has had instructions from time to time to use his best endeavour to have the Indian parents send their children to school regularly, but of no avail. I would advise that the school be closed and if the plan of establishing an industrial school in the Edmonton district goes through, I would suggest that the Department use compulsion and place these children there. No matter how much Miss Court is liked by the Indian children she will not have sufficient influence to get them to attend school.\n\nThe question of having an opposition trading store on this reserve has been brought before the Department at different times. I cannot see that the Indians would benefit a great deal by this and it is no reason for not sending their children to school. I was speaking to Mr. Agent Yeomans in regard to this matter and have asked him to submit a full report on the subject, and upon receipt of same I will again communicate with you.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nNovember 19\n\nSherrard (signature) & MacKenzie\nand he said to hold\nuntil Mr. Graham comes\n& Dept.\n\nP.P.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE\nREGINA, SASK., Nov. 13, 1919.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Mr. Agent Yeomans, Stony Agency, Morley, Alta., in which he informs me that the day school on that reserve has again been re-opened, and that there is only one pupil attending the school on occasional days. He states further that the teacher, Miss Court, conducts a private school for white children in the Missionary's house in the mornings and the afternoons are supposed to be devoted to the Indian children. Mr. Yeomans states that he was not advised by either the teacher or Missionary that the school was being re-opened, but does not state whether he was advised by the Department as to what was being done. I shall be glad therefore if you will advise me whether you advised the Agent of any arrangement that might have been made with Miss Court or Mr. Miller, the Missionary. The very fact that the Agent was not notified of the re-opening of the school shows a lack of interest.\n\nI may say that I was not advised by the\n\nD.C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDepartment as to what arrangements were being made in this connection. I do not see how the work can ever be a success unless those who business it is to see that the school work is being carried on satisfactorily, are advised when appointments are made and what arrangements are being made with teachers.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCommissioner.\nDecember 3rd, 1919.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier -\n\nReferring to official letter of October 23rd, last, and previous correspondence regarding the Morley School, I am convinced that there is no hope of our conducting a successful day school on the reserve at the present time.

Cochrane, D.D., was duly received, referring to the decision of the Department to allow a grant toward the teacher's salary at the Morley Indian School at the rate of $75.00 a teaching month from April last last, owing to the number of children on the Reserve who cannot be accommodated in the school.\n\nIn reply would say that it gives the Home Mission Board much gratification that provision is made in this way for the attendance of these children as day pupils.\n\nI note that the Principal, Rev. E. J.

Moreover the place is so cold in winter. True that it is not fit to live in. I wrote Mr. A. Scott Maclean some months ago regarding this matter, he told me he wrote you in the matter but has not heard one word about it.\n\nNow it seems to me that the cold weather will be upon us before anything will be done. Even if you cannot expend the sum asked for by Mr. Maclean, would it not be possible to make a grant for a smaller more modest dwelling so that we might have a little comfort out of school hours during the winter months\u2014if you would be kind enough to do this I would commence to the work right away. But I would not like Mr. Maclean to think that I am in any way interfering with his propositions. Such some repairs the school-room needed done for 40 years ago\u2014the interior is well ruined. Accepting your reply,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n[Signature]\n\n[Note: The signature is not legible.]\nOttawa, October 25th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant again calling attention to the necessity for the erection of a teacher's dwelling in connection with the Morley School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department regrets any inconvenience you are put to, but until it is finally decided where the school is to be permanently located the Department would not be justified in incurring any expenditure in this direction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJohn W. Niddrie, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nMorley, Alta.\nOttawa, January 14th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has reconsidered its decision to transfer the Morley Day School from the present building to the hospital and will continue Mr. Niddrie's services at the present location. It will, however, be necessary to provide him with more suitable quarters and also to make some repairs to the school building.\n\nIn September, last, Mr. Agent Fleetham suggested that the Department erect a building 18 feet by 24 feet, one and a half storeys high, two rooms downstairs and two rooms upstairs, with a lean-to about 12 by 18 for a kitchen. The material to be logs on a stone foundation and rough cast outside and lathed and plastered inside. Mr. Fleetham estimated the cost to be about $500.00. He also suggested that a stone foundation be placed under the school building and general repairs be made to it, including painting, at a cost of about $150.00.\n\nThe Department will be glad to have your views just as soon as possible in regard to Mr. Fleetham's suggestions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. A. Markle, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies, Asst. Secretary,\nRed Deer, Alta.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant in which you inform me that it is now decided to continue the day school on the Stony Reserve where it is now in operation. In my opinion the decision was a very prudent one for the present school apparently is located near to where the greatest number of children of this reserve are.\n\nWhen I recently inspected this school and building I concluded that it was about the best location on the reserve for a day school and that the building could be made to meet the requirements for a number of years with the expenditure of about $150.00. As the location is so near to Easkaw it occurred to me that the best and most lasting material to plaster the exterior wall would be cement. If properly applied it should make an everlasting job.\n\nA log walled building such as the one proposed by Mr. Agent Fleeton will no doubt meet the requirements. A good collar I think should be provided for under the lean-to kitchen. If the smoke pipe from the range is 3\" there could be a connecting 4\" pipe leading to it from the collar and in that manner draw off the odors which may arise from any vegetables stored therein. It may be well too at the outset to carry the lean-to the full length of the building - 24'. The extra room will doubtless be required and the extra expense will not be great.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nO T T A W A.\nMorley School, January 20th, 1910.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nXXX XXX\n\nThe little 10 x 12 hole I have been living in is not fit for a pig pen. When the wind is high I cannot keep a lamp burning in the evenings. I could build a first class log house 18 x 22 rough cast outside and lined inside for $250.00 which would be a credit to the school. We do not want a high building that is, an upstairs, but we have high winds, and they strike us here with great force.\n\nNow Sir, I have considerable time on my hands outside of school hours and on Saturdays and would be glad to do the repairs needed here, if you will allow me, Will guarantee the workmanship and will be in a position to do it cheaper than you could have it done by bringing in a stranger. Would you allow us when the repairs are done to bring the new desks from the Orphanage School room? They are laying idle there, and ours are used up here.\n\nI have Sir the honour to subscribe myself\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n(signed) John W. Nidd...\nOttawa, January 27th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nAs you have already been advised the Department has decided to continue the Morley day school at the present site and retain the services of Mr. Niddrie. It will, therefore, be necessary to make some repairs to the school-house and provide suitable quarters for Mr. Niddrie. In a letter of September 17th, last, you suggested the erection of a residence 18 feet by 24 feet or 30 feet, one and one-half storeys, with a lean-to kitchen, to be constructed of logs on a stone foundation, lathed and rough cast outside and plastered inside; also a stone foundation for the school-house, as well as painting and some general repairs.\n\nMr. Inspector Markle has approved of your proposals, but has suggested a cellar under the kitchen of the residence, with a 4 inch pipe leading to the chimney to draw off any odours which may arise from vegetables stored in it. He further suggests that cement should be used to plaster the exterior of the residence. These suggestions commend themselves to the Department, if it is feasible to use the cement instead of lime.\n\nThe approximate estimate of the cost, without these changes, was given as $500.00 for the residence and $150.00 for the school-house.\n\nYou are, therefore, hereby authorized to proceed with the erection of a building of the dimensions and\n\nT. J. Fleetham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMorley, Alta.\nkind described in your letter, as well as the repairs to the school-house outlined. Mr. Niddrie has offered his services during his spare time to help with the work and these should be utilized.\n\nYou will be good enough to have close supervision of this work to see that it is performed in a satisfactory manner and as economically as possible, and should it be found necessary to materially exceed the estimate of cost you should report to the Department and obtain the necessary authority.\n\nWhen the repairs are made to the building it has been suggested that the desks from the boarding school should be removed to the day school and of this the Department approves, as it is understood that those in use at present are not suitable. You will be good enough to attend to this.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Secretary.\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\nMorley, Alta.\n\nFeb. 23rd, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of Jan. 27th, 1910,\n\nNo. 116861/5 Re the erection of residence for the School Teacher on the North side of the river (Wesley Band)\n\nI would state that to carry out the suggestions of Mr. Inspector Markle as to cellar and cement being used for plastering the exterior of the building - after going through all the specifications I find the amount required will be from $600. to $625.\n\nAlso to make this a comfortable and warm building instead of two Heating stoves which will be necessary in addition to one cook stove, I would strongly recommend a wood furnace be installed at the cost of $160.00 for the following strong reasons. Stoves are dangerous and liable to be broken where boys are continually on the premises, fire would destroy the building in a few minutes. Whereas a furnace would be particularly safe and last for several years. I therefore consider the latter would be cheaper in the long run, besides being so much cleaner, and out of the way.\n\nI enclose offer from the E.J. Young Plumbing Co., Calgary.\n\nThe estimated cost of the whole would be, as near as I can make out at present\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nBuilding, 16x24 and Lean-to Kitchen, $625.00\nFurnace installed, 160.00\nCook Stove, 40.00\nRepairs to School House, 150.00\n\n$975.00\n\nI trust you will find this satisfactory, and that as soon as the frost is out of the ground I may be authorized to go on with the work as above stated.\n\nI am getting out logs to be ready.\n\nRepairs to the School will be attended to as soon as the weather is favorable and the frost out of the ground,\u2014probably in May.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 2nd, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of January 16th in regard to the erection of a residence for the teacher on the north side of the River on the Morley Reserve I beg to enclose herewith a copy of a communication received from Mr. Agent Fleetham, together with an offer to supply a furnace from the E. J. Young Plumbing Co., Calgary, and a sketch of the building prepared by Mr. Fleetham.\n\nThe Department would be pleased to have your opinion as to the suitability of the building and on the matter of heating, as well as any other suggestions that you may wish to offer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ. A. Markle, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRed Deer, Alta.\nSir,\n\nIn my letter of this morning, written at the Sarcee Agency, in referring to an expenditure of $800.00 for a residence for the teacher I intended it to apply to paragraph 2 of Mr. Fleetham's letter of the 23rd ultimo in which he stated the cost might likely be \"from $600. to $625.00. The cost of the range, furnace, tables, dishes, etc., were not taken into consideration. If a building erected on my plan instead of Mr. Fleetham's plan the cost would be about $1000. when the range, furnace, tables and plain dishes included in the cost.\n\nIn addition the estimated cost of repairing the class room building is $150.00.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInsp.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 14, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of February 23rd, last, and previous correspondence in regard to the erection of a teacher's residence on the Morley Reserve I beg to say that at the request of the authorities of the Methodist church the Department has decided to defer action till such time as a Commission appointed by the General Board of that body makes a special report on Indian work generally in Alberta.

May 14, 1930\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring one of his recent interviews with the Deputy Superintendent General, our General Secretary discussed with him the arrangement which our Society purposed making for the supervision of the work on the Sarcee Reserve after the retirement this autumn of the Ven. Archdeacon Tims the missionary-in-charge, and Miss Tims, the teacher of the Day School operated in connection with the Sarcee Hospital. The arrangement approved at the interview mentioned was that an ordained minister of the Church of England with teaching qualifications should be appointed to undertake the combined duties of the officers who are about to retire, and our Commission in preparing their Estimates for the year 1931 desire to know the amount of the salary and maintenance allowances which would be available from your Department for the teacher of the Day School in question.\n\nThey have been informed that the salary allowance of the Day School Teacher was recently raised to $100.00 per month for the ten teaching months of the year and presume that this amount would be available for the teacher appointed, but would like to have this information confirmed by you, and also to have your statement as to the amount of the maintenance allowance, over and above the amount provided as salary.\n\nAn early reply will be deeply appreciated by\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, May 19, 1930.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, informing the Department of the proposed arrangements made by your Society for the carrying on of the work on the Sarcee Reserve after the retirement of the Ven. Archdeacon Tims, the missionary in charge, and Miss Tims, the teacher of the day school.\n\nIn this connection it is noted that it is recommended an ordained minister of the Church of England, with teaching qualifications, be appointed to undertake the duties of the above named officers who are about to retire. If the minister appointed will also carry out teaching duties, devoting the regular classroom period to this service, the Department will be prepared to allow a salary of $85 to $90 per teaching month, depending on the teaching qualifications which he possesses. As he would have no duties in connection with the hospital, it is considered that the Department should not be called upon to provide any allowance in excess of salary for maintenance. I should be pleased if, in due time, you would forward the name, qualifications and experience of the missionary whose services you recommend.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. S. Williams,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave., E.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nWinnipeg, Man. May 23, 1930\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received your letter of the 19th inst. #120-1-1 and in reply to your request to be informed of the name, qualifications and experience of the Missionary-teacher our Society contemplates appointing to take charge of the Mission and Day School work on the Sarcee Reserve, after the retirement of the Ven. Archdeacon Tims and Miss Tims this autumn, I beg to state that this appointment has been offered to and accepted by the Rev. F. M. R. Gibney who has filled the position of Principal of the Old Sun School on the Blackfoot Reserve for nearly eight years (see letter of Canon Gould, our General Secretary, to the Deputy Superintendent General, dated May 20th). I should state that Mr. Gibney's acceptance of this appointment is subject to mutually satisfactory arrangements being made with regard to the amount of his salary allowance and the amount which will be provided for the maintenance of himself and his family, as well as for the upkeep of his residence, the operating expenses of a motor car, etc.\n\nI note from your letter that your Department is prepared to allow a salary of $65 to $90 per teaching month, according to the qualifications of the appointee. As Mr. Gibney is a fully qualified teacher, holding a Teacher's diploma as King's Scholar, under the Commissioners of National Education in Ireland, where he lived and taught school before coming to Canada, our Commission were hopeful that your Department would grant him in addition to his salary allowance, the maintenance allowance of $300.00 a year which they have been informed was available for Miss Tims if she desired to receive it. Mr. Gibney will, of course, fulfill the daily teaching hours required by the regulations of your Department, and in view of his teaching\nqualifications, our Commission beg to request that his appointment be accepted by your Department, and that he be granted a salary allowance of not less than $90.00 a teaching month and also a maintenance allowance of not less than $200.00 a year.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.O.C.\nOttawa, May 28, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, with reference to the appointment of the Rev. F. M. Ross Gibney to the position of teacher of the Sarcee Indian Day School. The Department will approve of his appointment, in view of his qualifications. A salary of $100 per teaching month will be allowed. I regret that no allowance can be made for maintenance, as this teacher, who is also to be missionary, would have no regular duties in connection with the hospital. If definite arrangements are made, please inform the Department, so that our local officers can be advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T.

He will carry out the regular classroom duties, as well as missionary duties on the Reserve. The salary allowed him will be at the rate of $100 per teaching month, and no allowance will be made for maintenance.\n\nI have to request that you will give Mr. Gibney every assistance you can in his work as teacher at the Sarcee Indian Day School, and use every endeavour to maintain a regular attendance of the pupils of school age who are in good health.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos.

Gibney, Teacher of the Day School on the Sarcee Reserve, (see letter Mr. A. S. Williams, May 19th, 1930, 120-1-1) I shall be glad to have a statement from you as to how and when this salary will be paid.\n\nMy understanding is that salaries of all Day School Teachers are paid to the teachers themselves direct, on receipt by your Department of the routine school returns. If my understanding of this matter is correct, then your cheque for $90.00 for each teaching month will be issued to Mr. Gibney direct. In his case the routine school return will take the place of a voucher, but I should like to have specific information as to whether you purpose making your cheque payable to him direct, or through our General Treasurer.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, November 4, 1930.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, with reference to the salary of Rev. F. M. Ross Gibney, teacher of the Sarsese Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection I have to inform you that the salary of Mr. Gibney, which is at the rate of $100 per teaching month - no extra allowance being made him for maintenance - will, as in the past, be paid direct, and not through the office of your General Treasurer unless specially directed by you.\n\nThe return showing the attendance, etc., for the month of September, last, has been received, and shows that Miss Winifred A. Tims taught during that period. A cheque in payment of the salary due her for the month of September, last, was sent to her direct. It is presumed that Rev. Mr. Gibney did not assume charge of this school until the 1st ultimo.\n\nIf it is your desire that cheques in payment of Mr. Gibney's salary be made through your General Treasurer, the Department will be pleased to carry out your instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

F. M. R. Gibney, teacher of the Sarcee Indian Day School, dealt with in your letter of the 4th inst. #120-1-1, I beg to request that payment be made to the Indian Residential School Commission, M.S.C.C., 39-43 The Bible House, 184 Alexander Ave., Winnipeg. The Commission issue their cheque monthly to meet Mr. Gibney's salary allowance, and as the amount allowed by your Department has to be supplemented from their funds, this method of payment will save time and simplify our process of bookkeeping.\n\nTrusting this arrangement may be agreeable to you.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, November 12, 1930.\n\nRev.

Gibney, teacher of the Sarcee Indian Day School, will be made payable and forwarded to the Indian Residential School Commission, M.S.C.G., 39-43, The Bible House, Alexander Ave., Winnipeg. It is noted that the Commission issue their cheque monthly to Mr. Gibney, and that cheques in payment of the salary allowed by the Department drawn and forwarded as above will simplify the Commission's bookkeeping.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.G.,\n39-43, The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to report on the Sarcee School, which I inspected just before the Christmas Holidays, but did not wish to report on until I got through inspecting the Agency, which inspection I have just completed.\n\nAt the time of my inspection there were 26 children registered, and I found that for the fall term, up to the time of my visit, the average attendance was a little over 24.\n\nI found the children looking real well. They were well dressed and looking healthy, and I must say that I was very well impressed with the classroom work, where I spent all afternoon.\n\nYou will recall that this school was diverted last summer from a boarding school to a day school. The classroom that was previously used was at the end of the main building, and as it took a great deal of fuel to heat this room the classroom was moved into one of the main dormitories. Additional windows were placed in this room, and blackboards etc., and the teacher advised me that this was very satisfactory. Everything in the classroom was fixed up to the teachers satisfaction.\n\nNo difficulty has been experienced in getting the children to come to school regularly, and some of the older ones come on horse-back, others are driven to school and called for by their parents, and where the Indians live together in groups they do this turn about. One wagon brings the children from each group of houses.\n\nA real good mid-day meal is furnished to the children attending, and since January 1st., which will be continued during the winter, before the children go home they are given a lunch, so I would say that they are being looked after pretty well.\nAs the classroom work is being inspected by the Provincial Inspector of Schools I shall not enlarge on that.\n\nMr. Gibbon's work has been very satisfactory, and he has been getting good results, as will be shown by the fact that last year three girls wrote on their Entrance and all passed.\n\nOne of the girls has since been married, but the other two are still attending school.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nM.

MacGregor, on Sarcee Indian Day School,\ndated October 12, 1932.\n\nTeacher's Name - Rev. Frederick M. Ross Gibney,\nSalary - $900.00\n\nSecond Class, Manitoba. I think it would be advisable for Mr. Gibney to submit his credentials to the Department of Education, in order that he might secure Alberta standing. Mr. Gibney appears to be enjoying good health. Satisfactory work is being done.\n\nPresent school hours are from 9:30 a.m. to noon and 1:30 p.m. to 3:30, with no recesses. Unless there are good reasons to the contrary, in my opinion, regular school hours, with the usual recesses, should be followed. In any event, care should be exercised to develop in these boys and girls the importance of being punctual.\n\nSchool is now being held in a room on the second floor of the hospital. It is not particularly suited for class-room purposes. Lighting arrangements are not satisfactory on account of cross lights. The teacher has endeavoured to decorate the room with pictures and specimens of pupils' art and map work. As soon as possible, school should be transferred back to the regular school building.\nOttawa, February 25, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received the report of the Provincial Inspector of Schools on his recent inspection of the Sarcee Indian Day School. He states that, while satisfactory work is being done by Rev. Mr. Gibney, it would be advisable for him to submit his credentials to the Department of Education, in order that he might secure Alberta standing. He also states that the present school hours are from 9:30 A.M. to Noon and from 1:30 P.M. to 3:30, with no recesses.\n\nUnless there are good reasons to the contrary, regular school hours, with the usual recesses, should be followed. In this connection, I would refer you to the Indian Day School Regulations printed on the inside back cover of the Daily Register of Attendance. You should inform Mr. Gibney that it is expected he will comply with the regulations and that the morning session shall be from 9 A.M. to 12 Noon and the afternoon session from 1 P.M. to 4 P.M., with a recess during each session of not less than fifteen and not more than twenty minutes. Mr. Gibney should comply with the requirements regarding the hours the school is to be opened and closed. Care should be exercised by the teacher to develop in the boys and girls the importance of being punctual.\n\nI shall be pleased to have a report from you after you have discussed the matter with Mr. Gibney.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

As this is not a boarding school there is very little for me to report:\n\nThe building that is used as a school and hospital is, as you know, an old and dilapidated one, but it has been kept in a fair state of repair. Mr. Varcoe, who has been doing the carpenter work on the reserve for the last two years has done a great deal of work for us around the school, without any cost to the Department. In such weather as he has been unable to work outside on the reserve he has spent his time in repairing our buildings and I must say the school building looks better than it has for years: Doors and windows have been fitted and walls fixed, floors repaired, &c.\n\nThere are 25 children on the register with an average attendance of from 19 to 24.\n\nDoctor Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nThe children all looked well and come to school regularly. They receive a good midday meal and a lunch before they leave for home at 4.00 o'clock. I have had complaints from the Indians about turning the institution into a day school, but during my inspection there this was not brought up, and the change seems to be working out satisfactorily.\n\nThe Reverend Mr. Gibney, teacher, according to the Provincial School Inspector's report, is evidently carrying on very well. Mrs. Gibney gives the girls instructions every week in sewing, embroidery, &c.\n\nAs you are aware, cows, chickens, &c., are kept at the school and therefore we have an abundance of milk, eggs, garden truck, &c.\n\nThe staff at the school and hospital consists of Miss Henderson as nurse and general worker, and Mrs. Smith as cook and general utility woman. Both these women have been with the Department for a number of years and their work is very satisfactory. I regretted to note that Miss Henderson is in very poor health and has more or less had a breakdown, and is, I would say, in no shape to carry on there. I advised her to apply for some sick leave and I could arrange to place Miss Coleman in charge while she is away, but I doubt if Miss Henderson will take advantage of this as she is under the impression that she cannot afford to go away. These\ntwo women have a great deal or work to do in keeping the building clean, supplying the mid-day meal and lunch for the children. Besides, there are five children kept at the school all the time as they live too far away to come as day pupils. There are always some patients in the hospital and the odd confinement case, so they are certainly kept very busy.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nMarch 19th, 1934.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department has received your letter 408-11A of March 10th, being a report of your inspection of the institution at the Sasee Reserve. Miss Henderson has been a very useful and faithful employee, and the Department regrets that she is not in good health. You are well advised to urge her to take sick leave, and I hope she will be able to do so.\n\nYou are aware, of course, that the cost of maintaining this institution has greatly decreased, and the Department's impression, founded on statements from yourself and Doctor Murray, is that its efficiency has not been affected. It is the only place of exactly this kind maintained in the service, and it is possible that it may be a pattern for other places.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHarold W.

Previous to this, I had made one call at the school, and found the teacher absent.\n\nENROLMENT AND ATTENDANCE:\n\nEnrolled - Ages\n\nMay 23/40 - Boys: 1 15 - 14 - 13 - 12 - 11 - 10 - 9 - 8 - 7 - 6\nGirls: 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2\n\nNo. of pupils present P.M. of this day (weather fine): Boys - 3\nGirls - 7-10.\n\nEnrolled -\n\nMay 2/41 - Boys: 1 - 2 - 5 - 3 - 2 - 3 - 1 - 1 - 2 - 2 - 20\nGirls: 2 - 2 - 2 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 31\n\nNo. of pupils present P.M. of this day (weather fine): Boys - 1\nGirls - 7-8.\n\nAverage attendance for quarter ending March 31, 1940 - 13.86\nAverage attendance for quarter ending March 31, 1941 - 18.13.\n\nAll pupils attending this school are from the Sarcee Reserve. Some of these live four and five miles from the school, and either have to be driven, drive themselves, or ride horse-back to school. Inclement weather -- more so in Winter -- lowers the attendance.\n\nDoctor Harold W. McGill,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nI am attaching hereto a list of names of all children on this reserve at time of my visit. This was prepared, at my request, by Dr. Murray, the Agent.\n\nThe teacher, Mr. F.M.R. Gibney, holds a first Class Irish, and second-class Province of Manitoba certificate. He has been teaching at this school since 1930. He is, I think, a capable teacher, has a kind manner in dealing with the children, and the pupils appear to respond to his commands, and answer his questions fairly freely.\n\nThe punctuality at this school is not the best: Some children are late in the mornings, and will miss school for any trivial reason. A number of the parents are too easy-going in this respect, and where the child rules the home, it is difficult to compel regular attendance. I believe Mr. Gibney could do more to impress upon the parents the importance of their children attending school. Dr. Murray, the Agent, is very strong on regular attendance: I have heard him lecture parents when we found a child at home without reason, and in some cases the child left for school there and then.\n\nI was not favourably impressed with the condition of the classroom generally on either of my visits: It was not tidy; I doubt if the floor had been swept recently; there were books here and there on unoccupied desks and elsewhere. His own (the teacher's) desk was loaded, pell-mell, with this and that. When I asked him for his quarterly returns and old registers, he did not know where to find them. The whole place was dusty; decorations on the walls needed to be straightened. I\nI drew this to Mr. Gibney's attention before leaving, and saw that he felt embarrassed, and said he would attend to same at once.\n\nClasses are held in the hospital building (formerly a residential school) in one of the dormitories on the second floor. Entrance to this classroom is from an inside door at the head of the staircase. This room is long and narrow -- 36' x 16' -- with 14-foot ceiling. The length of the room runs North and South, and there are three fair-sized windows at each end. The South end has also an outside door leading to a closed-in verandah, the upper two-thirds of which is glassed in (sun-room). The lighting is not the best -- I would call it \"cross-light.\" Artificial light (electric) is used on dull days.\n\nThe pupils' seats -- 30 in number -- four rows deep, are arranged to face the East wall and blackboards. The west wall, behind the pupils, is a blind one, with a door leading to the staircase and entrance. The teacher's desk faces that of the pupils. However, owing to the length -- probably I should say width -- of the seating arrangements (36 feet) it is difficult for the teacher to supervise (watch) the pupils who occupy the end seats. This is no doubt one of the reasons why Mr. J.A. Macgregor, Provincial School Inspector, reported that the discipline in this school came under the column \"low\" in his report dated November 7th, 1940. I agree with him that the room is not suitable for the purpose.\nWe have here a school house with a classroom proper. This is a good, substantial building, located a few feet from the hospital building, and connected thereto by the basement. It is not being used. The reason, I am told, is that having no heating system (furnace) of its own, heat was provided from the hospital steam-heating plant, the operating of which is quite costly (expensive) when having to supply heat to the separate school house, which has four outside walls.\n\nThis separate school house has a basement, with concrete walls and floor, and a full-length brick chimney from the basement. If a proper sized -- fairly large -- hot air furnace were installed, I believe this building could be made very comfortable, provided both outside doors are kept properly closed. The teacher, who should be given full charge and responsibility for the heating -- lighting fires and controlling them -- would see that these doors were kept closed.\n\nIf it is decided to again make use of this classroom, the interior will have to be redecorated. Provision will also have to be made for outside toilets. At the present time the facilities (water works) which adjoin the classroom (old dormitory) in the hospital building, are being used.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. Pant.

This would certainly make a difference in the income tax but Mr. Gibney has neglected to supply us with copies of form T.D. 1 and the cost-of-living bonus form as required by Order-in-Council. Consequently, as noted above, he is assessed for income tax purposes as a married man with no dependents. I enclose copies of form T.D. 1 and the cost-of-living bonus form which Mr. Gibney should complete and return to us as soon as possible, when we will endeavour to adjust the matter. In the space provided for signature by a Justice of the Peace it will be sufficient if Mr. Gibney secures the signature of his Indian Agent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. T.B.R.

I was called to attend Reverend Gibney but in spite of immediate response he had expired before I arrived. His death was evidently due to Coronary disease.\n\n[Signature]\nH. T.

We have been taking steps to find someone who can be nominated for the position but it will doubtless take a little time to succeed in this effort. As the School should re-open on September 1st, it has been suggested that Mrs. Gibney might undertake the duties for a month at least.

I may say frankly that the various difficulties in connection with this work have been more than distressing to us. We confidently expected the Rev. L.F. Rowe to be on the ground before this, and as a matter of fact he has been able to visit the Reserve, and we have been spending a good deal of money in repairing the residence for his occupation. It was most unfortunate that Mrs. Gibney should suffer her breakdown in health when she did. As I understand that Miss Tims had taken charge of the school until word came to close it, and as we know her to be a former teacher who has retained her connection in assisting her father in conducting the services, we felt it would be a happy arrangement if she could carry on for the time being. I note that your regulations make it more satisfactory that this appointment should run for a month, and I am notifying the various parties concerned accordingly. I may say that Mr. Rowe experienced some difficulty in being released from his present field, but we anticipate that he will be able to make the change during the present month.\n\nAgain thanking you, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa,\nNovember 26, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Sarcee Indian Day School\nNo. 701\n\nIn my memorandum of October 15, I advised you of the appointment of Rev.

Murray, Indian Agent\nSarcee Reserve, Calgary.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am sorry that in the pressure of much going and coming I have omitted to advise you of the arrangements made with Miss Winnifred Tims to carry on the teaching at your day school during the illness of Rev. L. F. Rowe. When we were told that Mr. Rowe was in hospital, it was also suggested that he was worrying a good deal about the children and was most anxious that school should be carried on until the Christmas holidays. We immediately telegraphed Miss Tims, who had kindly assisted us in the interval which occurred before Mr. Rowe arrived. We felt that she knew the school intimately and could carry on for a week or two more readily than a complete stranger. We did not think at the moment that it was necessary to advise the Department as we regarded Mr. Rowe as on sick leave and Miss Tims merely going as a substitute.\n\nIn the matter of remuneration, we hope that Mr. Rowe will continue to receive his cheque from the Department, and we\u2014and our Commission will be responsible for paying Miss Tims for the time she is able to render this assistance.\n\nTrusting that this will be satisfactory and regretting the delay in advising you,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHAA/IMA Secretary.\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines and Resources\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttention: Mr. R.A. Hoey.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe: Sarcee Day School.\n\nI beg to refer to my conversation at the time of my recent visit to Ottawa, and now beg to enclose copy of my letter to the Indian agent, Dr. Murray. I may explain that Mr. Rowe has had a serious attack of pneumonia, and is still confined to the hospital in Calgary. He is a most conscientious man, and we believe it would hasten his progress if his mind could be relieved in regard to the continuance of the school. Miss Tims is able to use her own car and go out to the school daily, as she has to look after her aged parents. She taught in the old residential school and is well known to the Indians and her services are always appreciated.\n\nI gather that a new nurse has been appointed to the hospital and that the building is likely to be put to fuller use for medical purposes as a result. I trust that consideration may be given at the right moment to our suggestion that the day school should be established at a more central point on the reserve, so that it may secure a larger attendance of pupils than appears to have been possible up to date.\n\nThanking you, and with kind regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH. A. Alderwood\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, December 18, 1944.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, regarding the Saree Indian Day School.\n\nFor your information I may say that Inspector Schmidt wrote us on November 14, advising us of Mr. Rowe's illness and recommending the employment of Miss Tims as substitute teacher. We approved this arrangement in a letter dated November 20 and consequently, as far as we know, the school is operating.\n\nAt the present time we are developing a plan for post-war reconstruction of buildings required in connection with Indian work throughout Canada. It is our intention to include in this list the necessity for a new school at a more central point on the Saree Reserve.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nActing Director.\n\nRev. H. A. Alderwood, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nIndian & Native Residential School Commission, M.M.C.C.,\n36-45 The Bible House,\n164 Alexander Avenue East,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nDec. 18/44\nOttawa, January 26, 1945.\n\nDr. Thos. P. Murray, Indian Agent, Calgary, Alberta\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of November 18, 1944, addressed to Inspector Schmidt, which he forwarded to this office, regarding the illness of the Reverend L. F. Rowe, teacher at the Sarcee Indian Day School. We subsequently received a medical certificate to the effect that Mr. Rowe would be absent from December 5 to December 15. We have not yet been advised if Mr. Rowe returned to duty and, if so, on what date.\n\nIt is our usual custom to allow one month's leave of absence with pay in the case of serious illness of a teacher. The period covered by your medical certificate would be slightly more than this, but we sent Mr. Rowe his cheque for December. We are withholding the January payment until we have definite information from you.\n\nIn the event that Mr. Rowe has returned to duty, you should let me know the exact length of time during which Miss Tims taught the school, in order that we may pay her.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSarcee Agency, Calgary.\nJanuary 30th, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWith reference your letter No. 120-1-1 of the 26th inst., regarding Reverend L.F. Rowe, teacher of the Sarcee Indian Day School. I beg to state that he is still unable to resume his teaching duties. Miss W.A. Tims has been teaching our school from November 14th to the present date, inclusive and has been paid by the Anglican Missionary Society of Winnipeg up to January 15th. Reverend L.F. Rowe advises me that he may resume his teaching duties within the next week.\n\n[Signature]\nH. T. Murray\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 3, 1945.\n\nEx'D.\n\nRepresentative of the Treasury.\n\nRe: Sarcee Indian Day School, No. 701.\n\nThe January salary for the teacher of this school was held until we had made some inquiries. It is now in order to release this cheque and forward same to the teacher.\n\nThe February cheque should not be sent until you hear further from this Branch.\n\nFor Deputy Minister.\nSarcee Day School,\nSarcee Reserve,\nP.O. Box 129,\nCalgary.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Training and Welfare,\nIndian Affairs Branch of\nMines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nEarly in the New Year when the School Returns were sent to the Agent here we also sent a very much needed Requisition for supplies needed during current term.\n\nSo far nothing has arrived and I am at considerable expense personally buying supplies we are short of.\n\nWould you kindly look into this matter and find out if the Requisition has arrived at the Department and if so why no action has been taken.\n\nI realize we should only make the Requisition once yearly in May. However I came here to Sarcee and only time teaches one how much to order. Last year I ordered sufficient for each Pupil to have about three writing books, while I find they can use up six. Other things on the Requisition are in accord with the requirements made by the Alberta School Inspector, to bring our standard up to the Provincial System.\n\nThanking you in anticipation of some action,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nLeonard H.

Rowe and the employment of Miss W.A. Tims as substitute, I beg to state that Mr. Rowe was not well enough to resume his teaching duties on December 15th, 1944. Reverend Mr. Rowe finally resumed his teaching duties on March 1st, 1945. Miss W.A. Tims was the substitute teacher from November 14th, 1944 to February 28th, 1945.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith, in quadruplicate, Mr. Rowe's application for leave of absence for the period December 15th, 1944 to March 1st, 1945. I have personally forwarded the Physician's certificate of inability to perform duties in Mr. Rowe's case directly to his Physician Dr. H.A. Gibson, 216-6th Ave. W., Calgary, Alta. I have requested Dr. Gibson to let me have these certificates at his earliest convenience. Immediately upon receipt of these Medical certificates I will forward them to your office.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nCOPY: for your information, please.

Sarcee Indian Day School, No. 701.\n\nIn my memorandum of February 3 I requested that the February cheque for the teacher should be withheld. I am now advised that Mr. Rowe resumed teaching duties on March 1, 1945, and consequently salary should be paid to him from that date.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nMay I again trouble you in regard to the salary of Rev. L.F. Rowe about which you wrote to us last on May 10th. We had thought that this matter was completely settled at that time but have recently discovered that one monthly cheque does not appear to have been received. We took the matter up with the Comptroller of the Treasury and have a reply dated September 25th admitting that no salary was paid for the month of February 1945 and claiming that this was not issued by reason of request from the Department.\n\nOur records are clear that we are still short of one payment of $113.42 and I shall be grateful if you will verify this and instruct the Treasury to make the payment. You will recall that Mr. Rowe suffered a serious illness and was unable to conduct the school from November 6th 1944 until March 1st 1945. However, after the lapse of one week our Commission secured the services of Miss W. Tims and the school was efficiently maintained until Mr. Rowe was well again. As he was incurring very heavy hospital expenses it was our thought that he required his complete income throughout the period and there was no suggestion on our part that he should turn over the grant from the Department to his substitute. Miss Tims was paid directly by the Commission so that Mr. Rowe might be free from anxiety during his serious illness. It would appear, therefore, that at the present moment the Commission is short by the amount mentioned above.\n\nCommending this matter to your kind attention, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.A. Alderwood\nSecretary.\nOttawa, October 11, 1945.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, the Treasury Branch is being requested to issue cheque to Rev. L. F. Rowe for the month of February.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. H.A. Alderwood, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nIndian & Eskimo Residential School Commission, M.S.C.C.,\n28-48 The Bible House, 184 Alexander Ave. E.,\nOttawa, October 11, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Saxson Indian Day School, No. 701.\n\nIn my memorandum of May 24 I requested you to resume payments of salary to Mr. L. P. Ross, teacher of the above-mentioned school, from March 1, 1945. Recent information indicates that Mr. Ross resumed duties on February 1, 1945, and consequently salary is due him for the month of February last. I would appreciate it if you would issue and send a cheque to him.\n\nFor Deputy Minister.\nThe Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission\nof the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nADDRESS ALL COMMUNICATIONS TO THE SECRETARY OF THE COMMISSION\nREV. H. A. ALDERWOOD, D.D.\n\n36-43 The Bible House\n184 Alexander Ave. East\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDecember 19, 1945.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nFurther to my conversation with you in November I now beg to advise that we have completed arrangements to change the status of the Rev. L.F. Rowe who has hitherto acted as teacher and missionary on the above Reserve. Mr. Rowe will now act in a missionary capacity both among the Indians and in two adjoining white congregations. It is proposed that a Day School teacher shall be appointed and I now beg to recommend to you Miss Winifred Tims of Calgary. You will doubtless recall that Miss Tims taught this school when her father was in charge of the mission and she has assisted us on several occasions when there has been need. She has the reputation of being an excellent teacher and her heart is in the work among the Sarcees. I feel sure that this change will be for the benefit of the pupils and we have encouraged to learn that already this year the level of attendance has been very much higher, probably by reason of family allowances being paid.\n\nWe are fixing up a small church building to serve as a teacherage and if this appointment is confirmed by the Indian Affairs Branch Miss Tims will take up residence and commence her duties from the beginning of 1946. Mr. Rowe has advised us that there is something seriously wrong with the heating plant in the school building and I am writing to Mr. Phelan to urge that something should be done to correct this before a new teacher takes over the work. If Miss Tims should be the person it would be most difficult for her to carry on the work under the conditions reported to us.\n\nAwaiting your kind reply, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHAA:WS\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, 28th December, 1945.\n\nMr. Thos. F. Murray, M.D., Indian Agent, Calgary, Alta.\n\nWe are advised by the Secretary of the M.S.C.C. that Reverend L.F. Rowe is giving up duties as teacher of the Sarcee School at the end of the present month.\n\nWe have approved the appointment of Miss Winnifred Tims as teacher of this school, effective January 1, 1946. I enclose the necessary forms which you should have her complete and return to this office.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, 28th December, 1945.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 19th instant, it is noted that Reverend L.F. Rowe is giving up duties as teacher of the Sarese School.\n\nWe approve the appointment of Miss Winnifred Tims as teacher of this school, effective January 1, 1946, at a salary of $100.00 a teaching month, plus bonus.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\n\nReverend H.A.

Hoey, Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs I have recently returned from a visit to several of our schools I think it well to give you a few notes of what I found.\n\nIn Calgary I had the pleasure of conference with Acting Inspector Goodman. I had previously met him at Gleichen and am very happy about his appointment. He appeared to co-operate splendidly with Principal House and I believe their united efforts were largely responsible for the successful work done on that reserve.\n\nThe Sarcee Day School: There is a very unsatisfactory situation on this reserve and I trust that before long it may be remedied. I understand that the Medical Services are considering some change in regard to the former Residential School which has for some years been used for hospital purposes. Apparently it has been of very little value and has not justified the expenses of maintenance. For some time it has scarcely been used for hospital purposes and has largely been empty and idle. On the other hand, the Day School has taken a new lease of life under the capable and experienced leadership of Miss Winnifred Tims. Her heart is completely in her work and her long knowledge of these Indians and her undoubted skill as a teacher makes her a very valuable worker. I found her full of enthusiasm and very happy about the teacherage which our Commission has provided by making use of the former Parish Hall. She is, however, somewhat discouraged at the poor quarters provided for the school and the many difficulties under which it is carried on. Apparently the school has been sacrificed at almost every point to the hospital. The classroom cannot be made comfortable in cold weather and is really too cramped now that 30 children are on the roll. There are no playroom facilities except in the dusty furnace room underneath. The children are given very little playground as ashes from the hospital are freely dumped in the level space that should be used for the purpose. There are difficulties about stabling and pasturing the horses which bring many of the children to the school and almost at every point it would appear that the school has little privilege while the large building stands empty.\n\nMay I urge that consideration be given to closing down the hospital completely and using a greater part of the building to\nprovide an improved day school. The present classroom could then be used for manual training purposes and better accommodation for teaching be provided in the large building. The children already have their mid-day meal in the dining room and on this basis they could have adequate playrooms. It might be necessary to have the services of a caretaker and cook and possibly a married couple might be secured at small cost for this purpose. This would compare with the cost of four workers which has been met during past years for very little purpose. This suggestion may have points of difficulty that are not present to my mind but I urge it when the disposition of the building is being considered. Any impartial person would agree at once that the interests of the children are now being made secondary to the maintenance of a large building that is practically empty.\n\nSt. Paul's, Cardston: I spent several days in this splendid school and feel that it is worthy example of what a residential school should be. I attended the meeting of the Woman's Auxiliary in one of the homes and it was a revelation to hear this group of women conducting their business in excellent manner. These are the product of the school during the years and their present standards are most satisfying.\n\nThe chief difficulties our Principal has experienced lately concern the failure of many children to return after the summer vacation and also the vexed matter of whether or not they should be allowed to go home at other times. Apparently many of the absentees were eventually recovered but our Principal still feels that not enough pressure is placed on the parents to compel the attendance of their children. After the return of the children to their homes at such times as Christmas and Easter had been established, as is apparently the custom in a number of schools in southern Alberta, the Agent took a strong line in refusing to allow this. The parents were much concerned and have been inclined to turn their indignation against the Principal so that the school has been losing some of the good-will it has enjoyed. There are various angles to this question that I may be able to discuss with you shortly but it is my feeling that we shall have to concede the point to the parents although it often increases the work of our staff.\n\nSt. Cyprian's, Brocket: I was well satisfied with the excellent work being done by our new Principal, Rev. E.S.W. Cole. He and his wife are experienced in Indian work and were throwing themselves into their duties with great enthusiasm. It is encouraging to note that there is an increased population on this reserve and the prospects are that the school will be full to its capacity in the Fall. I took up with Agent McMillan the question of moving our Church Mission House from the village to the school site and he has doubtless referred this matter to you before this. Instead of building a new residence, as requisitioned by the previous Principal, it seemed a good plan to have this building moved to the school and established in a permanent way. It can serve at present for a Farm Instructor or other worker and may later be used by the Principal if the larger number of children expected makes it advisable to use his present quarters in the school.\nOld Sun School, Gleichen: I did not visit this school as I was there last February but Principal House decided to take a short holiday and accompany me to the Pacific Coast. His school gives us less trouble than any and we are well satisfied with what is being done there.\n\nSt. Michael's, Alert Bay: Mr. House and I visited this school together and it was helpful for him to compare notes with Principal Wickens. We had an excellent display of physical training by the cadets of the school, fully 100 of the older boys and girls giving every creditable display. I have never seen anything better than the marching and general bearing of these children. It is good to know that provision has been made for treating the outer brick work of this building, as the amount of rainfall has made this very necessary. It is much to be desired that the old school building shall be taken down and new classrooms constructed as I believe is planned. As it stands the building is a fire trap and is badly infested with rats.\n\nSt. Georges, Lytton: While we have no responsibility for this school Mr. House and I were anxious to see Principal Hives who is rather a lonely man in his present location. By stopping off between trains on the return journey, we spent eight hours at the school. It is truly a very efficient institution and we gained a very favorable impression of the business-like administration of the Principal. The state of the farm was a revelation and made us very envious as we recall the difficult conditions under which most of our school farms are operated. In the evening I had the opportunity of addressing the congregation at the Evening Service in the beautiful stone Church. It was a truly reverent and beautiful service and the singing of the children was delightful. Mr. House and I felt that the spirit of the school was in every way admirable and we were very glad to have had the opportunity of visiting it.\n\nI trust that these notes may have some interest and shall be specially grateful for any action you are able to take to place the Sarcee Day School on a better footing.\n\nWith kind regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.A. Elderwood\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, May 29, 1946.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Secretary of the M.S.C.G. has forwarded to us the attached account, which covers the cost of repairs made to the former parish hall which is now being used as a teacher's residence by the teacher, Miss Winnifred Tims. I presume this building is located on the reserve and the Department is disposed to pay the account. You might, therefore, attach it to proper voucher forms and return for payment.\n\nI attach, for your information, an extract from a letter received from Dr. H.A. Alderwood, Secretary of the M.S.C.G. I would appreciate it very much if you would let me have your comments on the attached extract, as soon as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nDr. T. F. Murray,\nIndian Agent,\nCalgary, Alberta.\nMiss Walton\n\nDr. Stone refers to a letter from Mr. Gordon in file 120-1-1 but I do not see it on file.\n\nWe have no record of a letter referred to.\nIndian Health Services Hospital,\nJesuit College, Edmonton, Alta.,\nAugust 5, 1946\n\nSuperintendent, Indian Health Services,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nCopy to Inspector of Indian Agencies, Calgary.\n\nSir,\n\nThis will refer to Mr. Gooderham's letter 120-1-1 of August 5, a copy of which I have here.\n\nI concur in all that Mr. Gooderham says about the future of medical and welfare services at the Sarcee Agency, and in particular about the use of the Agency house as a nursing and welfare station. It would seem that this house should provide comfortable quarters for a nurse and for a school-teacher and leave ample space for a few patients, especially maternity cases. The only qualification of Mr. Gooderham's remarks is that I think the downstairs bathroom, which would be used for patients, has no tub, only a toilet and wash basin. A tub could be installed and otherwise I think the building would require no alterations, even if it is not quite what would be built if one were starting from the beginning.\n\nI agree that the old \"hospital\" and schoolroom are useless, and that a new school should be built. I do not think any provision need be made for resident pupils, but there should be a kitchen where a noon meal could be made. To my mind it would be the better if the kitchen were arranged and equipped to resemble an Indian home kitchen rather than that of an institution. This, I think, should be a part of the school itself.\n\nAs for staff, it would seem that one nurse-welfare worker, one teacher and one maid should meet the need. These employees should not be nominated by any church. I see that Mr. Gooderham recommends a 2-room school. Probably he is right, and my comment in this para should read accordingly.\n\nThe provision of medical services is bound up with the future of such services at Morley, adequately covered by Mr. Gooderham's letter.\n\nE. L. Stone\nM.B.,\nMedical Superintendent, Alberta.\nMiss Walker\n\nThere is a letter in my possession which might be the one referred to.\n\nI recall that there was another letter referred to in this letter.\n\nMiss Walker\nOctober 2nd, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Falconer,\n\nWith reference to Dr. E.L. Stone's letter of August 5th in regard to the transfer of the Agency building, Sarcee Agency, to the Department of National Health and Welfare to be used as a Nursing Station, I discussed this matter today with Mr. Hoey who informed me that as Mr. Gooderham would be in Ottawa on or about October 15th, he would like to discuss the matter with him further before agreeing to the transfer.\n\nIt would, however, appear that we will not require the Agency house and that it can therefore be transferred to your Department. As soon as the matter is settled, you will probably wish to issue instructions to have the present hospital building demolished.\nOctober 1st, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nCol. Neary,\n\nIn case you are not aware of it I thought I would point out to you that on file 120-1-1 there is a letter from Dr. Stone pointing out that the old school house on the Sercee Reserve should be torn down and replaced by a two roomed school.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to file 9-120, letter of August 5th, 1946 from Inspector Gooderham recommending the erection of a new two roomed Day School with certain facilities and the tearing down of the present Day School.\n\nBoth Dr. Stone and Mr. Gooderham have recommended that the present Indian Agency residence be used as a Nursing Station and in Dr. Stone's letter he states that the house would provide comfortable quarters for a Nurse and a School Teacher and still leave ample space for a few patients.\n\nOn file hereunder you will note a memorandum to Dr. Falconer stating that Mr. Hoey is not prepared, until the matter is discussed with Mr. Gooderham, to make a definite decision but it would appear that we will not require an Indian Agent at this point and that the house can serve as a Nursing Station, and you may possibly wish to give consideration to the School Teacher sharing the quarters with the Nurse.\n\nM.

Watson of Dewinton, Alberta, was in this office today, seeking more information regarding an ad we ran in the Calgary Herald and Calgary Alberton. She has a Second Class Saskatchewan Certificate, and a Letter of Authority to teach in Alberta Schools. She has had 7 years of experience but no summer session qualifications. She is married to a quarter breed Cree Indian and is interested in a teaching position in an Indian School.\n\nWe have had several applicants, but she certainly made the best impression because she appeared to be genuinely interested in Indian work.\n\nDuring the past year she was teaching at Dewinton at a salary of $1682.00 per annum plus free teacherage, and while she is prepared to take a small cut in salary in order to get into Indian work, she is not prepared to go too far in this respect. Mrs. Watson has completed part of her studies for a First Class Certificate through home study. Would it be possible to take her on at $1500.00, that is $1800.00 plus five years at $60.00 per annum or $300.00?\n\nYour advice by airmail would be appreciated. Mrs. Watson is obligated to advise the School Board next week whether or not she intends to return to Dewinton for the next term. Mrs. Watson realizes that there will be other applications to be considered, but she wishes to know what salary she would receive if she were appointed.\n\nG. H.

B. F. Neary,\nSupt. Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Teacher - Sarcee Day School\n\nFurther to my letter of July 24, with applications attached.\n\nI am attaching application and copies of School Inspector's reports, on behalf of Mrs. D. P. Watson, De Winton, Alberta. It is understood from your telegram of the 28th, that Mrs. Watson could begin at $1500.00 per annum.\n\nI believe we would have a very capable teacher if Mrs. Watson were granted the position. She holds a Second Class Saskatchewan Certificate with a Letter of Authority to teach in Alberta, and is studying towards qualification for a First Class Certificate. Furthermore, she displayed a keen interest in this position from the welfare angle, which is more than can be said for some of the other applicants.\n\nAt the same time, Mrs. Watson's husband, who is a quarter breed Cree, and a Veteran of this war, is prepared to accept employment as Caretaker at the Sarcee Agency. This was discussed with Superintendent J. E. Pugh and Clerk-in-charge, Mr. M. MacLeod, and they concur. At present, only the temporary position at $60.00 per month can be offered Mr. Watson, but he might eventually work into the permanent position which would carry a higher salary. Mr. Watson would serve as janitor at the school, office, and nursing quarters and perform other relevant duties as required.\n\nThe accommodation problem would thus be overcome, as the teacher's residence would be occupied, and Sarcee Agency would have a teacher and a caretaker.\nI wish to make it clear that I am not recommending Mrs. Watson just to get a janitor in her husband. This was just an after thought, Mrs. Watson's qualifications having been considered well beforehand.\n\nMrs. Watson wishes to know as soon as possible whether her application is accepted. She is not applying for another school and is quite prepared to go to Sarcee, after having visited the Agency yesterday.\n\nYour air mailed reply would be appreciated, as we cannot keep her waiting indefinitely. Teachers are very much in demand here, as you are no doubt aware.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nOttawa, August 5, 1947.\n\nDear Mrs. Blaine:\n\nWe have received your application for employment at the Sarcee Indian Day School. We have accepted the application of another teacher with six years' experience and therefore this position is no longer open.\n\nHowever, we are about to begin construction of two new day schools in the Edmonton Agency. If you are interested in the position of teacher at either of these two schools, I would suggest that you contact Inspector G. H. Gooderham, in Calgary, for further details.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMrs. Margaret Blaine,\nR. R.

Neary,\nSuperintendent, Welfare and Training\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary -\n\nI regret very much that I did not have the chance to talk with you when we were in Ottawa last April. That was entirely because I had a very limited leave from my job. I had intended to be East again this summer but circumstances have ruled that out also.\n\nThe matters to which I shall here refer, I have many times discussed with Mr. Gooderham, Inspector of Agencies and with Mr. Hoey. They have also been referred to, in our Brief to the Joint Committee.\n\nWe have understood, from what we have been told, that the old building, formerly a residential school and later a most unsatisfactory hospital, at the Sarcee Reserve was to be torn down, the materials salvaged, and a new day school built nearer the center of population on this reserve.\n\nOur Association appreciates the difficulties of the Indian Affairs Branch but we also are here on the spot and appreciate the difficulties these small children have in attending a school which is at least five miles from many of their homes. You must be aware that, under the School Act of this province, children cannot be compelled to attend a school more than three miles by surveyed road from their homes.\n\nWinter in Alberta is a dread prospect. Would you, sir, condemn or encourage your children to ride, drive or walk five miles over a reserve in an Alberta winter to attend school? In addition, they must carry a cold lunch.\n\nThat is not conducive to anything except discouragement and is certainly not in accord with any principle of reasonably modern education.\n\nAfter 27 years of teaching, I feel that I do speak with some knowledge of the child and its problems.\n\nThe Sarcees are a fine people and anxious to make up the lost years which maladministration in the past brought to their reserve.\nTwo weeks ago the Sarcee Band winter and summer schools were opened under the present administration. While the Department of Indian Affairs Board has been unable to provide means by which these schools can be operated, it has been quite possible to keep them in operation. It is now proposed to take advantage of the fact that the schools are now open and have long been closed. As a result of frequent visits to the school by Miss Basile, Roman Catholic missionary at Goodfellow, we believe that all of those who have attended the school will fall for the Catholic faith.\n\nThe Department of Pigeon Lake has been unable to offer us everything that we offer our students. We regret that we have given up the opportunity of bringing our students into Boarding School.\n\nWe believe that ALL students should be living with their families.\n\nCrescent School wishes success to its students and seniors.\nAugust 2, 1947\n\nColonel B.F. Neary,\nSuperintendent, Welfare and Training\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary -\n\nI regret very much that I did not have the chance\nto talk with you when we were in Ottawa last April.\nThat was entirely because I had a very limited leave from\nmy job. I had intended to be back again this summer\nbut circumstances have ruled that out also.\n\nThe matters to which I shall here refer, I\nhave many times discussed with Mr. Gooderham, Inspector\nof Agencies and with Mr. Hoey.

The Sarcee children are forced to face another winter and the long journey with its hazards to the present day school.\n\nWhy this delay? We believe that the Indian Affairs Branch is in full possession of these facts and has been for a long time. Is there no possible means by which this change could be accelerated?\n\nFrom past experience I should say that it is quite possible to have a new day school built and in operation by January 1, 1948 - if immediate action be taken on the matter.\n\nWe appreciate very much the prospect of day schools at Stoney Plain Reserve and at Michel's. They have long been sorely needed.\n\nAs I wrote Mr. Hoey sometime ago, and have frequently brought to Mr. Gooderham's attention the need at Sarcee, Alexander, Goodfish Lake (Pakana) and Saddle Lake is even more urgent than ever.\n\nWe believe that Mr. Gooderham has brought this to your attention. With two teachers available, Miss Baskwayak at Saddle Lake, for the children of the Roman Catholic faith, and Mr. Otapluew for those at Goodfish Lake, with the possibility of Mrs. Thackery for the Protestant children at Saddle Lake, of all of which you are no doubt aware, may we hope that some accommodation will be provided early this fall for those children?\n\nWe are sorry that the efforts to get the children of Pigeon Lake into a white school have failed temporarily but we appreciate that the Indian Affairs Branch has done everything possible at the moment. That the very generous offer was refused by the Divisional Board in that area is regrettable but no fault of the Branch. We have not given up hope but will concentrate some effort upon bringing about a change of heart in that Divisional Board.\n\nMay I say that I am very happy to state that ALLAN T. FETHERS (Tailfeathers) who has been living with me for the past three years and attending Crescent Heights High School in this city has successfully completed his High School Diploma and Senior Matriculation this year. I think Mr.\nHoey may be interested. He may also be interested that Allan's brother, Gerald, is now head sign writer at the Hudson's Bay Co. store here. Gerald has also recently completed a series of cartoons for the Managers' Dining Room at that store for which he was quite well paid in addition to his regular salary. I feel that Gerald has already justified the expenditure that the Indian Affairs Branch made on his behalf.\n\nHowever, I may also say in all truth that the grant of $165 per annum made to Allan just paid his tuition fees and his books. However, I am glad he has matriculated and justified our expectations. Whether he can go to University is still to be considered.\n\nI am sorry this is a rather disconnected letter, dealing with several subjects. I hope I may have some good news in reply.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJohn Laurie.\nHoey may be interested.

I had hoped you would drop in to my office during your visit here in April. Then we could have discussed the educational points raised in your brief.\n\nWe included sums for two schools in Alberta in our 1947-48 estimates. These were for the schools now awaiting contract approval at Saddle Lake and Michel.\n\nWe definitely intend to include a sum for the construction of a new school at Sarcee in our 1948-49 estimates. I had lunch with the young Chief, David Crowchild, and assured him we would try to get money for its construction next summer.\n\nWe have already written to the United Church concerning the building at Goodfish Lake. It is to be hoped that they will be agreeable to its rental.\n\nThe experience at Pigeon Lake is similar to that which we have encountered elsewhere.\n\nTwenty-five years ago we operated a number of day schools in the province of Alberta. At the request of Indians, churches, field officials and teachers and because of very poor attendance, we erected residential schools and closed the day schools. Now, the pendulum seems to have swung decidedly in the other direction and we are besieged with requests to open day schools.\n\n....... I will\nI will pass the good news concerning the Feathers brothers to Mr. Hoey, as I feel certain that he will be interested. Is there any possibility of Allan considering going to normal school and becoming a teacher? We are so short of good teachers for our schools and feel that we should carefully select young Indians for training for these positions. However, you will be able to discuss this possibility with him and advise me later.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard E.

The teacher (Mrs. Watson) was also consulted. Later I attended a meeting of the Chief and Council together with heads of large families and got their reactions to various sites proposed on a map. Afterwards, with Mr. McLeod and the Chief, I explored the ground by \"Jeep\" - cars are not much use in the reserve and Indian children usually ride horses.\n\nAs the patrons of the school are practically unanimous for a \"community-centered\" school, the site finally chosen and marked with a small pile of stones lies about one hundred yards west of a pump recently installed about a quarter of a mile north of NIGHT village, with MANY HOUSES village to the northwest and STARLIGHT village a little farther to the north. On the Army map of Camp Sarcee this would be map point 044324. This puts the school about three miles northwest of the present school. The trend of settlement and new houses will be to the northwest.\n\nThe surrounding land is fairly flat, and slopes gently to the west and south. Water appears to be available, and\nelectricity is not more than two miles away. Several trails approach the site.\n\n2 SIZE: There are presently forty pupils enrolled. In good weather attendance averaged 29; some children coming over six miles. Four pupils attend a nearer Alberta school.\n\nBased on a study of Family Allowance payments, it is clear that there are now 46 eligible pupils. For the next seven years the figures will be:\n\n50, 51, 51, 56, 57, 62, 58\n\nAs the Alberta curriculum puts the emphasis on organization to complete Grade 9, and the Indians wish their children to be given the chance to go further, the resulting combination of numbers of pupils and grades indicates the necessity for a two-room school.\n\nA full basement for various purposes is necessary.\n\nA horse shelter is also a requirement.\n\nQuarters for two teachers should have to be provided.\n\nC.A.J.

I concur entirely with what he has to say. The location is central, but cannot at the present time be served with any modern facilities. The Indians realize that fact. It is to be noted, however, that the site picked for the school is only a couple of miles from a power line, and that a road can be easily made between the school and the main highway.\n\nThe old school is situated at the Agency and should not be used if a new school is erected. Furthermore, it could not be used in conjunction with a new school so it would supply the pupilage in all grades. There is therefore no alternative but to erect a two-room school at the new site, if we are prepared to give the proper educational facilities.\n\nMrs. Watson, the present teacher, was well recommended. She is doing a splendid job with these Indians and would be prepared to stay as one of the teachers, but states definitely that she may not remain if only a one-room school is erected. She is conscientious, and realizes not only would the work be very heavy, but would not be satisfactory.\n\nI sincerely hope that arrangements can be made to put up a two-room school as the extra cost would not be great. This should be given immediate consideration so that no time will be lost in calling for tenders and starting erection.\n\nIt is to be added that Mr. Laurie of the Indian Association is very familiar with the reserve and the school situation. I know he agrees that the proper site has been chosen, and I am sure that he will ask, on behalf of the Indians, for a two-room school.\n\nMr. Clark and I conferred at some length before we agreed to submit our findings jointly.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nAirmail\nJune 2, 1948.\n\nMr. G. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nSarcee Indian Day School.\n\nWe have had an opportunity of thoroughly studying the report submitted by Major Clark upon the site, size of school, etc., for the Sarcee Indians.\n\nWe are quite prepared to accept recommendations made with regard to the site and to erect a school near Point 03324 on the Army Map of Camp Sarcee.\n\nIt is presumed that this new site will be the main factor in increasing the size of the school. Our records here show that for the March quarter the Sarcee Day School attendance was only 15 and for the month of April it was only 17. Your statement with regard to the entire cost of a two-room school is rather misleading. We know, from cold, hard, practical experience, that a two-room school with attached quarters for two teachers will cost us between $25,000 and $30,000. Under separate cover, I am sending to you a plan of such a school. The specifications are exactly the same as for a one-room school. You have already received our letter describing the various ways under which our day schools are being built. Could we please be advised if it is your recommendation that this school be erected by day labour. In this instance the Department would buy the necessary materials and supply them to a foreman - carpenter for the erection of the building.\n\nThe other alternative is to start looking for a contractor who will undertake the erection of the school on a flat price basis.\n\nAs we have now closed the supplementary estimates, it will be necessary to transfer funds from one of the\n\n....... Other\nother school building programs in your inspectorate. In other words, we will have to raise the extra $14,000.00 by transferring the funds from one of the other day schools projected for your inspectorate this year. You can advise us as to which project this should be.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nCopy sent to Major C.A.F. CLARK, c/o Mr. Mr. E. S.

Fortunately, Major Clark arrived in Calgary on the 14th and I was glad to get his report on school sites in various places in the province, and particularly his repercussions at Nordegg, before we discussed the Sarcee situation.\n\nWe agreed that the Sarcee Indians should be served by a two-roomed school if they were to be given the proper attention, and now was the time to supply the facilities which would meet requirements possibly for all time. The question arose as to what group or body of Indians could do without a school for the time being, in order to release sufficient funds to build this two-roomed school at Sarcee.\n\nThe conclusion was that it must be the Nordegg group, where there will not likely be more than ten pupils for some time. However, we were loath to make any move or suggestion until we discussed it with John Laurie. I therefore called him in to confer with Mr. Clark and myself at this office yesterday.\n\nWe agreed that the Sarcee Indians should have a two-roomed school. To release sufficient funds to make up the difference in cost between the one and two-roomed school, it was felt that this can be done without creating a hardship to any other group of Indians, by changing the plan of school structure for the Nordegg Indians. Mr. Clark has had considerable experience in bush life and living and teaching in log schools, and so has Mr. Laurie. In fact, Mr. Laurie at one time lived in the Nordegg country. Both were in total agreement that log buildings for the school and teacherage would be most suitable at Nordegg, and can be erected at very much less cost than the school of your plan. It was further agreed by Mr. Laurie that the Nordegg Indians should not expect a school this year.\n\nEnclosed with this letter is a report from Major Clark with numerous pictures, and a proposed school for the Nordegg Indians. There is nothing more for me to say; his information is most complete and instructive.\n\nI did tell Messrs. Clark and Laurie that I was going to ask for an accountable cheque to cover the costs.\nof logs, digging of cellar and drilling of well, all of which should be done this year.\n\nI called Superintendent Pugh in and discussed this with him today, and he agreed that it would be good business to give the Indians work in getting out logs and possibly in digging the cellar, and even in doing some of the concrete work. It is estimated that the cost of getting out 300 logs, 30 to 40 ft. long, would be about $750.00. The drilling of a well, with material and labor, is estimated at $400.00. Excavation and certain concrete work is estimated at $850.00 to $1000.00.\n\nIf Mr. Pugh were given an accountable cheque for $2,000.00, we are of the opinion that practically everything that could be done this year towards the erection of a school and teacherage can be carried out in season, and the logs left to dry out for use in 1949. The Indians would earn the major part of this money.\n\nIn other words, I am asking that you authorize the erection of a two-roomed school at Sarcee, and give an accountable cheque of $2,000.00 for Nordegg this year. Our building program is going slowly, and it is my conjecture that you can release $2,000.00 and still keep it within your appropriation.\n\nIf you concur, please wire as Mr. Pugh is already conferring with builders regarding the erection of the school at Sarcee, and would make arrangements with his Assistant, Mr. Thomas, at Rocky Mountain House to start the Indians to work at Nordegg.\n\nG.

B. F.

Copies were sent to Superintendent Pugh and Assistant Agent MacLeod, Sarcee.\n\nDuring the Easter holidays we discussed the possibility of opening the new school at the beginning of the new term. Neither the furnishings for the residence nor the desks had arrived and it was decided that the school must be continued in the old building.\n\nMrs. Watson appealed to Mr. MacLeod for a second teacher to assist her and stated she was not physically capable of carrying on alone. We did not think we would be justified in inviting Mr. Fresley of Brandon to move now, as there was no accommodation for him and his wife and since there was only two months remaining in the school year.\n\nFortune, however, was with us I believe when Mr. W. Paul Smith, a young gentleman, whose home is in Calgary, indicated that he might be interested in taking on this work for a couple of months. This was on the 23rd when I wired you.\n\nHe interviewed me on the 25th and I was favourably impressed. He is now completing his third year of a four year course in the Faculty of Education, University of Alberta. He has taught three years in rural schools, holds permanent elementary and intermediate school certificates and also a permanent junior certificate for high school. He is single, age 23 and a Protestant, Nazarene denomination.\n\nAs he was writing his final examination in Edmonton today and had been offered a school at Lac La Biche, he had to be advised whether or not we wanted his services at Sarcee. We, therefore, went out to the Agency and inspected the present school and the new school. Mrs. Watson welcomed us and it was apparent that she might have a break-down if she did not have some assistance immediately.\n\nI, therefore, suggested that we open a second classroom in the existing school and make temporary arrangements for blackboards and seating capacity. It was also agreed that the school will be carried on here until all equipment for the new school has arrived and is set up in the school. Then it is to be opened with proper ceremony.\nApril 26th, 1949.\n\nMr. Smith is prepared to accept the wage of $168.00 per month as quoted in your wire. He will start teaching on the 2nd of May and, on his return from Edmonton this week, will confer with Mrs. Watson as to how they will divide the classes and the work. He is completing an application form and when received at this office, it will be forwarded to you.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nGHG:RM\nMay 5, 1949.\n\nMr. G.H.

I note that Mr. Smith began his teaching duties on May 2.\n\nIf any of the documents attached to this letter have already been completed, kindly have Mr. Smith complete only those which you have not sent to him.\n\nBernard F.

It contains forty-two names.\n\nMrs. Watson handles the first four grades in which there are thirty pupils enrolled. Sixteen were present.\n\nMr. Smith teaches Grades five and six in which twelve pupils are enrolled. Eight were present. Although the room in which this group works is in the basement, it was well-kept and the children seemed content to be there. Mr. Smith's enthusiasm in the classroom and on the playground is giving these children an impetus.\n\nMrs. Watson's room, on the contrary, was not at its best. I think she lacks the nervous force to maintain a daily minimum standard over a period of years. There was a suspicion of rationalization in her remark that she felt two years in one place is long enough. It would be well to obtain from her a written statement of her intentions for employment for next year. After June 20th most Alberta teachers are committed to return to their present schools.\n\nMr. Smith will likely go back to college in the Autumn.\n\nThe probability is that the new school will require new teachers.\n\nC.A.F.

This reversal of the usual bread-winning tradition cannot be the best sort of example on an Indian reserve.\n\nA second teacher may, of course, find an alternative boarding-house within three miles (with white families) when the projected road is completed.\n\nThe contractor has left on the premises a shed (which he wishes to sell or remove) formerly used for the storage of materials. This might be acquired by the Department and adapted for use as a stable for the children's horses so that these poor beasts are not exposed to the elements all day long.\n\nThe well-built outdoor toilets are equipped with buckets which will likely become a problem. It is suggested that winter temperatures make pits advisable.\n\nAlthough the classroom windows face north, the illumination yesterday (a fairly dull, overcast sky) was acceptable. It could be questionable on a dull day in December or January, but Alberta boasts more sunny days than other parts of Canada, and we might have to re-consider the orienting of schools there or extend the eaves in the Manitoba manner to eliminate summer glare.\n\nCopy to Regional Supervisor\n\"    Superintendent, Morley, Alta.\n\nC.A.F.

Williams, 1923 - 34th Ave. S.W., Calgary, Alta.\n\nIn regard to this voucher I wish to state that on May 2nd last Mr. W.P. Smith was employed as second teacher at the Sarcee Indian Day School, and the school was then divided into two class rooms, with Mr. Smith teaching the senior pupils in the basement room. Mrs. Watson was taken ill on Friday, May 20th, and on visiting the school on Monday, May 23rd, I found Mr. Williams teaching in Mrs. Watson's class room. Mr. Williams is a graduate of the University of Alberta, a friend of Mr. Smith, and living with him for the past month in the school teacherage where they are batching as they are both single men.\n\nI informed Mr. Williams that I had no authority to hire a substitute teacher but that I would forward a voucher for his services along to the Branch for their consideration, and if this action is approved I would be glad if this voucher could be passed for payment.\n\nMrs. Watson returned to duty on May 27th.\n\nM. MacLeod,\nAssistant Indian Agency.\nJune 10th, 1949.\n\nMr. J.E. Pugh,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nMorley, Alta.\n\nWe have your Voucher No. 112 requesting payment of $28.00 for G.R. Williams, acting as a substitute teacher at the Sarcee Indian Day School for May 23rd, 25th, 26th and 27th.\n\nMr. Smith should be informed very definitely that he has no authority to hire substitute teachers. He should have reported Mrs. Watson's absence to the Indian Superintendent and requested authority before engaging him.\n\nWe would like to know why Mr. Williams is living on the reserve. I feel that you should refer the matter to Regional Supervisor G.H. Gooderham with a view to obtaining his opinion on the whole matter.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nPP/ST Supt. of Indian Education\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA,\nOntario.\n\nIt is desired to acknowledge the receipt of Branch File No 701-5 (E.1), dated June 10th last, with reference to Sarcee Voucher No 112, in the amount of $28.00, in favour of Mr G.R. Williams, for services rendered as a substitute teacher at the Sarcee Indian Day School, for 4 days in May.\n\nIn reply it is advised Mr Williams, a University student, is living with Mr Smith, while the latter is acting as teacher at the above school, and as Mr Smith is a bachelor, and there being no board services available at Sarcee, the former looks after meals etc for Mr Smith. In this arrangement we could see no harm and was sanctioned by this office.\n\nWe believe that Mr Smith acted in good faith, when Mrs Watson was taken ill, and while he had no authority to hire a substitute teacher, it was felt that inasmuch as the Branch felt that Mrs Watson required assistance for the large number of pupils, and that two teachers were being employed, he, Mr Smith had Mr Williams assist him in his teaching duties in the absence of Mrs Watson.\n\nThis letter is passed to the Regional Supervisor, for his perusal and comments, with a copy to Assistant, Sarcee Indian Agency. Mr Smith will be advised of the instructions given by the Branch.\n\nJohn E. Pugh, Supt.\nStony - Sarcee Indian Agency.\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nI am attaching a letter written by Superintendent Pugh in answer to a letter signature of Mr. Phelan, in respect to a voucher in favor of a substitute school teacher at the Sarcee Indian day school.\n\nIf I had been asked to find a substitute for Mrs. Watson while she was ill and considered that it was necessary, I would have wired for authority. Mr. Pugh and his assistant did not do so but they did believe that it was necessary to have a substitute and assumed the responsibility of employing Mr. Williams. This young man will, therefore, look to somebody for payment. Should it be Mrs. Watson, Mr. Pugh, Mr. MacLeod or the Department?\n\nIt is known that School Boards and Superintendents of schools must at times be prepared to employ substitute teachers and the same condition is bound arise at our day schools. What is the policy when the teacher is ill at an Indian Day School? If it is the policy to employ a substitute teacher when it is necessary, then I believe some consideration should be given to the payment of this voucher.\n\nIt is very easy to come to a conclusion that Mr. Williams saw an opportunity to earn some money and that Mr. Smith impressed upon the Assistant Agent, the need of an assistant while Mrs. Watson was ill. However, as Mr. Pugh has stated, we have indicated that this school requires two teachers and we were, therefore, fortunate in having available the services of Mr. Williams. I don't think the Department of Indian Affairs should expect this young man to give his services for nothing, do you? I ask you to please consider this and in any event must ask, what is the policy in regard to the employment of substitute teachers; this must be known for future guidance.\n\nG. H.

It was simply written for the purpose of pointing out to Supt. Pugh that the Department should be consulted before such appointments are made.\n\nWhen making application for the payment of a substitute teacher you should state definite information regarding the substitute's qualifications.

Tims, teacher of the Sarcee Indian Day School, to be allowed to teach on public holidays and during Easter week until the end of June, next, such extra time to be credited to her for the month of September.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department does not approve of the school being conducted other than the regular teaching days, as it is considered that it would not be fair to the Indian children. In order, however, to facilitate the arrangements which the teacher proposes to make to visit Europe this coming summer, the Department will be prepared to allow her leave of absence with pay until the middle of October, provided arrangements can be made for a substitute teacher to carry on during her absence. The substitute can be paid as an assistant teacher. This arrangement is made in consideration of Miss Tims' faithful service, and is not to form a precedent for any future cases that may arise, as all such will be dealt with on their respective merits. The name, qualifications and experience of the substitute teacher engaged should be forwarded for the information of the Department.\n\nPlease inform Miss Tims and the local Indian Agent accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

M. Ross, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarcee Reserve,\nCalgary, Alta., N.W.T.\nCopy of Messrs. Child & Wilson's report on present school building & proposed accommodation for 30 or more children, Sarcee Reserve.\n\n\"Child & Wilson, Architects\nOffice of Town Engineer,\nCalgary, Alta., W.T.\nOct 12th, 1893.\n\nRe School Building\nSarcee Indian Reserve, Alta., W.T.\"\n\n\"Apart from instructions we have surveyed the above building and beg to report as follows:\nThis building was erected 7 years ago; it is built of logs with shingled roof inside. The internally, the walls & ceiling are lined with beaded tongue & grooved wainscoting.\nThe building is by no means proof against cold air, the windows frames are poor & out of repair, the chimney & between the logs is defective in many places & the logs themselves are full of snake, also the roof is not tight at the wall plates, consequently it is not surprising that the building prove to be very cold in winter. The bottom logs & cells are more or less rotten & decayed. The building is quite unsuitable for school purposes, being very low & having an 45 sq ft to each child's cubic capacity for only eight persons. This includes the small recess at end. The floor space of school room at 10 sq ft to each, would accommodate 32 persons, but the width of the building being only 16' 0\", this could not be readily or conveniently done. 16' 0\" is altogether too narrow for a school room & the capacity of the room...\"\nThe school-room is rather dark; the windows which are two in number, and consist of panes each of 10 x 12\" glass; they are on one side of the room. The tops of their sills are only 15\" above the floor, and consequently much useful light is lost, being obstructed by desks &c. We are given to understand that it is proposed with a view of enlarging this school-room, to build a log building similar in all respects to the building in question & adding it on to the same; this will prove to be a very costly & difficult undertaking; the country being very hilly.\n\nOn the other hand should the said building be pulled down instead, with a view of utilizing the old materials, we would point out that in stripping off the \"wainscoting\" on walls & ceiling, the tongues & grooves would be more or less split off and destroyed, thereby destroying the usefulness of same in a great measure. Whichever of these plans is adopted it will prove more costly and less satisfactory than making use of new materials for a new addition or enlargement; but whatever is done the roof of the present building should be raised to increased the cubic capacity to something like what it should be. This will also apply to any new addition.\n\nWe are of opinion that the most satisfactory plan, and the most economical to adopt, is to erect an entirely new building of lumber & concrete on stout foundations.\nConstruct same in accordance with the regulations of the department. Such a building to accommodate between 30 & 40 children would cost about $600; and perhaps a little less if part of the work was done by the staff on the Reserve.\n\nEnclosed is a rough sketch plan and section which will give an idea of what the present building is like.\n\nYour obedient servants\n\n(Sgd) Child & Wilson\n\nThe building has no ventilation whatever to speak of beyond a hole in the ceiling through which the air escapes into the roof to take its chance of escape through what chinks & cracks it may find.\n\nC.W.\nSt. Barnabas' Mission,\nSarcee Reserve.\n\nCalgary & W.T. 13th April 1894\n\nTo the Indian Agent:\nSarcee Reserve.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI reply to a letter from the Office of the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, addressed to yourself, a copy of which is before me. I beg to remark that my first communication with the Department on the subject of the need of larger accommodation for the children under our care, was through your office on or about the 25th September last. A few days later in a letter dated 2nd October 1893, addressed to the Indian Commissioner direct, I wrote (inter alia) as follows\u2014\u201cIn view of a larger number of children, I have made requisition through the Agent for the enlargement of the School building, and have suggested the use of the West Camp School house for the purpose.\u201d\n\nThis letter was duly acknowledged on the 6th of the same month, when I was informed that the Agent had been communicated with, and instructed in the matter. In consequence of this last communication, I thought the proper course would be for me to get the best advice on this matter I could, and therefore wrote immediately to Mr. Child & Wilson, of Calgary, who have been architects for most of the buildings on our four Reserves, and knew also the views of the Commissioner on the subject of ventilation, so I asked his advice as to the most economical and satisfactory course to pursue. Their original report dated 12th October 1893, was forwarded to the Department, through\nthrough your office, a copy of which, in case it has been utilized I now enclose. From this report it will be seen that the proposal at first made would not be at all satisfactory.\n\nBoth buildings\u2014viz., the one adjacent to the boarding school, and that still at the West Camp, are not large enough for our purposes. They are equal to one another in size and taken together cubi capacity for not more than sixteen children. We have already 25 children (17 boys and 8 girls) in our house, and expect at least 5 more before the end of the present fiscal year. We are willing and indeed anxious to do our utmost to curtail the cost of a new building, and if you are able to help in the way you kindly suggested in October last, I think there can be no doubt that a very suitable frame building can be erected for $600. A further perusal of the Architect's report will, I feel sure, show the wisdom of putting up a new building in the place of the patchwork plan first proposed. A building 20' x 30' ft. and a 16' foot ceiling will give the required accommodation I believe.

I have thought it advisable to obtain a medical report on this subject from the Government Doctor, which I enclose.\n\nIn course of conversations, the Doctor mentioned that Indian children needed a larger cubic capacity of air than white children.\n\nI hope the Commissioner will see his way to help us out of the difficulty we are in. We have received the children into our care and it would be worse than unpardonable to have to let them return to the camp life again, or to retain them without educating them. To crowd them into 2 buildings, in the way proposed, would be to run the risk of an epidemic.\n111131\n\nSt. Barnabas Mission\nSarcee Reserve\nCalgary, Alta.\n\n2 May 1894\n\nTo Hon.

The Agent has already been told by the Department direct that it has no funds at its disposal for the erection of the building that has been asked for, and consequently that if the removal of the school building from the western village to the site of the boarding school will not answer the requirement there only remains to make the best of the existing accommodation.\n\nHe was told, moreover, that if it were, under the circumstances, desirable to move the building referred to, he should report on the cost of so doing, and if this be not done promptly it may end in there being no funds left available for the purpose.\n\nNo more children should be taken than there is\n\nA.

This will come to Mr. Reed direct.\n\nI am sending this statement to forward as I think it will come better from you than if I had seen Mr. Reed upon the subject.\n\nI also thought so.

It is condemned as being quite unfit for the present use, being large enough for only 6 or 7 children.\n\nIt was suggested that the old camp school should be brought down once more use of the same way along with the present building. First of all the two schools together.\nas the Architect's Report below, will not be large enough for our present number, to say nothing of five more the two schools together would have only sufficient cubic feet of air for 15 children. Then again if the building were brought down, it could not be properly united with the present school so as to form one house, on account of the condition of the logs (see Architect's report) and if left as it now is, we should have two teachers, and twice as many for the purpose, nor do we see the wisdom of paying for an extra teacher in order to arrive the expense of a new building.\n\nDuring the past 4 weeks since the hot weather began, several of our children have been unwell, and some are unwell as I write this letter.\n\nIf they are to continue to attend school under present circumstances, I fear the consequences, and the Department must be prepared to meet them, and will not be able to disclaim a responsibility.\nof the facts. One of our children Brightfoot and his brother have been sick and one of the worst Medicine men and preserving of our people (Bobby Many Crowes) is carrying the considerable anxiety on the ground of ill health.\n\nPerhaps the correct course will be either to close the school or to send back to the camp at least half the children.\n\nI have to think of such a course and I am quite sure that all interested in the Indians would condemn severely any such retrograde movement, but I for my part, will certainly prefer to send them back to camp rather than run the risk of anything approaching an epidemic amongst them.\n\nIndians naturally require more fresh air than white people.\n\nI am, dear sir,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH. L. Gibson, Teacher\n\nPrincipal\n\nSt. Bernadine Home\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter No. 044 dated May 22nd inst., I beg to inform you that your letter of the 24th ultimo, only asked for a report on the cost of moving the West Camp School. However, if it was considered desirable to move it, as I did not consider the scheme of using the West Camp school building here practicable\u2014even if the material was on the ground\u2014and was supported in my views by the Rev. Principal Mr. Stocken and the Architects, Messrs. Child and Wilson\u2014I did not think it necessary to report on the cost of removal.\n\nThe West Camp School-house is a badly constructed building and made of poor timber; it could not be taken down and rebuilt so as to\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina.\n114951\n\nmake a building warm enough for a school house.\n\nThe cost of removal would only amount to extra rations, tea and tobacco.\n\nIf permitted I can make use of the material in the last Camp Schoolhouse about the Agency.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd.

It cost \u00a3506 and the Department increased the grant to \u00a3200. In 1893 the building was enlarged making the total cost \u00a31364.10, and the Dept made a further grant of \u00a3100.

Mr. Gibbon Stocken, referred to in one of them, and relating to increase of school class room accommodation, and in reply to say that there does not appear to be anything to add to what has already been communicated to you on the subject, viz., that there are no funds to provide the new building asked for, and therefore the best possible use must be made of the existing accommodation and available means for increasing it, and no more children than can be accommodated consistently with due regard to their health.\n\nMr. Stocken's remarks, that there has been plenty of time to have made provision in the Estimates, or that such can yet be made, or failing that that it is possible to use the miscellaneous grant, are noted, but it does not appear to have occurred to his mind that there is something more required than time in order to provide in the Estimates, and that is to make Estimates which must necessarily be limited, go over all Indian requirements to the best advantage, nor can he possibly be in a position to know how the miscellaneous vote stands, or offer any suggestion as\n\nA. R. Forget, Esq.,\nAsst Indian Commissioner,\nRegina.\nas to how it should be disposed of. There exists a strong disposition on the part of individuals to think that local requirements are all important, and to entirely lose sight of the claims and necessities of other places, and the Department's difficulty in meeting all, and in this connection it may be observed that if Mr. Stocken would represent his views through the Bishop of his Diocese, His Lordship, who knows what demands are being made, at any rate in his own Church, in other parts of the country, would be in a better position than himself to judge as to the reasonableness of his requests.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nfuture expenditure on the building.\n\nUnder these circumstances I trust your Lordship will excuse me for saying that it appears rather unfair of Mr. Stockton to ask the Dept. just at this time, when the funds at its disposal for the current year are nearly exhausted and when it is too late to add anything to the Estimates for the next fiscal year, to approve the cost on this building; and I regret to have to inform your Lordship that so far as can be seen at present, it does not appear likely that the Dept. will have funds available for the purpose.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour Lordship's obedient servant,\n88526.\n\nThe Right Reverend\nThe Bishop of Saskatchewan\n& Calgary\nBishop's Court\nCalgary\n\nOttawa 17 June 1894.\n\nMy Lord,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your lordship's letter of 29th ultimo enclosing one from the Rev. Mr. Gibbon Stocken regarding further assistance being given by the Department to the building fund of the Boys' store on the Sarcee Reserve, and in reply to inform you that when it was first proposed to erect this building, the Dept. promised a grant of assistance to the extent of $100, but as it was subsequently shown to have cost...\nfive hundred and sixty dollars.\n\nThe grant was increased to two hundred dollars.\n\nIn 1893 the building was enlarged at an additional cost of $558.10 and the Dept gave a further grant of $400, and since that time there has been apparently a further expenditure of $279.97, making the total cost $1593.17, of which the Dept has subscribed $600 and only $276.97 has been paid from church sources, leaving a balance of $716.22 still due.\n\nWhen the first grant was made it was on the understanding that the building was to cost double the amount thereof, and the Dept confidently expected that it would be met at least halfway in any future.\nfuture expenditure on the building.\n\nUnder these circum-\nstances I trust your lordship will excuse me for saying that it appears rather unfair of Mr. Stockton to ask the Dept. just at this time, when the funds at its disposal for the current year are nearly exhausted and when it is too late to add anything to the estimates for the next fiscal year, to assume the debt on this building; and I regret to have to inform your lordship that so far as can be seen at present, it does not appear likely that the Dept. will have funds available for the purpose.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour lordship's most obedient servant,\ngive me when you rec.\nsider what it shows the\nworld, & district,\nremember you thought\nof giving back from\nmine, they all voted\nJane\n\nvery much,\n\nElsie Herbert\n\nCalgary\n\nHarper Red Top\nDeputy Chief-Indian\nIndian Department\nJune 1854\n\nMy dear Mr. Reid,\n\nAs the application sent by Mr. W.

Mr. Stokker and forwarded under cover of your lordship's letter of the 9th May last. Next there is a balance of $716.00 still due on the Boys' building to Pegg, thanks be to Almighty God.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\npoorly be as well to apply\nto that towards paying the\noutstanding debts or losses you\nagree to his suggestion in the\nDept the Dept will be ready\npay stockists to the amount of\n$653-00 upon receipt of proper\ncertified vouchers for the same\namount that by this arrangement\nthe stockers will be relieved\nfrom present financial\ndifficulties in connection\nwith Baraboo Farms.\n\nMay add that this is all\nthat the Dept will be able\nto contribute toward their\nhopes and that no further\nfunds can be made for\noutstanding checks or other\nsupplements to current funds.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, July 14th, 1894.\n\nMy Lord,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 13th ultimo, I have the honour to inform your Lordship that notwithstanding the desire of the Department to aid Mr. Stocken in the matter of the Boys' Home at the Sarcee Reserve it is feared that the available funds at its disposal will not enable it to do so.\n\nWhen writing to you on the 13th ultimo, I had not forgotten our conversation on this subject but at the time it took place I was not in possession of the facts as regards the previous expenditure on the buildings.\n\nIt would now appear from a statement submitted by Mr. Stocken that the Department has expended $600.00 against $270.67 contributed from other sources, whereas it was fully understood by the Department that such contributions were to, at least, equal the Department's expenditure.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nYour Lordship's obedient servant\n\nThe Right Reverend\nThe Bishop of Saskatchewan Deputy Supt., General\nand Calgary, of Indian Affairs.\n\nBishop's Court,\nCalgary,\nN.W.T.\nMy dear Mr. Reed,\n\nAs the application sent by Mr. W.G. Stoddart was made at your own suggestion and I am instructed to read what you say in your letter.\n\nThe application seems to have been well received. In our conversation, I thought not to have thought anything of it, but I was very grateful for the encouragement you\ngive me when you rec.\nsider that it should be\nmade, & distinctly\nremember you thought\nof giving back from\nvarious, already voted\nJane\n\nvery sincerely\n\nEthelbert Edmon\n\nHarper Red Top\nDeputy Chief-Special\nIndian Department\n88526.\n\nThe Right Reverend\nThe Bishop of Saskatchewan &\nCalgary\nBishop's Court\nCalgary\n\nOttawa 17 June 1894.\n\nMy Lord,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your Lordship's letter of 29th ultimo enclosing one from Mr. H. W. McLeod, Stockton regarding further assistance being given by the Department to the building fund of the Boys' Home on the Sarcee Reserve, and in reply to inform you that when it was first proposed to erect this building, the Dept. promised a grant of assistance to the extent of $100, but as it was subsequently shown to have cost...\nfive hundred and sixty dollars.\n\nThe grant was increased to two hundred dollars.\n\nIn 1893 the building was enlarged at an additional cost of $558.10 and the Dept gave a further grant of $400, and since that time there has been apparently a further expenditure of $279.97, making the total cost $1593.07, of which the Dept has subscribed $600 and only $276.87 has been paid from church sources, leaving a balance of $716.37 still due.\n\nWhen the first grant was made it was on the understanding that building was to cost double the amount thereof, and the Dept confidently expected that it would be met at least halfway in any future.\nfuture expenditure on the building.\n\nUnder these circum-\nstances I trust your lordship will excuse me for saying that it appears rather unfair of Mr. Stockton to ask the Dept. just at this time, when the funds at its disposal for the current year are nearly exhausted and when it is too late to add anything to the estimates for the next fiscal year, to assume the debt on this building; and I regret to have to inform your lordship that so far as can be seen at present, it does not appear likely that the Dept. will have funds available for the purpose.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour lordship's obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, June 11th, 1894.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of copy of two letters, dated 29th ultimo, from Mr. Agent Lucas, and of communication from Rev. Mr. Gibbon Stocken, referred to in one of them, and relating to increase of school class room accommodation, and in reply to say that there does not appear to be anything to add to what has already been communicated to you on the subject, viz., that there are no funds to provide the new building asked for, and therefore the best possible use must be made of the existing accommodation and available means for increasing it, and no more children taken than can be accommodated consistently with due regard to their health.\n\nMr. Stocken's remarks, that there has been plenty of time to have made provision in the Estimates, or that such can yet be made, or failing that that it is possible to use the miscellaneous grant, are noted, but it does not appear to have occurred to his mind that there is something more required than time in order to provide in the Estimates, and that is to make Estimates which must necessarily be limited, go over all Indian requirements to the best advantage, nor can he possibly be in a position to know how the miscellaneous vote stands, or offer any suggestion as\n\nA. R. Forget, Esq.,\nAsst Indian Commissioner,\nRegina.\nas to how it should be disposed of. There exists a strong disposition on the part of individuals to think that local requirements are all important, and to entirely lose sight of the claims and necessities of other places, and the Department's difficulty in meeting all, and in this connection it may be observed that if Mr. Stocken would represent his views through the Bishop of his Diocese, His Lordship, who knows what demands are being made, at any rate in his own Church, in other parts of the country, would be in a better position than himself to judge as to the reasonableness of his requests.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nTo Deputy\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, 7th June 1894\n\nIn 1892, $100 was provided by the Dept. to assist in the building of the Boys' Home, Sarcee Reserve, on condition that the cost of the building was double that amount. It cost $506 and the Department increased the grant to $200. In 1893 the building was enlarged making the total cost $1364.10, and the Dept. made a further grant of $100. Since that time there appears to have been a further expenditure on it, making the cost now $1593.19. Of this the Dept. has paid $600.\n\nPaid from Church Sources $76.87 $76.87\n\nLeaving a balance due on the building - $716.32 which consists of unpaid apportionment for labour and material.\n\nThere are no funds available from current years vote.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nMemorandum\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nTo Deputy Minister\n\nOttawa, 7 June 1894\n\nPlan No.\n\nNo. 11496/1\n& 11495/2\n\n[Signature]\n\nImmediate\n\n[Signature]\nReferring to your letter No. 044 dated May 22nd inst., I beg to inform you that your letter of the 24th ultimo, only asked for a report on the cost of moving the West Camp School house, if it was considered desirable to move it. As I did not consider the scheme of using the West Camp school building here practicable - even if the material was on the ground and was supported in my views, by the Rev Principal Mr. Stocken and the Architects, Messrs. Child and Watson - I did not think it necessary to report on the cost of removal.\n\nThe West Camp School house is a badly constructed building and made of poor lumber, it could not be taken down and rebuilt, so as to make\n114951\n\nmake a building warm enough for a school house.\n\nThe cost of removal would only amount to extra issues of rations, tea and tobacco.\n\nIf permitted I can make use of the material in the first Camp Schoolhouse about the Agency.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd.

H. Gibbon-Wooden\n\nPrincipal\nSt. Barnabas Home\nas the Architect's Report below will not be large enough for our present number, in any building of five more the two schools together would have only sufficient cubic feet of air for 15 children. Then again if the building were brought down, it could not be properly united with the present school so as to form one house, the account of the condition of the logs (Architect's report) and if not so united, we should have two teachers, once leave no funds for the purpose, nor do we see the wisdom of paying for an extra teacher in order to arrive the expense of a new building.\n\nDuring the past weeks since the hot weather began, several of our children have been unwell, and some are worse as I write this letter. If they are to continue to attend school under present circumstances, I fear the consequences, and the Department must be prepared to meet them, and will not be able to disclaim a knowledge\ntoo late to secure a provision in the supplementary Estimates and failing that the miscellaneous grant has been used for this kind of object before can be so used again.\n\nThe position of affairs\n\nThe Department have been anxious for me to get into our Homes all the children on the Reserve, with the exception of possibly 5 girls all are in our Homes.\n\nCirculars are issued to guard against anything which might prejudice the health of the children, their weights, sizes, etc., are checked for.\n\nThe present school building is considered by (i) the Architects (ii) Government-Doctors (iii) myself. I believe the Government Inspector to say nothing of yourself or myself. It is considered as being quite unfit for the present use, being large enough for only 6 or 7 children.\n\nIt was suggested that the old church bell-tower should be brought down and made use of in some way along with the present building.

I have to thank you for your communication of the 2nd inst. with accompanying extracts of letter from the Indian Commissioner.\n\nI am most willing and ready desirous of carrying any unnecessary outlay on the part of the Department in reference to school accommodation here, but I am quite at a loss to see how the erection of a new building is to be arranged.\n\nThe Commissioners' suggestions as to the removal of the building at the further village to the Boarding School site, is of course quite possible, but apart from the consideration of the expense of such removal, and the destruction of the \"tingue\" or \"grouse\" on the ceiling, there is one serious difficulty.\ndifficultly to be met, and that is\nthat the two buildings would not\nbe large enough for even our present\nneeds, and I am afraid that any\nattempt to connect the two buildings\nby the removal of one, or part of one\nof the walls of the building already\nhere, would make the whole unsa-\nble.\n\nWe are approaching the summer\nmonths when as much ventilation\nand cubic capacity as possible are\nnecessary for the sake of the general\nhealth of the children. I have thought\nit advisable to obtain a medical\nreport on this subject from the\nGovernment Doctor while I lecture\n\nIn course of conversation, the\nDoctor mentioned that Indian\nchildren need a larger cubic\ncapacity of air than white children.\n\nI do hope the Commissioner\nwill see his way to help us out\nof the difficulty we are in. We have\nseveral children under our care\nand it would be worse than\nunfortunate to have to let them\nreturn to the camp life again, or\nto remove them without connecting\nthem.

I beg to remark that my first communication with the Department on the subject of the need of larger accommodation for the tuition of the children under our care, was through your office on or about the 25th September last. A few days later in a letter dated 2nd October 1893, addressed to the Indian Commissioner direct, I wrote (inter alia) as follows\u2014\u201cIn view of a larger number of children, I have made application through the Agent for the enlargement of the School building, and have suggested the use of the West Camp School house for the purpose.\u201d\n\nThis letter was duly acknowledged on the 6th of the same month, where I was informed that the Agent had been communicated with, and instructed in the matter. In consequence of this last communication, I thought the proper course would be for me to get the best advice on the matter I could, and therefore wrote immediately to Mr. Fred Wilson, of Calgary, who have been architect for much of the buildings on our four Reserves, & knew also the views of the Commissioner on the subject of ventilation as I asked his advice as to the most economical and satisfactory course to pursue. His original report dated 12th October 1893, was forwarded to the Department.\nthrough your office, a copy of which, I am sure it has been received by you earlier. From this report it will be seen that the proposal I had first made would not be at all satisfactory.\n\nBoth buildings\u2014viz., the one adjacent to the boarding school, and that still at the West Camp\u2014are not large enough for our purposes; they are equal in size and taken together, their capacity for not more than sixteen children. We have already 25 children (17 boys and 8 girls) in our house, and expect at least 5 more before the end of the present fiscal year. We are willing and indeed anxious to do our utmost to curtail the cost of a new building, and if you are able to help in the way you kindly suggested in October last, I think there can be no doubt that a very suitable frame building can be erected for $100. A further perusal of the Architect's report will, I feel sure, show the wisdom of putting up a new building in the place of the patched-up old building proposed. A building 20 ft. x 30 ft. and a 16 foot ceiling will give the required accommodation I believe. I shall be happy to furnish full particulars of a suitable structure if requested to do so.\n\nI am dear Sir,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH. W. Gibbon, Secretary\nCopy of Messrs. Child & Wilson's Report on present school building & proposed accommodation for 30 or more children, Sarcee Reserve.\n\n\"Child & Wilson, Architects\nOffice of Town Engineer,\nCalgary N.W.T.\nOct 12th 1893\n\nSchool Building\nSarcee Indian Reserve, Alta N.W.T.\"\n\nAccording to instructions we have surveyed the above building and beg to report as follows:\n\nThis building was erected 7 years ago; it is built of logs with shingled roof inside. The internally, the walls & ceiling are lined with beaded tongues & grooved wainscoting.\n\nThe building is by no means proof against cold air, the window frames are poor & out of repair, the chimney & between the logs is defective in many places & the logs themselves are full of snake, also the roof is not tight at the wall plates, consequently it is not surprising that the building proves to be very cold in winter. The bottom logs & cells are more or less rotten & decayed.\n\nThe building is quite unsuitable for school purposes, being very low & having an 45 sq ft each [child] cubic capacity for only eight persons. This includes the small recess at end. The floor space of school room at 100 sq ft to each would accommodate 32 persons, but the width of the building being only 16' 0\", this could not be readily or conveniently done. 16' 0\" is altogether too narrow for a school room & the capacity of the room is...\ndecreased by book-closet, store &c.\n\nThe school-room is rather dark; the windows which are two in number, and consist of panes each of 10 x 12\" glass; they are on one side of the room. The tops of their sills are only 15\" above the floor, and consequently much useful light is lost, being obstructed by desks &c. We are glad to understand that it is proposed with a view of enlarging this school-room, to build boldly from a distance of 5 miles a log building similar in all respects to the building in question & adding it on to the same. This will prove to be a very costly & difficult undertaking; the country being very stiff. On the other hand should the said building be pulled down instead, with a view of utilizing the old materials, we would point out that in stripping off the wainscoting on walls & ceiling, the tongues &c. of same would be more or less split off and destroyed, thereby destroying the usefulness of same in a great measure. Whichever of these plans is adopted it will prove more costly and less satisfactory than making use of new materials for a new addition or enlargement; but whatever is done the roof of the present building should be raised to increased the cubic capacity to something like what it should be. This will also apply to any new addition.\n\nWe are of opinion that the most satisfactory plan, and the most economical to adopt, is to erect an entirely new building of lumber with concrete or stone foundation.\nConstruct same in accordance with the regulations of the department. Such a building to accommodate between 30 & 40 children would cost about $600; and perhaps a little less if part of the work was done by the staff on the Reserve.\n\nEnclosed is a rough sketch plan and section which will give an idea of what the present building is like.\n\nYour obedient servants\n\n(signed) Child & Wilson\n\nThe building has no ventilation whatever to speak of beyond a hole in the ceiling through which the air escapes into the roof to take its chance of escape through what chinks & cracks it may find.\n\nCtd.\nConstruct same in accordance with the regulations of the department.
