It forgets that should it succeed in proving that the bulk of the Canadian, native and old-country residents are ripe for rebellion, it will be unable to arrest its course, and that its policy will only then have begun, when the reason of the widespread and intolerable discontent has been found. That with such an object the Main should publish and adopt the views of those who wish to saddle all who will not ever furnish the evidence of good faith\u2014to say nothing of accuracy\u2014which might be afforded by the addition of their names to their epistles, speaks badly for its own honesty. It is evident that the end repent having on such evidence tried to blight the reputation of a community in general and some individuals in particular. The Main probably deceived by the evidence of indiscreet and uneducated persons contained in M.G.'s letter, failed to inform itself that he, although giving his initials, lives in so great obscurity that suspicion of him as the author has never arisen, and that in consequence of his object, probably the only result obtained by those who strive to injure would be his imprisonment and the starvation of his family. While quite aware that he has made impositions against several, totally innocent people, and has let himself and others, generally speaking, into the hands of his supposed friends\u2014quite open to attack, we think that he should be allowed more rope to hang himself. Curiously enough as he conceals each letter, he forgets that while he does so, he makes the charges and then transfers them to the public. Even honest men must see that the open and forcible manner in which these warnings were given had the object of getting the danger removed and stamped out at once. That this belief with Government support is untrue. The few admissions which could only be published in our paper we have had since the articles referred to were written. If \"F.B.M.\" can, without exposing himself too far, better the Mets by convincing the small clique in power that he is right, let him do it; he has no resort to countering the intentions of some well-intentioned articles of ours into sympathy with them, we are sorry for their cause. The French officers of a dismounted company stationed here, have been found at Batcote when like the dispositions to those in relation\u2014commonly assisted by the volunteers to have endeavored to make the same assault on F.B.M.'s post, by uncovering evidence in advance. We expect to hear more of him before the trials are over, and that he will be found to be right, that while supporting the Government as far as possible, we have not shared the guilt of suppressing what we could uphold of a nature likely to erupt in the future.\n\nDISARMING SETTLERS\n\nAs far as can be ascertained from telegraphic despatches the intention of the Government is to proceed certainly to disarm the Territorial, and to disarm settlers therein. Full particulars of the proposed measure are not to hand as we write, but we learn indirectly that white settlers will be exempt from its operation\u2014this is the only certainty likely to carry out this proposal, and as opinion that the Government is taking a step best with difficulties upon every side. In the first place it is very questionable whether they can succeed in disarming the disloyal, any settler at all, unless they have previously succeeded in depriving the Indian of every weapon, not excluding their bows and arrows, or else have made arrangements to put them in the possession of the half-breeds, but to insure their keeping, at that interval. There certainly are many few localities the population of which is so distinctly loyal or rebel in tendency as to allow of the application of the measure, and with the half-breeds it seems to us that it will be impossible to provide a district and say that all its inhabitants should be disarmed. Of course on the face of it there would be an enormous injustice in attempting to disarm a considerable number of half-breeds while white settlers are exempted, because there are large numbers of the half-breeds who have proved themselves to be quite as loyal and trustworthy as the best of the white settlers, and very much more so than many of the Indians. Again supposing that by some means which at present are not apparent, some equitable distinction between loyal and disloyal could be arrived at, and that the latter would be able to search for and seize the arms of those regarded as unworthy? We ventured some time ago to call attention to the necessity of making what radical measures may be considered before the actual dispersal of the forces under Gen. Middleton's command. It certainly seems a curious policy to first remove the troops and then immediately initiate such measures as will allow all parties left behind to be free among a majority of the inhabitants of the Territories who, from certain indications intelligible to old settlers, may be said to be by no means so thoroughly disheartened as is asserted by people at a distance. Such columns to justify the suspicion that we would give utterance to alarmist views, but in the face of the tone adopted by those who were lately in open rebellion and manifestly sympathetic to a movement to a certain extent, we feel our duty to plainly and distinctly tell the Government that instead of exhausting conciliatory measures, it should attempt any of an irritating tendency, it must first consider what hope it has of effecting its purpose, to send another army such force as has already been drawn. It must be borne in mind that while only a handful of the settlers were engaged in the recent writhed business, so will all find that only a generous policy will enable the Government to depend upon their support again. Suppose this to be assured, the proposed force of a thousand police will have the work cut out on to prevent the organization of a second band of the leaders and Indians from having most serious consequences, so having made a suitably severe example of the ring leaders in the late outbreak, it will be necessary to keep the Indians in hydra, and instead of keeping up class or race prejudices, to trust to careful and kindly treatment in future. In place of attempting to disarm the half-breeds in any number it will be far better to organize an army of equally equipped rifle corps composed of both whites and half-breeds known to be loyal, and to hasten on railway communication, supposing that all the Indians and all the settlers are loyal as has been always open to organized disarmament, it would be very questionable as to whether it would be safe in a country of such vast extent and with so small a police force to trust that portion of the inhabitants to carry arms, unless when called out as volunteers to act under responsible authority. We trust that the Government will carefully consider these points before proceeding to undertake a measure which will involve such serious difficulties such as they probably have little idea of.\n\nDRY LUMBER.\n\nMOORE & MACDOWALL.\n\nWish to inform the Public that they have on hand and for sale a Half Million Feet of Dry Lumber consisting of Matched, Dressed and Undressed.\n\nDressed Flooring, $48\nUndressed do., 42\nDressed Siding, 48\nUndressed do., 42\nSheeting, 30\nCommon Lumber, 35\nDimension do., 40\n\n\"Over 17 feet extra.\"\n\nLath, 75 cts. per bundle.\n\nShingles, $6 50 per M.\n\nWe are prepared to Contract for Buildings as cheaply as any firm in Town.\n\nBuilders paying Cash or giving good security for LARGE Orders, will have a reduction made.\n\nMOORE & MACDOWALL\n\nSTEWART BROS., TRADERS, GENERAL MERCHANTS\n\nHave just received a large stock\n\nDRY GOODS AND GENERAL GROCERIES\n\nTeas, Tobaccos, Coffee, Oatmeal, Sugars, Canned Goods, Cat.

Irvine towards the Irving House. Why have we not some of our valiant fifteen and twenty-five ladies who are working for their lives, while the Mounted Police were walking around town with rifles and saber-arms? They did such good work that was done during the trouble. Why did the ladies of Prince Albert not show a charitable spirit by sending some of their surplus money to good use like their sisters in the East and the Old Country? Had they been there to help those suffering the sick and wounded, they would then be worthy of praise! I fail to see any good reason why the hardworking people of Prince Albert. He was here as a public servant, paid a large salary by the Government to do his duty, and I am sure he did well. We should mark by doing it too well. It is to be hoped the leading ladies will make better use of their money in future.\n\nYours truly,\n\nANOTHER WOMAN.\n\nDominion Parliament.\n\nOTTAWA, July 13.\u2014In the House today Sir John said that during recent negotiations would be opened with the Governors of Ontario, Quebec, and Quebec, in order to settle absolutely and forever what the boundaries between Manitoba and Ontario, Ontario and Keewatin, and between Ontario and the region lying to the north.

D. MAVETY, PUBLISHER AND PROPRIETOR\n\n3RD ST., PRINCE ALBERT, SASK.\n\nSHANNON & McLEOD\nTHE REBELLION.\n\n(Continued from Our Last.)\n\nWhile the right at Black Lake had carried the step up to the 20th of March, the left had made no advance of what had been going on at Prince Albert in the interval between that date and the departure of Col. Irwin.\n\nCarleton, although this should not be omitted, there was little of interest to the government at this juncture, very shortly. It has already been noted that a committee was appointed to make preparations for the defense of the town, and that instructions had been given to Col. Sprattwood to take charge of the volunteers, while Inspector Moffat would remain at Carleton to keep in touch with Goschen. The measures adopted for defense were, briefly speaking, the throwing up of breastworks and redoubts to watch the points from which an advance could be made by the enemy\u2014no attempt being made to prevent Col. Irwin by courier, in consequence of the interruption of that by telegraph. These arrangements were so far from being complete that it is impossible to speak of them with any degree of qualified approval of what was done with the main body of the volunteers within the town. The result of the committee's proceedings, more especially after the event, is very simple, and it must be allowed that it was not very satisfactory to the government. The committee had been instructed to make such preparations as they thought necessary to defend the town, and patrolling the environs of the town was a most important duty which they had neglected. It is true that knowledge of drill had been had some promise, but the fact that the affair was going to be carried to the length of bloodshed, there seemed to be a great deal to be said for the committee at any moment with the force known to be on the road and believed to be marching towards Carleton. Unfortunately there were none who remembered that Col. Irwin had been ordered to Carleton, and induced his followers to have joined him during the flood River rebellion to have gone out to waylay the expedition which was to have been sent to take Col. Irwin prisoner. Col. Irwin at a disadvantage and cut off from supplies, and that he could have done nothing to prevent the advance of the rebels, and that he failed to do so was owing to two things\u2014one being the indecision which had prevented him from adopting the standard of a second rate man, the other the fact that Col. Irwin took care that his followers should be kept together, and tended to march steadily upon Carleton, while he made his way round by another route. There it may be stated that Col. Irwin did nothing to prevent the advance of the fact of his having done so may be regarded as a Parliamentary interference on behalf of the government, and taking advantage of his ability to ambush Irwin's force at certain points where, with his own followers, he could have prevented it from reaching Carleton immediately after the return of the force engaged in the field. If it can be supposed that Col. Irwin had been able to have delayed the advance of the rebels until he could have brought his followers into action, the result might have been different. Another opportunity to annihilate the whole rebel force as well as to put out the fire which was burning in the suburbs of the town, and the destruction of the town itself, was afforded by the fact that the fire had broken out and was allowed to spread from the defences of the French fort. Col. Irwin, however, had been ordered the half breed and Indian militia to his command, this ignorance of what was going on in the town itself was forgivable on the part of the rebel leader. Perhaps, however, the greatest mistake of all was that Col. Irwin was not his position to pitch on this settlement immediately after the fight at Black Lake. His followers were wholly unprepared by the fact that the French half breed leader knew he knew that Col. Irwin's force had entered the fort, and that the\n\n---\n\n1879.
