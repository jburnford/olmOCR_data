It is true that school principals have been asked to restrict their orders to one per annum recently, but the regulation has not been very closely adhered to; in fact, there was an order supplied to this school in the month of November. The Department is not desirous of entirely abolishing local purchases, but thinks they should be reasonably restricted to supplies required by the doctor and not available from the Drug List.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

The first case occurred about the middle of December and since that time we have had six cases. We are taking care of the patients in the City's isolation hospital and have the Home under quarantine.\n\nAt the outset I gave all the children the prophylactic dose of toxoid and have begun their permanent immunization. We hope to soon have the trouble cleaned up.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I may be mistaken, but this appears to be the first notice the Department has had of this outbreak. I have to quote to you the Department's instructions that a communicable disease should be reported by telegraph, within 12 hours of its discovery.\n\nThe Department has no doubt, whatever, that you and Doctor McCaig and the principal of the school are taking good care of the sick children.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

I should like to know how many pupils require this service, and whether it could be arranged to hold a one day clinic at the school. We have found this to be much more satisfactory than taking pupils in groups to the office of the dentist. When a clinic is arranged in a residential school as many as from thirty to forty pupils receive attention, whereas usually not more than twenty can be dealt with in the office of the dentist. This may be because members of the staff usually assist the dentist in looking after the pupils treated and those awaiting treatment.\n\nIf, on receipt of your reply, it is found possible to authorize a clinic, Doctors J. A. and G. L. Shannon will be instructed to make the necessary arrangements with you through Mr. Sims, who has received a copy of this letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nReverend C. F.

For your information, I would like to say that this girl is very anxious to enter a School of Nursing this fall. She is in good standing educationally, but before she is accepted, she will require to have her goitre trouble attended to.

Shannon, and from the findings shown in the enclosed, there are 206 cavities and 17 extractions.\n\nThe doctors thought it would be very much more convenient for them to have the children taken to their surgery. But of course, it would be more convenient for us if a clinic could be arranged here.

C. F. Hives\n\nJune 27th, 1936\n\nDear Sir:\n\nLetters have been received from Doctor McCaig and Mr. Hives regarding some Indian girl who is in Shingwauk Indian Residential School and who has been anxious to enter a school of nursing. It seems her application has been held up on account of the fact that she has a goitre. There is, apparently, nothing urgent about this case except that the girl wishes to go in training. Doctor McCaig does not actually recommend this operation and as Doctor Stone is at present in the West, I think the matter will have to be left until he returns.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary\n\nG. H. Sims, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nLM\nJune 27th, 1936\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to our letter of June 11th to Reverend C. F. Hives regarding a possible dental clinic to be held at the school, Mr. Hives has, apparently, called in Doctor Shannon to examine all the children. This in itself may have involved the Department in considerable expense and it was not intended that Mr. Hives should do this. In other schools the teachers examine the children and merely report the number requiring dental attention. Then when the clinic is authorized the teachers send into the room used by the dentist, those pupils most urgently in need of attention. I am returning the slips sent to the Department by Mr. Hives as they are of no use to us.\n\nIf Doctors J. A. and C. L. Shannon wish to undertake dental work for Shingwauk School this work will have to be carried out as desired by the Department. We find that much better results are obtained when the dentist goes to the school and the children are handled by the school staff quickly and without loss of time. In many instances an old barber's chair has been rented at small cost and the dentist brings a foot drill and other necessary equipment. $30.00 is allowed for an eight hour day and from thirty to forty pupils can receive attention.\n\nIf a clinic such as this can be arranged the Department is willing to authorize two days, it being understood\n\nG. H. Sims, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nthat the dentist provides his own material for fillings, etc., and the cost of the two day clinic will be $60.00.\n\nI think you would do well to explain to Mr. Hives that the Department has no funds available to undertake this dental work in the way he appears to feel it should be done. If the most urgent cases receive attention at this clinic and regular clinics are held, the condition of the teeth of the pupils will vastly improve within the next few years.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

I hope this may be done in the near future, for these fits are becoming more frequent and much more severe, and I don't think it is good for the rest of the girls to have her here. In fact, I think it is harmful. She had one yesterday in the diningroom while the pupils were at dinner, and it was very severe, and tends to upset the children very much.\n\nI would be glad if the matter could be taken up as soon as possible, and the girl transferred to proper care and treatment.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nChas.

McCaig\nSir:\n\nWith reference to the enclosed letters re Kathleen Stock of Shingwauk Home, I beg to say that I have made careful inquiries into this matter, and would recommend that action be taken as soon as possible to have this pupil transferred to an institution where she can receive proper treatment and care.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nDr. E.L.

Stone,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nDear Doctor Stone:\n\nI would like to recommend something to you regarding the visits of the Doctor to our school. Now that a new man is on the job, I wonder if it would not be a very good idea to have a doctor's log book, which he will have to report in and sign. The doctor's visit heretofore have been quite irregular and more or less haphazard excepting when he is called to a case. This is an important work, and well worth doing.\n\nIf the idea appeals to you, I would be very much obliged if you would send a Log book along with necessary instructions. The Head Matron, who is a registered nurse, can have charge of it, and in the event of any illness it will be recorded there in case you should want it at anytime.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nDoctor E.L.

Some of the pupils require immediate attention; especially some who have just been admitted; and others require to be looked after. Unless this is done regularly, there is great danger of the health of the pupils being impaired, quite a bit of unnecessary suffering, and in the end a large bill to pay.\n\nI had to send a pupil to the dentist for an extraction two months ago. This was an emergency case, as the child was suffering. The dentist informs me his bill for $1.50 for this item was refused payment by the Department.

This authorization is for not more than two days' work.\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from the Reverend Mr. Hives in which he states that he sent a child to the dentist suffering from a toothache. The dentist later told him that he had not been paid for this work. We would like to know the circumstances of this if you can give us any information.\n\nMr. Hives also asks about having the children's eyes tested for spectacles when it is deemed necessary.

Of the nine children apparently examined, orders for glasses are being placed for seven and these will be forwarded when completed. It is observed that \"No change in glasses\" is written on two of these prescriptions and no frame measurements have been given. They are for Lila Greenberg and Christina Butterfly; consequently, no action has been taken. Presumably, they have eye glasses and require no change at the present time.\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. L.

MIRCHIN, B.A., L.Th.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nNovember 13, 1944\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepart.of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn Friday last, Nov. 10th., Mr. Laurence, Indian Agent, received a number of pairs of spectacles for pupils of this school. These spectacles arrived in a parcel without cases to protect them. The enclosed pair had one lens broken when received. Mr. Laurence is away for this week so thought it might hasten matters if I notified you at once. Personally I consider it fortunate that there were not more of the spectacles damaged in view of the way they were packed.\n\nOn previous occasions when spectacles have been supplied, cases of some kind have been sent with them. I think this is necessary for the protection of the spectacles when not in use.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nConsolidated Optical Company Ltd.\n104 Sparks Street,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nGlasses for lens replacement will arrive under separate cover.\n\nPlease supply, at the expense of this Department, spectacles in accordance with the enclosed prescription and the following specifications:\n\n(royalty only) Lenses - equal to Consolidated Optical Company \"CENTEX.\"\n\nFrame - strong metal, full frame, cable ear fittings, matching pearl nose pads, equal to Consolidated Optical Company \"ROBIN HOOD\" Catalogue No. 3678.\n\nSend these spectacles by the most economical method to the following address:\n\nMedical Services Division, Booth Bldg., Ottawa.\n\nFor: Abraham Mitchell - Sault Ste. Marie Agency.\n\nThe account must show the prices charged for lenses and frame separately, eye examination if any, and be sent in duplicate at the same time to the above address. Patient's name should also appear on the face of the account as well as on the envelope containing the spectacles as a precaution against issuing them to the wrong person particularly when more than one order is placed at the same time from the same Agency.\n\nNo vendor is authorized to supply more costly frames for an Indian, either at the Department's or the Indian's expense, or on the Indian's promise to pay the balance, or to accept any payment or deposit on these spectacles from any person other than an Indian Agent or recognized representative of the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nForm Letter No. 968\n\nIndian Affairs.

Replacement of the broken lens has now been made and the glasses returned to you.\n\nFor your information, I should like to point out that the usual spectacle cases were not available when the seven pairs of glasses were sent to Indian Agent Laurence. We are also not very well equipped with packing material, consequently, we have to make the best of what we have. About three months ago, an order was placed for spectacle cases but, to date, we have been unable to get any action on it. This is probably due to the fact that material for their manufacture is still scarce.\n\nW. L. Falconer, M.D.\nA/Assist. Supt. of Medical Services.\n\nRev. A. E.

Marie.\n\nDear Mr. Laurence:\n\nFor the past two or three years, through the shortage of dentists, it has been impossible to have anything done for the children's teeth except urgent extractions. Dr. Shannon, who has generally attended to the children's teeth is still very busy and I am wondering whether the Department would be willing to have some dental work done by one of the other dentists. There are one or two who have recently set up offices in the city who might be able to handle the job. This matter is very urgent as a great many of the children need attention, and it is a shame that good teeth should be allowed to deteriorate until extraction is the only remedy. I should be glad if you would be kind enough to bring this matter to the attention of the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYou will please find letter received from the Principal of the Shingwauk Indian Residential School which is self-explanatory.\n\nAs Dr. Shannon is too busy to take care of this work, kindly advise if it will be in order to try and arrange to have some other dentist do this work as suggested by Mr. Minchin.\n\nRPG/LMY\n\nR. P. G. Laurence,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, Ontario.\nMarch 12, 1946.\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letter of March 4th with enclosure from the Principal of the Shingwauk Indian Residential School, Rev. A.A. Minchin.\n\nIt will be in order for you to arrange to have the dental work done at the school by any other qualified dentist if Dr. Shannon is unable to do the work. As you know, we allow $30.00 a day for this work. Neither your letter nor Rev. Minchin's mentioned the number of days that will be required nor the number of pupils concerned. We would like an estimate on this as soon as possible.\n\nIn the meantime, I think you should go ahead and try and have at least some of the work done before the end of March so it can be paid from current appropriations.\n\nW.L.

McGill,\nDirector\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA - Canada\n\nDear Sir; Re-Shingwauk Indian School Milk Supply\n\nThe local Medical Officer at Sioux St. Marie, has drawn to our attention, a situation that is causing some considerable embarrassment.\n\nI believe that this Indian School is located within the city limits, and it is pointed out that a herd of cattle is maintained at the School, and that raw milk is used by all the children there.\n\nYou will understand that legislation prohibits the use of raw milk in any of our cities or towns and this is being observed by others in Sioux St. Marie. Naturally, it causes a good deal of discussion and embarrassment when a government institution permits the use of raw milk and other people are forbidden to use this.\n\nI should be glad to have your comments in connection with this. It should not be difficult to have the milk for use at the School pasteurized by one of the local dairies. That is an arrangement that is followed by a number of places of like nature, and I think that you would have no difficulty insofar as this School is concerned, if you wish to follow this procedure.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDIRECTOR\nSANITARY ENGINEERING DIVISION\n\nAEB/MLD\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6214, file 469-14, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, March 16, 1944.\n\nRe: Shingwauk Home Residential School\nMilk Supply.\n\nDear Mr. Berry:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of March 12, in which you state that a herd of cattle is maintained at the marginally-noted school and that raw milk is used by the children enrolled at the institution.\n\nI may state that the Shingwauk Residential School, although built by the Government, is operated by the Missionary Society of the Church of England. A per capita grant is paid annually by this Department on the understanding that food, clothing and instruction will be provided by the church authorities. This Department is not responsible for the purchase or maintenance of herds at residential schools anywhere in the Dominion. I am disposed to think that the pasteurization of the milk at this particular school is a matter that might be easily arranged between the medical health officer at Sault Ste. Marie and the Principal of the school. However, I am today sending forward a copy of your letter to the Reverend A. E. Minchin and a copy of my reply. It is altogether likely that you will hear from the Principal in due course.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\n\nA. E.

Under those conditions, the respons-\nibility of course would rest with the Principal of\nthe School.\n\nI am glad to learn that you have written\nhim and I hope that we will have an answer shortly.\n\nThere should also be no great difficulty\nin adjusting matters between the Principal and the\nlocal health officer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDIRECTOR\nSANITARY ENGINEERING DIVISION\n\nAEB/MLD\nMarch 20, 1944\n\nDr. H.W. McGill,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nYour letter of the 16th instant re- Pasteurization of milk reached me on Saturday.\n\nIt is a curious thing that during the two years I have been in charge of the Shingwauk School no mention of this matter has been made to me either by the local Medical Officer or by anyone else. I have no idea how long this legislation has been in force. The matter is not by any means as simple as it appears to Mr. Berry. The nearest dairy is over two miles away and we often have very difficult roads to travel in the Winter and Spring months. We have only the Farm Instructor and the Engineer to carry on the Men's side of the work during the war. It seems impossible to secure an Assistant. We use an average of 600 gallons of milk per month. A lot of work would be entailed.\n\nAs you suggest, I am writing Mr. Berry, Director, Sanitary Engineering Division.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nParliament Building,\nToronto 8, Ontario.\nJuly 10th, 1944.\n\nReverend Canon Dixon,\n\"Church House\",\n604 Jarvis Street,\nToronto 8,\nOntario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to your visit of recent date to this office, might I say that I have canvassed with the Solicitor for the Department, the question as to whether or not the Indian School is privileged to supply the children in attendance with unpasteurized milk. Dr. Gray agrees with me that this Department has no authority in respect to this matter. I still feel strongly that every effort should be made to have this milk pasteurized.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.T. Phair, M.B., D.P.H.\nChief Medical Officer of Health.\nDr. H.W. McGill,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of March 16 addressed to A.E. Berry, Director, Sanitary Engineering Division, Department of Health, at Toronto, a copy of which you sent to Rev. A.E. Minchin, Principal of our Shingwauk School.\n\nI may say that we have taken up this matter with officials of your Department and at the suggestion of Dr. Moore wrote to Dr. J. Phair, Chief Medical Officer of the Ontario Government. I now beg to enclose a copy of Dr. Phair's reply to our General Secretary, Canon Dixon.\n\nMay I plead that your Department will bring some influence to bear upon the Provincial authorities to have them leave this matter in abeyance at least for the duration of the war. We are experiencing so many extraordinary expenses at the present time that it seems unfair to press such a change upon us now. The expenditure involved would be quite heavy and the difficulty of obtaining skilled help is very real at present. We cannot feel that it is just to demand such action at this particular school where the milk supply is handled under the very best of conditions. If need exists here then it is found in greater measure in all Indian residential schools.\n\nWe shall be grateful for anything you can do to assist us at this juncture.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.A. Alderwood\nSecretary.\n\nDictated but not personally signed because of absence from the office.\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of August 4, with reference to the pasteurization of milk at the Shingwauk Indian Residential School.\n\nVery careful consideration has been given to your letter and also to the letters received from the Department of Health at Toronto. We cannot see our way clear to request the Department of Health to exempt the Shingwauk Residential School from a regulation which is enforced on other persons in the same locality and throughout the Province of Ontario. I feel you will realize that if there were an outbreak of sickness at the Shingwauk Home, due to contamination of milk, both the Church of England and the Department would be subject to very strict criticism, if it became known that we refused to carry out the instructions of the Ontario Department of Health regarding pasteurization. I, therefore, trust that the Principal of the Shingwauk Home will make the necessary arrangements to have the milk pasteurized.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDirector.\n\nRev. H.A.

Moore,\nActing Superintendent,\nIndian Health Service,\nDept. National Health & Welfare,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Doctor Moore: Re: Shingwauk School - Sault Ste. Marie\n\nOur North Bay office advises us that Dr. T. A. Breton, your physician in the Sco., has done no tuberculin tests for the past two years.\n\nWe wish to survey this school this Fall but do not feel that we should waste time and films on non-reactors. Perhaps you could bring some pressure to bear to have the pupils tested first.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(K. M.

To be clean and careful with their clothes, and to take an interest in their general appearance, to teach them to respect themselves more.\n\nWe are of the opinion that a uniform would be very valuable for this purpose. Our present system of clothing the boys for Sunday service and special occasions is not as good as it should be. We have nothing uniform for the boys, their suits are of different colors and patterns, and do not look well as pupils of a school.\n\nIn this connection we have just received a letter from a firm in Ottawa, stating that they at one time supplied boys suits to the Shingwauk, and that they have still on hand a supply of brass buttons, a sample of which they have forwarded to us. And we wondered if the Department would consider using these in the event of our wishes being granted in regard to the matter of Cadets.\n\nIf we could have a branch of the Cadets here the boys would get very much benefit, and the matter of discipline would find a place in the working of the affairs of the school that is very hard to maintain in these strange times our country is passing through. And the suits could be worn only to services on Sunday, and other special times.\n\nPlease let us know your wishes in this matter, and we shall ever be thankful.\n\nYours Faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nG.H. Sims, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nIt is my painful duty to inform you of the death of one of our pupils, No.289, Beulah Henry, who died after a brief illness. Last Sunday, this girl complained of a slight pain in the back so she was put to bed instead of going to church, as the day was stormy. Monday evening she seemed to be worse, and it was evidently at that time, the appendix was ruptured which caused peritonitis, resulting in her death on Friday. I beg to say that everything humanly possible was done for her under the circumstances. I find it so difficult to teach these children to make known their pains. I have no doubt if the doctor had known of her trouble in time, she would have had a chance, for a ruptured appendix does not come about without some forewarning.\n\nAs soon as I knew of the girl's condition, I wrote to the father, and sent a wire, and a second wire the day following. On the day she died, I phoned Mr Indian Agent Moore, and informed him, and asked him to convey the news to the father; and to wire me his wishes regarding the disposal of the body, At the same time asking him to try, if possible, to have the body buried here.

H. Sims, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nReport of accidental drowning of Dudley Shilling, Age 16 yrs.\n\nOn Thursday August 15th, all boys of the school went on a picnic, under the supervision of A.B. Hives, Farm Instructor, Miss K. Mitchell, Boys' Supervisor, and Miss M. Loucks, Teacher. The place they had decided on was a safe and beautiful sandy beach near to Pointe aux Pins, some fourteen miles away. They started in the morning, and arrived at a sandy beach sometime before noon, so that the boys went in for a dip before lunch. Here they had to leave the truck, in which they had been conveyed, and walk to the sandy beach, which was their objective, and which was about a mile and a half further on. The boys, who had enjoyed the same experience last Summer, were told to proceed to this place along a well marked road. Presumably all obeyed, but in reality all did not. The deceased, Dudley Shilling, with two smaller boys, made off in another direction toward an island, situated across a channel from the main land about one hundred yards. Here they played on the shore of the main land until Shilling said he was going to swim over to the island. The two smaller boys refused to accompany him, and tried to persuade him from doing so. He more or less dared them to stop him, and started to swim. The water, at this point is about twenty feet deep, owing to the dredging which has taken place, and there is also quite a strong current. He had not swam far before it became evident to the smaller boys that Shilling was in great difficulties, and one of them ran to two other boys who were some distance away, and who came running to the scene. They both stripped and swam out to the drowning boy. One of the boys, Billy Riley, grabbed Shilling, who immediately struggled and very nearly took Riley down with him. Realizing that he could not handle the drowning boy and save his own life, he managed to get away from his grip, and with the aid of the other boy, William Altman, make his way to the shore. Here, both boys lay almost exhausted, but as soon as they could, they ran for a boat. In the meantime, one of the smaller boys had run for more help, and met another boy, Kenneth Benedict, age 15, who came and found the other two boys in a boat rowing to the place where Shilling had disappeared. Benedict swam out, and located the body in about twenty feet of water. Brought it up, and with the help of the other boys, loaded it in the boat, and rowed to the island. They immediately took the body and laid it across a log, and started resuscitation work on it, while one of the boys ran to the U.S. Coast guard at the light house, and brought a man, who saw that Dudley was past all aid.\nThe police and doctor were informed as soon as possible, and came out to the scene. No inquest was held, as the Coroner, Dr. A.S. McCaig, did not deem it necessary.\n\nThe body was laid to rest in the Shingwauk cemetery on Saturday, Aug. 17th.\n\nIn conclusion, I would add that no blame could be attached to those in charge. The boys knew what was expected of them. They knew and were told they were not to go into the water until one hour after lunch, and by that time they would be at their objective sandy beach, where they had been before. It is just one of those unfortunate accidents, which, I am thankful to say we have not encountered since nearly eleven years ago.\n\nChas. Havel\n\nPrincipal.\nOntario Provincial Police Report.\n\nDeath by drowning of Dudley Shilling, age 16 yrs., Ward of Shingwauk Home, Sault Ste. Marie, Ont., at Pointe Aux Pins on Aug. 15, 1940.\n\nWith reference to the marginally noted person, please be advised that on the afternoon of Aug. 15th, 1940 I received a call from Pointe Aux Pins, some fourteen miles north of Sault Ste. Marie, advising me that a boy had been drowned there. I immediately proceeded to that point, accompanied by Dr. A.S. McCaig of Sault Ste. Marie, who is chief Coroner for Algoma district.\n\nOn my arrival I learned that one Dudley Shilling, age 16 yrs., and a ward of the Shingwauk Home, at Sault Ste. Marie, had, with several other boys from the Home, been on a picnic at Pointe Aux Pins, and that right after his lunch, he had gone in swimming in Lake Superior. There is a small island about a quarter of a mile out from this pointe, and apparently this boy thought he could swim to it. Unfortunately he sank in about twenty feet of water, when about thirty feet from the island. The boy's companion, Kenneth Benedict, age 15 yrs., was about twenty feet from him when he sank, and on his arrival over where Shilling went down, he dived and until he brought the boy to the surface and to the shore.\n\nThe American Coast guard patrol saw the fatality and came to the rescue, and by resuscitation endeavoured to revive the boy, but with no results.\n\nAfter the Coroner, Dr. A.S. McCaig viewed the body, and interviewed witnesses, he deemed an inquest unnecessary and the body was released to the undertaker, T.E. Simpson of Sault Ste. Marie, for burial.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon Shilling was buried in the Shingwauk cemetery, with Rev. Canon Johnson officiating.\n\nThis boy is survived by one brother, Henry age 14 yrs. His parents being dead.\n\nProv. Constable\nC. STATEMENT OF INDIAN AGENT\n\n1.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1941.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Jan. 10, 1942.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nPage No. 268\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout C of E School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: A.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout C.E. School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: A. B. Clarke\n\nDated April 6, 1942.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nSioux Lookout\n\nDated at this APR 22, 1942\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 7, 1942.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nSioux Lookout\n\nDated at this\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFora No. I.A. 403\nRegn No. 921\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: November 20, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: Sioux Lookout\n\nDec. 5, 1942\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarters means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward the totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDecember 31, 1942\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nSioux Lookout\n\nthis\n\nJanuary 4, 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: December 31, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at: Sioux Lookout\n\nthis: JAN. 4, 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 10, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nSioux Lookout\n\nDated at this\n\nAPR 21, 1943\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n\nReg.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated April 10, 1945.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout, this APR 21, 1945.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated July 30, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout this July 30, 1943\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 603\n\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: December 31st, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: Sioux Lookout\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 408\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1944.\n\nDated October 16, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: A.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated: October 18, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated: OCT 28 1944\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Ind.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 8, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Oct. 8, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout this...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout I.R.S. School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Oct. 8, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter shows the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 6, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nSioux Lookout\n\nDated at: OCT 20 1945\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Dec. 31, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout this JAN 9, 1945\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: Dec. 31, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: Sioux Lookout\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 408\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging if No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Dec. 31, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 1, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days present of all pupils entering the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due or quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On the Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated April 1, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout APR 30 1946\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFonds No. I A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 11, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I A 408\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 30, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at SIoux Lookout\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SIOUX LOOKOUT ANGLICAN School for the Quarter ended SEPTEMBER 30th 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated OCTOBER 10th 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at SIOUX LOOKOUT this OCT 17 1946 INDIAN AGENCY\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403 Regn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SIOUX LOOKOUT ANGLICAN School for the Quarter ended SEPTEMBER 30th, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 10th, 1946.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at SIOUX LOOKOUT this OCT 17 1946 INDIAN AGENCY\n\nNOTE:\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403 Regn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging if No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SIoux LOOKOUT ANGLICAN School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 5th, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nSIoux LOOKOUT\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at JAN 13, 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SIoux LOOKOUT ANGLICAN School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1946.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated Jan. 6th, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nSIoux LOOKOUT\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at JAN 13-1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 408\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SIOUX LOOKOUT ANGLICAN School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1947.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated April 7th, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this Indian Agency APR. 18 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFont No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in quarter multiplied by the number of pupils. This total is arrived at by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days pupils are present when entering the Return and is obtained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 1st, 1947.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout this JUL 22, 1947.\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. L A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paged it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1947.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: Oct 8 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout OCT 10 1947\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Oct. 8, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nSioux Lookout\nDated at: OCT. 10, 1947\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall any grant be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct 10 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout this OCT 10 1947\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAME OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY/GIRL | CLASS OF STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF RETURN TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|---------------|-----|----------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|------------|\n| D257            | Sam Southwind | 15  | 1        | Lac Seul 248   | X                 |                         |                          | 9 4 44     |\n| 258             | Angus Wesley  | 7   | 1        | Albany 463     | X                 |                         |                          | 9 4 44     |\n| 259             | Adam Wasakasnic | 11  |          | Osnaburgh 205  |                   |                         |                          | 9 4 44     |\n| 260             | Jimmy do      | 12  |          | do 326         |                   |                         |                          | 9 4 44     |\n| 261             | Johnny do     | 11  |          | do 226         |                   |                         |                          | 9 4 44     |\n| 264             | Stanley Wesley| 13  | 1        | do 158         |                   |                         |                          | 9 4 44     |\n| 265             | Alex Fidler   | 13  | 1        | Trout L. 32    |                   |                         |                          | 9 4 44     |\n| 266             | Moses Mosketayonene | 14 | 1    | do 56         |                   |                         |                          | 9 4 44     |\n| 267             | Publius Fox   | 18  | X        | do 211         |                   |                         |                          | 9 4 44     |\n| 268             | Stanley Fox   | 13  | X        | do 211         |                   |                         |                          | 9 4 44     |\n| 269             | Albert Beardy | 11  | 1        | do 42          |                   |                         |                          | 9 4 44     |\n| 270             | Kalah Beardy  | 13  |          | do 186         |                   |                         |                          | 9 4 44     |\n| 271             | Carneleom Cromarty | 13 | 1    | do 251         |                   |                         |                          | 9 4 44     |\n| 272             | Lukas Beardy  | 13  |          | do 196         |                   |                         |                          | 9 4 44     |\n| 273             | Schade Beardy | 12  | 1        | do 189         |                   |                         |                          | 9 4 44     |\n| 274             | William John Beardy | 11 | 1    | do 196         |                   |                         |                          | 9 4 44     |\n| 275             | Tommy Wateoskin | 11 | 1    | Ft.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SIOUX LOOKOUT INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31st, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 10, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout\n\nJAN 10, 1948\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SIOUX LOOKOUT INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SIOUX LOOKOUT INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1948.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: April 5th, 1948.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout this 7th July 1948.\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet or the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The column of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition at the SIOUX LOOKOUT, ONT.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payments be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout School for the Quarter ended 31st Dec. 1948.\n\nPrincipal: J.M.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout School for the Quarter ended 31st Dec. 1948.\n\nPrincipal: J.N. Evans\nper D.G. Mickenden.\n\nDated 4th Feb. 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nSioux Lookout\nDated at FEB 14 1949\nthis 19\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nR. 3444\n| REGISTERED NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY/GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|------------------|----------------|-----|----------|----------------|-------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0293             | Lucy Matthew   | 10  | Boy      | Pt.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout School for the Quarter ended 31st Dec. 1949.\n\nPrincipal: J.M. Evans\nper D.C. Wickenden.\n\nDated 4th Feb. 1949.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payments be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition at the SIoux LOOKOUT, ONT School for the Quarter ended MAR 31 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated APRIL 16 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nSioux Lookout\n\nDated at APR 16 1949\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\n| Number | Name       | Age | Sex | Band or Reserve | Class or Study | Standing in | Trade or Other Industry | Date of Entrance to School | Attendance |\n|--------|------------|-----|-----|-----------------|---------------|-------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|------------|\n| 0322   | Nina Wesley | 9   | G   | 1 Loe Saul 460  |               |             |                         |                            |            |\n| 0323   | Marjorie Wain | 9   | G   | 1 Ft.Hope 885   |               |             |                         |                            |            |\n| 0324   | Kathleen Drake | 13  | G   | 1 Nipigon 300   |               |             |                         |                            |            |\n| 0325   | Marjorie Drake | 9   | G   |                  |               |             |                         |                            |            |\n| 0326   | Ida Hobbs   | 13  | G   | 1 Ft.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition at the SIOUX LOOKOUT ONT School for the Quarter ended MAR 31 1949\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 12th April 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nSIOUX LOOKOUT\n\nDated at APR 16 1949\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average Attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition at the SIOUX LOOKOUT, ONT School for the Quarter ended MAR 31 1949\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 17th April 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at SIOUX LOOKOUT APR 16 1949\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 408\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAME OF PUPIL | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN | TRADE ON OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., READY FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|----------------|--------------|-----|-----|-----|---------------|-------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| 351            | William Bannakosse | 10   | 1   |     | Ft.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout School for the Quarter ended 30th June 1949.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Signature] 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at: Sioux Lookout, Jul. 2, 1949\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 26th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendances in excess of the number of pupils for which grants is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the MINISCH INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended DEC. 31, 1949.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: DEC. 31, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: Sioux Lookout\n\nJAN 5, 1950\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per pupil grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will any grant be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1950.\n\nPrincipal: J.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarter's per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return, the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

I note from the file that the Dominion Water Power Branch has been asked to report on the water power available at Quibell, a town which is on the main line of the C.N.R., less than ten miles from the site of the McIntosh Residential School, and I believe it would be an error to locate the new Anglican school at this point.\n\nThe M.S.O.C. are securing most of their land on the Lac Seul and Frenchman's Head Reserves, and there is no reason that I am aware of why the school should not be placed somewhere in the vicinity of McIntosh, which is approximately sixty-five miles from Quibell and is the nearest town on the railway to the reserves in question. Would it not be possible to ask the Dominion Water Power Branch to make a report in connection with their report on water power available at Quibell.\n\nRussell T.

N. R., south of Lac Seul, and I am writing to instruct you to cooperate with Mr. Orr, the Department Architect, who will call on you in the near future. At the present writing, Mr. Orr expects to be in Kenora on or about the 11th instant to confer with you and the Rev. Mr. Freeman, of Winnipeg, with reference to a site near Kenora for the new Cecilia Jeffrey buildings. At that time, he will make arrangements with you to accompany him to the Lac Seul area, for the purpose of selecting a site for the Lac Seul Indian Residential School. On this latter trip, Mr. Orr and you will be accompanied by Dr. Westgate, of Winnipeg, or his representative, and by a surveyor.

If you will undertake this survey, will you please arrange that one of your firm will proceed to Sioux Look Out or some station near there and meet Mr. Orr when he is selecting the site? Mr. Orr is proceed to Winnipeg Thursday next and does not definitely know day during the coming week he will be returning to Sioux Look Out but he will wire you from Winnipeg stating the station at which he wishes to meet you and the date of arrival there.

A.D. Dewdney, Anglican Bishop of Keewatin, to meet on a date and at a place to be agreed upon, to inspect other possible sites and select the one which, in their judgement, is best suited for the purposes of an Indian Residential School having particular regard to (1) good farming land in sufficient quantities, (2) good water supply and (3) readiness of access.\n\nI am communicating on these lines with Dr. Westgate and Bishop Dewdney.\n\nIn the foregoing connection may I draw your attention to the following extract from my letter to the Honourable, the Superintendent General, dated Feb. 11th, 1925, setting out the points agreed upon in a recent interview. Copy of this letter was forwarded to you. The paragraph in question reads:\n\n(4) \"That, in future, the architect's plans for new Residential Schools to be administered by the Society shall include provision for cupboards, lockers, and other such necessary items of domestic equipment, and, also, for at least the main barns and associated out-buildings; thus avoiding repetition of the delays and losses to the Society which have occurred, and are now occurring, in connection with its occupancy of the new Residential School on the Blood reserve.\"\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We will forward you today a copy of our catalogue. As we are the only builders of such boilers in this district and as we presume that it is either of the above types of boilers that will be installed in the building, we would like to request that \"Pascol\" boilers, or equal, be specified.\n\nOur boilers are well known and there are many of them installed from considerably East of Montreal to the Pacific Coast. There are a number of them in the Dominion Government, also Provincial Government buildings. All sales outside of a radius of some one hundred and fifty miles of Port Arthur are made by our Agents, for which reason, to date, we have not had any direct dealing with your Department, but we believe Pascol boilers were installed in one or more Indian Schools in Western Canada. We can also recall offhand that they were also installed in Postoffices at Regina and Kingston, Ontario.\n\nThere are no better boilers built by any firm in Canada, or the United States for that matter, and we hope, as a compliment to a firm in the constituency for which the building referred to is to be built, you can meet the above request to have our boilers specified.\n\nWe are sending this same letter and one of our catalogues to the Accountant and Purchasing Agent for your Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPORT ARTHUR SHIPBUILDING COMPANY, LIMITED\n\nABC.HO.\n\nSECRETARY TREASURER.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The advertisement cost $24.00.\n\nA Novel Plan of Calling For Bids by Direct Mail\n\nWould you like to submit your next call for bids to a selected list of contractors, by means of a letter addressed to each contractor?\n\nWe are prepared to give this novel and effective service at a very moderate price.\n\nWe have very complete lists of contractors (30,000 all told) arranged according to the classes of work in which they specialize, and we can send your call for bids to any desired number of any particular class in any desired locality or group of localities. We keep these lists strictly up-to-date, for we also mail to every one of these contractors either our \"paid issue\" of Engineering and Contracting, or one of our \"free circulation\" supplementary magazines.\n\nA proposal advertisement in Engineering and Contracting costs only 40c a line, and is very effective and cheap advertising where it is desired to reach a large number of contractors. But in many cases it may be desired to reach only a limited number of contractors of a given class in a given part of the country. To meet this demand we have created a \"direct mail\" department which is now at your service. The proposal calls are sent by first class mail, and therefore receive careful attention by their recipients.\n\nWe suggest an early trial of this special service. The price is only $6.00 per hundred of selected contractors thus reached by first class mail.\n\nWe can either tell you the number of contractors before you place your order, or you can order us to send your proposal notice to so many hundreds of such and such a class in such and such cities, counties or states.\n\nThus, if you would like to have your call for bids reach 500 sewer contractors in the eastern states, name the desired state, and at a price of $30.00 your notice will be sent to them by us.\n\nIf, in addition, you would like to reach all such contractors in America, an insertion of your advertisement in Engineering and Contracting and its free issue Supplements will accomplish the purpose, at a price of only 40c a line.\n\nThe price of $6.00 per hundred includes postage, printing, stationery, addressing, etc., provided the printed matter does not exceed 300 words or about 50 lines. For all printing in excess of this an additional price of $1.00 per 100 words will be charged.\n\nRemember that yours will be the only proposal notice in the envelope that reaches each contractor, and that the envelope will have a 2c stamp.\n\nENGINEERING and CONTRACTING\n\n71 EAST 20TH STREET\n\nCHICAGO, ILL.\nMr. Gillette:\n\nYou may run this same ad in your next issue.

H. Simmons, of Winnipeg, for the proposed new Industrial School at Sioux Lookout, Ont. Owing to the lateness of the season and the comparative inaccessibility of the location of the school it is highly desirable that the contract should be awarded without delay in order that the contractor may get in the foundations and certain other work done before the heavy frosts set in. In the past it has been our practice to award a contract when the Memorandum to Council was signed and not wait for the actual passing of the Order in Council. Under existing conditions I would like to have the authority of either the Superintendent General or the Acting Superintendent General to follow this same course in this instance.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nNIGHT LETTER\n\nCANADIAN NATIONAL TELEGRAPHS\n\nGREAT NORTH WESTERN TELEGRAPH CO.

(RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 1)\nI beg to report that on Thursday, Oct. 22nd, in company with Rev. Doctor Westgate, Indian Agent Edwards, and the contractor, Mr. J. H. Simmons, I proceeded from Sioux Lookout to the site of the new Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School, and after a careful examination of the property decided on a location for the main school building and the barn. The site as selected provides excellent drainage facilities, and is well located for a water supply system. It is Mr. Simmons intention to proceed at once with the clearing of the land necessary for the building, and to begin building operations as soon as possible. The building site is located on a point in lot 26, concession C. This point consists of approximately 14 acres, and is at present covered with bush. Captain Edwards is arranging to have this portion of the property cleared this winter, as it is very important, from a stand point of fire protection that the bush does not immediately surround the buildings.\n\nAs Indian Agent Edwards has had considerable experience, before entering the service of the Department, in building construction he is well qualified to supervise the building operations and it will therefore be unnecessary to appoint an Inspector of Construction.\n\nThere are a few minor changes in the building suggested by Doctor Westgate, and after discussing the different items with Mr. Simmons, I authorized, subject to your approval, the following:\n\n- Changing partitions between class rooms to folding doors, in order that the class rooms may be converted at any time into assembly hall. $186.00\n- Changing size of beams in order to give extra support to floor of assembly hall. $52.00\n- Providing of a door from the ground floor to the residence. $30.00\nCovering the under side of the rafters on the second floor with insulation. $265.00\n\nChanging from lath and plaster in top floor ceiling to metal. 93.00\n\nIf weather conditions are favourable it will be possible for the contractor to place all his concrete before winter sets in, and to have the building erected and ready for occupation by the 24th of May next year.\n\n[Signature]\n\nARCHITECT.\nOttawa, Nov. 6, 1928.\n\nDear Captain Rhodes,\n\nI am enclosing herewith for your information a copy of a letter which I have received from Mr. Simons regarding the changes we were discussing in the plans for the Sioux Lookout School, and also copy of the Department's letter to him authorising same.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.

I expect that they are about ready to pour the concrete footings. I have advised the foreman to pour the concrete walls in a section at a time, and to house in each section and heat it with stoves. So there will be no danger of the concrete freezing. I have a steam upright boiler on the job for heating the water for the concrete, I have also plenty of galv. iron stacks for heating the gravel, also a concrete Oil Heater, which sends a flame direct into the drum of the mixer to heat the aggregate.\n\nIf the fine weather we are now having will only hold for two weeks, we will have no trouble in being ready to start the frame structure in a short time.\n\nI received the additional Blue prints which I requested.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

Mr. Simmons, the contractor, also visited the school at the same time. The contractor has the foundation and frame up for the barn, and it should only be a few days before it is erected in. This will be a good place for them to store material and do a certain amount of the work during the extreme cold weather. The most of the excavating is done for the main building, and concrete footings are now in. Fourteen acres of clearing has been done, but of course no grubbing or stumping. This cannot be done until the Spring when the frost is out of the ground. The logs cut will be piled so as to be later used for heating purposes for the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nJ.

We will not lay the concrete  \nfloor in the barn during the winter.\n\nPractically all the concrete footings of the school are  \nin place. We will start the concrete walls of the school after the  \nHolidays. We will build a separate protecting wall on each side  \nof the wall form, and keep the frost away from the walls until set  \nwith sufficient stoves.\n\nAfter the concrete walls are poured I will put on a good  \nsized gang of carpenters and will soon have the building enclosed.\n\nI expect to be taking my usual trip East this winter to  \nsee the old folks at London.

Guernsey Orr Esq.,\nArchitect, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Canada.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI am enclosing a sketch, of the Sioux Lookout Indian School, showing the approx. run of the main drains.\n\nWill it be advisable to run the soapy water drain also the boiler room drain to a sump as shown on the sketch? If so it will make quite a saving and save running a separate soapy water drain to the far side of the Septic Tank. The soil at the proposed sump is sand about five feet down.\n\nThere is a natural fall from the sump to the bay. By putting in Lye or other preparation in the sump it would clear away any corrosion on the walls of the sump.\n\nYou will note I have shown an alternate drain (see dotted lines) from the main soapy water drain to the manhole and beyond the Septic Tank.\n\nYou will note figures in red at various points around the basement wall, on the sketch. These are the approx. heights from the grade to the floor. Also that the figures at the extreme rear end show a fill.\n\nKindly let me know as quickly as possible if advisable to use the Sump for the soapy water, so I can arrange with the Plumber.\n\nNOTE:- If the soapy water does not run to the sump the drain will have to be set up in the fill, on account of the ground being so low at the rear of the building.\n\nOn account of the boiler room being so much lower than the other drains, it will be necessary to run the water from boiler room to a sump, even if we do not use it for the soapy water.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

On account of the location I see no reason why this would not work satisfactorily.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. Gurney Orr,\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nJ. H.

Secret, I inspected the work at the new Sioux Look-out Indian School. There had been very little done during the Christmas holidays, but the men are now back on the work and owing to the mild weather, are putting in the concrete. The footings are nearly all in, as also the basis for the pillars. The concrete wall is up on the west side of the west wing. There does not appear to be any danger of frost as they have the work closed in, with three stoves and two salamanders working. Since then we have had a cold snap and this will likely delay them. The barn is now up and sheeted and shingled, and this gives the Contractor a place to do his framing and other work under cover.\n\nThere are a quantity of logs on the ground, and these have not yet been gathered together and piled. This work is being done when the Contractor can spare the use of the teams.\nI have given instructions to the Contractor about the floor drains and other matters referred to in your letter.\n\nI remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nTo Frank Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE                                      | AMOUNT |\n|------|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1926 | Jan 27 Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School |        |\n|      | To labour week ending Nov 23rd               | 44.30  |\n|      |                                              | 47.07  |\n|      |                                              | 48.30  |\n|      |                                              | 10.10  |\n|      |                                              | 8.2522 | 178.65 |\n|      | To clearing 9 acres                          | 405.00 |\n\nAuthority Departmental Letter 129-6-15\n\n- Cheques read from Dept $1000.00 $500.00\n- Payments previously paid $36.14\n- This voucher $53.65 $121.75\n\nBalance at Imperial Bank Sioux Lookout\n\nEXAMINED AND FOUND CORRECT\n\nTotal $783.65\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFrank Edwards\nAgent\n\nIndian Affairs.

Secret, I Inspected the buildings of Sioux Lookout Residential School.\n\nThe men have worked very well since the Christmas holiday, a soft spell enabling them to make unexpected progress with the concrete work, which is well advanced despite a cold spell entailing a few days' stop. They have now attained the height of the main building and of the principal's residence.\n\nThe sub-contractors installing the heating plant are on the job, with boilers, piping and steam-fitting supplies on the site. The window frames for all buildings are ready for installation, and the barn complete save for paint and finish.\n\nThe logs on the site are not yet piled, this being done by us with the help of a team and men borrowed from the contractor when cold weather prevents their usual work. This is mutually helpful.\n\nSince Pelican, the nearest station to the site, is not a regular stop, I have arranged with the superintendent of the Can. Nat. Ry. to make this point a flag stop for passengers on Nos.1 & 2 on Sunday Tuesday and Saturday for the convenience of the school authorities, contractors and ourselves.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The concrete work on the walls would have been done by this time, but cold weather interrupted things for a few days. This part of the work should be done by the end of the week with reasonable weather.\n\nThe framing of the west wing has reached the second floor, with window frames in.\n\nBoilers are on the ground, also piping for drains etc.\n\nAbout 25 or 30 men and 3 teams are employed.\n\nThe contractor asks permission to raise the floor above the visitors' bedroom about five inches for the concealment of the pipes for the bathroom overhead. This improvement, he says, would entail no additional expense.\n\nThe hot water tank in the boiler-room is shown running N. and S. The contractor claims an E. and W. installation would be handier for the twelve foot length of boiler, and I advised him to do this if no difficulty results.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nIndian Agent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nH/A.\nJ.

This roll travels at a speed four times greater than that of the linen, imparting a highly-polished finish, and revolving in the same direction as the feed rolls obviates the friction and wear that linen is subject to on other types of mangles whose ironing shoe remains stationary.\n\nThe revolving ironing roll utilizes the whole of its circumference, constantly presenting newly-heated surface to the linen so that all the heat developed is used\u2014none going to waste. On other types of mangles the ironing shoe is stationary and only a small segment of its surface is used, allowing the entire heat generated to escape.\n\nGuarantee New Type Mangle is controlled by foot, leaving both hands of the operator, who can work sitting down, free to control the work. Linen can be finished direct from the extractor with once through the mangle at a speed of twelve feet per minute. Sheets need be folded only once, and collars are ironed and shaped at the same time.\n\nThe bearing shaft on the ironing roll is three inches in diameter running in roller bearings. Gears are made with extra large strong teeth, with a spare idle gear on opposite end of roll. This machine is automatically lubricating.\n\nHeat can be generated by electricity, gas, gasoline or coal. Electric type has two heats, each indicated by word and light. Electric heating elements fusing 3 k.w. per hour\u2014110 or 220 volts guaranteed and encased in steel tube lasting each year. Automatic temperature control.\n\nMangle is run by a \u00bc-h.p. electric motor which can be attached to any light socket.

The material throughout is of the best grade and no pains have been spared to produce a machine that can be relied upon to give many years of satisfactory service.\n\nThe Main Trunion Journals operate in roller bearings. Less power is required to drive the machine and wear is almost entirely eliminated, with the result that all gears are always in correct mesh and alignment. Broken gears, worn trunion journals and bearing replacements are never necessary on this washer. The main bearings are entirely separated from the tub by packed stuffing boxes, which absolutely prevents oil and grease from entering the washer or water from coming out.\n\nThe Reversing Movement is our Beaver Ball Bearing type in which all the thrust of operating the belt shifter slides is taken by hardened steel balls. The movement is designed so as to give a positive even shifting of the belts, irrespective of wear, so that the...\nBeaver Roller Bearing Washer\u2014Header on End\n\ncylinder runs the same number of revolutions in either direction. The gears are machine cut from solid blanks and the main gear is thirty inches in diameter. The gear has a split hub to facilitate easy removal. A combined gear lock and hand wheel is provided.\n\nThe Cylinder is of the best grade all heart stock long-leaf yellow pine with hard Maple ribs. The three lifting ribs are extra deep to ensure rapid washing. The trunions are bolted to heavy brass rings. The hinges are of brass bolted through a brass batten with an enclosed brass lock.\n\nThe Outer Case is of the finest clear Cypress and is furnished with a brass apron at the door opening. Inspection plates are provided in each end so that trunion bolts may be tightened without removing the upper half of the case.\n\nThe Inlet and Outlet Tees are connected by a 1\u00bd inch pipe into which steam can be injected. When steam is being used to heat the water this construction gives a rapid circulation and absolutely prevents any steam from coming in contact with the wood of the cylinder or case. The water inlet is 2 inches in diameter. The steam inlet is \u00be inch. A 3 inch plug type discharge valve is supplied.\n\nThis Washer can be arranged for motor drive, in which case it is driven from the motor through short belts. The motor is carried on a substantial cast iron base bolted firmly to the frame of the machine.\n\nAt a small additional cost these machines may be equipped with a Beaver 6 inch foot operated discharge valve, Beaver Water Level Indicator, visible anywhere in the wash room, Beaver Soap and Soda filling doors, and Monel Metal Lifting ribs in the cylinder.\n\nSpecifications:\n\n| SIZE   | NUMBER OF DOORS | NUMBER OF COMPARTMENTS | FULLYS | SPEED | FLOOR SPACE | WEIGHT |\n|--------|-----------------|------------------------|--------|-------|-------------|--------|\n| 36 x 36| One             | One                    | 16 inch| 250 RPM| 44 x 72     | 1500 lbs.|\n| 36 x 52| One             | Two                    | 16 inch| 250 RPM| 44 x 88     | 1650 lbs.|\n| 40 x 40| One             | One                    | 16 inch| 250 RPM| 48 x 76     | 1600 lbs.|\n| 40 x 52| One             | Two                    | 16 inch| 250 RPM| 48 x 88     | 1750 lbs.|\n\nSINGLE GEARED ONLY\n\nThe above are our standard sizes.

The Oversize Steel Spindle operates on a hardened ball point and button running in a long bronze bearing. The bearing is supported by two large rubber springs, so arranged and designed as to make this Machine self-balancing. A large amount of working space has been provided round the bearing, making very easy and quick the adjustment or changing of the rubber springs. An oil retaining well is provided, which requires only occasional filling.\n\nAll Beaver Extractors have countershafts attached to the curb, and may be for straight or angle drive. The angle drive, as shown in the cut, costs a little more than the straight drive, but effects a saving in floor space, and allows the Extractor to be placed in line with the washers. All Extractors have our improved adjustable friction clutch pulley, which gives a gradual increase in speed without strain to any part of the Machine. Motor drive extractors are direct connected with push button control.\n\nA Galvanized wire safety cover is fitted and so arranged that the cover must be closed before the Machine can be started.\n\n| Size    | Drive   | Speed of Counter | Diam. of Counter | Floor Space | Shipping Weight |\n|---------|---------|------------------|------------------|-------------|----------------|\n| 26 inch | Straight| 550              | 7 inch           | 36 x 60     | 1550 lbs.      |\n| 26 \"    | Angle   | 550              | 7 inch           | 36 x 36     | 1600 lbs.      |\n| 26 \"    | Motor   |                  |                  | 36 x 40     | 1700 lbs.      |\n| 30 \"    | Straight| 500              | 7 inch           | 40 x 64     | 1750 lbs.      |\n| 30 \"    | Angle   | 500              | 7 inch           | 40 x 40     | 1800 lbs.      |\n| 30 \"    | Motor   |                  |                  | 40 x 44     | 1950 lbs.      |\n\nTHE BEAVER LAUNDRY MACHINERY CO., LIMITED\nTORONTO\nWESTERN AGENTS: THE BEAVER SOAP CO., LIMITED, WINNIPEG\nThe Beaver Junior Drying Tumbler is especially designed for Hospitals, Institutions and Dry Cleaners.

I have, today, received an offer from Mr. Simmons to install a Septic Tank complete with the necessary manholes and sewer pipe for $1,230.00. As the boiler room in the building is below the level of the remaining portion, it would be more economical to drain this floor with a sump and Mr. Simmons has submitted a price for this work of $274.00.

I have also accepted their price of $374.00 for the building of a brick sump, four feet in diameter, inside approximately eleven feet high; eight inch wall and cast iron cover, also approximately eighty feet of six inch tile from the boiler room.\n\nThere has been some delay in paying Mr. Simmons the amount due on his last certificate, that is number five. The vote for Indian Education is very nearly exhausted and we are arranging to have some funds transferred to this vote, which should take place in a day or so, and when this has been carried out a cheque will be sent to Mr. Simmons in payment of his account.\n\nI am very pleased to hear that such good progress is being made on this contract, and that the work is being carried out in a satisfactory manner.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.

Simmons, I inspected the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School at Pelican Falls, and we were both very well pleased with the progress made.\n\nConcrete Work: Completed except for the floors, the cement and gravel for which are on the ground.\n\nLathing: Ground floor practically lathed, and two floors in main building ready for lathing, which should be done about April 10th.\n\nShingling: Main building roof practically shingled.\n\nElectric Wiring: Two thirds of main building now roughed in.\n\nPlumbing: All roughed in for the main building.\n\nHeating: All mains in place and about half the risers for the main building in place.\n\nPainting: Outside main building and barn primed one coat.\n\nSashes: All glazed and primed.\n\nMillwork: All which is not yet placed is on the ground.\n\nPlastering: All material on the ground, and several days' preparation done by plasterers and help.\n\nChimneys: Chimney and fireplace in residence complete, also small chimney for laundry. Main chimney started.\n\nMetal Ceiling and Ventilation: All material on the ground and half the ventilators in place.\n\nEdge-grain Planking on ground.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI should like to know what arrangements are being made for a water supply and storage tank, also whether it is intended to build ice and root houses.\n\nIn the course of inspection we noticed that the partition between the principal's house and the main building is only of lath and plaster, and since this adjoins the playrooms, classrooms and dormitory the partition should be deafened.\n\nMr. Simmons says he is doing this, as he knows the Department's architect will approve, and there is no doubt in my mind as to the necessity of it.\n\nEnclosed herewith please find Estimate No. 6.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nE/A Enc.\n\nI am now informed the laundry machine is at Sioux Lookout.\n\nPlease send a further supply of Certificate forms.\nOttawa, April 22, 1926.\n\nDear Captain Edwards,\n\nI overlooked a paragraph in your letter of the 5th ultimo, with reference to the water supply system for the Sioux Look-out School. When Mr. Simmons was in Ottawa in the early part of the winter we discussed the water supply system for this building, and when he left here it was his intention to make inquiries in Winnipeg as to the cost of erecting an elevated tank, and promised to let me have full information at an early date. I have not heard from him as yet, and perhaps it would be well if you would mention this to him at the first opportunity. I am of the opinion that the elevated tank system is the most satisfactory, providing it does not cost too much.\n\nIt is my intention to pay a visit to Sioux Look-out sometime during the month of May. If there is any particular date that would suit you, probably I can make arrangements accordingly. I would like, however, to go when the building is nearing completion.\n\nI am working on some plans for the outbuildings that is poultry house, play yard, etc., required, and will send them to you in the near future to get prices from Mr. Simmons.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.

Mr. Claude Secret.\n\nThe roof Ironwork is complete except over the chapel. All the main building is ready for Lathing and half lathed. 1500 yards of Plastering are browned one coat. Three outside coats of Paint are on the main building and residence. All inside and outside Sashes are glazed and fitted except for the chapel. All Plumbing is roughed in. The heating plant is complete for temporary Heat. Metal Ceilings are up on the first and second floors of the main building. The sump pit Pipe Line is in. All Laundry Machinery and Plumbing Fixtures are on the ground. The contractor has made a manhole to the roof in the ceiling of the passage. This necessity was not shown on plans.\n\nRev. C. Secret showed that the chancel floor must be 6\" above main floor from the vestry partition to behind the altar, and communion rail hinged in centre for passageway. I have instructed the contractor to do all this, the cost being about $15.\n\nSome arrangement should be made to get a root-house and a boat. Shall I take this up with Rev. Dr. Westgate?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 1)\nR. Gurney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect to Indian Department\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Orr;\n\nAs the management of the new school at Sioux Lookout will require a gas boat, it has occurred to me that as this important item of equipment will be provided by the Department I should offer you some suggestion with regard to the kind which I consider would be most suitable.\n\nAs the distance from Sioux Lookout to the school site is approximately 7 miles over a fairly wide sheet of water, and as there will be frequent communication from the school and this Town, I should like to recommend that a boat, capable of carrying a considerable amount of freight, be purchased. It should not be less than 25 feet in length, and as some rough weather may be encountered, it should have an engine of not less than 18 H.P.\n\nAs this boat will be used chiefly for freight purposes and would cost the school management too much for gasoline and upkeep to make one trip daily to Sioux Lookout for mail and other things, it would be a very great convenience and saving if a smaller gas boat could be supplied, as well as the larger one. Both these watercrafts seem to me essential to the efficient and economical management of the school, and our Society will be very grateful if your Department will supply them.\n\nI am hoping to visit Sioux Lookout during the weekend May 16th to 17th on my way to Moose Fort, and if you are unable to be there at that time, I will endeavor to furnish you with a brief statement setting forth any suggestions which I may have to make.\n\nMr. Marshall, who has been appointed Principal of this school, will arrive there sometime during the first half of July. I very much hope that the Principal's residence may be ready for him at that time. I am presuming that your Department will supply the furniture.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours truly,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nMay 7, 1946\n\nDear Doctor Westgate,\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant with reference to the new school at Sioux Lookout, and I have noted your request that a suitable bed be supplied for the use of this school. This matter will be given due consideration.\n\nI do not think that it will be possible for me to be at Sioux Lookout during the week ending May 10th, but I hope to be able to visit the school by the end of this month.\n\nWith reference to your remarks regarding furnishing if the building is completed we ought to be able to have all furniture in place by July. I will be glad to hear from you after your visit to the school around the fifteenth.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. Gurney Orr,\nArchitect to the Department.\n\nRev. Dr. W. B. R. Westgate,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 1)\nMEMORANDUM: Mr. Scott.\n\nMay 7, 1926.\n\nIn connection with the new school at Sioux Lookout, it will be necessary to supply this Institution with a suitable boat in order that they may transport their supplies, etc., from Sioux Lookout to the School, a distance of approximately seven miles. This covers a fairly wide sheet of water, and it will be necessary to supply a strong substantial boat. I believe that one similar to that purchased for McIntosh would best suit their purpose. The McIntosh boat is a plain, large, flat-bottom motor boat, with a good engine and is giving good satisfaction. I would suggest for your consideration, that a letter be written to Captain Edwards, Kenora, asking him to see what can be purchased in the way of a boat. He is well acquainted with the locality and knows exactly what is required. The McIntosh boat was purchased second hand on Lake Winnipeg. The cost will be approximately $1,800.00.\n\nARCHITECT.\nMay 7, 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Architect of the Department has reported that a motor boat will be required in connection with the new Indian Residential School at Sioux Lookout, and has suggested that one similar to that in use at the McIntosh School should meet the requirements for Sioux Lookout. Will you please make inquiries and let me know if a boat can be purchased similar to the McIntosh one, and what would be the cost.\n\nThere is no particular hurry regarding this matter, but you can look into it at your earliest convenience.\n\nFor obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. Wilson,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Paget\nChief Accountant.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nSir,\n\nOn the first of May, in company with the Rev. Claude Secret, I inspected the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nThe outside work is proceeding rather slowly owing to the cold weather prevailing of late, but on the whole the progress since the beginning of construction has been quite satisfactory.\n\nMr. Simmons, the contractor, had written Mr. Orr, our architect, regarding the installation of a water-storage tank etc.\n\nThe Material for the fire-escapes is on the ground.\n\nThe Chapel is sheeted in and the interior work now being done.\n\nPlastering is complete in the residence and stairways, and half-done in the main building.\n\nMetal ceiling is complete for two floors and painted on the second floor.\n\nOutside painting is finished, except for the back of the main building and the chapel.\n\nLathing is complete except in the chapel.\n\nTrimming and inside finishing on the two upper floors and the residence is partly done.\n\nThe outside walls are cement-plastered, and the contractor is back filling.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nAll metal roofs are complete except for the chapel.\n\nBrick chimneys are complete except the last staging of the furnace chimney.\n\nThe plumbers are installing radiators.\n\nI note that our architect Mr. Orr will be down this month, and I shall hold myself in readiness to meet him at Sioux Lookout.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nR/A\nSir,\n\nOn the 12th inst. I inspected the new Indian Residential School at Sioux Lookout. The work there is proceeding in a satisfactory manner.\n\nThe plastering of walls on three floors is complete, and the basement browned. Part of the cement floor is poured in. The concrete stairs are poured in. Trimming is complete on the carpenter work of the top floors. The second flooring on two upper floors is now complete. The main stairs are being set up.\n\nAll inside ceilings are on, metal work on two floors is painted, and all outside metal work complete. Most of the radiators are connected, and about half of the plumbing fixtures are in place. Fire escapes are installed.\n\nThe cement foundations of the barn appear to have been touched by frost, and may not receive the approval of our architect, but I shall point this out to him when he is inspecting the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nE/A\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWhen I laid out the new buildings for the Sioux Lookout School, I promised Captain Edwards, the Indian Agent, and Doctor Westgate that if possible I would again visit Sioux Lookout when the buildings were nearing completion, in order to make the final inspection. Captain Edwards was anxious that I should make these arrangements as he was acting as Inspector of Construction on the work, and wished to have me make the final inspection before the building was accepted.\n\nThe work at the School will be practically completed this month, and with your permission I will make the final inspection leaving Ottawa on the night of June 1st. I am setting this date in order that I will be here on the 3lst of May when the tenders close for the schools on the Pelican Reserve.\n\nArchitect.\nMay 19th, 1926.\n\nDear Captain Edwards\u2014\n\nI am arranging to leave Ottawa on the night of June 1st for Sioux Lookout, and I will arrive there at noon on Thursday, June 3rd. It is my intention to leave that night for my return trip. This will give me the entire afternoon and evening to inspect the work. If you can conveniently arrange to meet me on this date I will appreciate same. Please let Mr. Simmons and Doctor Westgate know in case they wish to be present.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. Gurney Orr,\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nCaptain Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nR. G. Orr, Esq.,\nRoom 701, Booth Building,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nI sent you a set of blue prints yesterday of a piggery which we have found to be the most economical in construction of any used on our Experimental Farm System. We have another style with a driveway down the centre which is decidedly more expensive to build. The one of which I have sent blue prints may be extended in either direction from the feed room or may be extended in both directions. I would suggest that a farrowing pen be placed next to the feed room on either side if the piggery is to be extended both ways as this make it possible to make use of any warmth that may come from the cooking. If you desire further information you could call Mr. Nicholson, our Draughtsman, here who would be glad to discuss the structure with you.\n\nThe Poultry Division promised to send you blue prints of the one-hundred-hen poultry house. No doubt, they will send them but if they fail to arrive within a day or two you might call the Poultry Division at the Farm and ask them to hurry them along.\n\nTrusting that this will be of service to you, I am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief,\nDivision of Extension and Publicity.\nMay 20, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Simmons,\n\nI am sending you herewith a copy of a plan of a pigsty and hen house, as prepared by the Central Experimental Farm here.

Gurney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect for the Indian Department,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nWith further reference to my letter of the 3rd inst., and your reply on Apr. 6th I beg to submit the following information relative to outbuildings, etc., required at the Sioux Lookout School:\n\n1. The Ice House. One like that provided for the Chapleau School would in my opinion be the most suitable. It is about 18' x 18' (so far as I recollect) with over half of the space partitioned off for ice and the rest thickly boarded and otherwise suitably fitted up for cold storage of meat.\n\n2. The Poultry House. To accommodate about 200 fowls.\n\n3. The Piggery. To accommodate about 1 dozen pigs.\n\n4. An Implement shed. About the same dimensions as that supplied to the Old Sun school. This is I believe (I am quoting for memory) about 90' long. The one for the Sioux Lookout school should certainly be not less than 70' long. If it were made 90' long, part of it could be used for storing fire wood for the Kitchen range.\nI had hoped to be able to submit to you plans for each of these buildings, but have not yet received these from the Manitoba Agricultural College to whom I made application some days ago. Should these come to hand in the near future, I am leaving instructions for them to be forwarded to you as I myself am leaving the City this evening and will be absent some days.\n\nVery kind regards, Believe me,\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/JF.\n\nDictated but not personally signed because of absence from the office.\nPORT ARTHUR SHIPBUILDING COMPANY\n\nA.B.

We will forward you today a copy of our catalogue. As we are the only builders of such boilers in this district and as we presume that it is either of the above types of boilers that will be installed in the building, we would like to request that \"Pascal\" boilers, or equal, be specified.\n\nOur boilers are well known and there are many of them installed from considerably East of Montreal to the Pacific Coast. There are a number of them in the Dominion Government, also Provincial Government buildings. All sales outside of a radius of some one hundred and fifty miles of Port Arthur are made by our Agents, for which reason, to date, we have not had any direct dealing with your Department, but we believe Pascal boilers were installed in one or more Indian Schools in Western Canada. We can also recall offhand that they were also installed in Postoffices at Regina and Kingston, Ontario.\n\nThere are no better boilers built by any firm in Canada, or the United States for that matter, and we hope, as a compliment to a firm in the constituency for which the building referred to is to be built, you can meet the above request to have our boilers specified.\n\nWe are sending this same letter and one of our catalogues to Mr. R.G.

H. Simmons of Winnipeg at Sioux Lookout, Ont. The work on the building is exceedingly well done, and the Department has a building that is well constructed in all its details.\n\nWATER SUPPLY SYSTEM.\n\nWhile at Sioux Lookout, I obtained the necessary information for the installing of a water supply system for this building. It will consist in the erection of an elevated tower and water tank, the supplying and installing of a 4\" water service from the lake to the school building, a distance of approximately 400 ft., a 3\" service from the building to the water tank, a distance of approximately 214 ft., and the supplying of a 2\" water connection to the barn. I have obtained a price from Mr. Simmons for this work which is $7,245.00. Using the elevated tank system there will be a good water supply in case of fire, and I have obtained a price of $300.00 for the installing of fire service to the outside corners of the school building, fitted with fire nozzles, valves, etc., complete. As these prices are fair and reasonable for the work I beg to recommend that Mr. Simmons be authorized to proceed with this installation.\n\nELECTRIC LIGHTING SYSTEM.\n\nWhile in Sioux Lookout I visited the office of the Superintendent of the Canadian National Railways, in order to see if it would be possible to obtain power for the school from their generating plant at Sioux Lookout. I could not get anything definite and I, therefore, left the matter in the hands of Capt. Edwards, who will submit a report to the Department as soon as the Engineers of the Canadian National railways advise him whether they will be in a position to supply the school with power or not.\nI also obtained from Mr. Simmons a price for the installation of the electric lighting plant in the school, and as soon as I receive the report from Capt. Edwards, I will be in a position to make a recommendation.\n\nFourteen acres of land have been cleared on which is located the new school and barn, but a greater acreage than this will be required in order that the school may start farming and gardening operations, and I instructed the Indian Agent to obtain and submit to the Department prices for the clearing of approximately 35 acres more. I would suggest that the portion to be cleared be selected on that part of the property where the least work will be required to put it into condition for farming. A few small out buildings will be required, and I obtained a price from Mr. Simmons for the following which I think are necessary:\n\n- Ice House, $590.00\n- Implement shed, $395.00\n- Chicken house, $830.00\n\nI consider the above prices fair and reasonable and I would recommend that Mr. Simmons be authorized to build same. If you approve of my recommendations regarding the water supply system and the out buildings, Mr. Simmons should be notified at the earliest possible date, as he has practically completed his work at the school, and will be moving his equipment.\n\nARCHITECT.\nDF KENORA ONT JUNE 18-26\n\nR GURNEY ORR\nARCHITECT DEPT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS OTTAWA ONT\n\nFOLLOWING FROM RAILWAY COMPANY STOP DISTANCE OF NEW\nSCHOOL TOO GREAT FROM YOUR LIGHTING PLANT AT SIOUXLOOKOUT TO\nCONSIDER FURNISHING ELECTRIC LIGHT FROM THAT SOURCE MOST ECON-\nOMIC PROPOSITION WOULD BE FOR YOU TO INSTALL SMALL OIL ENGINE\nGENERATOR SET SIGNED J GORD STOP PLEASE INSTRUCT SIMMONS\nDIRECT I WILL BE ABSENT ON TREATY\n\nFRANK EDWARDS\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 1)\nJ.

Gurney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nI arrived here yesterday evening, and have this day visited the site of the new School and examined the land and buildings. As you yourself contemplate a visit to this School in the near future I beg to submit the following observations and suggestions for your consideration.\n\nThe Land.\n\nWith regard to the land I find that only fourteen acres have been cleared. A greater acreage than this will be required for farming and gardening purposes, especially for growing oats and hay for the horses and cattle, and I would recommend that a total of, say, fifty acres be cleared, that is another thirty-six acres in addition to the fourteen mentioned.\n\nAs the stumps have not been removed from the land already cleared, and the land cannot be cultivated until this is done, I beg to recommend that a contract be let for their removal during this summer.\n\nThe lower land to the S.W. of the main School building will be valuable for gardening purposes if drainage is provided, and I beg to suggest that an open ditch be dug from the centre of this land to the natural outlet which is the bay on the west side of the school site.\n\nAs the levelling up of the grounds around the main School building will be too great an undertaking for the School management to handle, the contract for this work...\nmight, it seems to me, be included along with that for the additional clearing and the drainage already mentioned.\n\nThe provision of a wagon road from the School to the Pelican Station is a matter of urgent importance, and this also might conveniently be included in the same contract.\n\nWood for Fuel.\n\nThe provision of wood fuel for next winter is a matter about which I am much concerned. The trees on the cleared area have been stripped of their branches, but have not been cut up into cordwood lengths. Unless this is done in the immediate future, and the bigger logs split and piled up to dry, it will be very difficult, if not impossible to keep the school properly heated next winter. As a help to the solution of this problem I should like to suggest that an engine and pole saw be provided at once for the use of the School, but that the work of cutting up the poles into cordwood lengths be included in the contract for clearing, drainage, levelling, etc.\n\nFencing.\n\nThe immediate need of fencing is not, to me, very apparent, and expenditure under this heading might remain over until next year when ample provision for the same should be made in the estimates.\n\nWharfage.\n\nThe construction of two wharves appears to me to be necessary. The best location for the larger of these is, as we have already thought, on the east side of the School site on the S.E. side of the farm. All heavy supplies which may require transportation by wagon to the School from this point should be landed at this wharf.\n\nAt one end of this wharf a boat-house, or weather-proof shelter, should also be built.\n\nA smaller wharf or landing platform should also be built near the big boulders on the shore in front of the School. This would be for \"passenger\" service only, and would eliminate the necessity for the lady agents on the staff and visitors to pass through or by the barn yard when arriving at or leaving the School by boat.\n\nTelephone\n\nThe installation of telephone connection with Sioux\nLockout via Pelican or any other way, seems to me to be a matter of first-rate importance, and I commend the same to your sympathetic consideration.\n\nThe Main School Building.\n\nThe workmanship on the Main School Building, so far as it was completed, appeared to me to have been well and carefully done, and I feel confident that, in due course, our General Secretary will convey to you, and to your Department, an expression of our Society's appreciation of the great pains you have taken in this connection.\n\nThere are, however, a few minor points to which I drew the attention of the contractor, and which he undertook to refer to you. These are as follows:\n\n1. The windows leading to the fire escapes instead of being on pulleys, and sliding up and down in two sections, would admit of a more rapid exit of staff and pupils in case of fire, if made of one piece and fastened on hinges. The alteration suggested would be inexpensive, and I trust you may authorize it.\n\n2. The cement floor in the fuel room, off the boiler-room, is very liable to be dug up by cordwood thrown in unless covered with coarse planks, and I beg to suggest that this plank flooring be installed.\n\n3. As hardwood flooring has not been provided, the fir flooring is certain to give way if the pupils are not obliged to leave their heavy boots in the recreation rooms in the basement. To do this conveniently cupboards for the heavy boots and heavy winter coats are a necessity in the recreation rooms, and I beg to suggest that they be installed. Some benches around the walls in the recreation rooms should also be provided. The provision of these would not involve so much expenditure while the contractors are on the spot as at a later date.\n\nThe lockers in the dormitories are about all that could be desired and I was very gratified to see that they had been provided.\n\nThe porch and platform at the main front entrance, might, it seems to me, have been enlarged with advantage, and I hope that at some future date this action may be taken.\n\nThe Barn\n\nThe barn, which had been erected, would, I felt,\nwhen completed provide adequate and comfortable accommodation for the horses and cattle. The cement used in the foundation did not appear to me to be as firm as it should be, and I trust that the flooring may be of better quality. In completing this building the need of passage ways in front of the mangers, a feed room, a harness room, and breeding stalls, should be kept in mind.\n\nOther Buildings.\n\nThe other buildings required have already been referred to in former communications addressed to you. Of these, it seems to me, that a poultry house, an ice house, and cold-storage room combined, and an implement shed should be provided this year. A piggery is also necessary, but this could be left over until next year, if necessary, in order that the provision of all the other requirements mentioned above may not be delayed.\n\nI regret that my letter has reached so great a length, but you will understand, I think, the importance of the various items referred to, and which have necessitated the same. I trust that you yourself may be able to visit the School in the near future and give to the matters to which I have referred the careful attention which, I feel certain, you will recognize they deserve.\n\nWith very kind regards, Believe me,\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.G.\n\nTERW/JF.\nMay 29th, 1926\n\nDear Mr. Simmons,\n\nI have received your letter of the 25th instant, enclosing prices for the building of a pigsty and barn house at the Sioux Lookout School. I do not care to recommend the erection of these buildings at such a cost. I am of the opinion that we should be able to build a suitable barn house for not more than $400.00, and a pigsty for around $3,500.00. I will discuss these plans with you when I meet you at Sioux Lookout. In the meantime if you have a chance to figure on what we could erect that would be suitable for the above mentioned amounts it would be of some assistance.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nRe: GURNEY OHL,\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nJ.

The price on the piggery building is higher than I expected it would have been. I have only allowed the usual profit in figuring this work.\n\nI have the Lester Co. estimating on the Electrical equipment required for the Pelican school. I will most likely hold this figure until I meet you at Sioux Lookout, as you will be leaving Ottawa before the tender could reach you. The Lester Co.'s expert was in the office yesterday and was sizing up the Engine etc required for the water supply system and Laundry. He states that his 12 H.P. engine will do all the work required, including running the water pump and running the laundry outfit.\n\nI will have the figures on the water supply system and the elevated tank ready by the time you arrive at Sioux Lookout.\n\nI will be at Sioux Lookout on June 3rd, the date you expect to arrive.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nS/T.\nJ.

Hen house (D) for 100 hens for the sum of $984.00\n\nJH Simmons\nMay 12, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Simmons,\n\nThanks for your letter and sketch showing the location of the water supply pipe line. You have omitted giving me the elevation of the basement floor where the pump will be located with reference to the water level in the lake. I would like to know what the lift will be, that is the difference in elevation between the water at the intake pipe and basement floor, where we intend to install the pump, in order that I may determine the style of pump necessary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. Gurney Ger,\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nJ. H. Simmons, Esq.,\n506 Confederation Life Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nMay 22, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Simmons,\n\nReplying to your letters with reference to the water supply system for the Sioux Lookout School, I would say that the bottom of the tank should be approximately 10 feet above the top of the roof of the main building, and it will be satisfactory for the supports to splay approximately 12 feet at the top to 30 feet at the bottom.\n\nThe pumping outfit required will be a Fairbanks Morse outfit No. 1591, which is a belt driven 5 x 5 Typhon pump, connected to a 3 H. P. \"Z\" type engine. This outfit is to be located in the machinery room, and the gasoline engine to be so arranged that it will connect with a line shaft for operating both the laundry machinery and the pump.\n\nThe elevated tank is to have the tank enclosed with a space approximately 24\" all round, including the bottom. This space will be connected by a shaft approximately 3 feet square to the ceiling of a small 8' x 8' house at the bottom, in which we will install a Quebec heater to supply heat in winter. The pipe of course will be enclosed in this heated shaft. All wood framing of the tower should be painted either before or after erection with a good coat of creosote. Your price should include the tank, pumping outfit, and all pipe line from the lake to the building, and from the building to the elevated tank; also a pipe line to supply water to the barn. I would also ask you to include the placing of two fire hydrants, one on the ground at each end of the building.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 1)\nWith reference to the electric lighting plant please quote me a separate price for the installation complete of a Lister-Bruston 6 K.W., 110 volt, automatic electric lighting plant. It will consist of a 6 K.W. generator, and a twin cylinder, 12 H.P. gas engine, switch board, batteries, etc. This outfit is handled in Winnipeg by the R.A. Lister Co. Ltd., and they are located on Wall Street. In figuring on the lighting plant you should also include a gasoline storage tank to be located in the ground outside the machinery room. The Lister Company will give you the size required. This machinery is of course to be located along with the pumping outfit in the machinery room which I believe provides ample accommodation.\n\nI expect to leave Ottawa on Tuesday, June 1st, for Sioux Lookout, and will arrive there on Thursday, June 3rd, at noon.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.E.

On account of the first layout received from my foreman not being definite enough, I had to wait for further information, hence the delay in forwarding sketch to your office.\n\nYou will notice the distance from the water tank to the building is 214 feet. This is the best location for the water tank unless it is built in a low spot.\n\nThe intake at the lake will be in deep water with the proper current.\n\nThe distance from the main hole or well to the intake is approx 96 feet. There will be more or less rock to contend with in this 96 ft. and likely quick sand and water which will require sheet piling.\n\nThe ground floor of building is approx. 7 feet above the ground at the water tank location.\n\nOn account of being the principal in a fatal motor accident, I have been unable to leave Winnipeg and visit the work personally, but I am sure my foreman with the help of Inspector Edwards have selected the best and most economic location available for the water tank and inlet for the water supply.\n\nThe school building should be practically completed this month except a few odd jobs. They are having real warm weather this week and are now pouring concrete floors in the basement.\n\nIf you intend making a trip west, and intend stopping off at Pelican, I would be pleased to have you advise me so I can be on the job when you arrive.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

On account of the same being in his report on this boat which was built for service between Sioux Lookout and Pine Ridge was not satisfactory. It had many unsatisfactory features, one of which was that it possessed so powerful an engine (36 H.P.) that it would impose a very heavy financial burden on our Society to provide it with gasoline. The cost of this boat I found to be $750.00, while the fuel costs $120.00.\n\nWhile at Sioux Lookout he examined all other boats which were available, and informed me that, in his opinion, there was one owned by Dr. Mitchell, nearly new, and which the Doctor was willing to sell for $1000.00. This boat which is well-known to you, Mr. Orono, and also to Captain McVea, our Agent at Kenora, is 25 feet long with 6' inch beam, and is provided with a 10-14 h.p. Red Wing engine. The engine alone cost $750.00 and is in good condition, as is also the hull and other parts. The Principal was altogether favourably impressed with the suitability of this boat for the school's need, and I beg to recommend that the same be purchased.\n\nAs a \"snow\" will also be necessary to bring, at times, certain supplies from Sioux Lookout, the Principal learned that this could be built, at a reasonable cost, by a local boat builder there. The Principal recommends that what is known as the \"Lumberman's Pointer\" be purchased as the most suitable craft of this kind and I beg to submit this recommendation for your favourable consideration. A Lumberman's Pointer, with capacity of about 2 or 2\u00bd tons would be sufficient.\n\nI regret that I am unable to furnish you with an estimate of the cost but am of the opinion that it would not exceed $500.00 if it amounted to so much.\n\n(Sgd.)

Doctor Scottgate, recommending that we purchase Dr. Mitchell's boat at a cost of $1,000.00 for the Sioux Lookout School. I cannot agree that this boat is of the type required as I think it is altogether too good a boat for the purpose for which it is intended, as it is really a pleasure boat.\n\nFor your information I am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter which has today been sent to Doctor Scottgate, in reply to his letter, and I still think that a boat similar to the one in which we made the trip to the school, but of more sturdy construction, would better answer this purpose.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.

Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the fifth instant with reference to the motor boat placed for the new Sioux Lookout School, I beg to say that I do not think the boat, named by Dr. Mitchell, is suitable for the school. This boat is a pleasure launch, and not rugged enough to stand up against the use that will be made of it by the school staff. When the Architect of the Department was at Sioux Lookout recently, he discussed the boat question with Capt. Edwards, and Capt. Edwards is familiar with the type of boat that the Department considers most satisfactory for the school use. It would be well, therefore, for you to communicate with Captain Edwards regarding this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. B. Holmes,\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. D.

I inspected the Indian Residential School at Sioux Lookout.\n\nWork on the building at present is not proceeding very fast, since the contractor says he is waiting for some material from British Columbia.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Marshall, the principal, is on the ground and is taking much interest in the work. He is writing me a letter covering many points we discussed, and on receipt of the same I shall write you at further length.\n\nI received a letter from Rev. Dr. Westgate strongly recommending the purchase of Dr. Mitchell's boat at Sioux Lookout for this institution. It can be secured for $1,000.00 and is in every way suitable for towing the new building which could be done on day labour under the superintendence of Mr. Marshall if he had authority to purchase the necessary materials.\n\nMr. Orr knows this boat well, and I would accordingly recommend its purchase at the earliest opportunity as it is urgently needed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nH/A\nJuly 22, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to the Indian Residential School at Sioux Lookout. With regard to the purchase of Mr. Mitchell's boat it is not considered that this boat is the type most suitable for the school. A plainer type of boat of substantial construction, similar to that built by the boat building at Sioux Lookout would better answer the purpose, and I would ask you to please communicate with this boat builder whom you interviewed when Mr. Orr was at Sioux Lookout, and ascertain for what price he is prepared to build a boat similar to the one he is using at the present time, but of more sturdy construction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFrank Bizard, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKemora, Ont.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nCANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY COMPANY'S TELEGRAPH\n\nTELEGRAM\n\nCABLE CONNECTIONS TO ALL THE WORLD\n\nAS RA.J. 47 N.\n\nWINNIPEG MAN JULY 25-26\n\nTHE SECRETARY DEPT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\n\nOTTAWA.\n\nPRINCIPAL MARSHALL SIOUTLOOKOUT IS A PRACTICAL BUILDER HE WANTS CONCRETE FLOORS AND MANGERS IN BARN COST FOR FLOORS ABOUT SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS, MANGERS WOULD INCREASE THIS AMOUNT ALSO ASKS FOR IRON STANCHIONS INSTEAD OF WOOD, REQUEST SEEMS REASONABLE AND CONTRACTOR COULD COMPLETE IMMEDIATELY PLEASE WIRE TO KENORA.\n\nFRANK EDWARDS.\n\n4:32AM JULY 26\n\nIndian Affairs.

In this regard, Mr. Bunn, at our consultation, wrote a wire from me to you, copy of which is enclosed herewith. I asked a reply by wire since the instructions for this work must reach the contractor before the erection of stanchions.\n\nThe principal asks for the installation of cupboards in the three staff-rooms and the residential kitchen, also shelving in store room and clothes room to be done by the contractor before leaving, unless we allow the principal a carpenter for a time for the necessary work, we to supply the material.\n\nThe principal would like to have the contractor instructed to make a dock.\n\nThe principal says water-pipes should be boxed as eventually done at Norway House, and sunk at least eight feet to avoid subsequent expense.\n\nThe principal's request for a root-house might be attended to later on, since the only place for present storage of vegetables is the cellar of the residence.\n\nThe contractor expects to be finished at the end of this month. He has begun the tank and pipe-line. The lighting machinery is on the ground.\n\nThe frozen concrete in the barn is replaced and the walls plastered after scraping to the principal's satisfaction.\n\nEnc.

To do the above would require about 2,000 feet of one inch dressed lumber, also two inch dressed planking, 2x2's and 2x4's, and panel doors as in the kitchen cupboards.\n\nSidewalk: The principal requires 1,000 feet of 2\" planking for a walk at the front and sides of the school.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nR/A\n\nIndian Affairs. (NO 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nof the school.\n\nPews: These are needed for the chapel.\n\nLinoleum: Battleship linoleum is required for all halls and passages.\n\nIt is impossible to estimate exactly the amounts of materials required for the foregoing work, but I would respectfully suggest that the principal be authorised to get the lumber and materials to an approximate value of $500, with authority to employ a carpenter for two or three weeks to do the necessary work. The shelving etc. are absolutely necessary, and in this way the work would be done to the satisfaction of the principal at minimum cost.\n\nDeck: The materials required for this would be about 600 feet of 2\" planking, the necessary logs etc. to be cut on the school property. A small dock, about 100 feet by fifty feet would suffice for the time being, but later another dock and boat house will have to be built. This dock new proposed, in addition to the timber and lumber mentioned, will require 100 lbs of 4\" spikes and 150 lineal feet of \u00bd\" iron drift bolts, and would take about five days to build.\n\nWater pipes: Referring to my letter of July 26th. on this subject, these pipes should be boxed, as the contractor has struck rock near the water's edge, and there will have to be much filling and some blasting.\n\nTeam: The principal requests the immediate purchase of a team, and of a small number of cattle and poultry when the school is occupied. I would suggest that Mr. Inspector Bunn be asked to buy the team, wagons, etc. and have the same shipped as soon as possible.\n\nImplement shed and ice-house: These have been completed by the contractor but are not yet painted.\n\nChicken house: The concrete for this has been poured and the other materials are on the ground.\n\nSeptic tank: This is complete, along with the sewer to the lake.\n\nLaundry: All machinery for this is installed.\n\nBarn and outbuildings: Instructions should be given to the contractor to wire the barn, which needs three lights upstairs and ten below. The necessary lights should be installed in the implement shed and chicken house. Water should be laid to the barn and a plank trough built in the barn.\n\nElectric lamps for building: Should these be supplied by the contractor, or should we purchase them?\n\nStump Puller: The principal has asked for one of them. Could Mr. Inspector Bunn purchase this?\nHot water heater: This is a coal burner. Would it be feasible to change or convert it to burn wood?\n\nRev. Mr. Marshall accompanied me to Winnipeg on Sunday last and we discussed matters with Mr. Inspector Bunn, but were unable to get in touch with Mr. Smith, the contractor, and I am not informed of the costs of these various improvements, but all of them are absolutely necessary and not unduly expensive. If general authority were given me I would arrange to have the work done, keeping expenses as low as possible. My annuity payments are now over, and I am getting more time for this work.\n\nCompletion of the school should be rushed, so that children can be admitted in September, since otherwise the Indians go off to their trapping grounds and are hard to get.\n\nRev. Mr. Marshall showed a list of utensils needed, which has been sent to the Department, but this list was far from complete. He is therefore making an additional list which will be submitted at an early date. He would also like to have plans and blueprints showing the school property.\n\nI should be glad to receive instructions on the matters mentioned above at the earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nElliot Bros.\nBoat and Snow-Shoe Manufacturers\nRepair Work a Specialty\n\nSioux Lookout, Ont., July 30, 1926\n\nMr. F.

Elliott Bros.\nReference your letter #129-6-5 of 5th instant re launch for the Sioux Lookout School.\n\nI looked over all boats at Sioux Lookout that might be suitable for the school, and do not think any of them are more suitable than Dr Mitchell's boat however I informed Mr Marshall of the contents of the Departmental letter quoted above, and he said he would not be satisfied with any other boat, I therefore told him he better write me a letter which I could forward to you, I am today in receipt of the letter which I am forwarding herewith, and should like to get further instructions.\n\nI also enclose Elliotts letter, in which they say they would not be able to build another boat this fall.\n\nThe Principal also requests permission to purchase a swing saw, and encloses Messrs Waterous' tender, from which you will see the outfit can be purchased for $77, without the frame and counter weight which could be made at the school. I would recommend this purchase to cut the logs into cordwood for heating, the logs are very large and heavy and this machine can be run from the tractor, and is the most suitable for the purpose.\n\nAwaiting further instructions,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nIndian Affairs.

Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn looking over the many boats offered for Sale, ten in all, we come down to two: one owned by Elliott Bros. and the other by Dr Mitchell. I have made a special investigation into the cost of the power plant of the Mitchell boat and find the prices are as follows:\n\n1 10-14 Model D Engine 4 cylinder 4 cycle Propeller and shaft, cost at Winnipeg.............. $494.10\nElectric starter.......................... $168.75\nCopper exhaust and couplings............. $60.00\nGas tank & strainer....................... $20.00\nSide lights red and green, stern lights and spot light. Cannot obtain price in Winnipeg\nDeck cover for boat....................... $24.00\n\nThis, amounting (without prices on lights) to $746.85, leaving a balance of about $250.00 for the rest of the boat.\n\nIt seems to me the greatest and best bargain of them all as the boat is worth around sixteen hundred dollars and could not be bought for that amount from the builders, but owing, as you know to the Doctor's druggist decamping with his store funds, the Doctor is obliged to sacrifice other things as well as the boat to cover the loss.\n\nThe hull is built of the best material, bottom of heavier planking than sides, all of Cedar, Oak frame and combings with deck of Cedar, all in the best condition.\nCaptain F. Edwards\n\nThe Elliott Bros. Boat is much the same model but built of Cyprus planking on an Ash frame with deck and combing of Fir, with canvas covered deck. It has a Niagara engine 9-12 H.P., rebuilt engine, gas tank, no strainer, rear hand starter, no lights, but if equipped with a new engine such as the 10-12 H.P. Medium Duty Scripps engine the whole outfit would then class with that of Dr. Mitchell's boat and I believe that the Doctor would consider letting his go for even $950.00.\n\nThis is a full report as far as I can obtain prices and as I have lived the last twenty years with boats, should have some experience and personally, if the Department put a good boat in, it would be better taken care of than one bought for rough work and I cannot see any reason for putting on a semi-freight boat when all supplies could come via Pelican when the C.N.R. have granted the switch, which means a saving in time and cartage.\n\nAm also enclosing prices on saw outfit, the balance of the platform can be built at the School. I would strongly recommend this outfit as the timber is too large to handle on a pole-saw, frame too light. With this outfit the wood could be cut into the lengths required for stoves in School and residence and as the fire boxes in the furnaces only take a 3'8\" stick it means 400 cords have to be cut for heating purposes as well.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.F.J.

Their traveller called at my office today and I outlined to him the requirements of a boat suitable for the school, and he suggests and recommends the boat described in the accompanying circular. This boat is 26 ft. long, and will be equipped with side seats and lockers in place of the chairs shown. It has a speed of 15 miles an hour, and the Ford marine engine gives nine miles to the gallon of gasoline. He showed me letters from parties who have purchased this boat and it appears to have given absolute satisfaction. More mileage is obtained by the gallon of gasoline than with any other type of engine, also all the parts are standard and can be readily obtained in case they require renewing. I am advised that they keep these boats in stock and can ship immediately on receipt of an order. I would therefore be glad to hear from you by return mail advising me if you will be satisfied with this boat.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. Gurney Orr,\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nRev.

Marshall\nFor some time I have been looking for a suitable boat, that is required for the new Sioux Lookout School, Sioux Lookout, Ont., and I beg to recommend for your consideration that we purchase a Sidleyford motorboat. This boat is substantially built, and is equipped with a Ford marine engine. It is the ideal type of boat for the purposes for which it will be required in connection with the Sioux Lookout School. The Ford marine engine is a very economical engine to operate, and if any repairs are required the cost is the least of any type of marine engine. This boat is manufactured by the Gidlay Boat Co. Ltd., of Penetang, and they have several in stock. Their price on a 26 foot boat is $1,350.00. This price is very reasonable for the boat, and I beg to recommend that it be purchased, with instructions to ship to the school at the earliest possible date, as they are in urgent need of same. I may say that the school is located a distance of approximately 8 miles by water from Sioux Lookout station.\n\nIt is customary to get competitive prices and it will be necessary to get Mr. M.O.'s approval to depart from this rule. The season for purchasing boats has practically closed.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In a letter of even date addressed to you I have recommended the purchase of a Tractor, etc. If your Department will purchase the Tractor therein recommended, it would provide the motor power for cutting wood, but a sawing outfit would have to be purchased.\n\nIn view of the nearness of winter and the heavy nature of the timber to be cut into wood, I beg to recommend that the outfit recommended by the Watrous Engine Co., of Winnipeg through Mr. Inspector Bunn and Mr. Indian Agent Edwards, be purchased at the earliest date possible and forwarded to the School, in order that the male staff agents may begin at once to cut the winter's fuel supply.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.O.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It has occurred to me, however, that if it is going to take some time to get this pipe line installed, some temporary arrangements should be made in order to supply water to the school. I understand at present that they have not even the heating boilers filled, and that the building is without heat.

Mr. Marshall, so far as his memory serves him, believes the Department stated that they would deal with this matter at a later date. It seems to me that if the siding is not installed and the store room built before winter sets in, there will be no chance of having this work done by the C.N.R. before next spring. This will place the school management in a very awkward position, as the only place where supplies could be landed would be along the route and transported from there to the school would out of the question. The experience of the contractor last winter in trying to freight material over the ice when everything was lost, serves as a warning to us in this respect. I should like to suggest that you bear pressure on the Department to have this work done at once, and not writing to them direct, but am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Gray, whose address is to be seen from Kenora and my letter's delayed in reaching you. You should, I think, point out to the Department that the building of the store room could be accomplished much cheaper by the contractor who is now at the school, than by giving the work to another firm. Mention should be made of the annual rental ($825) the C.N.R. will collect. Kind regards.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.B.R. Westgate,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTERV/JF.\nSir,\n\nOn the 28th ult.

H. Attwood.\n\nRe - Sioux Lookout Indian School Water Supply.\n\nMr. Johnston's letter of October 2nd stated that the Department of Indian Affairs had requested that this office take up with Mr. J. H. Simmons, contractor for the new Indian School at Sioux Lookout, the question of the water supply of the school, with reference to the proper protection of it from frost. After discussing the matter with Mr. Simmons it was considered advisable that an inspection of the conditions be made, and on October 11th Mr. Simmons and the undersigned left Winnipeg for Sioux Lookout and on the day following visited the school and in company with the Principal, Rev. Mr. Marshall, made an inspection.\n\nThe school is about one mile north of Pelican on the Canadian National Railway and stands on rising land some 150 feet from the shore of Pelican lake, from which the water supply for the school is to be taken. The water supply system, which is already installed with the exception of the intake pipe into the lake, comprises a suction pipe from the lake to the pump located in the school basement, and from here the water is pumped to an elevated tank located outside the school.\n\nIn discussing the matter, Mr. Marshall stated that the only part of the system which he was afraid would be damaged by frost was the last 50 feet of the suction pipe to the lake, which is already laid, and the proposed intake pipe into the lake. Both Mr. Marshall and Mr. Simmons stated that the balance of the water mains had over five feet of covering and were amply protected from frost. It is therefore only this last 50 feet of the suction pipe and the installation of the intake upon which we have been asked for and given advice.\n\nAs the danger from frost to the fifty feet of suction pipe is due to lack of sufficient covering, it is recommended that this section be taken up and laid to a depth which will give a minimum covering of four and a half feet to the present ground level, and additional feet of covering to be given by grading. As the additional excavation will be rock it was suggested that two additional feet of covering might be added by grading, but Mr. Marshall stated that for the sake of the appearance of the grounds he could only increase the ground level in this vicinity by one foot.\nThe proper protection of the intake from frost and damage by ice calls for fairly extensive work due to the shelving nature of the lake bottom which is rock, and to the present high water level which today is three and a half feet higher than the recorded low level. To provide for a depth of water of four feet over the intake, which is considered the safe minimum, it will be necessary, in view of the low stages recorded, to lay the pipe to a point which will give at the present lake stage, a covering of at least seven and a half feet of water. This depth is reached at a distance of about 80 feet from the shore. The shelving bottom of the lake necessitates the excavation of a trench in order to secure the proper grade and sufficient covering for the intake pipe. If the bottom can not be in rock this work will call for a cofferdam some 90 feet long and owing to the necessary blasting, at least 15 feet wide.\n\nIt is proposed that this cofferdam be left in place and the pipe covered with earth to a depth of five feet with the remaining space in the cofferdam to be filled in with rock or earth.\n\nIn addition to the above it is recommended that an intake well five feet square and from eight to ten feet deep be constructed at a point twenty feet from the present shore line. As shown on the enclosed sketch, the intake pipe runs a short distance below the bottom of the well, with the suction pipe about a foot above the intake. With the intake well a certain amount of control is given over the suction pipe and the intake and any trouble occurring in either could be more readily located and remedied. Though not essential it is considered that the advantages secured by having the well more than offset the additional expense.\n\nAs outlined above it is apparent that the installation of the intake will be, for a small water system, quite expensive, but with the shelving lake bottom and the present high water this expense cannot be avoided if a proper job is to be made to assure a reasonable measure of protection from freezing and damage from ice. While the intake is under construction a temporary supply of water may be obtained by connecting up the end of the present main to the lake by means of a two inch pipe, this pipe to be drained each night to avoid freezing.\n\nJ. CRAIG,\nAssistant District Chief Engineer.\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing a memorandum from Mr. Craig containing his recommendations to protect the intake and the lower fifty feet of the water supply system of the Indian Mission School at Sioux Lookout, as requested in your letter of October 14th.\n\nMr. Craig inspected this site and states that while providing the intake with a reasonable protection against freezing will no doubt be expensive, that due to local conditions there is no other alternative. You will readily appreciate that any of the measures, if done under winter conditions, will greatly increase the cost and for this reason it is recommended that the work be done within the next three weeks, or before freeze-up.\n\nAs instructed by your telegram of even date, I have instructed the contractor, Mr. Simmons, to proceed with the work as outlined in your telegram. Mr. Simmons stated to me that he thought the work could be done within a period of two or three weeks and that he would place the work in charge of men familiar with that type of work and provide all the tools necessary in an endeavour to have the job finished before freeze-up. Under the circumstances therefore, it is essential that a decision be arrived at immediately regarding that portion of the pipe line which will be in the water and that decision wired to me.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

Attwood,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\n\nEncs.\n\nThe Director,\nDominion Water Power & Reclamation Service,\nDept. of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nYour file number: 129-6-5.\n\nRe: Sioux Lookout Indian School\nWater Supply.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th instant regarding the water supply system at the Sioux Lookout Indian residential school I enclose herewith a copy of the engineer's report on the protection of the water supply from frost, together with a copy of Mr. Attwood's letter of transmittal. Please note that Mr. Attwood states that it is essential that a decision be arrived at immediately regarding the portion of the pipe line which will be in the water, and asks that the decision be wired to him. I shall be glad, therefore, to have your instructions as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer\n\nMr. J.D.

I beg to state therefore, that in view of this information I am engaging one extra day labourer at the same rate as you have allowed for the other men who have been engaged, namely $50.00 a month, and am asking him to proceed to the School at the beginning of next week.

On this part they have struck boulders as anticipated, and this is of course harder to handle than solid rock.\n\nThe heater for the water tank has been sent as per authority Department letter 129-6-5 of 9th instant.\n\nThe saw and outfit has also been forwarded, this was delayed as the Waterous Company had to send East for the saw.\n\nThe Principal asks that delivery of the sleigh be rushed, so I took the matter up with Inspector Bunn and this will be attended to at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa,\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOn Saturday the 4th inst. I inspected Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School. The contractor's men had finished their work and left on Thursday.\n\nThe Cofferdam is complete.\n\nAt the request of the Principal the contractor had done a little extra work as follows:\u2014installing two laundry tubs in the basement of the principal's residence, extending water-pipes in the stable, and installing a valve and fire-line at the water-tank, to let water be drawn off outside, for fire purposes. Mr. Simmons asks me if these items could be included in the next certificate, as his only authority is the principal's request. These additional things I consider were absolutely necessary, and I have advised him to include them.\n\nThe Saw has been received at the school, and the water-tank, boiler, plough and dough-mixer are en route. Material for the blankets has arrived, most of the equipment is in, and the principal is sending things up as quickly as possible.\n\nRev. Dr. Westgate informs me that they have bought a car-load of coal from the J. Murphy Co. of Fort William at $16.60 per ton F.O.B. Pelican. He is also getting a price on soft coal, claiming he has the necessary authority from the Department. The coal will be used for the heaters in the water-tank and the laundry. The principal says he must use a certain amount in the school furnace this winter, as the wood cut last winter is not yet quite dry, and there has been little time to draw out dry wood. After this winter there will be little need for soft coal. The principal requests that I give him two barrows (steel pan type) for the coal, as well as six medium size coal scoops. He has ordered coat-hooks for the cupboards in the dormitories. The above-mentioned articles are all necessary, and I should be glad if you would ask Mr. Inspector Bunn to purchase the barrows and scoops.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nbarrows and scoops.\n\nMr. Marshall says he received 45 bedsprings 2'6\" x 4'6\", but claims they were too short and should all be 2'6\" x 6'0\". He says he interviewed Mr. Brownley of the Simmons Bedding Co. of Winnipeg, and thinks the company would make the exchange without further charge except for freight, as the company might dispose of the smaller springs to children's homes.\n\nElectric Lights. In this connection the principal is awaiting the arrival of the dough-mixer, which is now at Pelican station. The electrical company will then send down a man to meet the inspector of electrical installation, and the lights and power could be turned on.\n\nThe water is not yet turned on, as the principal is waiting for the tank-heater. In this connection I am a little afraid that the very cold weather prevailing may cause tank troubles.\n\nSeating for Chapel. I do not know if this has been ordered yet, but the principal would like to get it from the Valley City Seating Co. of Dundas, Ont., as he has experience of this type, and would have no trouble assembling it.\n\nI shall send in the contractor's certificate immediately on receipt.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nR/A\n15.

I have to request that you will arrange for the purchase of a wheelbarrow of a type considered satisfactory for the purpose for which it is required. The purchase should be made to the best advantage. You should obtain an itemized account, in duplicate, which you should certify in the usual manner and send to the Department, when payment will be made.\n\nA 9' flag is being sent you for the use of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Marshall,\nIndian Residential School,\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAt the time of my last visit to the Sioux Lookout School, viz., Nov. 25th and 26th, the floors of the boiler, fuel and engine rooms were being flooded with water which came in through the joints between the sections of the metallic roof. The roof, being almost flat, the snow which melted by the heat of the sun in the day time, ran down to the end and froze during the night. The icy barrier thus formed continued to increase in thickness until it was fully six inches thick at the end at the time of my visit. As the snow melted on the chapel roof and came down on to the flat metal roof over the boiler and engine rooms, the ice thus formed held it up and the level rose until it found its way into the rooms underneath through the vertical joints between the metal sections. The Principal cut away the ice, but it formed again and the leaking process begins whenever the snow on the roof melts. A similar leakage is now going on, I understand, between the infirmary and the chapel, and will undoubtedly cause serious damage if not remedied.\n\nI am furnishing you with this information (1) in order that you may ascertain whether the roof has been completed in accordance with the plans and specifications and (2) that you may take whatever steps you consider necessary to have the roofs made water proof. It has been suggested that the soldering of the vertical joints between the metal sheets of roofing would be the best remedial course to take, and I would recommend that, unless you have some better remedy in view, this action be taken.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.O.\n\nIndian Affairs.

MARSHALL, Principal,\nIndian Residential School, Sioux Lookout, Ontario,\nLetter dated December 50th, 1926.\n\n\"For your information we have neither water or light at the present time owing to some part of the electrical equipment being shipped \"Lake and Rail\" in November and was caught in the freeze up in the St. Mary River and only arrived here on Dec. 23rd. The electrician will be down from Winnipeg right after the New Year to complete the installation of the plant and we feel then that we will be able to take in children.\"\nJ. H. SIMMONS\nGENERAL CONTRACTOR\n\nWINNIPEG, MAN. Jan. 7th, 1927.\n\nR. Gunney Orr Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nI am in receipt of yours of the 4th inst., with a copy of Dr. Westgate's letter with reference to the roof of the new Sioux Lookout School.\n\nThe roof over the Boiler, Fuel and Engine rooms was covered with galv. iron, lock joint construction. This roof did not leak during the heavy rainy period.\n\nOn account of the snow at the bottom of the roof freezing and turning to ice, there was no outlet for the water when the ice or snow thawed, consequently it seeped through the lock joints to a certain extent. If the roof cannot be kept clear of ice, I consider the only way to make it watertight is to solder the joints far enough up the roof to protect the joints against any water that may lie on the roof in the winter.\n\nDr. Westgate mentions a leak in the roof between the Infirmary and the Chapel. This trouble is over the Sun Room against the wall of the main building. I understand the snow and ice has formed on the roof of the sun room against the outside wall of the main building. This is caused by the drip from the main building roof falling on the snow on the roof of the Sun room until the ice forms to a thickness above the flashing on the outside wall.\n\nThis can be remedied by putting on new flashing high enough to take care of any ice that may form over the roof at this point. This part of the roof did not leak during the heavy rains in the fall.\n\nMr. Marshall the principal of the School was in my office a few weeks ago and mentioned about the leaks and the ice forming on the roof at these points. I explained to Mr. Marshall to keep the ice off the roof so that the water would have an outlet, and that I would have the roof attended to as soon as the weather was favorable.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJH Simmons\n\nIndian Affairs.

The accounts are, therefore, returned herewith, and you should have the Principal of the School, whom it is presumed placed the order, certify the accounts and forward them to the Department.

(RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nOn the 15th inst. I inspected the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nPiping\n\nSome of the steam piping in the dairy had been broken through frost and was repaired by the principal. A certain amount of piping and elbows is required for the drier in the laundry. This was not put in when the machine was installed, but Mr. Simmons assured me, in the course of our last visit to Winnipeg on the 17th inst., that this would be attended to by the numbers. The laundry fan had no spout, and this will be obtained from the manufacturers.\n\nRoof\n\nA certain amount of water leaks under the roof of the chapel and chapel, due to the freezing of moisture under the roof and to the water backing up, but nothing can be done until Spring, and the resulting damage is small.\n\nIce forms on the metal roof of the main building, and slides off when a thaw comes, having once damaged an iron fireplace, and in another case breaking the balconies of the school rooms. Mr. Simmons can not see any immediate remedy for this, but suggests the rigging of a wire screen to break up the snow into small pieces. Nothing could be done until Spring, but this year, of course, we have an exceptionally great amount of snow, with repeated thaws to make things still worse.\n\nElectric Lights\n\nThese are in operation and satisfactory.\n\nWater\n\nThis is not yet laid on, owing to the apparent presence of dirt in the pipes. When the principal recovers from influenza I think he will remedy this, as he understands the system.\n\nMost of the staff have been sick with flu. The housekeeper got up last Saturday after ten days in bed. Miss Johnson, one of the staff, quit owing to the school not being able to have pointed out to the principal and to Dr. Westgate the advisability of arresting recruiting until the work is caught up with. Beds, chapel seats and desks are not yet caught up, and there is much that should be done before pupils are taken in. Mr. Marshall needs a good, handy carpenter and perhaps another man to assist for a month or six weeks.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nor six weeks. He should also get a couple of Indians to cut and pile cordwood for the summer, as all these things should be attended to before receiving pupils. The school otherwise will not function properly, although the members already at the school are quite efficient. These matters were taken up with Dr. Westgate, who will see the principal when the latter is able to visit Winnipeg, perhaps this week.\n\nThe principal talked of a boat, and now suggests that Elliott Bros. be instructed to build a suitable hull, which I understand they would do for about $600.00. The principal also suggests that an engine be supplied for installation by the same firm. This, I believe, would be better than sending him a boat with which he might not be well satisfied.\n\nTwo boy pupils were at the school last Saturday, and two more expected to arrive last Monday, but I advised the principal not to accept any more until the completion of the various unfinished matters would enable him to look after them to good purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nE/A\nWINNIPEG Jan. 10th, 1927\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDr. to\nR.

This contract, the amount of which is given on the certificate as $12,799.00, is apparently a new one made with Mr. Simmons for work not included in the specifications of the former contract.

(RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 1)\nFebruary 11, 1927\n\nHis Excellency\nThe Governor General in Council,\n\nThe undersigned begs to refer to an order of His Excellency in Council, P.C., 1926, October 31st, 1926, awarding the contract for the construction of the Sioux Lookout Residential Indian School at a cost of $81,755.00, chargeable to the appropriation for Indian Education to J.H. Simms, General Contractor, Winnipeg, who was the lowest of five tenders.\n\nWhen the tenders were called for the exact location of the school or the chosen site was not determined and it was impossible to estimate the cost of certain necessary works and services which were consequently not provided for in the original contracts. As soon as the necessary information as to levels and elevations for the water supply was ascertained, plans and specifications were prepared on which Mr. Simms was asked to submit a price. The amount quoted by him was $12,700.00 covering elevated tank, water supply and fire service, including plant and transmission, farm building and so forth. This was reported to be fair and reasonable by the architect of the Department and the contractor was authorized to proceed with the work. It was understood that the operations should continue and as Mr. Simms had his equipment on the ground and in consideration, moreover, of the isolation of the locality, in an unsettled part of interior, it was not practicable to call in outside competition for these additions.\n\nIn the circumstances, the undersigned has the honour to recommend that authority be granted for the expenditure of the sum of $12,700.00 as aforesaid.

The procedure in his matter was usual, but the Auditor-General for the first time, asked the Department to obtain the authority of council for the additional expenditure. This school is situated in an unsettled part of Ontario where building operations are necessarily difficult and it would not have been in the interest of the Department to have made a separate contract for these necessary adjuncts for the main building.\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General on the 21st FEBRUARY 1927.\n\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 11th February, 1927, from the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, with reference to Order in Council (P.C.1861) dated October 21st, 1925, awarding the contract for the construction of the Sioux Lookout Residential Indian School at a cost of $61,755, chargeable to the appropriation for Indian Education, to J. H. Simmons, General Contractor, Winnipeg, who was the lowest of five tenderers.\n\nWhen the tenders were called for, the exact location of the school on the chosen site was not determined and it was impossible to estimate the cost of certain necessary works and services which were consequently not provided for in the original contract. As soon as the necessary information as to levels and elevations for the water supply was ascertained, plans and specifications were prepared on which Mr. Simmons was asked to submit a price. The amounts quoted by him, in all $12,799, covering elevated tank, water supply and fire service, lighting plant and transmission, farm building and so forth, were reported to be fair and reasonable by the architect of the Department and the contractor was authorized to proceed with the work. As it was urgent that the operations should continue and\n\nThe Honourable\nthe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I inspected the Indian Residential School at Sioux Lookout, and found things in a bad way, owing to the principal's having had to go away following a mental breakdown resulting from influenza. At the time of my last visit, on January 15th, the water was not yet laid on, but the principal then expected it would be running in a few days. He was then in bed with influenza. On the 24th ult. I found there was still no water supply, and things were accordingly at a standstill.\n\nI returned to Winnipeg on Sunday the 27th and saw Mr. Inspector Bunn, who had been visited by the principal, Mr. Marshall. They had considered the advisability of putting in temporary pipes above ground, but I questioned the wisdom of this, and on Monday the 28th I arranged for a meeting at the office of Mr. Simmons the contractor, to include Messrs. Bunn, J.H. Simmons, and Mr. Beirsto the plumbing contractor besides myself.\n\nIt was decided, in the circumstances, to send a plumber immediately to rectify the trouble. One was sent, therefore, on the 4.30 train from Winnipeg, and if water can not be promptly set running, a temporary arrangement will be made, and a report sent to this office. These instructions were issued without the authority of the Department, owing to the urgency, but with the approval and advice of Mr. Inspector Bunn.\n\nAs soon as the water is running it will be possible to proceed with a vigorous recruiting campaign.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 1)\nWinnipeg, 4th March, 1927.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nRe Water Supply at Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nOn the 24th, the Rev'd Principal, Mr. Marshall, called at my office; he is still a sick man, and he has been sick since the beginning of January, 1927; he has been a victim of the prevailing epidemic of \"Flu.\"\n\nHe called to discuss the matter of water supply. After he explained the situation, he submitted a suggestion to put in a temporary water main. He got prices and other details of the expense in this reference; these he handed me on Saturday the 26th, and it was my intention to place his scheme before you for consideration. I held over until Monday, which was fortunate, as on the evening of the 26th Mr. Agent Edwards arrived in Winnipeg from Sioux Lookout. He phoned to me about 7:30 in the evening and by appointment I met him at 4 p.m. on the 27th, and this matter of the \"water Supply\" came up. We agreed to meet at the office of the contractor, Mr. J.H. Simmons at 10 a.m. on Monday the 28th, so that the situation could be intelligently discussed.\n\nThe conclusion arrived at was that it would be best to have a man who knew the layout, visit and examine to locate the cause of the trouble. This has been done, and this morning the man was at Mr. Simmons' office. I met him, and he has pretty definitely located the difficulty in the water main that prevents water flowing as it should, but he cannot say if it is frozen or some other obstruction. As it is imperative to get the water main to operate with the least possible delay, I consented to have this man, who can do the work well, go down with the least possible delay and to dig down to the place where the obstruction is and to remove same. Failing this, a temporary intake is to be installed so that the institution will be furnished with a sufficient supply of water. The conditions that obtain demand this immediate action, as any delay might cause serious harm and damage.\n\nI have sent a copy of this letter to Mr. Agent Edwards as it was.\nwas promised to so that he would be closely in touch with the action that was decided upon.\n\nThe protracted illness of the Principal has been very unfortunate; if his attention to this detail had been available it is my opinion that the situation would have been relieved in a satisfactory manner in good time.\n\nThe Principal has gone away for a short rest; he was a victim of a severe attack of the \"Flu\", and physically unfit to be on the job.\n\nI submit this explanation to you and trust that you will approve of the action taken; it was the only way to get a supply of water in the shortest time, at the least expense, for the school.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, March 8, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 108-22 of the 2nd instant, reporting on conditions at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School. I note with regret that there is difficulty in connection with the water supply. Your action, in immediately arranging for a plumber to rectify the trouble, is approved. I believe it advisable for you to make an inspection of this school, at your convenience, in the near future, and make a full report to the Department, indicating what is necessary before the institution can receive pupils and carry on its functions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nOttawa, March 8, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, reporting on the water supply at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School. I have also a communication from Mr. Indian Agent Edwards in this connection and your action in immediately arranging for a plumber to rectify the trouble is approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. R. Bunn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nChambers of Commerce,\nPrincess St.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\n\nReferring to my letter of the 2nd instant, re Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nI have today received a letter from Mr J. H. Simmons the Contractor, and he informs me that the Plumber has returned from the School, and reports that the pipe line to the lake is stopped up, plugged, or frozen. In making his test he put in about 40 gal of water in the main pipe, at the pump, the water would not go approximately beyond the front of the main building. The plumber proposed putting down a temporary pipe to the lake, but this is not his idea, he has suggested to set the pipe into the ground for about 40 ft (2' to 3') otherwise the pipe would be too high for the pump to draw water. As the pipe will only draw a certain height.\n\nMr Simmons proposes that the plumber return to Pelican and digs down to the 4\" pipe line near the front of the school, bore a hole in the pipe and see if it is frozen, if so try and thaw it out if possible. If this cannot be done the pipe can be rushed to Hudson by first freight.\n\nThe plumber states the building is in an awful state, the water, water, water. The toilets, urinals, &c are all full up. He also states they are liable to block up the sewer system if they cannot properly flush the toilets after using. The return steam line in the laundry is frozen up. They are not using the radiator in this part of the building. I believe the plumber had better fix this up whilst he is on the job.\n\nMr Simmons also says that if something is not done in a hurry to give them water the staff are liable to quit.\n\nUnder the circumstances, the only thing to do was to agree to the suggestions of Mr Simmons, and give him authority to go ahead as he suggested, I was on the phone with Mr Simmons this morning and told him I would approve providing he got in touch with Inspector Bunn and he also agreed, I believe this is the cheapest and best solution, but in a case like this it had to take the initiative, there being no time to get the necessary authority from the Department.\n\nI trust you will approve what I have done and send me the necessary authority for the vouchers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nP.S. The whole trouble is caused, in my opinion, by the Church authorities not giving the principal authority to go ahead as he requested.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Scott, Esq., C.M.G.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nPursuant to our conversation concerning the water supply in connection with the Sioux Lookout School, I beg to say:\n\nThat I wrote to the Principal making enquiry concerning the water supply and received a reply from the Acting Principal, Mr. Ross, as follows:\n\n\"At time of writing steam-fitters are engaged in excavating to locate suspected stoppage. An adequate water supply is expected within the next few days. Several large pieces of wood and refuse already have been taken from water main and it is believed that the stoppage above referred to is due to an accumulation of debris in water main, the result no doubt of negligence during laying of the water main.\"\n\nThis seems to make it quite clear that my statement, in our recent interview, with regard to the matter under discussion, was in general correct.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nS. Gould\nGeneral Secretary\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAs instructed, I proceeded to Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School and examined it on the 19th and 20th inst. I beg to report as follows:\n\nDue to a temporary operation of the pump, water lying in the pipes of the suction line from the lake had frozen. The radiators and pipes in the laundry had also frozen up and broken. These things are now attended to, being in good shape, and water is pumped to the tank, which leaks somewhat from disuse, but this is expected to correct itself.\n\nAll this work was done by Messrs Beaird Ltd., who had done the work for the contractor Mr. J. H. Simmons, and their charges, while high, appear reasonable and just. The entire trouble arose from the severe illness and absence from duty of the principal and staff. The former is now convalescing from a mental breakdown, and Mr. Campbell is acting pro tem. The principal's return is expected.\n\nA list of required tools and spare fittings has been sent to Rev. Dr. Westgate for reference to Mr. Inspector Bunn, who has authority to purchase some tools, and can get these in this way.\n\nThere is sufficient clothing for about a dozen each of boys and girls, and shorter in quilts and bedspreads. Blanket and sheet materials await the arrival of seamstress and laundress, which is being arranged.\n\nMr. Inspector Bunn has instructions to ship linoleum, carpets etc., but is holding this until the principal returns. The chapel seats and furniture have not yet arrived.\n\nRev. Dr. Westgate has authorized employment of two Indians and their wives for wood-cutting and scrubbing, the building being in filthy condition from previous lack of water.\n\nEnclosed herewith please find requisition for drugs required at the school.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nE/A\nThe school also requires three classroom clocks, a kitchen clock, and a few cheap alarm clocks.\n\nIt appears to me that the Department can take no blame for the delay in the opening of the school, the principal's illness being the main reason. He seems to be a splendid, capable man, in whose absence difficulties accumulated.\n\nI do not know what arrangements have been made for payment for equipment, bedding and clothing, but I gathered from Dr. Westgate that everything is being charged to the Department, including salaries and expenses of the staff. I do not know whether I am misinformed in this matter, but draw your attention to it. I believe the church authorities should be persuaded to rush matters and receive pupils so as to get on a grant-earning basis and reduce the present heavy expenses with their inadequate returns.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nP.S. Since writing the above I have received a telegram from the acting principal saying the water system is again out of commission, and as I only returned to Regina late last night, and as Mr. Emmott or Dunn knows our difficulties I have wired him to see Dr. Westgate and the plumbers and take what action he may think advisable.\n\nIf the water supply is put right and the necessary clothing and equipment arrives the school should be able to take pupils by May first.\nOttawa, March 28, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge, with thanks, your 108-22 of the 23rd instant, reporting on your recent visit to the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School. The drug requisition and the request for clocks are receiving attention. The Department is endeavouring to arrange for an early opening of this school and I am writing to the church authorities to this end.\n\nI regret to learn that a recent telegram informs you the water system is again out of commission; but I am hopeful that whatever action is decided upon by Mr. Inspector Bunn and Dr. Westgate will have an early remedial effect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Mr. Marshall, the Principal, is of the opinion that the wire could be attached to the G.M.R. telegraph poles for a distance of five miles, and should such prove to be the case, the cost of installation would be very considerably reduced. If your Department provided the wire insulators, tools, etc., the School management would be able to complete the line from the railway to the School building.\n\nI trust that this very important matter may receive your prompt and favourable consideration.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, April 4, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, with reference to a telephone connection for the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.

For $325 it would be possible to run an additional iron wire beside the present Michel Chemical Co.'s line, but this has many disadvantages and receives no recommendation from either the principal or the telegraph company. In either case a wire would have to be laid from Mile 5 on the railway to the school, a distance of approximately 3,200 feet. The greater part of this would skirt the lake and be free from danger from falling trees. The line could be attached to the trees with sling insulators to allow for sway.\n\nI would suggest that the line from the track to the school be constructed by the staff, with casual help, for which I presume we would have to pay.

Dr. Westgate, Field Secretary of the M. S. C. C., wrote in this connection some days ago and I corresponded with the General Manager of the Canadian National Railway Telegraphs. It is likely that the arrangement that has been offered to you by the General Superintendent would be repeated by Mr. Barber, of Toronto. If you learn from the General Superintendent that such is the case, in view of the urgency of the matter you are authorized to enter into an agreement with the Canadian National Telegraphs without delay. The Department will pay $500 to the railway company for the erection of two iron wires on their poles and will allow approximately $150 for instruments and for casual labour on the line from the railway to the school. You should inform the Rev. Principal that the school will have to be responsible for the rental and annual upkeep.

D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe:- Water Supply at Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to submit the following report on the water system as installed at Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nOn or about December 5th, 1926, J. H. Simmons, Contractor, completed the laying of the water main from the school to the lake. Part of this water main was put down when the thermometer registered 40 below zero, and was encased in ice. It will, therefore, be understood that the water system could not be put to test, until the weather moderated sufficiently to prevent different parts of the water main from freezing.\n\nDuring a mild spell on or about February 22nd, the pump was put into operation and sufficient water to reach the taps in the basement was had, but no more. On examination of the foot-valve, in the well, several rather large chips of wood and twigs were found. This debris was taken from the above mentioned valve and is now held in the office at the school. The pump was again put into operation, when the next mild spell permitted, and no water was obtained; but, as there was considerable suction noticeable it was evident that there was a complete blockage somewhere in the line.\n\nI left for Winnipeg on February 23rd, on sick-leave, and as a result of my complaint to Mr. Inspector Bunn, Mr. Cooper, of the Beristo Plumbing Co., was sent to the school in order to ascertain the cause of the failure of the water supply. Mr. Cooper arrived at the school on March 2nd, and returned to Winnipeg the same date, stating that he intended to return to the school as soon as possible, with men and pipe.\n\nOn March 7th, Mr. Cooper and two men, with equipment, arrived from Winnipeg, and immediately commenced excavating to reach the water main. On March 9th the water main was reached, stoppage...\nlocated and released. The pump was again put into operation, but a tremendous suction indicated further stoppage. Excavations were again made in two places and it was found that the water line had been frozen. On March 12th all stoppages were released and water was running through all connections in the school.\n\nBefore going any further in this report, it would be well to state, that upon excavation a considerable portion of the water main was found encased in ice, resulting, no doubt, in the water gradually freezing as it came in contact with the cold pipe.\n\nOn March 14th, the water main to the overhead tank was clear, and although considerable water was discharged into the tank the leakage was so great that it was found impossible to keep a fire in the stove below. On this date the pump drew considerable air and was not functioning properly. On March 16th Mr. Cooper and his men left for Wpg., and although there was a considerable supply of water available it was noticed that the pump drew a considerable amount of air, this Mr. Cooper suggested as being due to air locks. Here I may say that the engine ran almost continuously from this date until 4 A.M. of March 21st, when the Engineer reported that no water was being received into the building. Everything possible was done to ascertain the cause of the trouble, but without success, and Dr. Westgate was advised accordingly.\n\nOn March 26th a Plumber arrived from Wpg. and in the afternoon of the same date the water system was again in full operation, the plumber having stated that the pump was at fault. This plumber remained at the school until April 8th, during which time the water supply again failed, and has not since been in operation.\n\nThe general consensus of opinion is that the lake level has dropped to a point beyond the capacity of the pump at present installed in Sioux Lookout Residential School, which pump is known as a 5x5 Typhoon Pump. To arrive at this conclusion several experiments were carried out, the most notable and convincing being the shutting off of the in-take gate-valve and raising the level of the water, within the well, to 2' 3\" above the lake level. On starting the pump\u2014without raising\u2014it was found that it immediately took hold of the water and lost it again when the lake level was reached. Other experiments have been carried out and all point to the trouble being found either in the...\nI may state for your information that there is evidence to show that the lake level has dropped during the past winter 2' 6\". I should also like to state that the water levels are, at times, controlled by the winds and it has been noted that the water supply was at its best when a S.E. wind was blowing, and at its worst when a W. wind was blowing.\n\nI trust that is is not necessary to bring to your notice the disagreeable, and almost unbearable conditions arising from a non-supply of water to an Institution such as the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School, and I fear that unless we are again given the necessary water supply an epidemic of typhoid fever will result.\n\nI have suggested to Inspector Bunn the advisability of having an Evernude Double Cycle Forest Fire Pump on hand, as fire protection, owing to the fact that the C.N.R. track runs through school property which is thickly wooded. This pump could be used as an auxiliary pump until such time as a capable pump is installed at the school. It would then serve a two-fold purpose, and I cannot too strongly recommend this purchase.\n\nI would ask that you give this matter your favorable consideration.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. F. J. Marshall, Principal.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nWinnipeg, 11th April, 1927.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nThis evening I sent the following telegram with reference to the water supply for Indian Residential School at the Sioux Lookout School.\n\n\"Water difficulties Sioux Lookout remain unsolved.\n\"Pump installed fails to deliver water into the tank at present lake level.\n\"Agent, Principal and myself suggest temporary immediate solution by providing fire pump capacity equal to pump now installed to raise water in well six feet and therewith three hundred feet of hose. Reply urgent.\"\n\nAfter a thorough investigation in expense and time required to do this in a careful manner, the Principal has definitely come to the conclusion that the pump that is now installed cannot operate with the present lake level, the lift is more than the capacity of the pump can handle.\n\nThe problem was fully discussed today in my office between the Agent, the Principal and myself and as a result the fact was established that the pump installed will work effectively and well with the water in the well at a six foot level, and this was proven by raising the water in the well by baling to a level of six feet and it was found that the pump installed now took hold every time without priming and delivered water into the tank under these conditions.\n\nNow to keep the water at a level of six feet in the well we came to the conclusion that by providing a fire pump such as has been suggested this can be maintained and the flow of water to the tank would be assured.\n\nI held the above over pending a reply to my wire, this has just come to hand. Principal Marshall was in the office when it arrived, and he was very glad to receive the good news.\nWe will take immediate steps to secure the fire pump and the hose and have them placed for operation and I feel that we can be reasonably assured of a favorable outcome.\n\nI might also add that the fire pump will be a very useful unit to have on the premises for fire protection of the buildings and from any possible bush fires. In the summer of 1926 there were two bush fires that caused a good deal of worry and trouble.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report received from the Principal wherein he fully details the troubles and difficulties that have occurred in connection with the water main and the water supply arrangements, and unfortunately during a great part of the period the Principal was absent on account of a very serious attack of the prevailing \"Flu\", so that his experience and good judgement was unavailable. He returned from sick leave on the 28th March, he went down to Sioux Lookout the next day and by his careful examinations we have had a very full measure of intelligent light on the situation that I feel has resulted in a good solution of the trouble. He will be on hand and see that the fire pump is placed in with the least possible delay.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nEnclosure.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nWill you kindly advise us if the contract for the proposed Indian School at Sioux Lookout has been let.

As the opening of navigation is now near at hand and it is absolutely necessary that we have a boat by that date, I should be glad if you will advise me as to what has been done in the matter of securing the above mentioned boat.\n\nThanking you in anticipation,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.F.J. Marshall,\nPrincipal.\n\nR. Gurney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect, Dept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMay 3, 1927.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to my memorandum of the 18th of October last, with regard to the purchasing of a suitable boat for the Sioux Lockout School, as navigation is opening and they are in need of this boat I would recommend that the purchase be made.\n\n[Signature]\n\nARCHITECT.\nMay 7th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nAs requested in your letter of April 13th I have made a number of inquiries with reference to the water works system at the Sioux Lookout Indian School. In taking the matter up with Mr. Simmons he referred me to Mr. Cooper, foreman in charge of the plumbing and installation of the water works system. The evidence submitted is most convincing and satisfactory and shows what was actually done and how the suction end of the system was actually installed. The pipe from the well to the school was supposed to be laid in a direct line, but if one can believe some of the statements made it would appear that in order to avoid some really high points in the rock that the pipe line was laid indirectly to the school and contains a number of 45 and 90 degree bends and also that possibly there is a considerable hump in the line.\n\nI sent one of my engineers, who was going to Sioux Lookout on other work, over to the Indian School to check the elevation of the water level and observe the same that with the present water level the suction lift is only 14 feet, so that at extreme low water the maximum lift would only be 18 feet. The pump should handle this quite easily. Under the circumstances I am inclined to think that the trouble is either directly in the pump or in the improper laying of the suction line. It would then become necessary that the pump should be to uncover the suction line and if the fault is found there to re-lay it in the correct manner. It is possible that the uncovering and relaying of the pipe will cost in the neighborhood of $400.00. If you will authorise this expenditure I will have one of my engineers take the matter in hand and have the pipe laid over again and take a good pump-man to Sioux Lookout to check the pump and pipe line.\n\nI have heard that the Rev. Mr. Marshall was in the city this week, though I did not see him. I understand he has returned to Sioux Lookout with the intention of lowering the setting of the pump several feet. I have taken liberty to write to Mr. Marshall advising him that in my opinion the setting of the pump is not the fault and that I am writing you regarding the matter and have suggested to Mr. Marshall that he leave the pump setting alone until I have received your reply, or he has received instructions from you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nC.

Girard, advises that by using #9 gauge iron wire instead of #8 gauge as figured in previous estimate, he could erect the wire from Sioux Lookout to Pelican School for approximately $523.00 net including erection of poles between Pelican Station and the Indian School as it is understood you will furnish the poles, dig the holes and set the poles ready for wire to be erected thereon on this portion of the territory.\n\nYou understand, of course, that the above figures are only an estimate of the approximate cost. If Mr. Girard takes the work in hand our charges will be based on actual cost of material delivered on the ground and total cost of labor, plus ten per cent Stores Expense and Supervision, and ten per cent accounting and administration. In addition there will be a rental of Five ($5.00) dollars per wire mile per annum for the privilege of placing wires on our pole line on the right-of-way.\n\nPlease advise as early as possible if this offer is acceptable and when you wish the work undertaken.\n\nR.W.Ball,\n\nGeneral Superintendent\nSir:\n\nEnclosed please find a copy of a letter received from the Canadian National Telegraphs regarding the proposed telephone line from Sieux Leekeut to the residential school at Pelican.\n\nI am given to believe by the principal of the school that the poles required are all cut, peeled and ready to put in, and the line has been cut from the school to three poles west of mile 5, to a width of ten feet.\n\nAs I am on Treaty payments, and unable to get in touch with the school, I should be glad if you could write direct to the principal requesting erection of the poles, and I would also appreciate it if you would arrange with the C.N.Telegraphs to do the other work as per their letter, since I believe this is the most economical way of doing the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nR/A Enc.\nJune 7, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Marshall:\n\nI am today writing the General Superintendent of the Canadian National Telegraphs, Winnipeg, asking him to arrange for an early telephone connection from Sioux Lookout to the Indian Residential School.

Simmons, Esq.,\nContractor,\n506 Confederation Life Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed you will please find plan and profile of the 4\" suction main for the water supply system at the Sioux Lookout Indian School. This information was obtained by Mr. Mooney of this office, after you had uncovered the suction pipe.\n\nThe Plan \"A\" shows the suction pipe as laid and Plan \"B\" the suction pipe as I consider it should be laid, eliminating a number of the 45\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 bends. The portion of the suction pipe it is necessary to re-lay is shown on the profile in red. This, as you will note, will entail a fairly large amount of excavation, running to about three feet at the deepest part.\n\nWill you please arrange to have this work done as expeditiously as possible, in order that the water supply for the school may be put into satisfactory condition.\n\nIn view of the fact that the trouble is entirely due to the suction main not being properly laid, I do not consider that the Department of Indian Affairs should be put to any expense in connection with this work. The pipe line when laid and before being covered will be inspected and must meet with my approval.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\n\nEnc.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTo - Mr. J. D. McLean, Assistant Deputy & Secretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nRe - Water Supply - Sioux Lookout School.\n\nComplying with the request stated in your letter of May 11th, I have taken up the matter of water supply of the Sioux Lookout School with Mr. J. H. Simmons, the contractor, and with Mr. Beairsto, the sub-contractor for the plumbing. From the information obtained from these gentlemen it was apparent that the trouble was either in the pump itself or in the suction line to the pump. Further information obtained from Mr. Beairsto's foreman was that the pipe to the intake pump had been overhauled and found to be in perfect condition. Accordingly it was arranged with Mr. Simmons that he write to the Rev. J. F. Marshall, Principal of the school, asking Mr. Marshall to have the suction between the pump and intake well uncovered at Mr. Simmons' expense. While this was done an engineer from this office secured a profile of the line and noted the condition of the pipe as laid.\n\nFrom the survey made by our engineer the attached plan has been prepared showing the line from the intake pump together with a profile of the line. The profile shows that a hump of about feet existed in the line between the well and the pump which caused an air trap in the line and prevented the pump from operating. In addition to the hump it is also noted that a number of unnecessary 45 and 90\u00b0 angles had been placed in the line and these in themselves, even if the line had been properly laid to grade, would reduce the efficiency of the suction line.\n\nTo correct the present faulty installation it is the intention to have the suction main re-laid from about Station 70 to a point about Station 275 to the proposed grade shown in the attached plan. With this grade there should be no trouble from air traps, etc. It is also the intention to have a number of the bends omitted, as a number that were used originally are unnecessary. A plan of the present suction main, together with fittings used, is shown on Plan \"A\" while Fig. 1 is a plan of that proposed together with the fittings considered necessary.\n\nIn the first instance the suction line was improperly laid and I consider that any expense in connection with the correcting of this line to put it in proper condition should be borne by the contractor. I have accordingly advised Mr. Simmons to make effort and have instructed him to re-lay the pipe, at the same time informing him that I consider the work should be done at his own expense.\n\nW. H.

Cement foundations are required under the tool house and under the ice house, if these buildings are to be kept in good repair. The stock barn and the poultry house have cement foundations, and I recommend that the two buildings I have mentioned be provided with the same.\n\n2. As the walls of all the out buildings have been painted, but not the shingled roofs, I beg to recommend that these be painted as a help to preservation. The Principal recommends that they be painted green.\n\n3. In the process of clearing the land, the Principal found considerable timber which he considered might advantageously be cut into lumber and stored for future use such as repairs, fencing, erection of woodshed or other buildings, bridges, etc. He informed me that he could have this cut at the rate of $15 per thousand, whereas the price of the same if purchased would cost $35 per thousand. As the timber may not be exchanged for lumber, and it does not seem quite wise to have the better logs converted into fuel, the Principal would like an authorization to have approximately 20,000 feet of lumber cut and stored for future use.\n\n4. The verandah at the west end of the main school building, and the verandah attached to the Principal's residence have not been screened in, and I beg to request that this be done. The flies and mosquitoes at this time of year in\nthat part of the country are troublesome beyond description.\n\n5. The question of providing some sort of store room at the Pelican railway siding is one which has not yet been definitely settled. That it is very necessary, I am well assured. As the Railway Company would expect, I believe, an annual rental if such building were erected on their property, it seems to me that the building should have to be erected on the School land nearest the railway siding to escape the rental charges, or else an effort should be made to have the Railway Company provide a sufficiently large unloading platform where supplies could be kept under cover of a tarpaulin until removed. I shall be very grateful if your Department will do your best to meet this School's need in this respect.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, July 18, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to buildings at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School. You might have the Rev. Principal secure an estimate of the cost of placing cement foundations under the tool house and ice house. This should be forwarded to the Department for further consideration. I regret that I cannot authorize the painting of the shingled roofs of the outbuildings.\n\nYou may authorize the Principal to send sufficient timber for twelve or fifteen thousand feet, which would be cut into lumber and stored for future use, at a cost of $15 per thousand. You may also authorize the Rev. Principal to screen in the veranda at the west end of the main building. The materials only will be provided by the Department.

The delay is caused through our inability to secure extra gangmen at this time, either for ourselves or from the other Telegraph Company and our own gangs are tied up in work which will not permit them to be available until a time approximately as above stated.\n\nThe work, however, is being kept constantly before us and will be completed at the earliest possible moment.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRWB/G\nGeneral Superintendent.\nJuly 7th, 1927\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: Sioux Lookout School.\n\nOn July 1st when I visited Ottawa, I made a verbal report to the Superintendent of Indian Education on conditions as I found them at the new Sioux Lookout School a few days previously, and was advised to address a separate communication to you in connection with the following items:\n\n1. The metal roof of the engine room, and part of the roof of the hall-way, have become seriously impaired through the large pieces of ice which have fallen upon them from the roof of the chapel above. One hand rail of a fire escape has also been seriously damaged by a large piece of ice which fell from the roof of the main school building, and one hand rail and part of the steps forming the outside entrance to the chapel have been broken in the same way. The Principal informed me that one piece of ice which fell from the roof of the main school building was 8 feet long, 14 inches thick, and must have weighed about 400 lbs. The accumulation of ice along the eaves of the main school building and chapel is probably due to the fact that the temperature of the roof within the walls is raised by the heat from the central heating plant, while that part which extends beyond the walls remains unaffected, and causes the melted snow to freeze as fast as it runs down and accumulate. The best remedy is not very apparent, but I feel it my duty to submit the matter to you for your careful consideration. The joints of the roof of the engine room, and that of the hall-way should be soldered, but this will not prevent the accumulation of ice referred to above.\n\n2. Rain water soaked through the basement walls throughout practically the whole of the building, and for a time flooded the floors. The Principal informed me that he dug down in three places to see if the walls had been tarred on the outside, and in each case found that this had been done. He\nsuggests, (1) that the whole of the main school building be surrounded by a platform of cement not less than 10 feet wide, (2) that the spaces on either side of the front entrance to the main school building be completely covered with cement, and (3) that the spaces on either side of the chapel be likewise covered with cement, the surface throughout to slope gradually away from the building.

(RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 1)\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith extracts from a letter received from the Rev. Dr. Westgate with reference to certain work required at the Sioux Lookout Residential School, and I would ask you to please let me have a report at your earliest convenience with your recommendations as to whether the work asked for should be carried out, and also the best way of having it done. It would be advisable to consult with the Reverend Principal.\n\n1. The metal roof of the engine room, and part of the roof of the hall-way, have become seriously impaired through the large pieces of ice which have fallen upon them from the roof of the chapel above. One hand rail of a fire escape has also been seriously damaged by a large piece of ice which fell from the roof of the main school building, and one hand rail and part of the steps forming the outside entrance to the chapel have been broken in the same way. The Principal informed me that one piece of ice which fell from the roof of the main school building was 8 feet long, 14 inches thick, and must have weighed about 400 lbs. The accumulation of ice along the eaves of the main school building and chapel is probably due to the fact that the temperature of the roof within the walls is raised by the heat from the central heating plant, while that part which extends beyond the walls remains unaffected, and causes the melted snow to freeze as fast as it runs down and accumulates. The best remedy is not very apparent, but I feel it my duty to submit the matter to you for your careful consideration. The joints of the roof of the engine room, and that of the hall-way should be soldered, but this will not prevent the accumulation of ice referred to above.\n\n2. Rain water soaked through the basement walls throughout practically the whole of the building, and for a time flooded the floors. The Principal informed me that he dug down in three places to see if the walls had been tarred on the outside, and in each case found that this had been done. He suggests (1) that the whole of the main school building be surrounded by a platform of cement not less than 10 feet wide, (2) that the spaces on either side of the front entrance to the main school building be completely covered with cement, and (3) that the spaces on either side of the chapel be likewise covered with cement, the surface throughout to slope gradually away from the building. I recommend this suggestion to your careful consideration.\nAugust 23, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Marshall:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 30th ultimo, concerning the installation of a telephone at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School, I have today learned that it will be the middle of September before the Canadian National Telegraphs can undertake the work.

Simmons at Inspector Bunns office in Winnipeg, as the Rev Principal Marshall informed us the account included time of men spent in rectifying their own mistake, and he did not think it should be paid. Mr Simmons promised to look into the account and have it amended, as regards the materials used this was put into the by-pass connecting the intake to the pressure pipe, and was used by the contractors for priming the intake pipe. At the present time the Principal says the system fixed is only a decoration, and if they wish to take it out they are at liberty to do so.

No barge is to be had for this purpose as it ruins a barge and it would kill horses to have to haul gravel over the roads in their present condition.\n\nHowever if we were assured of the Department under taking to build one for next year we could commence to excavate in the proposed location and use the excavation for a pit for this winter as no other solution seems feasible. This of course is going to be very inconvenient but there seems to be no alternative.\n\nI would like the root house to have a basement cemented 24ft x 40ft. with a house on top to be used as a work shop and at one end partitioned off for two rooms where we could accommodate any extra help we happened to have. These men would naturally keep the place sufficiently warm to insure against freezing.\n\nI figured roughly that the approximate cost would be about two thousand dollars.\n\nI intend going east for the Wycliffe Jubilee Convention Sept. 21st to 26th and I was anticipating returning by Ottawa and if it would be convenient I would like to talk this matter over so that together we could come to a satisfactory decision.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRev.

(RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 1)\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter 129-6-15 of the 16th ult regarding Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School I beg to deal with the various paragraphs as follows:\n\nPar.1. Dr. Westgate's information is correct. A report as to the fire-escape and roof has already been sent to the Department. We have asked the contractor, Mr. Simmons who does not think we shall have ice slides again, as he considers this was due in some measure to new material, but I would suggest that authority be given for repairs to the fire-escape etc. and also that a cheap post and rail fence be put around the main building, to protect children from any possibility of injury from sliding ice and snow.\n\nThe contractor thinks, with reference to the soldering of joints, that this should be done, but will make a further report.\n\nPar.2. The contractor informs me that water seeps through the basement walls because no weeping drains were put in. To do this now would cost about $1.00 per foot. He would not recommend a cement platform, as this would cost about $3.00 per foot, and there would still be seepage. The cement work in any case could not be done until next spring, as the gravel, being at some distance from the school, can only be taken there in winter by team.\n\nPar.3. I would suggest that the principal receive authority to purchase pulleys and necessary materials, and he could put in a suitable gauge himself at a cost of a few dollars.\n\nPar.4. A lever, two shaft brackets and pulley are required. The principal will send me prices for these at an early date.\n\nPar.5. The typhoon pump should be exchanged. I believe this can be done for $100 or less, and parts can then be obtained at all times.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nR/A\nat all times.\n\nPar.6. I interviewed Mr. Darby of Winnipeg, an expert on lightning conductors, and he suggests we should have them installed on the barn, and that six points and ground wires be placed on the main school building. Would you like me to get prices on this?\n\nThe principal wishes us to purchase a sectional ladder, so that the roof can be reached. He also wishes construction of a small porch over the chapel entrance, to avoid danger from sliding snow.\n\nThe height of the bottom of the water tank is sixty feet. The height of the school building is seventy feet, so that there is not sufficient water pressure for fire-protection on the upper stories. Mr. Craig of the Water Power Branch suggests that a cut-off be installed between the pump and the tank, so that in case of fire the pump could be kept going and make a direct supply to the fire hydrants. This would not be expensive.\n\nThe principal also wishes to purchase a stove for heating laundry irons at a cost of about $30.00. Mr. Bunn suggested that the school purchase electric irons and that we should pay for the necessary wiring, but Rev. Dr. Westgate referred me to your letter 116-1-12 of May 11th last informing him such appliances may not be used in Indian schools supplying their own power.\n\nWith reference to your letter 129-6-9 of July 15th to Rev. Dr. Westgate regarding employment of men on the road, I may say the Rev. Principal would be glad to receive an accountable cheque for $500.00 to pay wages, as he has no available cash. In this way he could hire men when required.\n\nThe principal requests the building of a root-house and store-house, about 24' x 40', consisting of a cement cellar about 7' high for vegetables, with a room adjoining for a man, so that a stove could be put in. The store house built above this would be for stores, tools etc. This could not be built now, but if authority were given, the principal could put men on excavation, and gravel could be taken to the site in winter for construction next spring.\n\nThe railway spur is now put in by the company, and I would suggest supplying lumber for a small shed to be built there by the school authorities.\n\nTelephone poles are in position, but wires and instruments not yet installed.\n\nIn reply to your 129-6-5 of the 1st inst I enclose herewith voucher for $62.00 payable to Mr. Simmons for repairs to the pavilion.

Mr. Mooney went down, and Mr. Atwood reported fully to you in his memorandum of October 19th. Apparently the pipe was not taken out far enough into the lake as per instructions from the water power branch by Mr. Simmons. This work was done last fall in extremely cold weather and presumably Mr. Simmons' men did not carry out instructions, thinking no doubt that the pipe was far enough out. I do not think Mr. Simmons himself knew about this, I certainly did not. The principal of the school had arrived and I was not able to visit the school much at that time. The work was done on force account. I suggest that temporary measures be used for this winter and that a coffer dam and pipe be carried out further next spring. I would also respectfully suggest that the water power branch be asked to superintend the work owing to the distance from Kenora it is impossible for me to visit there very often.\n\nImmediate instructions are necessary to enable the school to get water for the winter. I believe temporary arrangements can be made by the water power branch for the sum not more than a couple of hundred dollars. And I should be glad if you would wire Inspector Bunn, The Water Power Branch or myself, if you have not already done so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary\nDept.

I think you must have misunderstood my letter, as at the present time I am not trying to arrange stops for trains at Pelican spur. All I wish to know is, if you could supply me with two old box cars to be put off at the spur for the benefit of the school, so that they could store perishable goods in same. The new spur was put in, not for carloading, as we do not ship much from Pelican, but as a receiving spur. Kindly let me know if you could supply the cars as previously requested.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nMr. C. D. Glass,\nAssistant Superintendent,\nCanadian National Railways,\nSieux Lockout, Ontario.\nMr. Frank Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nFurther in connection with your request for freight shelter at Pelican passing track,\n\nThe last full line of my letter to you should have read car load proposition and not car loading proposition.\n\nI took this matter up with Mr. Moodie before replying to you, and he suggested that we could not consistently establish another point for handling of L.C.L. freight, but I am taking no action to stop the occasional load of freight at this point for the Indian school, but you will readily understand the placing of a shelter would be the Railways admission of this being a regular unloading point.\n\nCDG/EB.\nAss't. Superintendent.\nMr Frank Edwards  \nIndian Agent,  \nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your 108-22 of October 15th, re shelter for local freight at Pelican, beg to advise that we now already have two stops between Sioux Lookout and Kenora, viz: Pelican and North Pines, and could not consistently establish another at the point you suggest, although, of course, I am aware that considerable local freight for the Indian School is unloaded at or near the new spur at the east end of the passing track. However, the new spur was put in as a car loading proposition entirely.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nAsst. Superintendent.\n\nCDG/S\nKenora, Ontario,\nOctober 12th, 1927.\n\nThe Superintendent,\nCanadian National Railway,\nSieux Lookout, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Glass:\n\nAs your company have put in a spur at Pelican for the Indian School, I have been requested by my department to obtain if possible one or two old box cars which could be dumped at the spur and used as a shelter for freight for the school.\n\nCould you assist us in any way? With kind regards.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nEnclosed please find correspondence between this office and the Assistant Superintendent of the C. N. Ry at Sioux Lookout, re obtaining old box cars for a shelter for freight at the east switch at Pelican spur for the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nMr Glass says there are two stops between Hudson and Sioux Lookout at North Pines and at Pelican, I may say there is very little business at North Pines only an old disused mine and some fishermen, who no doubt ship a quantity of fish, but at Pelican there is no one living there except the Section men, all the business at Pelican except for the Section men is for the Indian School.\n\nIt appears unreasonable for Mr Glass to state that he does not wish to have a shelter at the Switch, as we have had the spur put in, and the shelter is required for goods from the cars, so that they can be unloaded promptly and goods taken to the school as opportunity permits.\n\nI shall be glad if you will take up this matter direct with the \"ational \"ailways, as the lakes will soon be frozen over, and it is impossible to bring freight from Sioux Lookout over the ice owing to the current and rapids.\n\nI will interview Mr Glass again on the 12th instant when I shall be in Sioux Lookout.\n\nKindly return the correspondence for my files.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 1)\nOttawa, November 14, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 108-22 of the 7th instant, with reference to the refusal of the Assistant Superintendent of the C. N. R. at Sioux Lookout to place a box car at the Department's siding near Pelican, for the use of the Indian residential school there. I do not consider it advisable to deal with this matter direct with the Montreal office, as this might make the local officers of the railway less sympathetic to our requests at this point. You might see if you can secure permission to erect at the spur a small inexpensive shelter, that could be properly locked. If this can be done, let me have an estimate of the cost. Such storehouse should be built on sills, so that it could be moved later, if advisable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. McLean,\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

SHANNON, dated Oct. 20, 1927, on the\nSioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nCLASSROOM.\n\nIn the large Classroom now being used the lighting is quite inadequate. This room is lighted from the north side and has only four small windows.\n\nThis condition can be somewhat remedied by a better colour scheme in the interior decoration. If the ceiling were painted white, or a very light Silver Grey, and the walls, including the folding doors, painted a light Cream colour, the Lighting would be much better. The whole wall of folding doors, in natural fir, contributes greatly to the darkness of the room.\n\nAll the Blackboards in the School are too high from the floor for the use of the ordinary pupils. This condition can be remedied by dropping the Slates down Ten Inches or a Foot and filling in the space at top by a strip of Hyloplate. This latter is a convenient device for holding the Decorations which many teachers delight to have at the top of the Blackboard. I have recommended this to Mr. Marshall and he would very much like to have this improvement made.\n\nIn future you should advise your Architect to have ceilings of Classrooms supported by steel beams, as supporting pillars in the middle of a classroom is a very serious defect.\nOttawa, November 18, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School, states that lighting conditions in the large classroom could be improved by a better colour scheme in the interior decoration. He states that if the ceiling were painted white, or a very light silver grey, and the walls, including the folding doors, painted a light cream colour, the lighting would be much better. He also states that the whole wall of folding doors, in natural fir, contributes greatly to the darkness of the room. He further states that all the blackboards in the school are too high from the floor for the use of the smaller pupils.\n\nI have to request that you will take up with the Principal the matter of carrying out the recommendations of the Inspector regarding the improving of the lighting and the changing of the interior decoration. You should furnish a report as to whether you would recommend that the classroom be repainted in the colour scheme as recommended by the Inspector, and, if so, you should state the approximate cost of having the work done.\n\nRelative to the blackboard, I beg to say that it will hardly be possible to have these boards lowered. It is considered that if a platform of the required height were erected along the blackboards, this would be satisfactory. Please enquire into this matter, and furnish a report as to the cost of a platform of the required height and width.\n\nThese matters should receive your attention on the occasion of your next visit to the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nJ.

N. Wyatt's account for $998.00 for extending and repairing the water supply intake at the Indian Residential School. The account is in triplicate with the necessary vouchers attached and recommended for payment. Will you please have these forwarded at the earliest date possible in order that payment may not be held up more than necessary.\n\nThis work was carried out under the authority of Mr. Frank Edwards, Indian Agent at Kenora, from whom a telegram was received on October 24th instructing me to take whatever action was necessary to put the intake pipe into proper working condition. A copy of this telegram is enclosed for your files.\n\nThe necessity of overhauling and extending the intake was due to the contractor, Mr. J. H. Simmons, not carrying out his work a year ago according to his instructions and the plans furnished. Upon examination it was found that the condenser and intake pipe were not carried out a sufficient distance from the bank. After the pipe was uncovered it was also found that the flanged wrought iron pipe was irregularly laid and in fact was simply laid with the ends butting against each other, with here and there a hole without nuts put in the flanges. The outer end of the intake pipe landed among a large boulder and later when the high water washed the excavated earth into the stream it completely covered the end of the pipe and boulder, thus shutting off the water supply.\n\nThis bad workmanship and not carrying out the work according to instructions required quite extensive work to be done, which being carried on under adverse weather conditions resulted in the cost being fairly high.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

Ashdown and T. Eaton Co. Winnipeg both quote $4.50 per gallon for No.1 paint.\n\nFiguring this matter as economically as possible our result is as follows:\n\n| Item                        | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|-----------------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| 4 pieces of 4x5 Hylolite    |          | 37\u00bd        | $30.00|\n| 25 gallons of paint         |          | 4.50       | $112.50|\n|                            |          |            | $142.50|\n| Plus freight on paint, approximately |          |            | $7.50 |\n\nThe most feasible solution regarding the blackboards is to leave the top moulding where it is, lower the blackboard about 12 inches, filling in the intervening spaces with a strip of Hylolite B.B. using a piece of moulding to join the two B.B's together. This, I think, can be done easier and at less expense than building platforms, and be much more satisfactory in the end.\n\nHoping that this will meet with your approval I am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nJohn F.J.

I asked for prices from the different firms that had worked on the school and am submitting their various prices.\n\nThe contract was let to Roy MacDonald of Sioux Lookout for the amount of $375.00. This work was not completed nor passed by the Electrical Inspector until March the first of this year. Mr MacDonald wired the barn so that we had the use of it but owing to him having considerable building work in town I did not press for the wiring of the other buildings until after he had finished the wiring on the Imperial Bank this winter. So that with all buildings completed it made it worth while for the Inspector to come and inspect the work which he passed on March 1st.\n\nWe are therefore submitting the account for payment and consider that the work has been done faithfully and well.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Rev.)

This shed is very necessary in winter time and I would suggest that that if possible sanction be given for the erection so that all lumber and etc could be purchased at the same time the material is purchased for the roothouse.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Rev.)

On May 31st, the Reverend Principal was asked to submit a proposal with estimate of the cost. The Department stated, at that time, that we would prefer to have the activity on a day labour basis - the principal to purchase the materials. The members of the staff and the older boys were to assist and one carpenter engaged.\n\nThe Rev. Principal has now submitted a proposal and is willing to proceed now with the building activity, making the arrangements the Department suggested. Mr. Marshall is quite competent to supervise this activity, as he is a good carpenter, himself. I wish to recommend that he be authorized to purchase the materials in Sioux Lookout, engage a carpenter and proceed with the work.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I wish to confirm my answering night letter, as follows:\n\n\"Reference your letter eighteenth instant, you may erect combined workshop and roothouse on day labour basis - cost not to exceed $3500. Purchase lumber from George Parlinger, Sioux Lookout, at his best price to government school. You may engage one carpenter. Writing.\"\n\nThe Department will rely on you to purchase the cement, lime and hardware necessary in Sioux Lookout, to the best advantage. Under separate cover, there is being directed to you a supply of labour return forms, which should be kept in duplicate and which should be forwarded to the Department, showing the receipt of the carpenter engaged. If a labourer is engaged for the cement and other heavy work, you may also engage such a worker. His time and receipts should also be shown on the labour returns. To pay the labour, an accountable cheque for $300 is being directed to you under separate cover. The accounts for materials should be forwarded to the Department, properly certified, in duplicate, when payment will be made direct to the firm in question. At your earliest convenience, you might let me have a rough sketch, showing the nature of the building you propose to erect.\n\nI have also your letter of the 18th instant, with reference to a storehouse at the railway track. You may arrange for the erection of a suitable building, at an estimated cost of $650. Mr. Ferrier reports that this is necessary to the satisfactory conduct of the school in the winter time.\n\nI have also your letter of the 20th instant, with reference to cement for the foundations of the icehouse and \"school\" building. You may purchase 50 bags of cement and ring the foundations at the same time as you are doing that for the new workshop and roothouse.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

LISTER COMPANY (CANADA) LIMITED\n\nWinnipeg, Man.\nJanuary 18th 1929.\n\nThe Rev. J.F.J. Marshall,\nSioux Lookout Indian Residential School,\nSioux Lookout, Ont.,\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nWe have received the following report from our expert Mr. Atkinson in connection with his visit to your lighting and transmission equipment, during the present week. He made a complete overhaul of the engine and found a few parts necessary for replacement, which are being forwarded from our warehouse in Winnipeg, and when these are installed the engine will be in absolutely the best of conditions.\n\nThe same applies to the transmission equipment, the generator was overhauled and repaired. Mr Atkinson states however that the batteries were in a very bad condition, and nothing can be done with these, he advises that they should be replaced immediately, otherwise we cannot guarantee a continuance of satisfactory working condition of the lighting and transmission equipment.\n\nWith regard to your enquiry in connection with the date of shipment of the lighting equipment, this was forwarded from Winnipeg complete with batteries on July 16th 1926 and is undoubtedly the cause of the present battery condition.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Lister & Company (Canada) Ltd.,\nCredit Manager.\nDear Sir;-\n\nFollowing up a suggestion made by Mr. Ferrier during his visit to the school in August 1926 I wrote to the R.A. Lister Co. asking them if they had a travel ing repair man. They replied that they had no such man but that they could send one of their expert mechanics down to over look the plant in the quiet season so they sent a Mr. Atkinson down here in January to go over the lighting and water system. He made a thorough overhauling of the engine and made several minor repairs as shown on the enclosed accounts. He also spent considerable time trying to adjust the batteries but found that he was unable to fix them at all. His explanation is that these batteries were sent to the school in July of 1926 and were not charged nor kept up in any way until the plant was put in operation on January 15th 1927. This evidently was no ones fault but just circumstances owing to many setbacks at the time.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of the report made on these batteries by Mr. Atkinson for your information.\n\nTrusting that this work meets with your approval I am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Rev.)

Winnipeg for repairs to the water system and sewerage equipment.\n\nIn November we had trouble with our water line and had to dig up a great deal of pipe only to find that three flanges had broken. The only explanation we are able to offer is that it was due to contraction of the pipe. We had no flanges on hand nor could we wait for them to come so we borrowed from the B&B shops of the town with the understanding that we would replace them. We took it upon ourselves to do so when it was necessary to order a sewer rod and fittings to overcome trouble in the sewer pipe leading from the hospital just after the trouble in the pipe line. We tried wire but without results and so we ordered the rod to see if it would remove the obstruction. As you know this pipe from the hospital has always given trouble but we found that even the rod would not touch the obstruction so the only thing left was to dig up the pipe. This we did and found a piece of oak flooring 16in long had got lodged in the elbow of the pipe. There is no other way of this wood getting in the pipe except by being there before the pipe was put in.\n\nThis account was sent to the office of Indian Affairs in Winnipeg and was given to me when I was in the city last week. I trust that the action taken was not overstepping as it seemed to be the only course to follow, at the time owing to imperative haste being necessary,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Rev.)

The accounts for paint and etc. could be certified to and forwarded to you for payment but having the painting done on a day labor basis would necessitate having an accountable cheque forwarded to us for this purpose. We would then return the cancelled cheques to you along with the necessary forms.\n\nThe boat house is the only other outside building that is in real need of paint. If you think it advisable to have this done at the same time arrangements could be made whereby it was included in the order for supplies.\n\nTrusting that this is the desired information and that our efforts are satisfactory, I am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Rev.)

You should see that a good grade of paint is obtained, and you should forward an itemised account, in duplicate, covering the cost. This account you should certify in the usual manner and forward to the Department, when a cheque in payment will be sent direct to the merchant from whom you purchased the material.\n\nRegarding the labour in having the painting carried out, I have to say that this should be performed on a day labour basis. Proper time sheets, in duplicate, should be kept of the labour employed. Full particulars should be filled in as requested on the forms, and the individual labourers should sign same in duplicate, and they should also be certified by you and forwarded to the Department in accounting for the expenditure of the cheque for $300 which will be sent you under separate cover. A supply of labour returns forms is enclosed herewith.\n\nYou may also arrange to have the boat house painted at the same time as the work on the school building is being carried out.\n\nYou should see that the work is satisfactorily completed before the cold weather sets in next Fall.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst.

My recollection is that the objection raised by your Department to the installation of eave-troughs was based on the danger which had to be faced of having all the troughing torn off by sliding ice from the roof in time of thaw. I placed this consideration before the Principal and he informed me that this danger would be avoided by having the eave-troughs placed at a slightly lower level. Should your Department still consider it inadvisable to provide the eave-troughs, then the Principal strongly recommended that a cement platform be placed about the whole school to prevent a recurrence of the difficulties he has had to face during the past summer.\n\nAfter a careful survey of the situation I was strongly convinced that either one or other of the above improvements is absolutely necessary to protect the foundations and to help to keep the ground in shape, and I commend it once more to your careful and sympathetic consideration. It is not expected that either improvement should be undertaken this year, but that provision should be made in your estimate for supplying either one or both of these next year.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Shall we commence hauling gravel this winter?\n\nJ. M.\nSIOUX LOOKOUT INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\nOctober 30th., 1929.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nThe stairs, halls, and many of the rooms that have been in constant use need attention and to make them look as they should and while we have the painter here I would like to have these things attended to. The painter will be finished with the outside work next week and as they commence their winter rates on the first of November I thought it would be an opportune time to engage him and get things in to first class shape.\n\nIf you should think kindly of the suggestion I would suggest that a cheque of one hundred and fifty dollars be forwarded for labor and that we have sanction to purchase the necessary paint, varnish and etc and submit the accounts as usual. This would give us a good start for the spring and also have it done much more economically than we could hope to do it later as well as being sure of having a first class job done.\n\nWe hope to be able to have our own boys and girls do this as time goes on but as yet we have due respect for the building.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Rev.) J. F. J. Marshall,\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir;-\n\nEver since we moved into the residence of this school in October 1926 we have had to put up with a great deal of discomfort in the winter time owing to the fact that we can not keep the place warm. The residence is at the extreme end of the building and is not built on the same level as the school which necessitates a drop of 18in in the steam pipe and unless we have a full head of steam on, thereby roasting out the centre of the building, we cannot force heat into the residence at all. We have tried to accomplish this in every way we know of and it only results in the same way. It is usually well after 10 in the morning when the heat reaches us and very seldom do we get a bit of heat after seven at night. Besides being unbearably uncomfortable it is far from healthy to be living in such conditions and I feel that such should be brought to your attention.\n\nI discussed this matter with Dr. Stone during his last visit and suggested to him that a small furnace, wood burning, be put in the basement of the residence to overcome this condition. If you think favorably of the suggestion I could make arrangements with the local man in Sioux Lookout to install a suitable furnace and I am sure it would be economy in the end as far as fuel is concerned.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Rev.) J. F. J. Marshall,\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDec. 6, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Simmons,\n\nI have today received a letter from Mr. Marshall advising me that he has never been able to properly heat the residence portion of the Sioux Lookout School. There must be some obstruction in the pipes leading to that portion of the building. If you will remember the floor level of the residence was about two feet lower than the ground floor of the other portion of the building.\n\nWill you please arrange to have the contractor who installed this plant send a competent man to Sioux Lookout and see if the present unsatisfactory condition can be remedied. I will be glad to hear from you after the steam fitter has been to Sioux Lookout.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR. SUMMERS ORR,\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nJ. H. Simmons, Esq.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDec. 6, 1929.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 30th with reference to the heating of the residence portion of the Sioux Lookout School. If the heating system in that portion of the building is not working satisfactorily the same will have to be put in proper condition, and I am today writing to Mr. Simmons of Winnipeg, contractor for the building, asking him to have the steam fitter who installed this plant come to Sioux Lookout and make the necessary adjustments. If the system is properly installed according to the plans and specifications you should have no difficulty in heating the residence portion of the building.\n\nWith reference to your request for some interior decorating you may arrange to have this work done as suggested and an accountable cheque for $150.00 for the payment of labour is being sent to you.\n\nRegarding your request for lighting fixtures for the staff sitting rooms and staff dining room you may purchase suitable fixtures the first time you are in Winnipeg. Kindly select as economical a fixture as possible.\n\nYou may also arrange for the hauling of the necessary gravel during the winter that will be required to build a concrete gutter around the outside of the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This is a big help in keeping the walls, etc., clean and also preventing the plaster from falling. I do not know the amount required for this but the same could be taken from the plans.

Sir,\n\nWith reference to vouchers received with your statement headed \"Contents of envelope\" dated March 22nd, 1930, I beg to call your attention to the following:\n\n(No. 2). The return of labour accounting for the advance of $150.00 made by cheque No. 5510 states that the work was done \"as per agreement made with the painter\". The written agreement referred to should be forwarded to the Department.\n\n(No. 3). Brandram-Henderson Limited. There was an error of $10.00 in the addition of the statement which accompanied the invoices of this firm. The correct addition according to the figures given in the statement is $372.61. In invoice No. 29 dated January 22nd, 1930, the item for 40 gals. Everlastic varnish at $2.40, extends to $96.00, instead of $168.00, which makes an overcharge of $72.00. When these corrections are made, the amount due this firm is $300.61. I herewith return the vouchers for correction.\n\n(No. 12). This item is misleading, as the sum of $6.65, which you claim to be due you for expenditure over the advance of $375.00 for the root house is included in the labour return amounting to $381.65, and should not have appeared in your statement as a separate voucher.\n\nThe other accounts mentioned in your statement appear to be satisfactory and will be paid, with the exception of Dr. Jefferies' accounts (No. 7) for dentistry, which were returned to you under cover of Department's letter of the 2nd instant, File No. 129-6-13. As soon as they are returned with the particulars asked for in that letter, they will receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. J.F.J. Marshall,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\n\nA.F. MacKenzie\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, April 17, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith further reference to vouchers received with your statement \"Contents of Envelope\", dated the 22nd ultimo, I wish to state that the Department's filing system is such that there is considerable difficulty when accounts of various natures are forwarded in the form of one letter. The present rule is one subject per letter, with any vouchers that are relative thereto attached. Several subjects may be grouped in one letter and vouchers, if any, attached, provided that all pertain to one or other of the following main questions:-\n\n1. General policy at the Institution, appointments, etc.\n2. The quarterly returns.\n3. Per capita payments and current expenses.\n4. Classroom equipment, texts, athletic equipment, etc.\n5. Buildings, repairs, painting, improvements.\n6. Indian agent's inspections and reports.\n7. Public school inspector's inspections and reports.\n8. Farm and building site, fencing, clearing, etc.\n9. Correspondence re pupils, applications, discharges, etc.\n10. Vocational training.\n11. Furnishings.\n12. Medical, dental and hospital.\n13. Livestock and agricultural implements.\n14. New main building under construction or recently constructed.\n15. Water power development, if any.\n16. Students' organizations, Boy scouts, etc.\n\nYou will note that there is no 8 subject. The reason for this is that I have given you the numbers that\n\nRev. J.F.J. Marshall,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 2)\ncorrespond with the Department's filing system. The agency in which the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School is situated is No. 129, the school is No. 6 and practically all letters which you will receive from the Department will commence with 129-6 and will end with one or other of the sub-numbers listed above. When you are replying to a communication or indication enquiry, you should quote file number and date and, as a general rule, keep one subject to one covering letter.\n\nWhen authority has been given to you for some improvement or expenditure and this authority has been executed as directed, a covering letter is really not necessary, as you can forward the account in duplicate, properly certified, referring to the Department's letter on the face of the account; but where there is any comment to be made or explanation or a request for an answer, a covering letter should be prepared.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy Secretary.\nOttawa, May 20, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that funds are available for a cement apron, or concrete gutter, around the foundation of the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School. You may proceed with this work, on a day labour basis, keeping in mind that no unnecessary expense should be incurred. You might let the Department have an interim letter, stating what arrangements you are making and indicating the approximate cost. Before purchasing the cement, please be sure that you are securing the best possible price.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. S. Williams,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J.F.J.

We will engage a man on the day labour basis and will purchase the cement from A.A.J. McDonald in Sioux Lookout. The cement for the root house was purchased through him and I was able to get a good price on same.\n\nWould you kindly forward an accountable cheque for this work. It may be necessary to have a couple of good men on the job but I figure that a very satisfactory job can be made and cost in labor no more than $500.00 by using the boys and superintending the work myself.\n\nThe rains have been quite bad this summer and as a result the play rooms have been almost a swimming tank. It will be such a relief to have it fixed so that the play rooms and wash rooms can be used at all times.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Rev.) J. F. J.

In this connection I have to say that a cheque to the amount of $500 to pay the labour is being sent you under separate cover.\n\nTime sheets, in duplicate, for the labour employed should be kept. A supply of forms for this purpose is enclosed herewith. These returns should be prepared in duplicate, all particulars filled in and signed by the individual labourers employed and certified by yourself, in accounting for the above advance. The accounts covering the cost of the cement should be certified by yourself and forwarded to the Department for payment. You should see that a satisfactory job is completed and that all expense is kept as low as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nFor Secretary.\n\nRev. J. F. J.

INSPECTOR SHANNON,\nDATED NOVEMBER 14, 1930, ON HIS INSPECTION OF\nTHE SIUX LOOKOUT INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 129-6-6.\n\nThe ventilation could be greatly improved if shields of framed Celloglass or ordinary glass about nine inches high be provided for two or three windows in each classroom, so that the windows could be opened an in or two at bottom all the time without causing direct draft on pupils' heads.\n\nAs suggested above, a marked improvement in each classroom would be obtained by having the desks fastened to slats in groups of three or four. The alignment in rows could then be secured with little difficulty as well as the proper spacing of the desks in the row. With loose desks the classroom always has the appearance of disorder and causes considerable trouble to teacher.\nOttawa, January 15, 1931.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his inspection of the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School in November, last, states that the ventilation in each of the classrooms could be greatly improved if deflectors of Celloglass or ordinary glass about nine inches high were installed on two or three of the windows in each classroom, in order that these windows could be kept open a few inches at the bottom without causing a direct draft on the pupils. The Inspector also states that a marked improvement in each classroom could be obtained by having the desks fastened to slats in groups of three or four. The alignment in rows could then be secured, as well as the proper spacing of the desks in the row. He states that with loose desks the classroom has the appearance of disorder and causes trouble to the teacher.\n\nIt is thought that, if material for the making of window deflectors and the lumber for the slats were provided, the staff of the school could do the work. I shall be pleased to hear from you regarding the above matters, giving an estimate of the cost of the materials required and stating whether, if same are supplied, the staff could make the deflectors and fasten the desks to the slats.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. F. J. Marshall,\nPrincipal, Indian Res. School,\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\nWith respect to the Indian Residential School, Anglican, at Pelican, I would beg to draw your attention to a condition examined by me on the occasion of a survey made some time ago.\n\nThe sewage disposal at this point is effected by means of a septic tank, the effluent from which is conducted directly into the lake without any further treatment. At the time of my inspection there was a considerable amount of the sewage mixture with effluvia. This was due to the fact that there was low water and the end of the original effluent is now exposed some 15 ft. above the normal water line. Wastes from the laundry and kitchen are on a separate system and do not pass through the tank. The sewage mentioned above is located on the west side of the bay around the point and about 700 ft. from the water intake. The direction of the current is downstream from the intake. I should say at the present time that I do not think there is any danger of pollution of the water supply.\n\nAs the soil at this point appears to be gravel with clay overburden, I think that there would be a suitable location for a filtration bed. This would be very desirable in view of the fact that the present contamination affects the water shed which may at some future time supply the town of Sioux Lookout and which at present supplies the Canadian National Railways at Sioux Lookout.\n\nMR. INDIAN AGENT EDWARDS REPLIED IN PART AS FOLLOWS:\n\nWe were not aware of the fact owing to the low water, the end of the original effluent is now exposed some 15 feet above the normal water line. As this outlet is below the rapids, there is no danger, now or at any other time, of pollution at the intake of the water supply, or for the water supply for the town of Sioux Lookout or the National Railways.\n\nYou may rest assured that the Department's first consideration is for the health of the people, and we don't consider there is any danger to health at any of the schools.\n\nBefore installation of the sewage disposal plant at schools is made, great care is taken that the health situation is being cared for.\nOttawa, March 20, 1931.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to letter to you of the 20th August, I have to request that you will be good enough to account for the advance of $500.00 made to you by official cheque No. 5281 on the 20th August to defray expenditure in connection with the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School buildings. The matter should receive prompt attention as the fiscal year 1930-31 is about to close and the cheque was drawn against the appropriation for the said year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.H.

This breakage happened when you were away on the treaty trip, otherwise I would have wired you regarding the repair. The crank shaft broke when we were returning from town, opposite to Potts camp. The engine had a full supply of oil and it has been a puzzle to me as to what caused the break, other than the heavy strain on this type of motor.\n\nI had taken the engine out thinking I might have been able to have made the necessary repairs but when I saw the main centre bearing broken I knew it was beyond our capacity. I had the boat towed into town by the Forestry and the mechanic from the Sioux Motors came down to examine it. He said from what he could judge the engine would have to go into Winnipeg as the main crank shaft was broken and part of the babbitt had scored the inside of the cylinder block; so being hard pushed for time I gave him instructions to go ahead and put the engine in running shape and to keep the price as low as possible, which I think he has. He installed the engine in the boat and gave it a good looking over after it had been running for three or four trips, but he warned me that with these converted automobile engines, and this style particularly, when the blocks have been re-bored and fitted with oversized pistons to make them into marine engines, it would be impossible if anything happened the cylinder blocks again to re-bore them and have them run with safety. This will mean condemning the engine and having to buy a new one.\n\nI would strongly recommend to the Department that when they do consider buying a new engine that it would be one built for marine purposes only.\n\nDuring the time that this boat was out of commission I had to walk in to town four times in the one\nweek and it is very awkward at the present time to get in by train as the local has cut off two trips a week; the other times they are very late, sometimes around seven and eight o'clock. This means it is useless to us if we have any business to be done in town.\n\nI hope that you and the Treaty Party arrived home safely and that the Doctor isn't any the worse for the wear of his sixteenth annual treaty trip. I am sure that you are all glad to be back home once more.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Rev.) J. F. J.

The third item on the program was sufficient paint to finish painting the rest of the interior of the school, the sewing room, dormitories, Chapel, classrooms, basement halls and laundry. We figured that about $450.00 would complete the job allowing about $150.00 for the painter, the balance for material.\n\nThe dormitories and classrooms could be done at the present time while the children are away from school. We have the old painter I spoke of before still with us and I have him going over part of these with sizing preparation awaiting your reply to purchase paint. We hope you may see your way clear to allow us to finish the painting of the interior. I may say that the outside has been finished and is a great improvement to the appearance as well a protection to the buildings.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Rev.) J. F. J.

In reply I have to say that our Appropriation this year was considerably reduced and we will have no funds to provide for this expenditure. Only the most urgent requirements at our schools can receive consideration this year.

Namely, sewing room, dormitories, Chapel, basement halls, laundry and staff sitting rooms.\n\nFarm implements, approximate cost $125.00. Double mould-board plow and cultivator.\n\nReplacing shafting in engine room, approximate cost $125.00. The present shafting is rather light for the work in hand and has at the present time been repaired twice. Heavier shafting was recommended by the engine inspector. This would necessitate new bushings in the pulleys. I would like if this work could be done this winter as any break in the shaft again might cause damage to the engine or dynamo and as the amount is not very exorbitant I would deem it on the part of safety to have it replaced.\n\nMaterial for Indian house, approximate cost $2,000.00. This is much needed. When the Indians come to visit their children we have to put them to sleep in the classrooms. The labour can be done by the school management.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Rev.) J. F. J.

These people quoted us prices on heavy engines, of $1,000 and over, so we wrote them again, asking for lighter engines and more suitable for our Gidley-Ford boat, and this is the best prices obtainable.\n\nThis FARR Marine motor is something new to me, I have never heard of them before. We might term it a Kermath Jr. and I would judge it would cost in the neighbourhood of $750, including freight and installing same. Or if the Department do not see their way clear to sanction such an amount, the rebuilt on Page One of the letter, seems a very good buy, but then again it is only a second hand engine.\n\nWe would appreciate it if you would kindly make inquiries from Stones regarding the FARR engine. I think we would be safe in putting our figure in around $750, even if we have to find out more regarding the qualifications of this engine that they recommend.

Toronto, would be the best he could get for his purpose. We understand that the Farr engine is manufactured in the U.S.A., and the Anderson Boat Co. of Kenora recommend the Russell engine, Model MD55, which they can let us have for $665.00 F.O.B. Fort Frances. The quoted price of this model is $775.00 and this engine is made in Canada and the freight charges would be less than from Toronto, but personally we doubt if this engine would be as good as the Farr.\n\nWe shall be glad if you will return to Mr. Marshall, his letter and file as neither of us have kept a copy of the correspondence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDear Sir,\n\nWe received your letter regarding fire escapes and fire drill No. 1-1-5, dated Feb. 1932, and wish to take advantage of your suggestion in the last paragraph - \"Any Principal who is not satisfied with the fire escape and fire prevention facilities should report immediately to the Department.\"\n\nWe would like to place before the Department several things regarding the fire escapes in this school.\n\nBoth fire escapes are at the back of the building, the one on the boys side coming right down on the roof of the boiler room, with a seven foot drop, and the one on the girls side emptying into a cove made by the kitchen wall and the children's dining room wall. Both these places are very dangerous.\n\nOur fire escapes are the iron stair type with very little protection for the small children at the sides. The exits on the girls side on the top floor are from the small dormitory and from a window, hinged door style, opening out against the wall, 41 inches from the floor. Immediately in front of this window is a toilet. It is the only fire escape for the big dormitory and intermediate on the top floor. On the next floor, still on the girls side, there is no fire escape out of the little girls dormitory, and the exit on this floor is from two windows half way down, opening with windows 31 inches from the floor. Then another exit from the girls hospital which necessitates going from the dormitory through three doors and two hallways, a very complicated exit and landing one into a maze of doors, then climb over a radiator and through a window 34\u00bd inches from the floor.\n\nThe stairways in this school are exceptionally well planned out and are in my estimation safer by far than the outside fire escapes and should anything happen whereby the stairway was to give way, there would be mighty little chance of anyone being able to gain the fire escapes where they are placed. We also have put an extra hand rail on the wall side of the stairs. Safety first!\n\nThe same may be said of the boys side with the exception that there is a door going through the dispensary and into the sunroom which opens on to the fire escape letting down on to the boiler room roof. The two dormitories have their exits similar to those of the girls side; they would necessitate a drop of six feet onto the roof of the porch. The two top dormitories have their exits similar to those of the girls, from the smaller dormitory through a window 41 inches from the floor, also climbing over a toilet.\n\nOn the boys side the stairway is similar to that of the girls, splendidly planned, with a rest and fair sized landing halfway down each set of stairs.\n\nOn the main hall we have good exits; the main door, the residence door and a door leading on to the verandah from our sewing room, together with the two doors opening out on to the playground halfway between the main floor and the basement.\nHaving a personal dread of fire possibly born in one, and very well emphasized, I may say that I almost lost my life in the big Toronto fire of 1904, the following year having one in our own school building with it, with two others, until we put it out, two of us being severely burned, and spending 16 years in the north where in the summer one lives in dread of bush fires and in the winter from over heated stove pipes, or lamps, it means that I have made a study of possible fires and the best way to escape. Then the experience of the last fire in this school a year ago, still bears out the necessity of ever being on the watch. I may say that the fire extinguishers and hose in this building are the best that money can buy, and the fire extinguishers are adequate and kept up to date. Systematic patrols are made through the school in the day time as well as in the evening, the fire warder going through on his last trip from 10.30 P.M. to 2.00 A.M., and I personally go through the school from attic to basement about midnight. Our fireman is up at 2.30 A.M. leaving the time between 12.30 and 3.30 the only time in the 24 hours that no one is on patrol, and believe me the dormitories are locked.\n\nWhat I wish to point out is the inadequacy of the present fire escapes on this school and the place where they empty out. As we are all alone on a point we realise that we have to depend wholly on ourselves in case of emergency and I have strongly recommended before, the advisability of purchasing the bank fire escape as built, I believe, by the Chicago Bridge & Iron Works, similar to the type that are on the majority of Winnipeg schools. I have visited the Winnipeg schools on more than one occasion to examine these fire escapes before I recommended them to the Department and am told do not provide a back stair to the dormitories on the second floor, at ease regarding the exits. Think what this type of fire escape go in effect, down the floors, the same as walking into a hall, and you will suddenly find yourself on the slide and in a few seconds land outside. On taking the matter up with some of the principals in Winnipeg, I asked them if there was any possibility of them obtaining and they claim there is not, that very few of them get away while on the way out. I strongly recommend this type to our Commission Authorities when in their office last April and also to the Department. I know they do not tend to add beauty from an architectural standpoint, as they look like two silos one on each end of the building, but when one knows what they are for, they add efficiency in the equipment line and considerable peace of mind to persons who have them in their schools.\n\nIf I may offer the suggestion, I do think it would be well worth the Department's while to look into this type of fire escape as they are long past the experimental stage.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Rev.) J. F. J. MARSHALL\nPrincipal\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, CANADA\nOttawa, March 7th, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to fire prevention at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School. The Department is glad to have your report in this connection and to note that you are treating this very important matter quite seriously. I may say that the Department does not supply the tube fire escapes as used in some public schools as our Architect believes the steel stair type is quite adequate as long as they are properly placed and the exits are satisfactory. The Department has pictures of your school taken from the rear, showing the location of the fire escapes and any comment you make will be quite understandable to our Architect. Can you recommend any other placing of these escapes to make them really efficient? Would it be possible to change the function of some of the rooms which lead to the escapes to assist in making the problem easier?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J.

I was able to obtain the services of a man who had built stone drains in Scotland for the railway. He laid stone in around the main building 36 inches wide and 14 inches deep. To draw the water off from the cement we constructed two stone drains leading down to the river. This part of the work was completed a year ago and as the appropriation for labour had been used up we carried on with the cement work under the school management. Our cement ran out before we were around to the girls side so I got 100 bags to carry on and hope this amount will be sufficient to complete the work.\n\nWe also had trouble with our main drain from the school from time to time. This trouble was always in the same place so during the summer holidays when the drain was not so greatly used we built a cement manhole at the place where the trouble used to occur. Since then we have had very little difficulty with blockage. At the outlet to the drain, which was constructed during high water, we also put in another cement box to take the drop from the height, and also to act as a catch basin before the water ran on to the playroom floor. On raising the cement box to within about five feet of the river level, part with tile pipe, the balance with a wooden box. The outlet to this drain had caused considerable comment from the Medical Health Inspector. This work was done at the actual cost of material, with most of the material being on the place.\n\nOn looking over our letter to you of March 30th, 1931, I regret that I have overlooked the last sentence. I purchased this cement in good faith for the work but did not carry out as I had said and - \"asked for permission to buy sufficient cement to complete the work.\"\n\nI may say that the cement gutter is proving up very satisfactory as far as we have carried it around and we think will prevent the continual wetting of the play room floors in the spring time and after rain.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Rev.) J. P. J. MARSHALL\nPrincipal\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Canada\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 2)\nDear Sir,\n\nOur letter of today's date covering cement work, gives you notice of part of the work we have been carrying on this last summer. The floor in the barn, which is only of wood laid on 2x4 scantlings on top of a fill in, was very badly in need of repair, and knowing the shortage of funds we did not want to trouble you for any appropriation, as we considered it will only be a short time before we will have put in a good cement floor in the entire barn. So we ripped out the floor in the cattle stalls and also in part of the horse stable. We used what parts of the planks we could and if you remember we had a two plank road around the school; we lifted each end of it so as we needed to replace the floor of the stalls in the cattle and the horse stable. This is the third time we have replaced the floors in the horse stalls and we raised the floor in the cow stalls in some places six inches, filling in under with stone and gravel.\n\nWe also overhauled the water tank and practically rebuilt the little house holding the heater and the pipes, as the ice almost demolished it. The entire wooden casing around the pipes dropped clean through the roof of the taking room and all with it. We jacked up the wooden casing that is around the pipe, which is about a 3' box by 50' long, putting in new supports under it made of 6x6. The old ones were only 2x4. When we overhauled the tank we noted that a number of the iron rods will be needing replacing in the near future but we hope we will be able to carry on for another year.\n\nThe latter part of the summer of 1930 being a dry season we took advantage of the dryness and put through a fairly deep ditch, draining the muskeg back of the school out to the lake. Then we built in a crib work of lumber and poles as a pipe before we filled it in. This proved very satisfactory in the second fall although the ground in the low lying areas is sour, we were able to plow and seed it with some clover. The balance of the part immediately behind the school is cleared back to where you saw the first tree line and with that and the small garden we have planted there, we took in 600 bushels of potatoes. We had a fair amount of other vegetables seeded but in June we had a sand storm come through from Saskatchewan that settled all over this district. I think some of the people in the surrounding country thought that the plagues of Egypt had come upon them. We had cut worms and caterpillars immeasurably and the grasshoppers were a burden, so that our vegetable stuff was cleaned out completely, even cleaning off the rhubarb leaves, but we were very grateful for the abundant crop of potatoes which helped materially in the food question of the school. We always have a little job that keeps us busy in spare time, which is pulling out stumps.\nRegarding the children this year, the health of the little ones has been very good, with two serious cases, one of appendicitis which we had to rush in to the hospital. Otherwise, they seem to have become acclimatized to their surroundings and also have a good appetite for the white man's food, which is sure enough to go very hard on the little ones and on their stomachs, and it takes considerable watching to guard against upsetting them. Some will not even drink milk who have been here for over a year but they get it in various other forms.\n\nWe had some difficulty in maintaining the number that we have as during the holidays an epidemic of smallpox broke out in the Pagwa River, in the settlement to the south of the bridge. A number of our people lived to the north of the bridge and on the opposite side of the river. When they heard that the doctor pronounced it smallpox, a number of them were missing the next morning, and they had not returned back to the settlement at the time when I visited them about August 25th. Nor had they returned to the settlement even for Christmas. This epidemic meant that five of our boys had not returned to school. It came too far to go after them so I immediately filled their places with other children, from this, or other reserves.\n\nWe have twelve names on our register of children not returned this term who are out for various causes; some through sickness, some through death, and three through absolute indifference on the part of the parents. This number was greater than I had expected and together with the number who had left owing to age or graduation, left a greater number to hunt up as new pupils. We are very fortunate in being able to recruit the number that we did in such a short time. We are carrying now as many as we have beds for and have applications on hand for several that are coming in in the spring.\n\nThis is just a little insight into the work that does not appear on general reports and I know you like to hear from time to time how we are getting along. Thanking you for past considerations of our needs and assuring you that we will do our very best to keep things up to the mark and the requirements as low as possible, I remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Rev.)

Sir:\n\nI have your letters of the 7th instant, with reference to the account which you submit covering the cost of 100 bags of cement and freight, used on the cement gutter at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School. The work that was carried out in this connection has been noted, and it is hoped, as a result, that this will prevent the continual wetting of the playroom floors in the Spring and after rains. The account for the cement and freight will be paid in due course.\n\nI have also noted the work that was carried out in repairing the floor in the barn, overhauling the old water tank and wooden casings around the water pipes; also the draining of the muskeg back of the school.\n\nYour remarks regarding the health of the pupils and the difficulty in having several of them returned after the summer holidays have also been noted.\n\nI wish to thank you for the report regarding the work carried out during the past year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

In this connection we would refer you to our letter of February 23rd last. Would you kindly look into this matter, as there are no roads to Sioux Lookout from the School, and they have to depend mostly on water travel.\n\nThe Reverend Principal also informs us that expenses due Miss Cunningham for taking the Cromartie Children to Dynever Hospital have not been received by Miss Cunningham. This refers to Voucher #6175 Authority Department letter 93-44 of March 18th, 1932, which was forwarded to you on April 23rd last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, June 28, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, regarding the supplying of a new engine for the boat in use at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School. Your former letter, dated February 23rd, last, in which you submitted quotations received for the supplying of an engine, was inadvertently overlooked. I regret the Department has no funds to cover the cost of supplying this equipment. The school authorities will have to be responsible for the expenditure for the purpose, from their per capita allowance or other receipts.

This shafting is rather light for the work, and heavier shafting has been recommended by the engine inspector. We understand this work would necessitate new bushings, and that the estimated cost of installing the heavier shafting would be approximately $125.\n\nI have to request that you will take this matter up with the Principal and ascertain from him definitely what is required, and you should then arrange for the purchase of the equipment required and for the installation of same. The school authorities would, no doubt, be able to provide the greater amount of the labour in carrying out the work. The total cost of this improvement should not exceed the amount stated above. After the heavier shafting has been installed, please forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nAttention was also drawn to the need of replacement of the metal fittings on the toilet seats, at an estimated cost of $50. I have also to request that you will take up this matter with the Principal and arrange for the purchase of the fittings required and have same installed on the toilet seats.

We got Ashdowns to send these things down rush and we worked all night to rip the old ones out. We plugged the intake and outlet of the hot water tank so we could keep the boilers working and when Ashdowns rushed the pipe through it was not a question of the same thing the night after. We carry no steam pipe on hand, therefore the rush order. We hope you will not think it is presumption on our part, getting these repairs first and then asking afterwards, but it meant maintaining our fires pretty well at all costs.\n\nI was surprised at the pipes we had taken out. They were in good condition on the part where the steam ran through but on the part exposed to the hot water tank itself they were eaten away to such an extent that I pushed a 2\u00bd inch nail through them in some places. I must take this matter up with Inspector Kelly and see if he can recommend something that might be painted on the pipes that have to go in to the boiler and are exposed to the water. As the water is used for bathing, dish washing and general use, one cannot use any strong solution that would become detrimental to its use in other parts of the building. However, I find it in good shape before I left for Toronto, but on return found that the invoices were not made out properly. I had to return them to Ashdowns and they have just been returned to us.\n\nThe 12 machine bolts also belong to the same piece of work as we had to saw the bolts off the brackets erected on the inside of the tank to hold the pipes, to get the pipes out.\n\nWe are also enclosing an account for gasoline fuel tank, duly certified. We had to write three times to get the receipted freight bill, they seemed to think the ordinary shipping bill would do, but it does not.\n\nHoping all this will meet with your approval, we remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Rev.)

MARSHALL\nPrincipal\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Canada\nDear Sir,\n\nIn compliance with your letter No. 129-5-5 dated Feb. 21st, 1933, I am pleased to submit the following report on the breakdown of the engine of the lighting plant at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nOur lighting plant is an R.A. Lister 10-12 H.P., which runs the dynamo direct drive. This engine supplies us with power for our lighting, pumping our water, running our laundry and our bread mixer.\n\nOn the evening of Feb. 20th, the engineer had just left the engine room to go on his rounds to see that the water in the automatic flush toilets and the toilets were turned off for the night. He had just made his round up as far as the first floor when the buzzer from the water tank gauge sounded, meaning that the water tank was full. He immediately went down to stop the pump and on entering the engine room noticed something wrong with the engine and immediately shut it down. He came up to the office for me, it was about ten minutes after nine. I went down with him to the engine room, we examined the engine and found that the connecting rod had come loose and had broken through the side of the base on which the engine is built. Upon further examination we found that the piston and the cylinder head were badly damaged. I then looked around for the cause of the break and found in the bottom of the base a broken connecting rod bolt, one nut and a broken cotter pin. I showed same to the mechanic from the garage who came out to do the welding. He gave it some technical name but it simply means that the steel in the bolt had sort of become crystallized and broke. On overhauling our engine, we have used new cotter pins wherever possible there was likely to be a strain. The engine carries sufficient oil at all times to keep the bearings lubricated as it pumps from the base to the bearings and there were nearly two gallons of oil in the base at the time.\n\nI then realised the necessity of quick action and on sizing up as far as possible the damage done to the engine, I gave instructions that no water was to be used from the pressure tank for general use and that the boys could go on the bucket brigade to supply the necessary water to satisfy their thirst. I also left instructions with the engineer to adjust the line shaft the next day so that we could use the tractor for pumping water. (This he had almost completed on my return Wednesday.) I then left for Sioux Lookout to catch No. 1, which passes through at 1.30 A.M. for Winnipeg.\n\nOn arrival I proceeded direct to the firm of R.A. Lister and consulted with their manager, Mr. Munford, and his chief mechanic, as to the best thing to do under the circumstances. As they had no engine of our type in stock at the time, I looked over several of their other engines to see if they could be hooked up with our engine plant as a substitute. There was one they had which made a very complete unit and could have been attached to\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nour dynamo with an extended shaft and pulley being put on the engine of the dynamo and the dynamo to be driven by a belt. This outfit would have weighed crated close on to a ton. It would have also necessitated the mechanic coming down with tools to adjust the dynamo to the dynamo. The mechanic's transportation from the time of travelling would have amounted to about $10.00 freight would have amounted to about 10. or $12. on the engine. At the end of the discussion, we came to the conclusion to give the old Fordson a trial the way I had previously instructed the engineer.\n\nI then collected some of the parts that I knew were so badly damaged as to be beyond repair and took the flight train back to Sioux Lookout, and it had to be late that night. Wednesday morning I was out early and routed out the owner of the garage and his mechanic to see if they could come out to the school to weld the broken parts. On examining their gas gauge they found they had not sufficient gas or air in their tanks to do an extended job. They promised they would borrow one from the C.N.R. shops or some place, and asked me to make arrangements to have it transported from Sioux Lookout to the school, as they were unable to get things in time to have them come on the local which leaves Sioux Lookout at 4:30 A.M. Upon arrival at the school I sent six boys with the Boy's Master, in to town to haul the mechanics outfit out on a large hand sleigh. This outfit weighed, with the tanks and all complete, nearly 500 lbs.\n\nThe engineer and myself completed the work of adjusting the shaft and getting the tractor driving with a belt through the window to work pumping water and we adjusted one of the pulleys from the laundry on to the engine of our dynamo and were able to keep our batteries charged, but were not able to drive it fast enough to give them a continuous light in the school, so they reverted to a supply of lanterns that I keep in stock.\n\nWe worked through dismantling the engine and had it ready for the mechanic to start his part of the work in preparation for welding. He and his helper started about 10 o'clock and I was to waken them at 6 A.M., when we went to work on the welding itself. This was completed by 7 o'clock in the morning and they walked back into town.\n\nAs soon as the engine base was cool enough to handle the engineer and myself started in to reassemble the engine and when the other parts which we had sent to Winnipeg for arrived on the passenger train, we completed the work and had the engine running again smoothly and were able to get back to our regular routine the following Tuesday.\n\nPersonally, I do not think that the breakage was caused by neglect. I still retain the parts which were broken, which I found in the base of the base. No one regrets more than the engineer and myself the engine breaking loose, as we have taken an emotional pride in our lighting plant as well as the rest of the whole plant. The engineer particularly, being an Englishman, and coming not far from where the diesel oil firms works are, has that English pride in the British made goods. I don't know of any other way, other than replacing bolts from time to time, to guard against such breakdowns, but we can assure you that we are taking the best\nof care of these things to the best of our ability and when not knowing enough of certain parts of the plant we call in an inspector, or ask for advice from the manufacturers of such.\n\nI hope this will give you a full, if lengthy, report on our recent expenditure, and wish to thank you for so quickly coming to our aid when in distress.\n\nI addressed this wire to Dr. Stone, knowing that he had visited the school and personally knew the plant, and hope it was not conflicting Department business in any way.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Rev.) J. F. J. MARSHALL\nPrincipal\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Canada\nDear Captain Edwards,\n\nThis is in reference to your note on \"How about the $75.00 for transportation.\" Really, we have been so rushed the last couple of months it was hard to get time to think. I have had this transportation on the go off and on since before Christmas and now we have got it to the stage where it is now coming in the envelope. We have picked out the nearest to the $75.00 we possibly could, which is $75.15. Our transportation this year has run to about $345.00 and we are very glad indeed to have the $75.00 grant from the Department to assist towards bringing the children back to school again.\n\nTo ease your mind, our lighting plant is in running order again. I haven't received any accounts yet but expect them in on the next mail. Therefore, I am unable to say what the actual cost will be, but did not fail to ship the engine down to Winnipeg at a substantial saving. We plugged old Henry on to the line shaft and kept the water supply up to regular height, also turning the dynamo over to keep the batteries charged, but as Henry Fordson was outside, and the line shaft, pump and dynamo inside, we used very little electric light.\n\nWe had to get a man out from Sioux Lookout to do the welding for us. Mr. Mayo, Jack and myself re-fitted the engine into running order again. The welders were the proverbial plumbers, leaving the connection pipe from the building like a ditch through the middle of the building. Jack walked into town and came out on the midnight with the parts that fitted and I wakened them up at 4 o'clock A.M. so they had their work over before eight, and were able to walk into town.\n\nThe other accounts I am chasing up so as to have them all in next week.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n(Rev.)

We note it has cost the school $345.00 for transportation.\n\nA short time ago we received a wire from the Principal, informing us that the engine that supplies Water and Light had gone wrong and that he had gone to Winnipeg to see about the necessary repairs. He also informed us that he had communicated with Ottawa by telegraph, so we did not notify you.\n\nWe inclose a letter we have now received from the Principal explaining what he has done to repair the engine and presume that the Department will authorize the payment of the accounts. We do not know what they will amount to, but we know that the Principal will keep them as low as possible.\n\nWe would like to take this opportunity of mentioning the splendid co-operation and endeavour the Principal is using, to keep down expenditure at the School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We have here the invoices of the Beaver Laundry Machinery Co. for $21.87, replacing the shafting and pulley on the extractor, which was badly needed. Also the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Co. Ltd. for $57.75 and $7.50. We have another one from Ashdowns, they had to procure the goods from the East and as they have been some time getting them we did not deem it wise to hold these invoices up any longer. The Ashdown invoice will be around $30. or $31.00, making a total of about $117.00.\n\nI may say that there are no labour charges to be taken into consideration as we did the work ourselves and we appreciate the kindness of the Department in supplying us the necessary things to work with.

(RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 2)\nDear Captain Edwards,-\n\nIn our covering letter to you of March 9th. re. the invoices of Fairbanks-Morse and Beaver Laundry Machinery Co. for shafting, we stated the Ashdown invoices were late in coming. They have since arrived and am enclosing the same. If perchance the invoice covering the express charges is on the mail when I arrive in town, I will enclose it. I am also getting the express receipt from Len Graham, and if the charges come along later, will take care of them in petty cash, so this will enable the Department to close up the account for shafting - their letter of Nov. 21st. 1932, No. 129-6-5.\n\nThe set of dies I had to purchase, as on replacing the shafting, there were a number of bolts which we had to re-thread and I got tired of carrying them into town, so decided to include this small outfit, which will come in very useful for other things, on the shafting order. The Cement also comes in under that heading.\n\nHoping this will enable the Department to clear this account before the end of the month,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n(Rev.) J. F. J.

I note on checking over these amounts that the amount that should be coming to me is $88.51, an account from the Winnipeg Brass, who sent them good C.O.D. and I redeemed them, forwarding the receipted C.O.D. railway voucher.\n\nThe amount of $99.74 is for Brown & Rutherford of Winnipeg, Department letter #129/6/5, dated 15th October 1932, lumber material purchased, not to exceed $100.00.\n\nThe amount of $87.12 is sanctioned in Department letter #129/6/5, Nov. 21st, 1932, and the amount is made up - Ist. Beavco Laundry Machinery Co. Toronto $21.85 End. Fairbanks-Morse of Winnipeg $65.25\n\nIf by returning this cheque and having the other new cheques made out would involve a total of $225.37 being brought in under 1933 appropriation I would willingly have the return of the cheque and me depositing the cheques and issue cheques covering various accounts, obtaining receipted invoices, and forward same to you. As I know this year you will need every cent that you possibly can save. I had thought over this way of doing it, then again I considered it might lead to some difficulty in the Finance Department if I deposited the cheque and paid the accounts, as they might require cancelled cheques.\n\nHowever, I am willing to help out in the best way you see fit, therefore I am placing it in your hands so it may not cause any inconvenience to your 1933 appropriation.

This school is beautifully situated and is in splendid condition. The Principal is busy clearing land, using a tractor for the purpose. It was necessary for him to incur an expense of approximately $200.00 for this purpose. There is $1,000.00 available in our appropriation for this school this year and Agent Edwards will submit accounts covering the cost of repairs.\n\nThe only means of reaching this school in summer is by motor boat. A new engine is badly needed. I told the Principal that the Department would likely be able to provide the funds this year, and he and Agent Edwards will obtain prices from a firm on the approved list for a motor of a type that would be satisfactory and submit same to the Department.\n\nWhen the accounts covering the cost of repairs to the tractor are received, I would recommend that they be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

You should therefore obtain itemized accounts covering the cost of materials and labour. These you should attach proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. Please state on each copy of your voucher that the expenditure was incurred under authority of E. R. No. 1053.\n\nWith reference to the purchase of an engine for the school boat, I have to say that the Department will approve of the Principal and yourself arranging to obtain an engine, of a type that would be of sufficient capacity to operate the boat. You should obtain prices for the supplying of this equipment from firms on the list to receive tenders. The cost, if possible, the cost of the engine delivered at Sioux Lookout, should not exceed the sum of $600. It would be advisable for you to consult the Principal regarding the type and manufacture of the engine considered by him to be satisfactory. An account, in triplicate, stating full particulars regarding the engine supplied and the cost obtained, etc., you should attach proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment after the engine has been delivered to the satisfaction of the Principal. Please state on each copy of the voucher that the expenditure was incurred under authority of E. R. No. 1053, a copy of which is enclosed.\n\nIt is hoped that it will be possible to secure the engine at a price not exceeding the above authorized amount.

The prices of this would come in under Mr. Sutherland's amount quoted to us, and to keep it in under the $700, the school would take over the freight and the cost of installing the engine into the boat.\n\nThe Kermath seems to me to be the most reliable and well built power plant for marine work in all the engines that I have known, and I have been around water places most of my life. I have been in boats since I was 8 years old. I have looked into and inquired into other makes, but on the majority of them they have sacrificed durability for speed and lightness, therefore they are not to be classed with the Kermath.\n\nI think if we carry out Mr. Sutherland's instructions in sending him these letters direct addressed to him personally, they will receive better attention than going through the ordinary channel, and I do hope that we succeed in getting this Kermath as quoted in their letter of October 20th. Here's the best of luck for it.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n(Rev.) J. F. J.

In this connection I have to say that, in addition to E. R. No. 1063, which covers what you under covered in your letter of the 19th ultimo, I enclose E. R. No. 1100, for $130. This will make a total expenditure of $730 authorized for the purchase of this engine, which should provide for the cost of the engine and sales tax on same. The Principal will have to pay the cost of freighting the engine to the school and having it installed in the boat.\n\nYou may therefore arrange to purchase an engine of the type mentioned in the communication from the Kermath Manufacturing Company, which is returned herewith, as requested. The business is to be awarded this time provided they are on the approved list. You should request that arrangements be completed for the purchase and delivery of the engine at an early date. Please obtain an account, in triplicate, covering the cost, including sales tax, if any. This account, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. You should state in a copy of the account that the expenditure was incurred under authority of E. R. No. 1063 and No. 1100.

I remarked then that I did not consider it very sanitary or satisfactory to wash milk pails, etc., in the same sink as the children's dishes, against it as there was no other place where we could wash them. The sinks in the kitchen, dairy and bakery are of the shallow type ordinary kitchen sink; so I thought it advisable to bring to your attention the necessity of having a wash sink for the milking utensils alone.\n\nI have also been in communication with the Alberta Dairy Supply Co. of Winnipeg, and have found out they have a two compartment sink which they supply to the dairies, butchers, bakers and farms for washing their pails and pans. This is made up of heavy galvanized iron, with four iron legs. The total length of the sink is 72 inches by 27 inches wide, depth 16 inches. The price quoted was $25.00 F.O.B. Winnipeg.\n\nIf the Department would supply us with the sink, we would do the necessary fittings, that is, connecting up the water pipes and the drainage from the sink.\n\nI may say that I dread the summer time coming on when hot water is not as plentiful as it is in the winter, making it necessary for the extra washing of the children's sink both before and after the washing of the milk pans.\n\nI do hope you had a few minutes to spare to call around at the Alberta Dairy Supply Co., who handle these various wash sinks and tanks. Or if there was anything else they may have shown you while you were there that might be more suitable for our purpose, we would be very glad indeed to have the information.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Rev.)

He requests us to purchase a double compartment sink for washing milk cans, pails etc., as at the present time they have to be washed in the same sink as the children's dishes, not a very sanitary arrangement. While in Winnipeg the other day, I called on the Alberta Dairy Co. and discussed the matter with them. The sink mentioned by the Principal at a cost of $25.00 is very reasonable and we would like, if possible, to get authority to purchase this for the school, as we consider it very necessary for sanitary reasons.\n\nThe freight from Winnipeg, would not amount to very much.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, March 10, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your 108-23 of the 6th instant, I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase of a double compartment sink for washing milk cans, etc., to be used at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that the cost of the above will be $25.00, plus freight from Winnipeg.

I was shown around the buildings and also the farm. I was particularly interested in the large herd of beautiful cows, which have been tested and the milk that has been used by the children.\n\nI was pleased with the appearance of the children and the cleanliness of the rooms. However, I observed one serious drawback\u2014there is no proper fire escape. Should a fire occur, I am afraid the result will be most serious. It seems to me that something should be done to avoid this danger.\n\nI also noticed that the floors were rather damp. Marshall said he would be quite willing to put in cement floors if the Department would.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose the application of Daniel Masakeyosh, the son of David Masakeyosh, No. 195 Osnabugh Band for admission into the Pelican Lake Residential School.\n\nAs this boy has been pronounced medically fit, I have advised the father that he may send the boy to the school when it reopens about the first of September.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Now I am getting down to clearing the basket, if it is possible for once in a while to see the bottom.\n\nI am somewhat puzzled over your letter of July 14th regarding letter #189-6-5 of the 10th instant. We had Mr. Arey here on a visit while staying over in Sioux Lookout together with Dr. Mitchell and two other Doctors. As we discussed the matter they said he visited the broken planks in part of it and I told him we had made application for a new cement floor and had hoped that the Department would have seen their way clear to have granted us the amount and permission to put it in. This you will readily have been able to see for the last few years and when Mr. Sutherland was up here last year he realized the conditions under which we were working; I suppose that due to his illness the matter has been overlooked. I do hope this isn't another way they have of putting it off for another indefinite period.\n\nI think, with your permission, I will delay the purchase of the suitable planks to replace the broken ones, which practically will mean delaying the barn until after we have seen the Health of Animals Inspector there to see the cattle on the block tested for contagious abortion, as personally I think that the condition under the planks may be the breeding place of this germ which has evidently got into our herd. I would not want to have the extra cost of planks and the work of laying them if the Health of Animals Inspector was to condemn the floor that was already in the barn. I may say that we expect the Veterinary Doctor at any time, as this is the months they like to test the herds for this and T.B., and will write you as soon as possible after the visit of this Health of Animals Branch Inspector.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd.)

(RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 3)\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed please find letter we have received from the Principal of the Indian Residential School at Sioux Lookout re the Fire Escapes at the school as referred to in your letter 129-6-5 of 10th inst..\n\nApparently the Department has full information re this situation, on file, but when we are next at the School, we will discuss the matter fully with the Principal.\n\nKindly return the Principal's Letter for our files.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSIOUX LOOKOUT INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nSioux Lookout, Ont.,\nJuly 27, 1934.\n\nDear Captain Edwards:\n\nRe. the last paragraph of your letter of July 14th were Mr. Awrey states the serious lack of fire escapes. This matter has been under investigation at different times both with the late Mr. Russell Ferrier and at the time Mr. Sutherland and yourself were over here a year ago, but to alter the present fire escapes would involve a considerable amount of money.\n\nAs Mr. Awrey was going through the school he noted the outlets, but as I stated to him, all these outlets were on and around stairways and if your stairway was endangered your fire escapes were practically useless. So true to the word of continual supervision, carefulness in smoking all fires, and I myself personally patrolling the building from top to bottom every night between eleven and twelve. I have gone into the fire escape question not only on this but on other schools and buildings and made a study of it; and after considering various types I have come to the conclusion that the tank system seems to be very best where schools or institutions have a number of people depending on open stairways for safe exit. I also looked into the costs of these at the time and reported the same to the Department in our letter of February 14th, 1933 and haven't had any reason to change my opinion regarding them rather in other ways I have seen this type of fire escape on the increase even taken up by hospitals, but as I stated above, at the present time the cost of them is prohibitive.\n\nWhen Mr. Awrey and the company of Doctors were here, I had not understood that they were on an inspection tour and I think these things have all been carefully noted by yourself and that you have done all that can be done, without any further inspection.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd.)

Cement floor and steel fittings for Barn.\n   Estimated cost\n   Cement $300.00\n   Steel fittings $200.00\n   Lumber $100.00\n   Total $600.00\n\nWhen our Barn was built in 1926, it was built on the side of a hill with considerable fill in on one side and the end. It was therefore economical to put in a wooden floor with wooden partitions for cattle. Since then, the floor has settled and plank floors have filled up with gravel three times to make up for the settling of the ground, doing the necessary repairs with whatever plank we happened to have around the place, but the floor is very unsanitary and impossible to keep clean.\n\nThe Veterinary Inspector states same to be the cause of infection in the case of sickness and abortions. The necessary work for this work can be handled in the winter time, if you let us know in time.\n\n2. One new set of batteries for lighting plant.\n   Approximately $500.00\n\n3.

(RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nOn Nov. 7th, 1934, I wrote you regarding the breakdown of our generator, stating that I had shipped the coil in by express to R.A. Listers agents, Mumford, Medland, Ltd. The firm wired back stating they wanted the other part of the generator, the same was shipped to them without delay.\n\nA broken wire causing the short circuit, according to the statement of the electrician of Mumford Medland, burnt out considerable of the inside wiring of the commutator. This made it necessary to rewind and rebuild the commutator. It took some considerable time to do this.\n\nWhen we received the generator back we could not get satisfactory lighting and looking for further trouble we found it in the control box; that certain plates which hold each grill plates had also been burned out. The control box is such a mixed up mass of coils, brushes etc., that we took the thing off complete and shipped it in to the Lister people. Then when it returned our troubles were not at an end. Our voltage would run exceedingly high and our amperage next to nothing. Our re-wiring back from the plant to the control box, from the control box to the generator was O.K., as we had tagged every wire. Other than run any chances of blowing out the brushes, I wired Mumford Medland and they came down this way we would be very glad to have him set the machine in proper order. When he arrived it didn't take him long to detect what was the matter. He stated when the generator is re-wound it also has to be rewound the plant with which it works. This was what was causing our difficulty. It certainly was a job for an expert, as he had to loosen up the brush carrier and hold them in his hand until he got the correct reading on the board.\n\nThe generator broke down on the night of Nov. 8th, and we did not have electric light until Dec. 4th. During the intervening time we used four lamps and twelve lanterns. The children were exceptionally good under the trying circumstances, but some of the staff had their first experience of seeing what it was like to work with lamp light. Needless to say, we all appreciated the return to order of our electric light plant.\n\nI am therefore enclosing the invoices for the generator, the control box and the man's time and expenses, together with the necessary prepaid freight accounts.\n\nVery sorry you were not able to stay overnight with us on your last visit to the school; when the winter sets in it means walking one way.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Rev.)

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 3)\nOttawa, June 5, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nAs you were informed in official letter dated April first, last, the following items are provided in our Estimates for the current fiscal year, to carry out certain work at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School:\n\nNew floor in barn and steel fittings for stable - $1,150.\nPainting interior of school building - $500.\n\nThere is also an item - if the expenditure of same should be absolutely necessary - to supply new batteries for the electric light system.\n\nI have to request that you will consult the principal of the School and forward a report regarding the work and materials required in putting a new floor in the barn and stables and any steel fittings that may be required for the stable. You should also state, in detail, what painting you would recommend be done in the interior of the school building. Please give full information concerning materials required, how they could be had and the work be carried out, what part - if any - could be done by the staff of the school and the outside labour that would be necessary. Any information you can give, regarding the best means of having the work performed and the approximate cost of materials, etc., will be appreciated. Your early reply is requested.\n\nI may add, for your information, that Reverend J.F.J. Marshall, Principal of the School, has been authorized to incur an expenditure to an amount not exceeding $500 in the purchase of a number of purebred Appaloosa young cows in place of some of the old which it was necessary to dispose of, on account of the outbreak of infectious abortion. Mr. Marshall will visit probable sources of supply. However, he has been informed that the Department considers it advisable to have the new floor installed in the barn before the cattle are delivered at the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 3)\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reference to our conversation over letter No. 129/6/5 dated June 5th, 1935.\n\nRegarding new floor in barn, steel fittings etc. Since our company has been delayed in getting prices for bricks on the material required and I have just received in on last mail prices from Betty Bros. Ltd. who supply the necessary steel fittings for barns. As I noted that the amount asked for in my letter of Oct. 12th, 1934 was $1300.00 and the amount set aside by the Department for this work $1180.00 therefore it was necessary to get new quotations. The lowest price that I can obtain on cement is $1.20 per sack from A.A. McDonald, providing he has a carload lot.\n\nWe require 250 bags - $1.20 per bag $300.00\nThe steel fittings for barn, recent price obtained $682.70.\n\nThese two items alone come to $1182.70 which does not allow for any lumber to build the forms or for any labour.\n\nIn a former letter regarding the same matter, I stated that we would be willing if the Department supplied the materials, to do the necessary work in putting the barn into good sanitary shape, but I do not feel that the school management should be called upon to supply extra material out of the per capita grant to complete the work. We have already hauled a quantity of stone and gravel, and will continue to haul sufficient quantity of sand so that we may be able, when instructions come to purchase the necessary equipment, to go right ahead with the work. This I have already stated I allow absolutely nothing for engaging an extra man to help mix cement, which will have to be taken out of school funds, as I do not feel that any article we have included in our list should be left out. Should the Department wish us to carry on with the work we will endeavour to keep it within the amount stated, that is $1300.00 allowing $100.00 for lumber, this to cover all necessary equipment and freight charges.\n\nPainting - As the Department have allowed $500.00 for completing the painting of the interior of the school, namely - the five dormitories, two stair sitting rooms, children's dining room, office sitting room, kitchen and laundry. $400.00 of this amount could be placed into material and freight, allowing the $50.00 grant for labour. As you know, our old painter is with us yet but not on any salary. I also wish to draw your attention to the fact that the chapel is not taken into consideration on this as we already have it in hand and are painting it out of the collection box money. For the purpose of this work of painting could be done at different times through the term with a certain amount of assistance rendered the painter by some of the staff members.\n\nNew batteries for the electric lighting system - As you no doubt noticed when the engine was shut down the light was very dim. In fact, there is not sufficient current in our batteries at this present time to start the automatic switch on the engine, and the engine when needed has to be started by hand. I have again taken this matter up with R.A. Lister, the firm in Winnipeg who are the manufacturers.\nof our present lighting system, and they state in their reply of June 25th, 1935, the following -\n\n\"We have consulted Mr. Montgomery in connection with your requirements, and he suggests that we quote you on what is known as -\n\nW-13 Lighting Plant Battery having 13 plates,\nwith a capacity of 252 amp. hours,\nWeight 870 lbs.,\nSize of plates 5-1/4\" X 7\"\nPRICE .......................................................... $598.50\n\nI may state there is some refund for the old batteries and jars which would bring the amount down to approximately $565.00. They do not make any set price on the old batteries and jars as it depends on the condition and size of the plates and tops. The Mr. Montgomery referred to is Listers head electrician and expert, whom they sent down here last November to put our lighting plant into shape after we had the dynamo re-wound, so the advice given is the best that can be obtained.\n\nIt is needless for me to say that we are ready at all times to co-operate in such work whatever that may be being done around the school plant so as to allow the Department to keep the already reduced funds spread out as far as possible and as you know our own two boys Edward and George are already on the job hauling sand, stone and gravel and will do considerable amount of the cement work on the barn during the holidays under my personal direction, and some little remuneration to them would not come amiss.\n\nWe have at the present time two of our men at work erecting a log barn, so as to provide shelter for the milk cows that are on the infected list. After these various animals are disposed of, I consider this building can be used as an implement shed, to put our wagons in in the winter time, and our sleighs in the summer; plows and other farm machinery.\n\nHoping this will give you the information you require,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nSigned John F. J. Marshall,\n(Rev) J.F.J. Marshall,\nPrincipal.\n\nCaptain Frank Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKENORA, ONTARIO.\nKenora, Ontario,\nJuly 18th, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter 129-6-5 of June 5th last. On our inspection of Sioux Lookout Residential School we discussed the matter of repairs with the Reverend Principal and asked him to write us covering the several points.\n\nWe inclose a copy of his letter which we have received today which covers pretty well what is required.\n\nWe would suggest that the work be carried out under the Principal.\n\nAwaiting your instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nKenora, Ontario.\nAugust, 6th. 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed please find copy of a letter we have received from the Reverend Principal of the Sioux Lookout Residential School, re floor in barn and batteries for the lighting system.\n\nWould you kindly refer to our letter of July 18th, inclosing letter from the Principal dated July, 9th. with reference to your letter 129-6-5 of June, 5th.\n\nWe shall be glad if you can direct the Principal direct, sending us a copy of your letter, so as to save time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent,\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\nJuly 31st, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI was just wondering if there has been any reply from the Department with instructions to go ahead with the barn floor, as the holidays are almost half over and I myself will have to be leaving again to pick up children returning to school. We have gathered up a large amount of sand and gravel and we should get the order through to Beatty Bros., so as to give them time to make up the different things for the staunchions, as a lot of the piping has to be cut to size.\n\nThen if you are writing the Department, our batteries are that low that we have to start the engine by hand and prop up the automatic control as there is not sufficient juice in the batteries to hold it up. I would like these things in before school starts again. I do hope they will let us get the barn completed before the bad weather begins. Then we have considerable crop to harvest and the present time is the slackest time we will have in the next two months. So kindly let us know the circumstances under which we are working if you have any information on the subject at all.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nSigned John F. J. Marshall,\n(Rev.) J.F.J.

Agent Edwards, Kenora, was requested to consult the Principal regarding the work and to furnish an estimate of the cost. It will require 250 bags of cement, at a cost of $500, for the floor in the stable, and the price of the steel fittings for the stable would be $200. The work in laying the new floor and installing the fittings will be performed by the staff of the school, without expense to the Department. Regarding the painting of the interior of the school, they estimate the paint, oils, etc., required will be $450 and request that the balance of the grant available, viz.: $50, be allowed for extra labour in carrying out the work.\n\nA quotation was received from the R. A. Lister Company, Winnipeg, who are the manufacturers of the present lighting system at the school, for the supplying of the batteries. Their quotation was $585 50, less a refund for the old batteries and jacks which would bring the amount down to approximately, $565.\n\nI would request your authority to incur the above expenditure, and I should be pleased to have the names of the firms who should be asked to quote on the supplying of 250 bags of cement and also the firms who should be requested to quote on the steel fittings for the stable. In this connection, Nearby Brothers Ltd., are the manufacturers of steel stable fittings. The Principal obtained a quotation from this firm, to the amount of $295.\n\nRegarding the painting, please advise the names of the firms from whom prices should be obtained for supplying the materials required.\n\nWith reference to the new batteries for the lighting system, would it be satisfactory to place the order with the R.

(RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nOn your recent visit to the school we took up the matter of certain places in the basement halls where it will be necessary to have something on the walls other than plaster as we have plastered in some places three times already and every spring the frost heaves it off. This is in places below the main level. Therefore I would respectfully suggest put in a material like ten test which is painted on both sides should resist the dampness and last considerably than plaster. Would it be possible for us to try out at least about 2000 square feet of ten test. This costs $55.00 a thousand at Sioux Lookout but I believe it might be obtained for about $80.00 a thousand from Winnipeg.\n\nThen on the new building that we have erected to act as an isolation barn. As you noted, we had the log walls up and the rafters all in place but we have no lumber to put on the roof. I may say that the school management have offered the barn up to the present time as a loan whatever to the Department, therefore I do not think it is asking too much to ask them to supply us materials to roof this building with ship lap roofing. The building is a good permanent building, we have built it substantial and set it up on 12x20 fir blocks which we got from the Canadian National when they were repairing the bridge at mileage 4.4.\n\nI have figured on the material only which I count will cost $200.00 landed, freight included. There will be no extra cost for labour. For your information I may say that the building is 24'x20' and stands clear with a 9' wall width and 6' depth. This building will be used as an isolation barn for our cattle in times of sickness and afterwards will give us a place where we can store our various farm implements, as at the present time we have no building whatever to cover these different things. The roofing of this building is very urgent as we would like to get it on before the extremely cold weather.\n\nHoping the Department may see their way clear to grant us this very important item in our present emergency, I remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n(Rev.) J. F. J. MARSHALL\nPrincipal\n\nCaptain Frank Edwards,\nIndian Agent\nKENORA, Ontario\nOttawa, November 7, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School, in which he requests that a quantity of ten feet be supplied for the basement halls and also that materials be supplied to roof the new building that has been erected for use as an isolation barn.\n\nIn reply I have to say the Department will approve an expenditure, not exceeding the sum of $110, in the purchase of approximately 2,000 sq. ft. of ten feet, and also an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $200 in the purchase of the material for the isolation barn. Yourself or the Principal may arrange for the purchase, from the best available source of supply. Please obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost. These accounts, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. It is understood that all work will be carried out by the school authorities, without expense to the Department. I would request that the purchase of the above materials be made and accounts forwarded at an early date.\n\nRegarding the purchase of the materials authorized in official letter of September 30th, last, for use in re-flooring the barn; the supplying of stable fittings; the painting of the interior of the main building and the supplying of new batteries, I would request that accounts covering the cost be submitted at an early date.

Allen\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: Oliver Furniture Limited,\n950 Gladstone Ave.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nReceipt is acknowledged, with thanks, of your letter dated the 27th instant (129-6-5) enclosing cheque No. 37033 for $130.04 dated the 27th January and made payable to the Receiver General of Canada, which sum is to be applied to the sales tax arrears of the above named firm.\n\nPlease be assured that your co-operation in this matter is appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent,\nExcise Tax Collections.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of Jan. 21st, 1936, re. inquiry of Department letter #129-6-5 of Jan. 17th, 1936, I will give you information regarding each item as they are all somewhat different.\n\nRegarding the new floor and fittings in the barn, I may say that by the time the authority for these various things reached me and we got in touch with the different firms, we were in the midst of getting in our crops from the fields and garden, and the weather, as you know, was rain three or four days a week. At the time we had between 60 and 70 tons of feed in the loft which made it nearly impossible to tackle the remodelling of the barn with that amount of weight above. We were looking for material for various reasons and came from the different firms that we were to obtain prices from also caused us further delay and no firm carries this equipment in stock as it is all made to order to fit the size of barn.\n\nWith these circumstances confronting us, I thought it good policy to take advantage of the offer made by Heatty Bros., that if our order was not in a rush they would include it in a car of their own equipment shipped to Port Arthur, free of charge. The only freight that we would have to pay would be from Port Arthur to Pelican, a distance of 507 miles as against nearly a thousand miles of freight charges.\n\nThen being caught by the wet season, it left us with no place to house our cattle while the work would be going on; and one cannot do a satisfactory job in cement in cold and freezing weather. Also at the time there was a shortage of cement in the market, consequently it would not have been by local freight, which would have cost us nearly $2.00 a bag FOR Pelican. I have the cement order placed with A.A.J. McDonald of Sioux Lookout, for delivery as soon as he can get sufficient to bring in a carload. The steel fittings I expect will be delivered to us sometime about the 10th. of February, as I had word from the firm that their car had been shipped from their factory.\n\nTaking all these unforeseen circumstances into consideration, I judged I was saving money or otherwise, being able to obtain a little more equipment for the money allowed, and also would be able to turn out a better job in the warm weather. I hope this will meet with the approval of the Department.\n\nPaints and oils to paint the interior of the school. This order has been placed with the Brendan-Henderson Co. of Winnipeg and they are holding it over for the next batch of paints that are due to last month. We are doing ahead with a certain amount of cleaning in preparation to painting the walls and ceilings and also patching up little holes and cracks in the plaster, which will, when the extreme cold weather passes, enable us to turn our attention to the work of painting proper, as I deem it useless painting over dirty and greasy walls and...\nceilings. It is some contract, washing the walls and ceilings, scrubbing them with Dutch Cleanser, soap and water and then clean water, but I consider we will be well repaid when we come to paint over a good clean surface. I expect the shipment of paint any day as I had a letter from Bremner-Hamilton January 30th.\n\nThe ten test has been ordered from J.H.Ashdown Hardware Co.\n\nThe material for roof of isolation barn has been purchased from Geo. E. Farlinger and is now in the barn. We are waiting for the paper and shingles to complete the roof. These are being purchased in Winnipeg. We expect to be able to complete the roof of this barn during Easter holidays. I am using it the present time the chicken house as an isolation barn and will have the other completed before the stock are turned out.\n\nJust in passing and a little aside from the subject in hand yet relative to it; we have passed through a very hard and trying month of January. The flu struck us here immediately after New Year, coming in probably with some of the parents visiting and at one time we had 92 children in bed, besides some members of the staff. It meant long steady duty for those who were able to keep up.\n\nSo if it seems that we have been remiss in not replying to any of your correspondence, or getting things done, it is not that we have forgotten, but as you know we have no control over unforeseen circumstances and you will also know that we will try and do our best as the occasions arise.\n\nYou can rest assured that I will have the invoices covering the different outstanding accounts in just as soon as I can chase them up.\n\nThe one item that bothers me is the cement. It puts us on the horns of a dilemma, as there is practically no cement moving at this present time, although the last I heard from Allan McDonald he was trying to locate enough orders to complete a carload for delivery before the middle of March. I expect to see him this week and I will let you know what is being done in this matter.\n\nHope this gives you the necessary information in reply to the above mentioned letter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Rev.)

This cement has been ordered by McDonald coming through in car lot, in fact two cars, but will not be shipped from the cement factory until the opening of navigation. This should bring it in here about the middle of May, which is ample time for use on our job. This enabled Mr. McDonald to quote us a very low figure of $1.05 per sack.\n\nHe wishes the cheque to be mailed to you or myself to be held over until delivery of the cement.\n\nIt would have cost us $1.40 per sack to have purchased and brought it in all rail. I hope this is satisfactory to the Department as it is the best arrangements that could be made under the circumstances. You will note that the price is F.O.B. Pelican.\n\nThanking you for your kind consideration in this matter, I am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n(Rev.) J. F. J. MARSHALL\nPrincipal\n\nCaptain Frank Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKENORA, Ontario\n\nEncls.\nMEMO: MR. RUTHERLAND\n\nIndian Residential School,\nSioux Lookout,\n\nWith reference to voucher in the amount of $262.50, which you will find hereunder I wish to advise that payment may not be made until the material, to which reference is made therein, has been actually delivered.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRepresentative of the Treasury.\n\nADW/B\nDr. McGill,\n\nWith reference to the account in favour of Allan A. J. MacDonald, to the amount of $262.50, for the supply of cement for the floor or barn at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School, I have been advised that the Treasury Board has refused to pay the account on the grounds that the material has not been actually delivered. You will remember, I discussed the matter with you, and you approved that the account be paid - it being understood that the cheque would be held by the Principal until the cement is delivered.\n\nIn September, last, the Minister approved the purchase of the cement from A. A. J. MacDonald, and Mr. Edwards, the Indian Agent at Kenora, was advised accordingly. In connection with the Principal, who issued the voucher, it is stated that the cement has been ordered but that it will be impossible to ship same until opening of navigation. It would have cost $1.40 per sack to have it delivered all rail. In having the cement delivered when navigation opens, in May, next, it was obtained at a price of $1.05 per sack.\n\nI beg to point out that the funds for the purpose are provided in the Appropriation for the fiscal year just closed, and we have no money provided in the Vote for the fiscal year 1936-37 to pay this account.\n\nI can see no reason why the cheque cannot be issued and held by the Principal or at the Department until the cement is actually delivered at the school. I would beg to recommend that you instruct the Representative of the Treasury to have the cheque in payment for the cement issued and either forwarded to be held by the Principal or retained in the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 3)\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDr. Macdonald\n\nRet: Allan A.J. MacDonald account $262.50 for cement.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Sutherland's memo, hereunder regarding payment to Allan A.J. MacDonald, of Sioux Lookout, for 250 sacks of cement which have not been delivered, I regret to say that, under the provisions of the Consolidated Revenue and Audit Act, payment may not be made for materials or supplies until the goods have been delivered nor for work until the service has been performed.\n\nSection 30 of the Act reads as follows:\n\n\"No payment authorized by Parliament shall be made in respect of work performed or material supplied whether under contract or not, in connection with any part of any public service or Contract, unless there is submitted therewith a report or certificate which is required in that behalf by the deputy minister or other officer charged with the administration of the particular service, certifies that such work has been performed, or such materials supplied, as the case may be, and that the price charged is according to contract, or if not covered by contract, is fair and just.\"\n\nThe account in this instance can not be properly certified that the goods have been received.\n\nI would also refer you to Section 23 of the Act which reads:\n\n\"All estimates of expenditures submitted to Parliament shall be for the services coming in course of payment during the fiscal year.\"\n\nThis section is interpreted as follows:\n\n1. To direct that all accounts be liquidated in the year in which Parliament has provided the money;\n2. To prohibit payments in advance of delivery or rendering of a service when the charge belongs to a succeeding fiscal year;\n3. To bring expenditures for services on a comparable basis.\n\nIt\nIt might also be pointed out that in both Great Britain and the United States payments are not made until goods have been delivered or the services have been rendered. I am sure the reason for taking such a stand is obvious.\n\nThis is not a unique case as there are others from time to time where funds are provided for the expenditure in one year's estimates and the goods are ordered before March 31st but not delivered until after April 1st.\n\nThe certificates executed by the Principal of the school and the Indian Agent on the account and voucher, respectively, are not in accordance with the facts.\n\nRepresentative of the Treasury.\n\nECA/S\nOttawa, April 9, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th ultimo, the Department finds it necessary to return, unpaid, the account of Allan A. J. MacDonald. Owing to present regulations, it is not possible to pay for the cement until it is delivered.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F.

Mr. MacLaughlin is on the job and is now able to give a greater time to the painting than he did. When the winter days were on it required much of his time in the boiler room. We have the Chapel completely done and Mr. Maye is putting in a lettered border which I think that you will approve of the good work being done by him when you are around this way to see it. The two Dormitories on the girls' side are now completed and the little girls' Dormitory we expect to start on in the morning. Some of the staff rooms have been done and when you consider that the ceilings and floors and walls have all to be washed over twice, the floor sometimes often means a big job before a paint brush is put on it. However, we believe in doing the thing properly when the Department have entrusted this work to our care. We are not rushing it but expect that it will take us on into the summer before it is completed.\n\nAs regards the work in the barns, we expect to be able to move the cattle from the main barn into the isolation barn about the end of the month and start work on the cleaning out of the wooden floor, removing about a feet deep of the soil before laying the cement floor. This space will be built up out of small stones so as to secure good foundations. The stones, as you know, we hauled last year. We have about doubled the quantity of these this spring, taking a number of them from the lake shore while the water is low.\n\nI will let you know from time to time how the work is progressing, and we are looking forward to your visit at Treaty time.\n\nDon't forget to take lots of warm clothing when you are starting out on the Lake of the Woods Treaty Trip.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n(Rev.)

Owing to the drastic cut in the Department's allowance this year I would judge that they are not going to be able to do very much towards the estimates, therefore I am giving you some idea of the things that I think are most essential to the carrying on of the work at the Sioux Lookout School.\n\nThe lumber statement in our estimates of October 16, 1935 which is to complete barn ceiling and root house ceiling. This particular part I think should be put in with fir as the local lumber is not of the very best quality and has tremendous shrinkage and if put in, in a few years would look like so many slats. Then there will be an amount required for repairs to the hay loft floor and reinforcement joists in the hay loft floor, as a number of them have tremendous sag in them as they are placed too far apart. We would require a little extra labour in putting in this ceiling in both buildings as it is too much for the boys to do. Local labour could be procured at about Eighty Dollars. ($80.)\n\nThe next items would be some of the farm implements, the hay mower and hay rake and double mouldboard plough, leaving the seed drill to another time as we can still carry on seeding by hand but it is a slow method. Then I would, if it is at all possible to surmise they might have the funds to purchase an ensilage cutter, as I would like to try out a small pit silo to see whether it would work in preference to one of the barrel type, it would save considerable money. The cutter then would be more important than the stave silo. I have gathered considerable information from various sources regarding the use of the pit silo in the northern country and I find that where there is good drainage to be had they have proven a good success. The mud walls can be used it is claimed for a couple of years and then if necessary cement walls can be put in. This would make a very permanent silo and the greatest advantage of all in favour of the pit silo is freedom from frost if carefully covered, therefore I think it would be advisable to give it a try.\n\nShould I be assuming too much the mouldboard plough might be dropped, the other things I think are absolutely essential.\nNew for reasons in putting forth the request for lumber on the root house. As past winter, as you know, held below forty-five and fifty for almost a month and this played havoc with our roots and potatoes, although we had them covered even better than at other years. Today we took out three wagon loads of potatoes that had been frozen during the winter. This would be avoided if we had the lumber to finish the inside.\n\nHoping this will give you the information that you required in reference to the letter that you have received from the Department,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Rev.)

(RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 3)\nOttawa, May 15, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nMr. Agent Edwards has forwarded communications which he received from you, dated the 9th instant, regarding the lumber, labour, etc., required to complete the barn ceiling; repairs to hayloft floor; reinforcement of joists in hayloft; installing cement floor in barn; also stating the farm machinery required and requesting that a small pit silo be provided, at the Sioux Lookout Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I would say that our appropriation for the current fiscal year provides an amount of $625 to erect a silo and $500 to complete barn and root-house. From this amount, however, it will be necessary to deduct the sum of $250.00, the payment for expenses for the barn floor, as this amount was not paid before our books closed for the last fiscal year. In connection with the work yet to be done, as stated above, only the sum of approximately $400 would be available to cover the cost of all items at your school this year. I would request that you furnish us plans and estimates as possible of the lumber and other material required, the cost of any extra labour and also state the type of labour. We would then be in a position to advise Mr. Agent Edwards regarding the purchase of the materials and the employing of the extra labour.\n\nI note that you intend to try out a small pit silo, in preference to one of the barrel type. If so, the building of the pit silo would save considerable expense, leaving funds from the amount available for other purposes.\n\nYou might also advise us as to the cost of supplying a hay mower and a hay rake, also an ensilage cutter. It is doubtful, however, if we will have funds to supply all this farm equipment.\n\nIt is noted that you are progressing with the painting of the interior of the school building; that the work in painting the chapel, the two dormitories on the girls' side and some staff rooms has been completed; also that you expect to have the cement for the barn flooring delivered at an early date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Would you ask Mr. Sivier or Mr. Mayo if they could get someone from Sioux Lookout to estimate what it would cost to get men to do the work so that I can wire Ottawa and get authority.\n\nI could not find a cement mixer in Sioux Lookout, but I am asking Colonel Marmigan to ship a mixer from Winnipeg.\n\nI do not think there is much chance of building a new machine shop outside or putting compression water tanks in the school. If there is anything further you think I can do, don't hesitate to write me or wire. I am very sorry about Mr. Marshall's illness and hope everything comes along well and that he will soon be around.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nIndian Agent.\nKenora, Ontario,\nOctober 1, 1936.\n\nMrs. J. Marshall,\nIndian Residential School\nSioux Lookout, Ontario.\n\nDear Mrs. Marshall:\n\nAs soon as I got to Winnipeg I went to see Mr. Marshall at the General Hospital, but was informed he was in the operating room. I went there again in the afternoon and saw him for a minute or two, but of course could not talk to him very much. He had heard of the fire, but I let him understand it was a very small thing and that nobody was hurt and that you were alright as was everybody else. I also interviewed Colonel Barnigen and also visited Archdeacon Matheson. I arranged with Messrs. Mumford and Medland to send a man to Sioux Lookout that night with an engine and generator. I also arranged with Mr. North of the Canadian National Railway to make sure this was put on the local and taken to Pflug next morning. This engine provides about fifty lights so that you would not be without temporary lights until something can be done. Whilst in Sioux Lookout I also arranged with the Forestry people to leave their pump there so that you could get water. Unfortunately, Mr. Montgomery of Mumford and Medland was out of town and would not be back until the end of this week. Mr. Mumford promised me that when his man returned from the school, he would send me a report as to what was necessary to put the Lister engine into commission and put everything right as regards to machinery. He would also examine the batteries and when we receive this report we will know what to do.\n\nDr. Westgate returned from Toronto yesterday morning and I saw him and as the doctor at the hospital had told me that Mr. Marshall would be in the hospital for a month longer and that he would not be able to do much work or any work for six weeks after that, Dr. Westgate is I believe, writing Rev. Mr. Sivier at Sioux Lookout to ask him if he would go to the school fairly often and give Mr. Mayo and yourself any assistance he could as the school could not be left without further assistance.\nCanadian Pacific Hotels\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 3)\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wired you on Sunday that I had received a telegram from the Sioux Lookout Indian residential school that they had had a fire and that I was leaving to investigate.\n\nI left Kenora Sunday evening and arrived at the school 2:00 a.m. Monday morning and found that the fire had evidently started in the engine room, most likely from the exhaust of the engine. The exhaust pipe has run through the same hole since the school was erected, but for some reason the fire started at that point.\n\nNo damage was done to the main parts of the building but the interior of the engine room is badly burned, as are also some of the rafters and joists. I do not know what damage was done to the engines or the batteries. This cannot be ascertained until an expert examines them.\n\nThe fire started about 8:00 p.m. on Saturday. A message was sent to Sioux Lookout and the Canadian National Railway sent two coaches and men with equipment to Pelican. The Ontario Forestry also sent a number of men, pumps, etc., but the fire had been extinguished before they got there.\n\nIn addition to the damage to the engine room, the fire had travelled between the walls as far as the bake room, and also travelled up inside the walls around the chapel, but had not broken through. The staff managed to extinguish the fire by 9:00\no'clock, although quite a little damage was done by the fire and water and also by the holes which had to be made through the roof and building to get the water to the fire.\n\nAfter the fire, there was, of course, no water or lights but the Ontario Forestry had left a pump there for a few days so as to take care of the water. I also borrowed a few lanterns and, with the ones they had at the school, they are managing, but with great inconvenience.\n\nI came on to Winnipeg this morning to see the Principal, the Reverend J. Marshall, but found he was in the General Hospital, here, undergoing an operation and of course could not proceed. I called at the English Church Missionary Society and saw Colonel Marmigan but he had no suggestions to make. However, he rang up Archbishop Matheson and I am going to see him this afternoon. Owing to the urgency of the situation I wired you the following telegram:\n\nSecretary of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nSioux Lookout school engine room badly burned borrowed pump from forestry for temporary water supply sending tonight expert Lister engine Co. with engine and generator to supply temporary light Principal operated on today Winnipeg hospital and Inspector Hamilton away writing tonight - wire authority Royal Alexandra Hotel.\n\nAs I had to make arrangements for light, I trust this meets with your approval. I am getting the engine and generator from Messrs. Munford and Medland, who are the agents for the Lister Motors, which is the engine at present in the school. They are going to find out what is the trouble and give me an estimate of the cost of repairing the engine damaged by the fire. They are also going to let\nme know if the batteries are destroyed as the heat was very intense and melted the wax from the top of them and they may be spoilt.\n\nI called to see Inspector Hamilton, but he was out of town and will not be back for some days.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate the amount of damage done, but outside of the engine and tools damaged, I imagine about $2,000 would do the necessary repairs. I should be glad if you would wire me authority to do what we think advisable up to about that amount, and when we get a full report as to what the total amount it will take to rebuild and repair, we will let you know.\n\nLuckily, they only have about ninety children in the school at the present time, as many have not returned from vacation.\n\nI would also like to receive authority to purchase refills for the eight 2\u00bd gallon foamite fire extinguishers.\n\nI am staying over in Winnipeg tonight to make sure we get the expert and the engine away tonight to Sioux Lookout, and I have arranged with the Canadian National Railway so that the man and engine can be taken to Pelican tomorrow morning, where they will be met by the school and the engine put into temporary use. I do not imagine the cost of sending the expert, and use of the engine borrowed, will be more than $150.00, but it is difficult to estimate the exact amount.\n\nI would therefore like to receive blank authority for the expenditures suggested above so that the situation can be taken care of. I will write you further as soon as I have any more information.\nCanadian Pacific Hotels\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

They have borrowed one, but it was not workable and as the cold weather is coming the work had to be completed immediately. As the principal was in the General Hospital in Winnipeg and would not be back for some months I discussed the matter with Colonel Lennagan, of the Indian School Mission and asked him to purchase a cement mixer at the cost of $40.00 f.o.b. Pelican. He is purchasing this from the Eaton Company as they were the cheapest, and is having this shipped to the school. The Department had to supply material and the school undertook the labor. I therefore think this is a legitimate charge against us and should be paid to receive authority for payment of the amount.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 6, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, informing the Department that it was necessary to supply a cement mixer to carry out the work of laying the concrete floor in the barn at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School, and that same was supplied at a cost of $40.\n\nThe Department will approve of this purchase, and an account, in triplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded, covering the cost.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nOctober 6, 1936.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nA fire occurred on the evening of the 29th ultimo in the engine room of the Indian Residential School, Sioux Lookout, a government-owned institution, (Electoral District of Fort Arthur-Thunder Bay) Ont., Kenora Indian Agency. Upon being advised, the local Indian Agent immediately proceeded from Kenora to Sioux Lookout, and, in his report, he states as follows:\n\n\"The fire started in the engine room, most likely from the exhaust of the engine. The exhaust pipe has run through the same hole since the school was erected, but, for some reason, the fire started at that point.

Humberd and Redland, agents for the Lister Motors, Winnipeg, for the loan of an engine and generator and also for them to forward an expert to examine the damage to the engine, the batteries of the lighting system and the water pumping equipment.\n\nThe Agent states, further, that it is difficult to ascertain the amount of damage, but he estimates it to be approximately $5,000.00, in making the necessary repairs to the lighting and water systems and the building. No blame appears to be attached to the staff of the school in the outbreak of the fire.\n\nAs it is necessary that immediate action be taken in restoring the lighting and water systems, the Agent requests that he be given blanket authority to incur an expenditure of, approximately, $5,000.00, in making the necessary repairs. He will arrange for the purchase of materials, from firms on the approved list. In the installing and overhauling of the lighting and water systems, the labour would be carried out by the firms supplying the equipment. The greater part of the other labour in repairs to the building could be performed by the school staff.\n\nI would recommend, for early approval, that Mr. Agent Edwards be granted authority to overhaul the equipment, purchase any new equipment required and undertake the repairs to the building, at a cost of approximately $5,000. Funds for this purpose could be provided from the Appropriation for Indian Education. Unfortunately, the Principal of the School, Rev. J.F.J., Marshall, is in hospital in Winnipeg, where he has undergone a serious operation.

It is noted that the fire started in the engine room, from the exhaust pipe.\n\nThe Department is pleased that, through prompt action of the staff and outside assistance, the building was saved and that there was no loss of life or accidents to the pupils and staff. From the facts stated by you, it would appear that the fire was accidental, although it is considered the engineer or other members of the staff should have noticed the condition of the exhaust pipe leading from the engine.\n\nRegarding your request, that blanket authority be given you, in order that the damage incurred can be repaired and the building placed in good condition, I beg to confirm the following night lettergram to you, of today's date:\n\n\"Reference your letter, twenty-ninth, fire damage, engine room and equipment, Sioux Lookout School, may incur expenditure two thousand dollars effecting repairs.

Further, it is noted that an expert from Messrs. Humford and Medland will examine the lighting plant and engine and furnish an estimate of the cost of the repairs. You should make purchases from firms on the approved list, and, in the purchase of any equipment in Winnipeg, Inspector Hamilton should be consulted as to the source of supply.\n\nThe Department will leave in your hands the matter of effecting repairs to the plant and building, to a cost not exceeding the sum of $2,000. You should obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering all expenditure, and these you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nYou may purchase refills for the eight 2\u00bd gallon foamite fire extinguishers, forwarding certified accounts covering the cost. You should also render an itemized account, in triplicate, covering the cost of sending the expert and for the use of the borrowed engine.\n\nI would request that you arrange to have all work completed at an early date.\n\nI may add that the Department regrets the serious illness of Rev. Mr. Marshall, the Principal. It is noted that he will be absent from duty for a considerable period.

H. Wright &\nCompany, General contractors, Sioux Lookout for building\nand repairing damage done by fire at the Sioux Lookout Indian\nResidential School. This contract only applies to damage to\nthe building, not machinery etc. As soon as I receive an es-\ntimate of the cost in connection with the machinery, I will\nwrite you. In connection with this contract, apparently Fred\nA. [illegible], who is the engineer at the school and is in charge\nduring the principal's stay in Winnipeg General Hospital has\nmade out a list of what is required.\n\nI do not think it will be possible for the school em-\nployees to do the work and they might have difficulty in ob-\ntaining labor. I do not think there is another contractor\nat Sioux Lookout who would be able to take on the work, but\nif you desire it I could go to Sioux Lookout and probably get\nMr. Wright or some other person to take on the work on day\nlabor. I should be glad to receive a reply as soon as pos-\nsible that we can get the buildings repaired before the freeze\nup which will be very soon. It might also be difficult to\ntake out the material once the lakes freeze up.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nSee also letter Oct 8/36.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We were sorry to hear that the improvements and extra engine room that we hoped to have could not be granted. There is nothing left but the next best.\n\nThe man from Mumford Medlands came down on Tuesday's train, spent the night at Canon Sevier's and came out on the Local in the morning with engine plant. It was installed at once. There were many cross currents which had to be rectified; therefore there was not much light that night. By Saturday night lights were on from basement to the top floor. The pump from the engine room was also set up so that it was pumping water by Saturday. Mr. Lafreniere is now taking down radiator and doing other necessary things in the old engine room and also going over the old plant, necessary for his report.\n\nRegarding the estimate, Edward went in to see Canon Sevier to get some one for that purpose. I thought Dr. Day might also help the Canon but as he was ill the Canon secured Mr. Wright, a contractor in town who has had most of the building there to do. He came out with the Canon this morning by boat, took his notes and will let you know at once of his estimate.\n\nThe man from the Forestry Department has been most faithful in supplying us with water and has been most kind in many other ways.\n\nNow I have come to one of the most important items of this letter, and that is that it is almost impossible to get through the winter with the present tank. Last winter towards the end we had to trust to luck that it or the pipes did not freeze when it was impossible to get into the tank house, with the danger of tons of ice hanging overhead, the ice forming higher every day covered the base of the stove. Every day around the door before one could open it, the ice was hacked away. I think you know all this. It seems the cruellest thing to ask any one to\nCaptain Edwards con'td. - 2 -\n\nAttend to it. Every year it has been attended to in the summer but with all that there is the same trouble every winter and worse as the years have passed. It took the Forestry pump and the one in the School to fill it both working at the same time before it ever flowed. Lately we have had to pump once or twice daily to keep up the supply, the leakage is so great. The staves are open for about six feet down. It is a fire hazard in a sense and trust that you can get some one to listen before any more trouble befalls us.\n\nOn going over the engine room Mr. Lafreniere has suggested that a 13 x 9 x 7 (with a few inches) pressure tank 6000 gals. could be installed at one end of the room. Automatic pumping system. He has wired to Winnipeg to find the cost of such and will add it to this letter before closing. It is not what Mr. Marshall intended to do, but he will not be able to handle what he would like and this seems the next best thing. We thought while the roof is off would be a good opportunity in which to get the tank installed. Mr. Mayo has looked carefully into all this with Mr. Wright and Mr. Lafreniere. The tank and tank house is one if not the greatest chronic sore with which we have to contend. We hope you will be able to get the sanction for this extra while the roof is off the engine room.\n\nMr. Mayo asks if we will send the requisition for tools and equipment needed to you. We need very shortly the belts for sawing the wood and the belt for sawing odd pieces of lumber on the saw machine.\n\nI was glad to know that you had seen Mr. Marshall and that you were able to set his mind at rest about the School and all here.\n\nWe heard from George that the cement mixer has been shipped. The office of the M. S. U. C. sent for him to explain what it really meant.\n\nSince beginning this letter yesterday Dr. Mitchel has been down to see a number of children, 36 in all who have had to go to bed during this last week. We thought it was the result of exposure the night of the fire but it is a good dose of measles. We are now being isolated to some extent from each other.\n\nThank you very much for all your kindly interest,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. We had not heard yet the price of Water Tank. Hope to be able to wire you that tomorrow. I hope you will push this matter all you can so let us have reply as soon as you can so that we may order.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The school authorities are very anxious that a new engine room be built outside the school and that the old engine room be used for a compression tank to hold about six thousand gallons of water. I enclose letter received from the principal's wife, Mrs. Marshall, with a notation by engineer Mayo. I will endeavor to get prices on all of these things and as soon as I have something definite, I will write you further. There is no question the outside water tower they have has been a continual source of trouble ever since the school was built and if it can be financed, I would strongly recommend you to carry out the wishes of the school authorities. I also enclose telegram received from Colonel Mermagen of the Indian School Commission, showing the commission strongly recommend the installation of the tank.\n\nIt is difficult for me to make another trip to the school at the present time owing to the amount of work at the agency and also trips I have to make for cash distributions to various bands. You will note they also require tools which were damaged by the fire. We have not got a price on these yet, but would like authority to supply his most immediate needs if you would authorize this.\n\nThey seem to have more trouble there as it is reported that they now have measles in the school and thirty-six have had to go to bed during last week.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nSIOUX LOOKOUT INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nCooling tank and fuel tank to be oblong and as small as is practical.\n\n100 - Ft. 4-1/2\" double ply belting.\n50 - Ft. 3\" Belting, double ply.\n24 - Ft. 3-1/2\" ditto\n36 - Ft. 1-1/2\" ditto Laundry.\n36 - Ft. 1-1/2\" ditto single ply\n\nWire lacing and tool for same.\n\n20 - Lbs. heavy duty babbitt.\n30 - Ft. asbestos casing for 4\" steam pipe.\n3 - Doz. straps.\n1 - Each 12\", 16\" and 24\" pipe wrench.\n\n1 - Semi-rotary 1\" hand operated fuel pump.\n\n10 - Ft. 1\" hose.\n2 - Doz. plates.\n2 - Doz. toggle switches.\n6 - Key switches, 3 keys to each.\n500 - Ft. heavy insulated cable.\n1000 - Ft. light insulated cable.\n50 - Ft. cab tire rubber cable and socket head, lamp guard and plug, for trouble light.\n2 - Doz. wire ceiling lights.\n3 - 3/4\" service switch boxes.\n\n6 - Pull chain socket heads.\n2 - Doz. fuse plugs, 20 and 30 amp.\n200 - Ft. drop light cord.\n200 - Ft. bell wire.\n\nArmoured cable cleats, 1/2\", 3/4\" and 1\" for conduit pipe.\n\n1 - Doz. 3-3/4 octagon boxes and porcelain plates to cover, with 2-1/4 or 2-1/2 wood screws for same.\n\n200 - Ft. 1/2\" conduit piping.\n50 - Ft. 3/4\" ditto\n100 - Ft. 1\" conduit piping.\n\nLock Nuts and bushes for same.\n\nFairbanks-Morse self-coiling typhoon pump, speed 215, pressure 100 lbs., gals. 2500 per hour, Serial No. A. 139875.\n\nPiston Leathers and packing for Fairbanks-Morse 2500 gal. typhoon pump, also two (2) Self-Seating Check Valves.\nPressure tank, 13 ft. long, 10 ft. high, 8 ft. wide.\n\nPressure Gauge and Safety Valve and Water Gauge for tank.\n\n- Valves\n- Unions\n- Elbows\n\n2 - 20 Ft. lengths of 2\" Galvanized water piping.\n\n1 - 1-1/4\" hot water Globe valve.\n\nAcid-resisting paint for tank.

Also, the magneto is burned and will need a new one.\n\nThe generator we cannot tell about without bringing it to Winnipeg for a test, but if it requires to be rewound this may run anywhere from $35.00 to $100.00 according to the number of coils that are defective.\n\nThe crankshaft and new bearings which would have to be fitted, also the magneto, would come to $170.00 without labour or freight on the plant backward and forward.\n\nThe instruments on the switchboard were not burned, but the glass was broken and they are full of water and are now useless, so that considering the age of the plant a complete overhaul would seem to be doubtful investment, but we will have to leave the decision on this point to you.\n\nWe attach hereto a long list of the various small items that will be needed to re-equip the powerhouse when rebuilt, but the only items required in a hurry are the ones for the Fairbanks-Morse pump, and these are only worth a few dollars.\nCaptain Edwards.\n\nYou will notice that they ask for a pressure tank 13 ft. long, 10 ft. high and 8 ft. wide, for 100 lbs. pressure.\n\nThere are several things wrong with this from our point of view. As we understand it you now have a wooden tank on a tower which is 67 ft. to the top, but this tank is very old and is leaking very badly, and the idea is that when the new powerhouse is built the pressure tank will replace the elevated tank.\n\nA tank of this shape for 100 lbs. pressure would have to be very heavy indeed to avoid distortion, and would therefore be much too expensive. A round tank 8 ft. in diameter and 13 ft. long would have very nearly the same capacity, and could be provided for very much less money. A 78 ft. tower would only give 30 lbs. pressure at ground level, and as the tank is not close to the building there would be some loss in pipe friction.\n\nWe are of the opinion that a circular tank 7 ft. in diameter, 13 ft. long, for 50 lbs. pressure would be ample. This would cost you approximately $800.00, whereas the tank asked for would cost nearly $1,100.00, and should not be necessary at all.\n\nWe found that they had been using about 2-1/2 bbls. of gasoline per week and running the plant probably twelve hours per day. A great deal of this is caused by the waste of water from the leaking tank.\n\nWe also have a report that the wiring in the building is not at all in good shape, as the extension cords, drop lights and switches have been damaged by the children, and is the cause of the blowing out of a great many fuses.\n\nIn the case of the batteries, there are twenty-seven good cells, twenty-eight with the covers broken, and one complete cell broken. This could be taken care of by sending down one new cell and the necessary covers and compound to seal on the new covers.\n\nWe have had some talk with the Rev. Mr. Marshall from time to time regarding the installation of a new lighting plant, and we have one in stock of the Fully Automatic Type exactly the same as the one you have, which was included in the stock that we took over from the M.A. Lister Company when we took charge of their Prairie Branches. We did not pay them full value for the stock and therefore could give you a reduced price on this of $950.00.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMUMFORD, MEDLAND, LIMITED.\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary:\n\nThey have temporary lights and water at the school and we are only waiting definite instructions from you as to what we are to do.

(RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 3)\nKenora, Ontario,\nOctober 9, 1936.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your telegram of the 8th, authorizing expenditure up to $2,000.00 effecting repairs at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nI had a long distance telephone call from Winnipeg yesterday morning from Mumford, Medland, Limited, who supplied the original Lister engine to the school. I also spoke to Inspector Hamilton over long distance and went to Winnipeg yesterday afternoon having arranged for Mr. Mumford and Dr. Westgate, Secretary of the Anglican Indian School Mission to meet me that night.\n\nI enclose copy of letter received from Mumford, Medland, Limited, which reports damage done to machinery.\n\nThe generator will cost, say $100.00.\nThe crankshaft and magneto, about $170.00.\nThe switchboard could be shipped to Winnipeg and a report got as to whether it is worth repairing. A new one would cost about $300.00.\n\nAs mentioned in my last letter the school commission wishes to build a new engine room a slight distance away from the school. I presume one about 16' x 25' would answer the purpose. It is hard to get a price on this, but I think it should be able to be built for about $1,000.00 or $1,500.00, providing we do not have to pay too much for the foundations. If this was built, the present engine room could be repaired as per contractor W. E. Wright's estimate for a little over $1,000.00 and can be used for the pressure tank and so do away with the water tower which is in bad shape. The school authorities wanted a square tank so that they could have another engine in the machine shop to drive the laundry machinery, but Mr. Mumford explains that a square tank would cost considerably more than a round tank and would not be as serviceable.\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary\n\nHe considers a tank costing about $1800.00 which would hold about 3200 Imperial gallons would be large enough.\n\nThe School authorities wish to get a Deisel Crude Oil Engine instead of a gasoline engine as at present. This would save the Church authorities a considerable amount on the fuel, but the original cost is pretty high.\n\nIn the case of the batteries, it is only necessary to send one new cell down and the necessary covers and compound to seal on the new covers. This would cost in the neighbourhood of $25.00. You will note the school wish to get a Deisel Engine, but the Mumford Company could ship down a new lighting plant for $950.00 second hand, but in excellent condition. A Deisel Engine would cost in the neighbourhood of $2500.00. I would suggest that if we can finance it, we build a new engine room, supply them a Deisel Engine for lighting, and also allow them to keep the engine we shipped down on loan. It would cost about $260.00, but if this cannot be afforded we could send them down the $950.00 lighting plant and also allow them to keep the $250.00 engine. Mr. Mumford also sends the list of tools, belting, etc., required, which has been spoiled by the fire. The cost of this is about $250.00.\n\nI have already ordered the piston Leathers and also the Self-Seating Check Valves for the Fairbanks-Morse as this would only cost about $10.00 or $12.00. I should be glad to know your wishes as soon as possible, so that we can go ahead with the work as Dr. Westgate fully agrees with what we are doing. Of course the cheapest way out of it would be to fix up the old engine room, put in the $950.00 lighting plant, allow them to keep the $250.00 engine and do the necessary repairs asked for, but if they get the new engine house, the Deisel Engine, etc., it would put the school in better shape than it was before.\n\nI also note Mr. Mumford reports that the extension cords, drop lights and switches have been damaged by the children, causing blow outs of a great many fuses. Estimates for the repairs of this would be a little over $200.00. I spoke to Inspector Hamilton over the phone, but he was apparently busy and could not see me last night. However I have a list of Winnipeg firms and the approved list of Mumford, Medland, Limited which must be one of them as Inspector Hamilton is making other purchases from them for other parts of his inspectorate.\nKENORA ONT 14\n\nSECTY DEPT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nOTTAWA\n\nINDIAN SCHOOL COMMISSION REPORTS CEMENT MIXER SHIPPED BY THEM AS SUITABLE TO SIOUTLOOKOUT SCHOOL TOO SMALL NOW WANT AUTHORITY TO PURCHASE ONE COSTING ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOB WINNIPEG WIRE\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nFRANK EDWARDS\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to report that under instructions from the Commission, I visited the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School on Friday the 9th October.\n\nOn arrival, I learned that in addition to their other worries measles had broken out and of the forty-six girls in residence forty were affected. Of the boys six of the thirty-eight had contracted the disease. In spite of this Mr. F. A. Mayo, the Acting Principal, and his staff were carrying on the administration of the School in a most efficient manner.\n\nThat the building did not become a total loss is due to the mercy of God and the wonderful devotion to duty of the entire staff. The children were all out in three minutes and the fire extinguished by the efforts of the staff before aid arrived. The Canadian National Railways and the Forestry Department at Sioux Lookout were most generous and helpful in placing both men and material at the disposal of the School authorities.\n\nAs the entire stock of fire extinguishers was used, may I urge the immediate supplying of a new quantity and also the favourable consideration of the installation of the 6000 gallon compression tank and thorough inspection of the electric wiring.\n\nYou will doubtless have received a full report from Captain Edwards, whose assistance and cooperation the Commission\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs - 2.

He claims it was an $80.00 suit about two years ago, but was still worth $25.00 and he would like to know if I could pay for this. I wrote and told him if he would submit an account I would send it to Ottawa and request payment, but he says he does not feel like doing this, and as I understand the Canadian National Railways, through his assistance, sent down an engine and caboose with men to fight the fire for which they are not likely to make a charge, so I should be glad if there is any way we could pay for the suit for the superintendent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards\n\nIndian Agent.\nOctober 19, 1906.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nIn further reference to my memorandum of the 8th instant regarding the damage occasioned by fire at the Indian Residential School, Sioux Lookout (Elaboral District of Fort Arthur), Ontario, Canada, Kenora Indian Agency, the Anglican Church authorities, Winnipeg, under whose auspices the school is conducted, and the local Indian Agent have recommended the following:\n\n1. That a new engine room be erected, a slight distance from the school building, in which to install the electric light plant and engine for pumping the water supply.\n\n2. That the old engine room in the main building, where the fire occurred, be repaired and a pressure tank installed for the water supply system.\n\n3. That a new Diesel engine be supplied and the old lighting system, comprising generator, crank shaft, magneto, switch board and wiring, be repaired.\n\n4.
