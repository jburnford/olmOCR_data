In the past the carnival was the greatest annual celebration throughout Europe, and as such it was a very grand affair. We have our carnivals, but of a very different nature, and more suited to our own times. Mr. Slater spoke very wisely when he said we should secure the better end of the North West. He went so far as to say that all intelligent people would be of the same opinion. Mr. Slater is a man of great influence among the North West greeves, who is always well informed when there is anything worth mentioning. The chairman, Mr. Markley, also remarked that he was most agreeable to have a discussion on the subject, and of course we take into account the year in which we enjoy ourselves the most, in which we feel really happy and glad when our expectations are realized. We may say that all intelligent people would be of the same opinion as Mr. Slater.\n\nMr. MacKean, from Duke's Mills, Money invested in the bank at the rate of 5% per cent., and Mr. Markley, from the Farmers' Union, spoke very wisely about the importance of having a good carnival, and of course we take into account the year in which we enjoy ourselves the most, in which we feel really happy and glad when our expectations are realized.

The resolutions passed by the Farmers' Convention and the farmers' meetings throughout the North West, which were passed at the Farmers' Convention are the sole topic of conversation here.\n\nThe farmers are denounced on all sides.\n\nThe City Council here has passed resolutions calling for a meeting of all farmers and the same thing has been done at Brandon and Melbourne.\n\nThe farming here is that the farmers are most unfairly treated.\n\nOwing to these resolutions, British capitalists are already refusing to send money here to assist the railways. The Canadian Pacific Railway, and the C. P. R. for the same reason, refuse to go on with their branch lines.\n\nThe Local House opened today.\n\nIn the reply the farmer referred to the recent negotiations with the French Government, but as no official reply had been received, nothing could be done until such is the case.\n\nA severe storm came on at Wainwright, delaying trains for twelve hours.\n\nThe troubles at the A.M.

What we should like to see is, that some of the religious and political men who are taking such keen interest in this subject, would come up here and look at the ground for themselves, not trusting to hear-say words and then sell us, the principal people here, concerned, and when the question of the undertaking will mostly depend, what they think of the idea; how they wish to run the line; and how much it will benefit us; if we help them on with their plans. We think that the people of this country are too apt to place their interests and money at the mercy of any mobocrats, hundreds of miles away, is simply absurd. The facts of our having ports on the coast, and navigable rivers and our very mild, navigable river ships and steamers, a large portion of the year, ought to be sufficient to get the position of that port fixed at once. Why does not some one question on whom the line is to run at the best interests of the country at large? Let our public men see to it, they cannot do so too soon, as it affects the health and growth of the country. They must think to be \"deeds not words.\" And let the country for its own good, help them in this great national undertaking, and let no petty local matters separate and private animosities stand in their way, which latter we are afraid they are almost too prone to do at present.\n\nTHE RECENT VICTORY IN EGYPT.\nThe British victory in Egypt, although anticipated by us has been rather a surprise, as regards the time it has taken to complete the number of small actions show fight to the enemy. Though an ultimate, but perhaps a dearly bought victory was almost certain, still it speaks very well for the efficiency and discipline of the troops engaged that they were so successful in the first onset.\n\nWe hope sincerely that an active and strong handed policy will now be adopted by the English Government, and that the full advantages of the victory will be followed up, and that no supposed to be charitable and merciful ideas be allowed to stand in the way of giving these Egyptian people the lasting lesson for England has brought home, lessons from time immemorial that no half-and-half measures will do, and that it we wish to secure our moral supremacy in Egypt, that the inhabitants of that country must be taught to understand distinctly what they will be called to receive, and that they try to break that general peace and harmony that is for the good of all.\n\nAt present, with the very meagre telegraphic information in our possession, we cannot give any details of the conflict, but will do so as soon as more authentic accounts reate us.\n\nNEW BISHOPRIC OF ASSINIBOIA.\nThe Bishop of Rupert's Land, is a leader to the Society for Promoting Christian knowledge in India, has been asked by the bishops of the district of Assiniboia to support. He says: \"I am anxious for the formation of a bishopric endowed with a fund of $25,000. A grant of $10,000 would do that, but this will not last; $30,000 would be raised.\"\n\nThe members of the Society have given notice that this month they will propose a grant of $10,000 towards the endowment of the Bishopric. The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel will do nothing to give an equal amount, and the liberality of Rupert's Land will be needed to complete the balance. An appealment may, therefore, be looked for at an early date. Under the provisions of the Act of Parliament concerning that money and rent are being sent out from England, the Archbishop of Canterbury has been requested by the Provincial Synod to make the appointment. He will, as doubtless be guided by the advice of the Bishop of Rupert's Land, choose a missionary of the Society, in their appointments to Moosejaw and Athabasca, who have wisely selected for their residences, a country where they have experience and knowledge of its needs, and, no doubt, the Archbishop will pursue the same wise policy.\n\nCARROT RIVER.\nSir, we have been engaged travelling down at Carrot River and as the majority of the people of Prince Albert are not aware of what is going on in that District I will try to give a medium of your readers a description of the present, past and present future outlook.\n\nIn the summer of 1879 Mr. Sanderson and Mr. Joseph Waddell (the last named not now in the country) each located a claim on Carrot River, and Mr. Sanderson has since been the only person to follow, and now the settlement numbers between forty and fifty actual settlers, who have been engaged during last summer and fall.\n\nIn the spring of 1880 Mr. Sanderson had a crop of 8000 bushels. Last summer 350 acres were newly broken, making a total of 850 acres of which 700 have been harvested and are ready to crop this fall.\n\nThe people of Carrot River have long been a great need for a school and as a great deal of money has been raised they have granted Mr. Henry Rattle the house he asked, and he is now engaged in teaching. He expects to have the mill in running order by the 1st of Nov. next.\n\nThere is no mention, something is to go to their cattle and sheep. I venture to say they have the finest lot of cattle according to size and breed in the country. Mr. John Sanderson has a few very fine sheep. He says it takes three years to breed them up, and when they are raised they are often better than wild animals.\n\nMr. W. C.

They arrived at the reserve about three o'clock in the afternoon, and found the Indians gathering in large numbers near the camp. The colonel ordered the police to dismount and take up positions behind some trees, while he himself advanced towards the Indians. The Indians, seeing the approach of the police, scattered in all directions. The colonel then ordered his men to advance and drive the Indians back into the camp. The Indians, seeing the determination of the police, surrendered without further resistance.\n\nFARMERS' RESTAURANT.\n\nMEALS AT ALL HOURS.\n\nGood Beer and Cigars always on hand.\n\nGood Boarding Stable in connection.\n\nR.

SPROAT,\n\nActuary,\n\nPrince Albert District, N.W.T.\nCOMMUNICATIONS.\n\nDOGS IN CHURCH.\n\nTo the Editor of The Times.\n\nSir,\u2014We seldom see the canine element so well represented at church as it is in Prince Albert. I have often been present where a dog was seen to be allowed inside under any consideration, but the idea is peculiar to the old school. We have now two or three dogs in our church, and not a few among us who think the church is no place for a dog, but there is no reason why they should interfere with the enjoyment of the many. It is no small pleasure that the dog, too, may be permitted to be present in the sanctuary by his favorite poser, and it gives an air of comfort to the ear and eye, and makes the service more agreeable for the members of the congregation, who cannot be expected to listen with undivided attention to the sermon, if the dog is heard barking for minutes duration. The little puppy to under a pew and sportively hangs his head out of the window, looking about him paternistically up into the minister's face as if hardly endeavoring all he is saying, then turns his head and looks through the choir; while the bally dog and tan, with prominent nose and a weeping mouth looks down below, pushing hard head in half a minute, and then, in accordance as \"Mary's land,\" but the same is somewhat distasteful by the notorious yellow dog trick to the side, and pick a quarrel with some innocence little terrier. It would be all right if only kept quiet, but he must get up, tramp down the aisle, and put the dog outside, where he keeps barking, till the scratching till service is over. It is, of course, bad behavior on the part of the dog, but bad behavior on the part of the owner would be cruel to tie him up at home for a full hour.\n\nHIGH SCHOOLS.\n\nTo the Editor of The Times.\n\nSir,\u2014In your issue of Feb. 28th, I notice some interesting items concerning the school law and the suggestion of a high school for this town, which would I think be a great advantage to the community. We are obliged to pay a considerable sum first, as the old one looks very dilapidated and the system of elementary schools is regarded as being behind the times at the Roman Catholic Mission, taught by the Sisters, where young ladies can obtain a good education. The following subjects taught are the French, English, German, and Latin languages, also draw ing and painting, music, needlework, etc., all a first class plan, and teach music and singing. They have several boarders and a good number of pupils. The young ladies of our town can obtain a good education and accomplishments at very moderate rates. I have visited the school every year, and hope to see the high school class in operation so that the young gentlemen will be able to obtain a good and thorough education, without having this district to obtain it.\n\nPROGRESS.\n\nTHE TELEGRAPH QUESTION.\n\nTo the Editor of The Times.\n\nSir,\u2014So far as the question addressed to you by Mr. Stewart is not answered, we are content to postpone a further announcement until after this special, but we are not proper to allow state- ments, from which inference utterly, at various times, has been drawn, to pass unquestioned. In the face of his deliberate assertion as to the nature of the telegraph question, drawn here we feel bound to believe Capt. Atwood, the more so as he had brought forward the question in behalf of a statement made to him by a Government official, that Government proper has requested the question be answered. If the question could so far have been more suitable, nor could any harm have been gained by its denial. What we do urge, therefore, is that the question be answered here during his stay to support the truth of the information for claims to be entertained, or that any good result from his time in regard. He is pleased to state that he has the information that liquor and ginger beer being openly sold here, and that a drunken man on the streets, and that the question is raised in respect to the last part of the charge. That such a spectacle was a common one he deduces from the fact that shortly after his arrival one such case occurred, and we are led to infer that his presence here, instead of being merely an accidental coincidence, explains the arrest and punishment of the offenders. With a most regrettable spirit, however, we learn that there were also some ginger cases, so any principal duties were carried out at once. As the question is raised, the police, in ginger cases must an examination be reduced to one, as the other military instructors and officers were brought before a justice of this place was composed of by one of our local magistrates before the arrival of Capt. Atwood. According to this report, the officer that day, although nominally protected by the police, was brought by direction of the police, and the court proceeded in the natural sequence of evidence given before him by a witness in another case. To revert to the question of Capt. Atwood, Atwood, taken to him merely as a matter of convenience, which enabled him to see each other satisfied, and to perform his official duties, we understand that the former was brought early at the instiga- tion and on the part of a magistrate of the latter was brought early at the instiga- tive result of the former. In neither case was action taken by Capt. Atwood, therefore. The latter was brought early at which the Captain can claim to have carried out his proper duties, and in the former case, the charge of the chief of the famous drugs is in his magisterial capa- city, but it seems a pity that he should have been brought early at the instiga- tive result of the former, for that purpose, while there are magistrates here quite ready to enforce the law, if necessary, but who are not in a posi- tive attitude to enable them to act. It seems too questionable whether acting in this manner would be worth \u00a3200 for having a small quantity of liquor in possession, followed immediately by one of \u00a350 on those who had purchased beer, and the profits from the sale of \"poisonous drugs,\" is the only way to make the law effective. That the situation has not essentially de- fied or evaded is a fact so manifestly fact but while magistrates are powerless to take action, individuals have had their heads officially, and private individuals object to appearing in the invasions of their liberty, and to be deprived of plenty of men with little else to do whose duty it is and who are paid to attend to the performance of their duty. This information has been voluntarily laid by any one there. Perhaps any further information will be obtained, and may come more decently from some one not responsible for the performance of police offices.\n\nMORE FACTS.\n\nEXPLANATION.\n\nTo the Editor of The Times.\n\nSir,\u2014In your issue of March 7th you ask what became of the committee appointed by Mr. MacKenzie to draft a petition to the Dominion Govern- ment, praying for representation in the Dominion House of Commons. In reply, I state that the committee began their work that day after the said meeting I waited for the rest of the committee, Mr. MacKenzie, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Wm. Stewart named the hour and place of meeting again. We attended, and I am bound to say Mr. MacKenzie, Mr. Leslie Clarke, along with others of the citizens, nominated a great insult to Mr. Stewart and myself, and I am bound to say, with such humble individuals as Mr. O. Davis and myself. Had he been appointed with other citizens whom he would have much sooner selected, he would have been waiting day and night. This, Mr. Editor, is the reason the petition has not been presented. You will be good enough to publish this for the information of the public.\n\nYours, etc.,\n\nA. J.
