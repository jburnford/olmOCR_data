D. McLean,\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6490, file 42167-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of Departmental telegram dated Sept. 18th, in which the Department offers per capita grant, plus $50.00, and in addition the necessary books for High School, on receipt of requisition, in the case of the Indian child Peter Rivers, who had recently passed the Entrance Examination, for the High School.\n\nIn this connection, I beg to say that in the case of the half-breed, it is probable that he will be taken care of at the expense of the rate-payers, at North Vancouver, by arrangement with the Board of School Trustees.\n\nOn the 19th instant, Mr. Cairns, Inspector of Indian Schools, and I visited the Squamish Mission Reserve and interviewed the parents of the Indian boy, Peter Rivers, to see if the parents would be willing to make up the difference between the grant offered by the Department and the fees demanded by the School Trustees and after consideration, the parents have decided that instead of letting this boy attend High School they will have him go to work.\n\nI would add that in my former communication I referred to this boy as being a pupil of the Indian School, but I later ascertained that the boy is a day school scholar, attending the classrooms in the boarding school, set apart for Indian Day School purposes. The per capita grant, therefore, in his case, which the Department offers to pay, would not apply to this boy.\n\nI have suggested to the Board of School trustees that if they would be willing to accept the fee of $50.00 offered by the Department, with free books, the parents may be induced to allow the boy to attend High School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.C. Ferry,\nIndian Agent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nThe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been instructed by the School Board of this District to make enquiry from you with regard to the education of six white children who are living on the Capilano Indian Reserve, North Vancouver, B.C.\n\nThis reserve is situated just outside the boundaries of our Municipality and within the Municipality of West Vancouver. The children are not near any West Vancouver School, and have been allowed to attend one of our schools which is convenient for them. Now we find that we have not sufficient accommodation for them and West Vancouver refuses to take care of them on the ground that the land on which they live pays no school taxes.\n\nThese people are living on the reserve on land leased from the Indians or the Indian Department, we are told. It therefore appears to my Board that the Indian Department should provide for their education. It seems reasonable for West Vancouver to refuse to take them in when they do not pay school taxes, and of course it is out of the question to expect my Board to do so when they are not in our District.\n\nYour kind consideration of this matter and an early reply will be much appreciated. Meantime we are continuing to look after the children's education.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary to the Board.\nOctober 12th, 1925.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your 4-47 of the 29th ultimo with reference to grants for two pupils who are attending the High School at North Vancouver. I note that one boy is a half-breed and the Department of course cannot give tuition grants for pupils who are not clearly our wards.\n\nI note that Peter Rivers in whose connection the Department offered a grant of $50.00 is not a pupil of the Squamish Indian Residential School. This alters the case somewhat and as you appear to be interested in this lad's future, the Department would increase the grant to $75.00 for the academic year if the parents decide to have him attend High School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6490, file 42167-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOctober 12th, 1925.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am directed to reply to your letter of the 1st instant addressed to The Honourable, The Superintendent General. I regret that this Department is not responsible for the education of the six white children who are living on the Capilano Indian Reserve, North Vancouver, B.C. It is my opinion that your Board or that of the Western Vancouver School District should collect a non-resident fee if it is decided to allow them to attend your institutions.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General\n\nJames Chapman, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nThe North Vancouver Board of School Trustees,\nBox 37,\nLynn Creek, P.O., B.C.\nSquamish Residential Sch.\nAug. 31st 1892.\n\nMrs. C.C. Perry\nIndian Agent\nVancouver.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs you directed me, two Sisters called on Mrs. Campbell, Principal of the North Vancouver high school in order to secure the best terms enabling Florence Thomas to take the commercial course there, but there is nothing to be done. The girl, being an Indian, is deprived of all privileges extended to white children; we could not even bring them to curtail the fees.\n\nI will do everything in my power to help this child take a year in the commercial course, but $50.00 allocated by the Department is very little compared to what is wanted. As you are aware, dear Sir, the fee is $11.00 a month, and the books. The girl will keep on boarding at the school here, and as it is rather far from the high school, I do not mean to let her walk it in the rainy and cold seasons. Then there shall be the car tickets to buy for her. Her mother, Mrs. Long, will provide these funds, but most likely this is all she will do if she does anything.\nWould you not, dear Sir, bring all these particulars before the Department and try to secure a higher allocation to the child for the purpose.\n\nOf course, if we do not succeed in pushing the girl through a year of high school, or if it takes too heavily on our little budget, we will have to give up forever trying; for most likely, we shall not be able to induce other children work for the entrance examinations. What would be the use if they can not benefit any by their exertions?\n\nHoping, dear Sir, that these lines shall be taken into consideration, I remain\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSister Mary Alice\nAssistant.\nSeptember 12, 1927.\n\nIn excess of what the Department would be prepared to grant toward the girl's education at High School. This the Reverend Sisters at first concurred in but afterwards made representation contained in the enclosed letter, which will be self-explanatory. I may say that the Sisters have not yet expressed any outstanding reason why this girl should be given any special training but simply that she be allowed to take her course at the High School, thereby enhancing the value of the girl's education.\n\nKindly be good enough to advise me if the Department is prepared to give any special assistance in excess of the $75.00 which I believe the Department was prepared to pay some time ago in the case of a lad named Rivers who passed his Entrance Examination at the same school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[C.C.Perry]\nINDIAN AGENT.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to transmit herewith a letter which I have received from Reverend Sister Amy, Principal of Squamish Indian Residential School, respecting the future educational progress of a pupil of that institution, named Florence Thomas, who recently passed her Entrance Examinations and who it is desired should be sent to High School for further training.\n\nIn this connection I would advise the Department that I made enquiries from the respective School Boards in the cities of North Vancouver and Vancouver and was informed that the scholastic fee for one year at the former City would be $120.00, while that of the City of Vancouver would be $100.00.\n\nMr. R. H. Cairns, Inspector of Indian Schools, and I had an interview some weeks ago with the Reverend Sisters of the Squamish Residential School when it was suggested by Mr. Cairns that unless it would be possible to transfer the girl to the Coqualeetza Residential School, where there were better facilities provided at Chilliwack High School, the only alternative appeared to be for the Rev. Principal to detain Florence Thomas as a grant-earning pupil and that the school board the girl out of its grant and pay for tuition fees in excess of\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 19, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, enclosing a communication from Rev. Sister Mary Alix, of the Squamish Indian Residential School, with reference to the providing of a tuition grant to assist Florence Thomas, a pupil of the School, to take a year in a commercial course.\n\nIn this connection I have to request that you will furnish further information regarding this request. You should state definitely the institution this girl will attend, the approximate length of time it will take her to complete the course, and whether she will continue in residence at the Squamish School during the period she is taking this special course. If this girl lives at the School during the period of the course, the Department will allow the regular per capita grant for her, and also the special tuition grant of $50 allowed in such cases, or slightly in excess of the latter amount, if there are circumstances in her case that would warrant same. When we have further particulars as requested, consideration will then be given to the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. C.

Sep. 20th., 1927\n\nSTATEMENT\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nPer: The Mother Superior,\nSt. Paul's School,\nNorth Vancouver, B.C.\n\nIn account with: The Board of School Trustees\nof The City of North Vancouver\n\nTo one-quarter of annual per capita charge in respect\nof school accommodation and tuition to Florence\nThomas at North Vancouver High School, for period\nfrom September 6th to November 15th, 1927. . . . $28.75\nSept. 20, 1927. To tuition of Florence Thomas, Indian girl of Burrard No. 3. Band, at the North Vancouver City High School for the quarter September 6th to November 15th, 1927, as per attached account.\n\nI hereby certify that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that all expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6490, file 42167-3, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge Departmental letter No. 103-167, dated September 19th., with reference to the tuition grant of the Department to assist Florence Thomas, a pupil of Squamish Indian Residential School, to take a commercial course at the City of North Vancouver High School.\n\nIn reply I have the honour to inform the Department that during negotiations with the Department the Reverend Bishop in charge of the Indian School made arrangements for the admission of the girl to the City of North Vancouver High School to enter upon a two-year commercial course, for which the girl is thought to have inclination and ability, and I have received from the Secretary of the Board of School Trustees an account for the first quarterly term, September 6th. to November 15th., 1927, in the sum of $28.75, voucher for which, No. 2712, is herewith transmitted to the Department.\n\nIn this connection I would inform the Department that I have discussed with the School Trustees the question as to payment by the Department for tuition fees in view of the fact that the Residential School is located within the City, and the Department has assumed payment to the Municipality of school taxes amounting to 10 mills in behalf of this institution. In doing so I had in view the information conveyed to me that pupils of the Coqualeetza Residential School at nearby are admitted to High School in the Town of Chilliwack free of tuition fees. The Board of School Trustees holds the view that it is evident that the Squamish Residential School is operated for monetary consideration along the lines of any business undertaking and that if the point raised by me was seriously considered it might follow that any person, firm or organization conducting business within the City and paying Municipal taxes on property used for business purposes must likewise be possessed of transferable rights in respect to the educational facilities of the public schools:\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6490, file 42167-3, part 1)\nSeptember 30, 1927.\n\nschools; also that to admit free of charge any one pupil of Squamish Residential School to the City High School would establish a precedent entitling all children who are inmates of the same institution to the privileges of the public schools of the City. Similar treatment could not then be denied all private boarding schools. Thus, the owners of such institutions would be enabled to dispense with the teaching staff and operate their establishments with domestic help only while bringing in children from outside territory and deriving a profit on their education obtained at the expense of the local ratepayers.\n\nIt is quite probable that the Department has already given consideration to the foregoing question and, assuming it has done so and has decided notwithstanding the question in point to contribute to the tuition fees of pupils attending High School in the same City where the Indian Residential School is situated and where school taxes are paid by the Department, the account of the School Board has been certified for payment.\n\nThe tuition fee of the North Vancouver High School is $115.00 per year and the Reverend Sisters in arranging with the School Board for quarterly payments did so with a view of terminating the High School course for the girl in the event of it being found that the Department would not be prepared to meet the cost of the girl's tuition at High School.\n\nAccounts for succeeding quarters are expected to be received from the School Board unless any further question should arise in connection therewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(C. C. Perry)\nINDIAN AGENT.\nOttawa, October 7th, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, regarding the providing of a tuition grant to assist Florence Thomas, a pupil of the Squamish Indian Residential School, to take a commercial course at the City of North Vancouver High School and enclosing a voucher for the first quarter's fees. In reply I beg to say that the Department will be responsible for the payment of the fees charged, namely, $115., for the present academic year and you should forward accounts, from time to time, for the amount due. A cheque in payment of the first quarter's fees will be sent in due course.\n\nAs it is understood that this girl will reside at the Squamish School, the Department will continue to pay per capita grant for her and her name should appear on the quarterly returns with the other grant-earning pupils. A note should appear opposite her name that she is attending high school.\n\nWe have noted the objection of the Board of School Trustees to providing free tuition for this girl.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In March she held the second place in a class of 45, typewriting D, and in June she was fifth in a class of 40 pupils, typewriting C. The Rev. Principal of the Residential School states that the classwork was indeed good for an Indian child but that the want of practicing at home with a typewriter was much felt. The Department has recently authorized a typewriter for this school so that the girl will be able to use it to her advantage. I am further advised that the health of the girl is good. In view of the progress made by this girl, I have pleasure in recommending a continuance of the Department's grant to further assist Florence Thomas in her second year's course upon which she has already entered by arrangement between the Reverend Principal and the High School authorities. I would further recommend that the grant be paid from the $100,000 appropriation set aside for Indian advancement by the Government through the Parliamentary Committee.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6490, file 42167-3, part 1)\nOttawa, September 5th, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, with reference to a tuition grant to assist Florence Thomas, a pupil of the Squamish Indian Residential School, to continue her commercial course in the City of North Vancouver High School. In reply I beg to say that the Department will allow the same amount as last year, viz., $115, and you should forward accounts from time to time for the amount due.\n\nAs it is understood this girl will reside at the Squamish School, the Department will continue to pay per capita grant for her, and her name should appear on the quarterly returns with the other grant earning pupils. A note should appear opposite her name stating that she is attending high school.\n\nPayment of this grant will be made from the appropriation for Indian education.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

He has made arrangements to pay for the boy's maintenance, if we will pay the school expenses.\n\nThe training so far has been given free, and I believe there will be no change in this policy. All we are asked to do is to provide tools and stationery.\n\nHenry has enrolled at the School as they wanted him to commence at re-opening and he required school supplies to the value of $10.68. I believe the Department is willing and anxious to assist suitable young Indians in this way, so authorized the expenditure pending your advice.\n\nHenry Paul is 15 years old, and was formerly in Sechelt Residential School. He is a particularly fine-looking lad, and his parents are hardworking Indians, his father being a logger. The mechanical training is to enable the boy to obtain work on a fish-packing boat as engineer. Indians with experience of this kind are usually given preference on these boats which often have Indian crews entirely.\n\nI am advised by the School that expenses for the mechanical training are kept very low as most of the boys would be unable to obtain the training otherwise.\n\nI respectfully request that you authorize this in the case of Henry Paul. I should add that his board and incidental expenses, paid by his father, will amount to about $25.00 or $30.00 per month.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nB/DH.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, October 4, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd ultimo, I may state that your action in purchasing certain school supplies for Henry Paul, who is enrolled as a student at the Vancouver Technical School, is approved.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

The expense to the boy's father has been quite a heavy drag on him, and I do not think Henry has warranted the expense. For a few months he was quite studious, but later took no interest in his studies, and the proprietor of his boarding house said he was behaving badly. The School authorities advised me they thought he was wasting his time as he stayed at school only as an excuse to be in town. He has now returned to his Reserve.\n\nI was surprised to receive the enclosed account for tuition, as we have put a number of pupils through the Technical School during the past 10 years, without charge, but I am now advised that they are compelled to charge under Section 138, of the School Act. The following is a copy of the School Board's letter:\n\n\"It is quite true that we did not bill you in previous years for Indian students who came to Vancouver to reside and attended school for the reason that Section 138 of the School Act defined these children as residents. This Act was changed at the 1937 session of the legislature as follows: 'For the purpose of this Act, a pupil whose parents or guardian reside elsewhere shall not be deemed to be a resident in a school district or municipality by reason only of the fact that the pupil boards at a boarding-house in the School district or municipality, unless he is a pupil whose parents or guardian reside in a part of the Province not comprised within the limits of a school district.' The amendment of said Section 138 enacted by this section shall come into operation on the last day of July 1938.\"\n\nTherefore, I presume the account must be paid.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nB/DH.\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6490, file 42167-3, part 1)\nOttawa,\nJanuary 6, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 30th ultimo it has been decided to pay the accounts which you submitted in favour of the Vancouver Technical School in connection with the tuition of Henry Paul.\n\nHowever, I would point out that in future no payments will be made for tuition of Indian pupils from your Agency unless we have been consulted before the pupil starts the course and a definite decision has been given regarding the amount we are prepared to allow.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

She has made all arrangements and will do housework for her board, but is unable to finance the books.\n\nI do not know whether the Department is willing to do this, but I hope there is nothing to prevent the assistance being given to this girl who is quite ambitious. I know of cases where all expenses have been paid for Indian boys attending University, but do not remember any girl being so assisted.\n\nI am unable to say at present what the cost of the books would be, but it is not much in comparison with what we have done for Indian boys, and I respectfully recommend that this girl's application be given favourable consideration if it is possible to do so.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB/DH.\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, August 8, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, with reference to Mona Baker.\n\nAt the present time the Department is not encouraging Indian girls to take higher academic training.

An Indian of the Squamish Band, No.171, Simon Baker, who has six children, two of school age, has been sending them to the Lower Capilano public school in the District of North Vancouver. The District has advised him that he is living in the Municipality of West Vancouver, and therefore they cannot accept his children in the District school unless he pays $5.00 per month for each child.\n\nBaker lives on Capilano Indian Reserve (Squamish No.5) and is only a few feet from the boundary of the District and the Municipality of West Vancouver, whose schools are several miles from Baker's home. The children cannot attend the Squamish Indian Day School, as it is also too far, and they are not Roman Catholic, Baker does not wish them to attend Squamish Indian Residential School. Even if they did attend the latter school, it would cost us more than $5.00 each per month, and the school is filled up anyway.\n\nBaker now requests that the Department will pay this charge for him. There are not enough children on Capilano Reserve to open a day school for Protestant children. One family has moved to Squamish I.R.No.1 at North Vancouver so that their children can attend public school, but Baker cannot do that.\n\nSeeing that we are paying quite a large grant to Residential and Day Schools in this Agency, which are all Roman Catholic, I hope the Department can see its way clear to do this much for the Protestant Squamish Indians, a number of whom (including Simon Baker) attended Lytton Anglican Residential School. Your advice at an early date will be appreciated, as the public schools re-open on May 3rd.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nB/DH.\nOttawa\nApril 30, 1943.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nMr. F.J.C. Ball, Indian Agent, 416 Federal Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Simon Baker, No. 171, Squamish Band\n\nI have for acknowledgment your air mail letter of the 28th instant, in which you submit for Departmental consideration a request received by you for a grant necessary to enable the children of the marginally-noted Indian to attend the Lower Capilano Public School.\n\nInasmuch as requests such as this may reach you from time to time, may I explain how our educational appropriations are now voted by Parliament. These appropriations consist of two main items:\n\n1. Grants to Indian residential schools;\n2. Indian day school teachers' salaries.\n\nUnder existing regulations these funds cannot be used for any other purpose and are voted separately by Parliament. This fact leaves us with a comparatively small amount of money for tuition and other grants. It is exceedingly difficult, therefore, for us to make a grant such as the one suggested, particularly in view of the fact that no provision has been made for it in the 1943-44 estimates.\n\nIn view of your recommendation, however, we are prepared to make a grant for the coming academic term which, I notice, commences on May 3. The claims of these children for a continuance of this grant and the conditions in which they find themselves should be carefully reviewed at the close of the school year. It is just possible, of course, that Simon Baker, in\nthe meantime, may change his place of residence. In any event it would be appreciated if a report on the case reached us prior to the preparation of the 1944-45 estimates.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nre: File No.103-167\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of the 30th April last regarding grant for the children of Simon Baker, No.171, of the Squamish Band, to attend public school. Your decision to make a grant for the term commencing May 3rd was much appreciated, but, unfortunately, could not be taken advantage of.\n\nThe City of North Vancouver had an unpaid bill of $50.00 against Simon Baker for a period during which the children attended school before they found out that he was not living in that municipality. Baker could not pay this amount, and the City therefore refused to accept the children for the term commencing May 3rd, although I assured them that we would pay for this term.\n\nThe children did not attend school, therefore, and the only tuition they received was from their parents, which was not very much. I could not ask the Department to pay this outstanding bill, and the matter rested there. I am reporting the above facts with a view to receiving your advice.\n\nBaker says he will try to pay up the $50.00 before school re-opens, but he feels rather badly about the fact that other parents on the Reserve hand over their children to the Residential School for the Department to support for ten years whereas all he asks is assistance in paying only for their tuition. If an amount could be placed in the 1944-5 Estimates as mentioned in your letter, it would be appreciated. This case is uncommon in this Agency, although no doubt it is common enough in many other places.\n\nIndian Agent.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, July 6, 1943.\n\nMr. F.J.C. Ball, Indian Agent, 416 Federal Building,\nVancouver, B.

C.,\nVancouver\n\nI would like to apply for authority for two Indians to take lessons in pottery at the Vancouver Art School during the coming winter.\n\nA number of Indians are getting too old for longshoring and other heavy work, and there are also T.B. arrested cases who can do only light work. These people could make a living for themselves by selling pottery with Indian designs, and some of them are anxious to learn. If a sufficient number became interested, it might be possible to create a real industry, as this pottery would sell well to the tourist trade.\n\nThe cost would be $10.00 for each Indian, and two of them would like to start in September. I would suggest that $25.00 in all be authorised, as the $5.00 extra would cover any small incidentals.\n\nActing Indian Agent\n\nDH/EP\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI am forwarding Mr. Acting Agent Caldwell's letter of June 20th in connection with the proposed attendance of two Indians at the Vancouver Art School during the coming winter for the purpose of taking lessons in pottery. The expenditure in this case should not exceed $25.00 and the necessary funds could be provided from the Technical Education Division of the B.C. Special Vote.

He entered a Catholic School when nine years old and was advanced three grades in his first year. After a year's absence from school through illness he passed the eighth grade. In September 1946 he entered grade nine in Vancouver College, being apparently under the impression that a course in typing and bookkeeping was available. When he found that this course was not taught he lost interest and discontinued attending.\n\nEdward Guerin, the father, works as a fish buyer. He has a boat and is now building a second one for use in his business. However, in order to build he has had to pledge the bulk of his earnings for a year or more ahead. He is illiterate and finds it a big handicap in business, and the son William wants a business course in order to be able to handle his father's accounting and correspondence.\n\nThe Principal of Vancouver College advises that William should do well in such a course. He is undoubtedly bright and has ambition, and as a business course may enable the family to eventually carry on a good business, I would recommend that the Department provide the necessary fees.\n\nThe Sprott Shaw Business College, 30 minutes by streetcar from the Guerin home offer a nine month course in typing, cost accounting and junior bookkeeping for $2.00 monthly.

Remarks of principal (or teacher): These should include comments on character, general fitness and academic capability.\n\nCharacter: Good. He has shown himself to be reliable, amenable, and determined.\n\nFitness: His physical fitness is excellent. Social: Sociable. Academically: Average. However, because of the boys' wish to go to school, and because of the effect his going to higher school will have on the rest of the pupils (see back of this page).\n\nAgent's remarks: This boy is good material. He was a Scout leader prominent in athletics and well behaved. He will board at the Indian Residential School whilst attending white school. This arrangement is considered desirable in view of the unfavourable environment in North Vancouver.\n\nPrincipal (or teacher) Indian Agent\n\n(over)\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6490, file 42167-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n12. (Continued)\nI feel the boy should be recommended. In the past it has been difficult to maintain interest among the boys in their last two years of school. It was the end of the road for them, so to speak. Their interest in studies flagged. If one of their own continues on the High School we will have an incentive to set before them.\n\nThe boy is one month late starting school already. It is questionable whether he will be able to make his grade this year. Nevertheless I should like to recommend him. In view of the above I think it would be money well spent.\nAIRMAIL:\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nEnclosed is an application for a Tuition Grant for Norman Joseph of the Squamish Band in order that he may take Grade IX at the Sechelt Superior School.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Taylor has requested an amount of $50.00 plus the cost of textbooks.

It is noted that this Return includes the name of Theresa Jeffries. In this connection I attach a copy of a letter which was forwarded to Major MacKay on October 16, 1947. Is this girl staying at the Sechelt Residential School?\n\nWe do not appear to have had any previous correspondence re Normal Joseph whose name is also shown on the December Return from the Sechelt United School.

M.D.\n\n352\nMarch 30, 1949.\n\nW. S. Arneil, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nI enclose application form in duplicate for tuition grant for Joyce Bernadette Moody, No. 159 of the Squamish Indian Band, who is in attendance at St. Ann's Academy in Victoria, B.C.\n\nWhen this girl left the Songhees Indian Day School, which she attended for seven years, the Reverend Father Bradley spoke highly in favour of admitting her into high school. I thereupon wrote to the Reverend Principal of St. Ann's Academy asking if they would accept this girl and what tuition fees would be. In the absence of any reply to my letter, the matter was not proceeded with.\n\nI now find, however, that Joyce Moody has been in attendance at St. Ann's Academy from September 1947 to date, and that she is now in Grade 9 and making good progress. She has ambitions to graduate and to train as a nurse. The report on her progress would seem to justify recommending the continuance of her studies. The fees are $60.00 per year, and I would recommend that they be approved and made retroactive to September 1947.\n\nThe mother of this girl has been separated for many years from her husband, who resides on the reserve at Squamish. She is unable to provide for her daughter's education, and so far the Academy has received no fees.\n\n(H. E. Taylor)\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nHET/FR\nEnc.\nApril 12, 1949.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Tuition Grant, Joyce Moody\n\nAttached is an application for a tuition grant to enable the above mentioned pupil to continue her high school training at the St. Ann's Academy in Victoria, along with a letter in support of this application from Mr. Superintendent Taylor.\n\nIt will be noted that this girl has been attending St. Ann's Academy since September 1947 and that she is now in Grade 9. Although Mr. Taylor originally recommended payment of tuition fees as from the time of her admission, it is felt that in view of the fact that the Academy did not inform Mr. Taylor of her attendance in spite of his request for information, that the Department should pay for the current year only. This office has requested Mr. Taylor to endeavor to secure from the principal prompt advice as to the admission of Indian pupils from his Agency.\n\nIt is recommended that the attached voucher covering the period from September to December be paid and that the Department authorize an expenditure of $33.00 to cover tuition fees for the remaining six months of the current year.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n26th April, 1949.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 12th instant regarding tuition grants for Joyce Moody to enable her to continue her high school training for the current academic year.\n\nIn view of your recommendation we are paying Voucher 447 and we will allow an additional amount of $35.00 to cover tuition fees for the last six months of the current year. The marks she obtains on her June examinations should be submitted for our consideration if she intends to continue during the year 1949-50.\n\nIt is felt that the Principal of St. Ann's Academy in Victoria should be definitely informed that in future the Department will not be prepared to pay tuition grants for any Indian children attending that school unless their admission has previously been approved. In fairness to all parties concerned, if any educational institution expects a grant from the Department for the admission of an Indian child, our approval must be obtained before the child enters on a course.\n\nBernard F.

George Johnston was appointed teacher at the Kincolith Indian Day School as from October 1st this year. He lives in the Mission House at Kincolith. It is recommended that he be allowed fuel for his house whilst employed by the Department as teacher. In previous years the fuel requirements at Kincolith have been three tons of coal and three cords of wood. This is entirely inadequate if the teacher's house is included in fuel requirements. This winter has been exceptionally cold and severe. In conversation with Bishop Gibson he informs me that the teacher was allowed up to $100.00 worth of fuel per year for his residence but I cannot find any record of this on file.\n\nIt is recommended that an additional amount of 8 tons of egg coal and 4 cords of wood be provided for the Kincolith School and teacherage. It should be said that Mr. Johnston gives 5 days service a week full time to the Department's business and he should be entitled to the same consideration regarding fuel requirements as teachers in other village schools.\n\nCoal can be purchased at Philpott, Evitt & Company Ltd., Prince Rupert, at a cost of $14.70 per ton plus $6.25 per ton freight and sacks. A purchase order is requested.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian-Agent.\nAIRMAIL\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI am enclosing Mr. Indian Agent Anfield's letter of December 16th in connection with the proposed supply of fuel for the Reverend George Johnston, teacher at the Kincolith Indian Day School for use in the Mission House. The quantities of fuel recommended by the Agent would cost in the neighborhood of $200.00 and as Mr. Johnston is being allowed salary at the rate of $125.00 per teaching month this would make his total remuneration equivalent to $145.00 per month. This amount is in excess of what we are paying most certificated teachers.\n\nApparently an allowance up to $100.00 worth of fuel for the year was previously made to the teacher at this school and I would suggest that this be continued.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, 9 January 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant, we will allow an amount of $100.00 towards the cost of the fuel for the teacher's residence at the Kincolith Indian Day School.\n\nBernard F.

C., Box 70, Vancouver.\n\nRe your 12-11-1 of April 14th, 1948, having reference to fuel needs at the Sunnyside seasonal Day School, will you please delete the item of $127.25 from our requisition for funds for this Agency for heating Day Schools. There is nothing on file in writing from the B. C. Packers Ltd. to the effect that they will supply fuel though correspondence from Mr. Gillett, Agent, would indicate that some verbal arrangement had been reached on this point. Whilst at Sunnyside earlier this year, I gathered that there was an intention to charge for fuel for the School but as the informant was a minor employee, it is possible he was misinformed. As soon as the Manager and Accountant arrive at Sunnyside, I shall have a conference with them and endeavor to get a written agreement. In the meantime, I would appreciate the forwarding of our request for an accountable advance for other Schools.\n\nF. Earl Anfield.\nIndian Agent.\nP.O. Box 187.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nW. S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B. C., Box 70, Vancouver.\n\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nApril 9th, 1948.\n\nAttached please find list of fuel requirements for the schools of this Agency for the fiscal year 1948-49. Authority is requested to purchase the coal at the best available figure from local sources, also fuel oil requirements. An accountable advance of $1683.15 is requested, if possible by airmail, to meet costs of cutting wood fuel and for delivery charges by Indian gas boats on other fuel needs.\n\nThe fuel requirements of the Agency are higher than last year due to the fact that the Kitselas School has been re-opened on a 10 months basis and also with fuel requirements for Sunnyside School are included this year. It should be said, however, that so far the B. C. Packers have provided the fuel requirements for this school but I have reason to believe that they intend billing us for them in the future.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nEnclosed herewith is Mr. Indian Agent Anfield's letters of April 9th and April 26th and summary of fuel required for schools in his Agency for the current fiscal year.\n\nIt will be noted that the item of $127.25 for fuel needs of the Summside Indian Day School has been deleted pending a conference between the Agent and B.C. Packers Limited regarding the provision of fuel for this school.\n\nIt is recommended that Mr. Anfield be authorized to purchase fuel as requested and that an accountable advance of $1647.15 to cover cost of cutting wood fuel and for delivery charges be forwarded to the Agent by air mail if possible.\n\nW.

C.\nJune 10th, 1948.\n\nW. S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B. C., Box 70, Vancouver.\n\nFurther to your 12-11-1 of April 14th, 1948, and my reply of April 26th, 1948, dealing with fuel requirements for the Indian Day School and teacherage at Sunnyside Cannery. Attached please find:\n\n1. Voucher no. 560 in the sum of $329.78.\n2. Copy of letter from the B. C. Packers Ltd., in this regard.\n3. Copy of letter from Indian Supt. Gillett, who was Agent here at the time that the reported arrangements were made with the B. C. Packers regarding the supply of fuel.\n\nOn a recent visit to Sunnyside Cannery, I discussed this matter with the Manager and the Accountant in some detail. Their statements co-incide in general with those of Mr. Gillett that the arrangements at the time this school was opened was of a purely temporary nature. The B. C. Packers agree that they will supply a furnished house for the teacher and a nurse at Sunnyside Cannery but they do not feel obligated to supply fuel either for this teacherage-nursing post or for the school.\n\nUp to last fall, the teacher lived in a little one-room shack next to the school but on the appointment of Miss Freeman to the position of teacher arrangements were made with the B. C. Packers to give her a furnished house gratis. Under the circumstances, it is recommended that the voucher as submitted be paid and that a sum of $268.00 be authorized for the purchase of the following fuel requirements for the balance of the present fiscal year:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n4 \\text{ tons of coal} & @ \\$18.25 = \\$73.00 \\\\\n1000 \\text{ gals. oil} & @ 19.5 = \\$195.00\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nIt should be said that the cannery really has nothing to gain by having a school at Sunnyside except for the three months of April, May and June when their Indian crews come in for cannery work. During these months, the children of these families can receive education. What is actually happening is that an ever increasing number of our Native people are leaving their Reserves and living at canneries such as Sunnyside and Port Edward where they are establishing more or less permanent domiciles. At Sunnyside Cannery some of the men whose families attend school are in the employ of the cannery for repair work and cannery boat building projects during the winter. At Port Edward most of the parents of the children attending school are employees of this plant which is rapidly reaching a twelve-months operational basis.\n\nWhilst not immediately pertinent to this fuel problem at Sunnyside, this situation should be watched very closely as in my opinion the day is coming when the Department could quite justifiably claim that the education of these children is the responsibility of the Province. These large fishing corporations such as Nelson Bros. and B.C. Packers are among the heaviest taxpayers in the Prince Rupert School district and it would seem to me that within two or three years we could justifiably claim that the children of their Native employees should not be a charge on the Indian Affairs Branch for purposes of education.\n\nThis entire situation should be watched with particular care at Port Edward where the Cellanese Corporation of America are establishing a huge plant and where it is quite likely a considerable number of Indian families will locate as employees in the raw products operation of this concern.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Superintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nFurther to my letter of April 29th regarding school fuel requirements, Skeena River Agency and in particular my reference to the fuel needs of the Sunnyside Indian Day School, I am enclosing Superintendent Anfield's letter of June 10th and enclosures referred to therein. While I have noted Mr. Anfield's comments regarding provincial responsibility in the matter of provision of education for Indian children at the Sunnyside and other canneries I doubt whether this is an appropriate time to raise the question.\n\nI would recommend that the attached voucher No. 560 be passed for payment and that the Department approve an expenditure of $285.00 for provision of the fuel needs of the school for the present fiscal year.\n\nW.S.

C.\nJune 3, 1948.\n\nMr. F. Earl Anfield,\nSuperintendent,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Anfield:\n\nWe have your letter of May 29th with reference to fuel for the School at Sunnyside Cannery. Our arrangements with Mr. Wallace, at the time we asked the Department for authority to open a School at that place, was of a temporary nature until such time suitable buildings and a permanent set-up could be established, depending on the population, etc.\n\nI understand from Mr. Wallace at the time, that he would provide accommodations for the teacher and supply some furniture and coal. I do not think the fuel for the School entered into the matter. If I remember rightly, we sent some vouchers for School fuel. The teacher at the time was not quite satisfied with the fuel arrangements and she was informed that she was given additional salary in lieu of fuel.\n\nMy opinion is that the fuel for the School should be definitely the responsibility of the Department if a permanent School is set up.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"J. Gillett\"\nJ. Gillett\nSuperintendent.\n\nC O P Y\nSunnyside Cannery  \nSkeena River, B. C.  \nMay 26th, 1948.\n\nMr. F. E. Anfield,  \nIndian Agent,  \nPrince Rupert, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nWith reference to our recent conversation about charges to Sunnyside School and Teacherage; the following were the arrangements made with Mr. J. Gillett:\n\n(1) Sunnyside and Cassiar were to supply the materials for the repairing of the school at the time it was opened. These materials were supplied at no cost to the Department of Indian Affairs, but any materials supplied after these repairs were to be chargeable to your office.\n\n(2) Fuel to be supplied by Sunnyside Cannery to the school and teacherage and to be charged to the Department of Indian Affairs. From our conversation this matter appeared to have been misunderstood by Mr. Gillett in that he thought Sunnyside Cannery was to supply the fuel at no cost to the Department, but this is not the case as I explained to you.\n\n(3) Teacherage to be supplied by Sunnyside Cannery at no cost to the Department; and per our conversation Sunnyside Cannery will supply the necessary furnishings at no cost to the Department.\n\nWe are enclosing herewith the past winter's fuel and supplies bill and trust that the foregoing will clear up any misunderstanding there may have been.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"W.

Anfield, Indian Agent,\nPRINCE RUPERT, B.C.\n\nIn your report for the quarter ended Sept. 20, you wrote in part as follows:- \"Some nine pupils are taking advanced studies in the Prince Rupert City High School\". At the present time we are engaged in checking the grants that we have authorized for higher education for the current academic year and we can only locate the names of six children who are attending Prince Rupert High School namely, Oscar Mercer, L. Garner, George Kelly, Lawrence Helin, Percy Adams, and Virginia Clark. Bertram McKay is attending Langley High School. The names just mentioned number seven.\n\nPlease let me know if there are any other Indian children in your Agency attending High school and if so give their names, ages, grades, and schools in which they are enrolled. If there are more than the seven mentioned above it is presumed that their parents are paying the cost of their education.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nReference your 103-168 (W.T. 1) of January 3rd, the following pupils are attending High School in Prince Rupert: Laurence Garner, George Kelly, Oscar Mercer, Percy Adams, Lawrence Helin and Virginia Clark. These are all on a grant earning basis and are all from this Agency.\n\nIn addition to these, Ronald Brown of Massett Agency is in receipt of a grant being administered by this office. In addition to these 7 children, Walter Harris of Babine Agency and Donald York of Massett Agency are attending the local High School and doing particularly well. I am not aware if grants are being paid for these two or not.\n\nMy purpose in stating \"some nine pupils\" in my September report was that I visit these schools every month in an effort to keep tab on the progress of these young people all of whom in High School appear to have behaved themselves in an orderly manner and are making good progress in their studies.\n\nIn addition to these children attending the Prince Rupert schools Bertram McKay is attending the Langley High School. As far as is known, no other children of the Agency are attending High School.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nFebruary 14, 1947\n\nF. E. Anfield, Esq., Indian Agent, Prince Rupert, B.C.\n\nYour voucher No. 136 covering tuition fees for Indian pupils attending white schools, Prince Rupert District, is being forwarded to the Department and recommended for payment.\n\nI would point out however that insofar as this office is aware departmental authorization for the attendance of these pupils at white schools has not been secured. I would refer you to my circular letter, O-11-1 of August 14, 1946 and particularly the penultimate paragraph which states that an Agent may give temporary authorization for such attendance but that the authority of the Department is to be secured as soon as possible.\n\nPlease let me have a report with respect to the pupils listed in the accounts covered by your voucher above referred to giving in each case details with respect to the circumstances which necessitate the pupil's attendance at a white school when there is an Indian Day School in operation on his Reserve.\n\nD.

Kelly, Port Simpson Band Tuition Grant.\n\nThe Department in their letter of October 24th, 1946, file 215-8-5550, sanctioned a tuition grant of $150.00 to enable this boy to attend High School in the city schools at Prince Rupert. It was understood that he would board with his aunt and arrangements for the cost of board and room were left with his parents. The aunt took seriously ill and on doctor's orders she informed me she could no longer keep George Kelly and Laurence Garner.\n\nMy letter of even date with reference to Laurence Garner will outline the procedure taken to keep these boys at School. The parents have been asked to pay in $20.00 a month from February 1st. It will be necessary to request an additional grant as follows:\n\n| Item                  | Cost   |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| Tuition fees - 6 months @ $5.00 | $30.00 |\n| Board and room - 5 months @ $20.00 | $100.00 |\n| Books, supplies, etc. | $15.00 |\n| Sanctioned from 1947-48 Vote | $45.00 |\n\nAdditional grant required $100.00\n\nAn accountable advance of $145.00 from 1947-48 Vote is recommended, as the boy has made satisfactory progress in his studies.\n\nF.

M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nFebruary 28th, 1947.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C., Vancouver.\n\nRe: Laurence Garner, Port Simpson Band.\n\nTuition Grant.\n\nThe Department in their letter of October 16th, 1946, file 215-8-5458, sanctioned a tuition grant of $225.00 for this fatherless boy to attend High School. His mother contributes $15.00 per month towards his board and room. An Accountable Advance of $157.50 was received on account expenditures up to March 31st, 1947, leaving an amount of $67.50 due from next year's vote.\n\nDue to unforeseen circumstances, it will be necessary to request an increase in this grant. Up to Christmas the lad boarded with a relative in town at a rate of $25.00 per month. This lady became seriously ill at that time and as a result of doctor's orders, could not take this lad and another, George Kelly, as boarders after the Christmas holidays. I managed to get them a room for $10.00 a month each and for a few weeks had to buy meal tickets for them for use in local restaurants. Appeals for homes for these lads proved unavailing, but eventually I managed to have the Salvation Army Hostel take them as boarders at $30.00 a month as from February 10th, 1947.\n\nMrs. Garner has been asked to increase her contribution to $20.00 per month as from February 1st.\n\nTo get this lad through to June, the following assistance will be needed:\n\n| Tuition Fees - 5 months @ $5.00 | $ 25.00 |\n|---------------------------------|--------|\n| Board and room - 4 months @ $20.00 | 80.00 |\n| (\u00bd cost)                         |        |\n| Books, supplies, etc.            | $ 10.00 |\n| Total required                   | $ 115.00 |\n| Sanctioned 1947-48 Vote          | $ 67.50 |\n| Additional grant requested       | $ 47.50 |\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6491, file 42168-3, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAn accountable advance of $115.00 from 1947-48\nVote is recommended. The boy has done well in school.\n\nF. Earl Anfield.\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of October 11th approving a tuition grant of $225.00 for Laurence Craig Garner, Port Simpson Band, I am enclosing Mr. Indian Agent Anfield's letter of February 28th from which it will be noted that due to difficulties in the matter of accommodation for this boy a further grant of $47.50 will be necessary to enable him to attend the Booth Memorial High School for the remainder of the current school term.\n\nApparently there is no better alternative to the arrangement made for room and board for this pupil at the Salvation Army Hostel, and consequently I would recommend that an additional grant of $47.50 be approved.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nenc.\nOttawa, March 11th, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your four letters of March 5th, the following additional tuition grants are authorized for the academic year 1946-47:\n\nLaurence Craig Garner -- $47.50\nGeorge Edward Kelly -- $100.00\nVirginia Clark -- $100.00\n\nAn accountable advance for the amounts mentioned above will be forwarded to Indian Agent Anfield together with an amount of $47.50 requested in his letter of February 28th, as soon as the funds from the 1947-48 appropriation are available.\n\nAs you are aware, it will probably be the middle of April before we can forward this advance as the Interim Supply Bill is usually passed just previous to the middle of April.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa\n\nYour File 103-168 (WT 1)\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Neary's letter of March 11th in connection with tuition grants for Indian children attending white schools in the Skeena River Agency.\n\nI am unable to reconcile the amounts approved in Mr. Neary's letter with Agent Anfield's requests. It would appear from our files that an additional grant of $85.00 is required for Virginia Clark, the amounts mentioned for Laurence Craig/Garner and George Edward Kelly being correct.\n\nWith reference to the amount requested, being the balances of grants already approved payable from 1947-48 appropriation, it is thought that this should be $247.50 rather than $47.50. A total accountable advance of $460 will meet the tuition requirements of all the pupils referred to in Mr. Anfield's four letters of February 23rd.\n\nFor D. M.

Mr. Coleman takes the view that, where the parents are domiciled in the school district, there is no liability for special fees. Mr. Anfield is more inclined to distribute funds for any purpose which will accelerate the assimilation of Indians. He was, perhaps, a little enthusiastic in promising the Board that he would recommend payment.\n\nI think we should get a legal opinion regarding liability. We should also get a copy of the B.C. Manual of School Law.\n\nOne factor deserves consideration. The Board is not\u2014repeat not\u2014charging us the per capita cost of educating these pupils. If they got tough and charged us the actual cost for high school pupils we should have to pay that.\n\nI had useful discussions with Coleman and Darry who would like to continue the talks here on board.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nAttached is a copy of a report received from Mr. Clark who is en route to the Yukon.\n\nYou will note in the first part of his memorandum he refers to elementary school pupils. It has always been our practice not to allow fees for elementary school pupils whose parents are residing in the town in which the children are attending school, provided the family have lived off the reserve for a period of eighteen months.\n\nIn the latter part of his memorandum Mr. Clark refers to the Indian children attending high school. We were under the impression that we were allowing the tuition fee that the school trustees requested.\n\nWe would appreciate hearing from you regarding the contents of Mr. Clark's memorandum.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\n\nEncl.\nThe Department has, during the past four years, been called upon to pay accounts covering tuition fees for Indian children attending white schools for which no provision was made in the Estimates.\n\nIn preparing your 1947-48 Estimates, please make sure that adequate provision is made for this item and attach a list showing the names of the pupils for whom fees are required, the names of the schools they will attend and the fees in each case.\n\nYou might let me have as soon as possible a similar list of pupils who will have to attend white schools during the 1946-47 academic year. Detailed information should be provided regarding each pupil and a definite recommendation made in each case.\n\nThe Department should not be called upon to pay tuition fees for children of Indian families who are residing in an organized municipality in premises assessed for taxes, nor maintenance for Indian children whose parents are in a position to provide for them themselves.\n\nFor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nCircular to All Indian Agents:\n\nA procedure has now been established by the Department in connection with the attendance of Indian children at Elementary White schools.\n\nAlthough under no circumstances should an Indian child be delayed from attending a Provincial school pending departmental authorization Agents should in August or early September submit a report to the Department through this office on Indian children for whom the Department will be required to pay tuition fees.\n\nIn the event that an Agent only learns in late August or after the start of the school term that an Indian child will have no alternative other than to attend a white school he may at once give temporary authorization for this attendance, departmental authorization to be secured as soon as possible. Cases such as this should be the exception rather than the rule, however, and it should be the normal procedure for Agents to anticipate such attendance and obtain authorization beforehand.\n\nCases already referred to this office covering attendance during the 1946-47 Academic year are being submitted to the Department.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\n-mh\nMEMORANDUM\n\nVancouver, B.C.\nMay 9, 1947\n\nFrom Inspector of Indian Schools\nTo Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nI would refer to Mr. Indian Agent Anfield's letter of the 30th ult., attached hereto, requesting payment of school fees to the City of Prince Rupert for the academic year for various children of the Skeena and Queen Charlotte Agencies, in support of his voucher #477 of April 30th, 1947 for $197.00. Also his letter of the same date respecting similar payment of fees totalling $485.00 for children of the Queen Charlotte Agency. It will be noted that the parents of practically all the children have apparently been gainfully employed and resident in Prince Rupert for some time.\n\nIt will be observed that Mr. Anfield draws a distinction between the 18 months clause in respect to relief and medical services for Indians on the grounds that the education of Indians is obligatory on the Dominion Government under the provisions of the British North America Act, but reference to Mr. Hoey's letter of May 16th, 1944, file 600401, expresses the opinion that it is the duty of the municipalities etc. in which Indians are resident to provide for their welfare, mentioning \"education\" in subsection (1) of the second paragraph, which would indicate that the Department feels that such municipal responsibility included this and all such services in consideration of the fact that an Indian renting premises in a town or municipality was an indirect tax payer. There are cases where Indians own such property.\n\nExamination of Agent Anfield's premises do not justify his conclusion. Closed schools at Kincolith and Greenville, overcrowding at Kitkatla and Aiyansh, unsatisfactory teachers at Port Simpson, do not necessarily or even probably account for the parents of the children living at Prince Rupert. He further mentions that Kitkatla has only one untrained teacher. His letter of Sept. 4, 1946 states that this teacher, Mrs. Grace Vickers, \"has a successful career as a teacher and there is no question but that the Department would approve her appointment,\"\n(your file 168-18-1 (WT1). He considers we become liable for the fees when economic needs or parental ambition leads to the Indians settlement in areas where white schools are in operation.\n\nHe claims authority for assuring the School Board that he would support their application in this office's circular of August 14, 1946 asking Indian Agents to advise this office as soon as possible what children would be attending white schools at the expense of the Department. About six weeks previously our circular of June 27th, 1946 on the same subject advised very specifically that the Department should not be called upon to pay these fees for children residing in organized municipalities in premises assessed for taxes. There was nothing in the subsequent directive to entitle him to assume that this principle had been abandoned.\n\nMr. Anfield's reference to Section 63 of the \"School Act\" of B.C., it is believed, should read Section 63 (3) (b). I cannot agree with his interpretation of the section. This section dealing with the power of Municipal Council to fix minimum property tax, and to impose other taxes for school purposes is as follows:\n\n\"To direct, in respect of any year, that where neither of the parents of any child or children attending public school in the municipal school district is taxed for school purposes in respect of property within the district, the parents or the surviving parent of the child or children shall pay a tax for school purposes in the district; and to fix the amount thereof which shall be payable monthly or otherwise as the Council may direct: Provided that the amount so fixed shall not be less than the amount of the minimum tax imposed and payable under clause (a) of this subsection, and shall not be greater than that amount by more than fifty per centum:\"\n\nOf interest in this connection is the interpretation in the Act of \"Indian\" as follows:\n\n\"Indian\" means any person who is either a full-blooded Indian, or any person with Indian blood in him who is living the Indian life on an Indian reserve.\"\n\nIf Mr. Anfield's argument is considered valid\nthe Department must be prepared to meet numerous demands for similar cases in other Agencies in this Province as there are many Indians who have not lived on the Reserves or followed the Indian mode of life for many years, in some cases having purchased lands outside the Reserves for the sole purpose of co-education of their children with whites in their schools. It is of interest in this connection to note that the franchise in British Columbia has recently been extended to such Indians.\n\nWhere the parents are already contributing directly or indirectly by the occupation of taxable premises there is no justification for further payment from public funds, as such Indian taxpayers are entitled to the rights and privileges of any other taxpayers. This is not intended to exclude from assistance those children resident on a reserve for whom we cannot provide ordinary or advanced education and are attending white schools with department assistance.\n\nIt appears that a restatement of Departmental policy is necessary and it would be appreciated if you would secure a ruling from the department on the subject.\n\nHowever, since Mr. Anfield has apparently given some assurance to the Prince Rupert School Board that the fees will be paid by the Department it is recommended that their payment be authorized with the stipulation that this does not set a precedent for future applications.\n\nR.F.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nRe voucher no. 477 attached, covering tuition fees for Indian pupils of this Agency for the period January to March 1947, and the following information given in connection therewith:\n\nWhen these and other children applied for admission to these schools last Fall, I was asked for a definite yes or no by the School Board as to whether or not their fees would be paid by the Department. In view of (a) closed schools at Kincolith and Greenville (b) overcrowded conditions at Kitkatla and Aiyansh (c) an unsatisfactory teaching staff at Port Simpson (d) the fact that parents of these children were earning their livelihood in Prince Rupert instead of being without employment on the reserves (e) the genuine desire of the parents to secure proper educational facilities for their children, and (f) your Circular O-11-1 of August 14th, 1946 authorizing temporary admission of applicants, I gave the School Board an assurance that I would endorse the admissions and recommend payment of the accounts presented. As to the liability of the Department to pay such accounts for Indians living in rented premises, I stand on the School Act (B.C.) Section 63B, and the responsibility of the Department to provide educational facilities for Indians under the B.N. Act. It is fully agreed that where adequate school facilities are provided, Indian children should attend the village day schools. I do contend, however, that the Department's responsibility does not cease when economic needs and or parents ambitions for better educational facilities compel the removal of families to areas where white schools are available.\n\nTo report briefly on the families concerned:\n\nHelin, Arthur, Marian and Barrie.\nRyan, Harry and Jeanette, Port Simpson - Fathers in both families are fishermen working out of Prince Rupert where they rent a home. These men will be eventually enfranchised and it is their opinion and mine that school facilities at Port Simpson will not give their children the education they deserve for their future as Canadian citizens.\nBarton, Alex and Frank\nStewart, James, Victoria and Chester.\nAlexander, Virginia - No school at Kincolith until October of last year. Teacher then appointed unqualified and unsatisfactory.\n\nDavidson, Ray. This boy is an Indian who lives with his mother and a stepfather in Rupert in rented premises.\n\nInnes, Delores\nNelson, Lorna, of Kitkatla. There are at least 70 children of school age, only half of whom were admitted to the school which has only one untrained teacher.\n\nMcKay, Reynold.\nSankey, Janet, of Fort Simpson. Parents are employed in fish filleting plant at Prince Rupert and live in rented premises.\n\nWright, Kenneth, Nora, Bertha.\nClayton, Herbert, of Kincolith. These families live in Prince Rupert and work at local fish plants.\n\nIn view of all the foregoing, it is recommended that these children be allowed to complete their courses for this year and that school fees be paid by the Department.\n\nF. Earl Anfield.\nIndian Agent.\nOffice of Indian Agent\n\nP.O. Box 187.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nApril 30th, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nRe your 215-11-6996 of April 9th dealing with Queen Charlotte Island children attending Prince Rupert City Schools, this matter has been discussed with Mr. J.A. Findlay, Acting Agent at Massett, and we agree on the following presentation to the Department:\n\n1. Last fall I was asked by the School Board as to the intention or otherwise of the Department to pay School accounts for native pupils admitted to city schools. My reply was an affirmative one as to recommendation for payment.\n\n2. The Day Schools at Massett were closed for lack of teachers and several families moved over to Prince Rupert to enable them to work and have their children attend school. I admitted them to the city schools and told the school board I would recommend payment of accounts by the Department.\n\n3. With regard to the statement that parents were working at Port Edward Cannery, the Collinsons, Whites and Parnells were working at Seal Cove Cannery and not Port Edward as stated by Mr. Indian Agent Phillips. They may have gone out to Port Edward for a few weeks only at the height of the herring season, when that plant was desperately short of help. I checked with Millards at Seal Cove and found that these people were on the clam canning operation.\n\n4. We are not aware that the 18 months clause applicable in medical matters can be applied to education. Our understanding is that Indian education is the direct responsibility of the Department and that if for any reason, school facilities are not adequate or available on the reserves, the Department is obligated to assist in securing or paying for same elsewhere.\n5. Whilst it is admitted that the School Board has no right to refuse admission of these school pupils. I am convinced that the Department is legally bound to pay fees, they standing in loco-parentis to these Crown wards. When not directly taxable for property in Prince Rupert, I believe these fees are due and payable under Section 63 B of the School Act.\n\n6. In general, attendance of most of these Indian children in the city schools has been regular and their progress very satisfactory. There has been no noticeable discrimination and a tribute is paid to the interest and attention given them by the teachers and principals concerned.\n\nThe grants requested are recommended in all cases.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nSubmission is made of Mr. School Inspector Davey's memorandum of the 9th inst. with enclosures as stated covering the subject of payment of school fees to the Prince Rupert School Board for the academic year ending next month for the children of Indians of the Skeena and Queen Charlotte Agencies, totalling $411.50 for the quarter ending March 31st only. Presumably similar accounts will be submitted for the current quarter.\n\nThe matter is fully detailed in the Inspector's memorandum but the writer does not agree with him that payment should be authorized and fails to see how it could without extending equal consideration to other schools in the Province attended by children of Indian residents occupying premises assessed for taxes. It is considered that Mr. Agent Anfield had no justification whatever for assuring the Board that he would recommend payment of the account and should have at least refrained from such commitment until he had discussed the matter with the Department or this office.\n\nThe subject was briefly reviewed with Mr. Clarke of your office on the 10th inst. and as he was leaving for Prince Rupert on that evening he was asked to discuss it with Mr. Anfield en route North as the boat would probably tie up there for several hours. I wired Mr. Anfield to meet him. Possibly he may be able to present some hitherto undisclosed angles of the matter that may bring you in agreement with the Inspector's recommendation.\n\nFor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\n:mh\nAir Mail\n\nOttawa, May 23rd, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 12th instant enclosing letter of April 30th from Indian Agent Anfield and a report from Inspector Davey in connection with payment of school fees for Indian children enrolled in the elementary grades at the Prince Rupert public school.\n\nOn reviewing our files we find that you submitted voucher 664 covering the tuition fees for these pupils for the month of September, 1946 and payment was made. We also received your voucher 136 dated February 10th, 1947, for the same pupils for the months of October, November and December, 1946. Both the above vouchers were paid as we overlooked the fact that the pupils were in the elementary grades, and no specific authority had been given to pay tuition fees for them.\n\nAs you are aware, our policy in the past has been as follows:\n\n1. The Department will pay tuition fees for Indian children in public white schools provided they reside on the reserve and there are no educational facilities available on their home reserve.\n\n2. We have never assumed responsibility for education of Indian children in elementary grades when the parents reside in a municipality and are either house owners or tenants. We have\nalways considered that in such cases they are entitled to the same consideration as any other resident of the municipality.\n\nMr. Anfield had no authority to promise the Prince Rupert Public School Board that we would pay tuition fees of any children who have been enrolled in the elementary grades. Such procedure would be contrary to our policy outlined above and would involve us all over Canada with other school boards.\n\nHowever, it is evident from the correspondence that he promised the Prince Rupert Board and unfortunately we paid the two vouchers mentioned above without checking on them. Under these circumstances, it has been decided to pay the fees for the current academic year only, but we will not be responsible for such fees after the end of June, 1947.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nChief Treasury Officer, Department of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nReference cheque No. B-22-R 037134 of April 22nd, 1947, being accountable advance to pay tuition fees for Indian Children attending High School in Prince Rupert, B.C. We would appreciate having a break down of this Departmental advance as to the pupils concerned and the amount allotted for each pupil.\n\nF. Earl Anfield.\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour File 103-168 (ETL)\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of May 17th and copy of report received from Mr. C.A.F. Clark who is enroute to the Yukon, you will by now have received my letter of May 12th and School Inspector Tevey's memorandum of May 9th in connection with the attendance of Indian children at Provincial white schools in the Prince Rupert district.\n\nIt is considered that the question of responsibility in these cases should be confined to Indian children attending elementary schools at the present time as the Department is allowing tuition fees for Indian children attending high schools regardless of the circumstances with respect to their residence in the Municipality.\n\nD.

In general, the High School children have done fairly well, most of them have been promoted and most of them intend to continue their studies this fall. At the Elementary Schools, in general, the children who have attended at all regularly have made marked and satisfactory progress. Where the parents fail to cooperate and seeing that their children attend on time all the time, the results have been as disheartening for teacher and School Board, as they are to teachers and the Department in our day schools in the village.\n\nF.

Transportation for the year would roughly be about $50.\n\nAccording to my estimation, as outlined above, the total amount required to cover my year at Normal School will come to approximately $652.\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nAugust 1st, 1947.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C., Vancouver.\n\nRe your O-11-2 of July 29th, 1947, dealing with an application from Leonard D. Leighton for tuition assistance to enable him to enter Normal School in Vancouver this fall.\n\nThis Metlakatla Indian has completed his degree as L. Th. at the Anglican Theological College, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nIn view of the desperate shortage of teachers for the Indian schools, it is recommended that he be given every encouragement to secure his teaching certificate and a grant of $500.00 is requested to that end, on the condition that he agree to teach at Indian schools for at least two years. The $500.00 will put him safely through to the end of the fiscal year, following which a further grant could be applied for if indicated.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\n\nP.S. It is presumed the med. can be done when L. D. arrives in Vancouver for the summer.\nIndian Affairs Branch. - #2.  \nAugust 6, 1947.\n\nIt is recommended that Mr. Leighton be given an opportunity of teaching in one of our Indian Day Schools for a year.\n\nI would appreciate hearing from you so that I may discuss the matter further with him.\n\nD. M. MacKay,  \nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI have to refer to the application for a grant of $500.00 to enable Leonard D. Leighton of the Metlakatla Band to attend Normal School during the 1947-48 academic year, and letters in support of this application from Mr. Indian Agent Anfield and the applicant.\n\nMr. Leighton has completed his Junior Matriculation and in April of this year received a degree of L.Th. from the Anglican Theological College, Vancouver, B.C., after four years of training at that institution. The church authorities apparently expected that he would be ordained following his graduation and gave him assistance towards his training in theology. It now appears that he does not intend to enter the ministry.\n\nIn view of the lack of stability shown in the abandoning of his plan to enter the ministry after four years' training and without giving it any definite trial, it is felt that the Department would hesitate to approve the amount of $500.00. An alternative might be to employ Mr. Leighton for a year as teacher in one of the Indian Day Schools. This should enable him to save something and make a larger contribution towards his training. He has had several weeks' teaching at the St. Cyprian Indian Residential school at Brocket, Alberta. Inspector Davey believes he would be suitable for one of the schools either in the Skeena or Queen Charlotte Agencies where we are having difficulty in securing teachers. Mr. Leighton's home is in this area and such a position would be attractive to him.\nIndian Affairs Branch. - #2.  \nAugust 6, 1947.\n\nIt is recommended that Mr. Leighton be given an opportunity of teaching in one of our Indian Day Schools for a year.\n\nI would appreciate hearing from you so that I may discuss the matter further with him.\n\nD.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nAttached please find application and medical report on Gloria Morven, applicant for a grant of $375.00 to enable her to continue her High School education in Prince Rupert. We shall be able to place her at the Salvation Army Hostel where she will be well cared for. Her father is dead and her mother has made a real effort to put up her share of the cost. In connection with these girls I would quote from a report of Rev. S.J. Wickens of Alert Bay Indian Residential School, who comments on their remaining in a boarding school as follows:\n\n\"I am strongly of the opinion, however, that they should not return to this School to continue their studies, even though the Superior School in the village will be teaching Grade 9 and 10 work. I think it is generally believed that it is to the advantage of such young people that they should meet the challenge of High School life separate from the restraining influence to which necessarily our younger children are subject. Obviously we have to expect them to observe the same discipline and regimentation to which the whole School has to adhere. If they are to learn poise and self-discipline, they should certainly be free from the restraint we have to impose on juveniles.\n\nI therefore urge these young people should be given an opportunity to attend High School in Prince Rupert, and I trust you may be able to make early arrangements with their parents and the Department that they may continue their studies which they have shown through their past industry they deserve to do. I have spoken to these pupils and they fully understand the point of view I am expressing to you. I trust you will do your very best to give them a chance to go on to further studies.\"\nI agree with the Rev. Principal and as I believe Gloria wishes to train as a nurse, endorse her application and if approved request a grant payable to Indian Agency Trust Account.\n\nF.

She suddenly became very un-\nhappy and inspite of every effort by this office and also\nher own Agent, Mr. Boys, she left Prince Rupert and went back\nto her mother, later obtaining employment in the Smithers\nHospital.\n\nShe was a very large girl for her age and in addition\nwas seriously retarded as to Grade. It is my opinion from\ndiscussion with the Principal and teachers involved that she\ndeveloped a violent inferiority complex. Most of the pupils\nin her class would be about half her size. I held the funds\nhoping that she might change her mind after Christmas.\n\nMary turned in all her text books and school supplies\npurchased and these have been placed in our school stock cup-\nboard and are available for other pupils in future. There\nwill be no loss from this purchase. A copy of this letter\nis being forwarded to Mr. Boys for his information.\n\nF. Earl Anfield.\nIndian Agent.\n\ncc. J. V.

Hyndman of the Provincial Department of Education.\n\nThere were 38 pupils on the roll, all of whom were of Indian or mixed origin. Of this number, there were 18 of Indian status, one of whom was absent due to illness.\n\nThere was a very happy atmosphere in the classroom and the pupils appeared to be making excellent progress. Last year separate schools were in operation at this point and I was fortunate in being able to compare attendance records for this year with that of last and previous years. The improvement in this respect was most striking. In the corresponding week last year, the number of Indian pupils attending our school was 7 and on going back through the register to the 1944-45 academic year, I noted that for no quarter did the average attendance of our pupils reach 14 although as many as 22 had been enrolled. In the present year, the average attendance has been well over 90%.\n\nThe attendance has so far exceeded our expectations and the Provincial authorities find it necessary to operate another room next year.\n\nR.

He states that he will be in a position to put up a minimum of $300.00 towards his expenses, the full amount of which he does not know but he asks if the Department by means of a grant or even a loan would make available the balance required. I heartily recommend this application. I do not know exactly how much extra would be required to put Mr. Leighton through the Normal School but perhaps Mr. School Inspector Davey could supply this information.\n\nJ.V. Boys,\nIndian agent.\n\nJVB/MHC.\n\nCopy to: Mr. School Inspector Davey\nMr. Indian Agent, Anfield, Prince Rupert.\nReference Mr. Indian Agent Boys' letter of May 5th, 1948, file 3-11-2 (151), re Leonard Leighton. I would endorse a grant to enable this young man to attend Normal School this winter. I believe that a grant of $400.00 plus what he himself can put up should be ample for his needs and would recommend that this sum be made available on the understanding that following the conclusion of his course he agrees in writing to teach in an Indian Day School for at least three years.\n\nF. Earl Anfield.\nIndian Agent.\n\ncc. J. V. Boys, Esq.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMay 25, 1948\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nTo: The Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nFrom: The District School Inspector.\n\nRe: Application for tuition grant\nLeonard D. Leighton\n\nI refer to the letter of Mr. Indian Agent Anfield dated May 10th concerning the above. It will be noted that Mr. Leighton has done satisfactory work at the Kispiox School and that he is prepared to contribute $300.00 towards the cost of his course. It is also to be noted that at the present time Mr. Leighton is receiving a salary of only $1000.00 per year and consequently his contribution represents a definite effort on his part.\n\nThe following is a statement of the fixed charges in connection with this course:\n\n| Fees | $57.00 |\n|------|--------|\n| Board | 450.00 |\n| Books | 25.00 |\n\n$532.00\n\nYou will note that I have included $450.00 for board. This figure is based upon the amount which we have had to pay in at least one case to accommodate an Indian pupil attending high school in Vancouver and I anticipate that Mr. Leighton will be fortunate if he secures board and lodging for as low as that amount.\n\nNothing has been included for incidental expenses such as laundry, transportation either to Vancouver and return or for car fare while attending the Normal School. Mr. Leighton will only be able to keep under a figure of $700.00 by exercising extreme care. I would recommend a grant of $400.00 to Mr. Leighton.\n\nR.F. Davey,\nDist. School Inspector.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Neary's letter of August 12th, 1947 (file 103-168 WT1) and previous correspondence regarding the application of Leonard D. Leighton of the Metlakatla Band for a tuition grant for academic year 1947-48. Following this correspondence Mr. Leighton was assigned as teacher of the junior room, Kispiox Indian Day School. He has now requested a grant to enable him to attend Normal School this coming winter, reference Mr. Boys' letter of May 5th and Mr. Anfield's letter of May 16th attached. District School Inspector Davey's memorandum of May 6th in this connection is enclosed and I concur in his recommendation that the Department approve a grant of $400 to Mr. Leighton.\n\n-S. Carmell,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nJune 4, 1948.\n\nAir Mail\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 1st instant, file 1-41-2, with reference to Leonard D. Leighton, of the Metlakatla Band.\n\nIt is noted that he wishes to attend normal school and the cost of the course will be $700.00 of which amount Leighton is prepared to pay $300.00.\n\nIn view of the above the Department is prepared to allow him a tuition grant of $400.00 for the academic year 1948-49.\n\nBernard F.

Earl Anfield,\nIndian Supt. Prince Rupert, B.C.\n\nRe file No. 2-25-LG-168\n\nDear Mr. Anfield;\n\nLawrence G. Garner, who attended this School in Grade 10 last year, completed his course with the exception of the practical examination in metal work.\n\nYou mentioned that there was some possibility of his becoming an apprentice under the Provincial Government Apprenticeship Act. As he has the ability, I would recommend that if possible, this idea be implemented. I believe that he would be more use to himself and community learning a trade than he would be in school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) A.M. Hurst\n\nA.M. Hurst\nPrincipal.\nW.S. Arneil, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nFederal Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Lawrence Garner\n\nFurther to my letter of Sept. 16, 1948, enclosed please find application for grant, medical certificate, school report and copies of letter from Principal of Booth Memorial High School re this lad, all of which omitted in error from my last letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nSuperintendent,\nSkeena River Agency\nW.S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Lawrence Garner, Port Simpson, B.C.\n\nThe above named lad, born April 1931, attended the Booth Memorial High School, this city for the past two years. He is ready to go into Grade XI, having earned 23 credits, with one subject, Metalwork incomplete; due to his having left school before the final exam in this subject. Lawrence is a very fine lad, of good character and undoubted intelligence. He is a fine physical specimen and has proved most adept at woodwork, mathematics and science. I had a long talk with his instructors about his future and they and the Principal strongly concur with Lawrence's own desire to be apprenticed as a journeyman boat builder, whilst continuing to take credits in his high school work by correspondence under the supervision of the local High School.\n\nI have today had a long interview with Mr. Ted Ivay, Inspector of the Apprenticeship Division of the Provincial Government of B.C. and Mr. McLean of McLean's Shipyard of this city. The latter is willing to take the boy as an apprentice under the Act, particulars of which I am asking the Vancouver office of the Department to forward to you.\n\nLawrence is anxious to learn a trade, in preference to finishing his High School graduation course. His mother is a widow and cannot contribute much to his support as she has other children to raise. His father was a First World War overseas veteran who later died. Lawrence has discussed his future with me at some length. He would be nineteen when he completes High School Graduation and would still be without a trade. Under an apprenticeship he would learn and earn and if the Department could help him for the first year or so, he could be on his own and able\nto help support his mother within 2 years, at the same time learning a worthwhile trade. There is a desperate shortage of journeymen boat builders and if the lad made good, he would have an assured livelihood and would be able to carry out his stated interest of moving his mother from the reserve to a home in Prince Rupert.\n\nYou will note that his wages under the apprenticeship contract will be approximately 27% of the journeymans wage of $1.27\u00bd hour for an 8 hour day or maximum 40 hour week. This, if employment was constant, would give him an assured wage of $55.00 a month, less income tax, hospital and unemployment insurance etc. Employment may not be constant; he will have to feed and clothe himself, buy books and tools and try and give his mother a few dollars a month as well.\n\nIt is therefore recommended:\n(a) that this boy be allowed to transfer his courses from High School Graduation to a contract apprenticeship of 4 years, at McLeans Shipyard, Prince Rupert.\n(b) that he be assisted for the 1st year with a Tuition grant of $360.00 only, and that the apprenticeship be further reviewed in a years time.\n\nMedical exam forms and application for grant are attached herewith, also his High School report card.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Superintendent,\nSkeena River Agency.\n\nFEA/g1\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Lawrence Garner - Port Simpson Band\n\nI am enclosing Supt. Anfield's letter of September 18th and enclosures referred to therein which were subsequently received, together with a copy of the Provincial Apprenticeship Act, contract of apprenticeship forms, etc., in connection with a proposed grant of $360 to the above named to enable him to become a journeymen boat builder through apprenticeship to the McLean's Shipyards, Prince Rupert.\n\nThe proposal is somewhat unusual but in the case of this boy I think it is fairly obvious that the training he will receive will be of greater value than academic training or technical training at a Provincial School and the financial assistance required from the Department will be less. I would recommend that Garner be assisted for one year with a grant of $360 and that his apprenticeship be further reviewed in a year's time.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOctober 22, 1948.\n\nMr. F.E.

Anfield,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nWe are in receipt of your Credit Voucher No. 172 in connection with the advance of $1,750.00 forwarded to you to pay tuition grants for children from the Skeena River Agency attending secondary school.\n\nAttached to your Voucher is an account from Gordon and Anderson, covering 2 3' mattresses at a cost of $32.31. Please let me know why you apparently considered it necessary to purchase these.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nMarch 7th, 1949.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources\nOttawa.\n\nRe Credit Voucher #172, $1,750.00, tuition grants. We pay only $45.00 a month for board and room for these High School boys. The regular rate for board and room in Prince Rupert is $50.00 or more. I found that these boys were sleeping on an old double bed with an old mattress not fit for use. The landlady stated she was unable to buy mattresses and single beds unless we raised the rates to at least $50.00 a month. I considered it cheaper to buy the mattresses to go with two single beds which we had in our storage from War Assets stock. This equipment will remain the property of the Department. I later changed the home for these lads and moved the beds and mattresses to the new domicile, where they are much happier.\n\nSgd. E. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nD.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe your 42168-3 (E) of February 28, 1949, the list attached to your letter has been checked and the Department is advised as follows:\n\n#9 ADAMS, Percy, age 18, Grade X, removed from School for health reasons October 1948.\n\n#10 MORVEN, Louise Pearl, age 16, Grade X, taken out of school by parents, as mother ill and needed the girl. She did not attend High School in the academic year 1948-49.\n\n#30 Correspondence course provided for Selina DIXON of Skidgate Band, Queen Charlotte Island Agency. This girl attends the Fort Edward Day School, is age 14 and is doing Grade 7.\n\n#31 Correspondence Course provided for Marjorie CLAYTON, Kincolith Band, this Agency, attending the Kincolith Indian Day School. She is 16 years of age and in Grade 8.\n\nGeneral: I take it that your list refers only to Indians of this Agency attending Provincial Schools with Departmental assistance. You are doubtless aware that in Prince Rupert there are 39 Indian children attending city elementary schools without cost to the Department. They are from this and other Agencies.\n\nF. Earl Anfield.\nIndian Superintendent.\nMarch 28, 1949.\n\nMr. F.E. Anfield,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nSkeena Agency - Tuition Grants\n\nWe have received your letter of March 10 and recorded the information contained therein. With reference to the last paragraph, we wish to notify you that we are interested in all Indian children attending provincial or private schools regardless of whether or not they are receiving Departmental assistance. We would, therefore, appreciate it if you would provide us with a list of the 39 Indian children attending city elementary schools in Prince Rupert. In each case, please designate the name of the school, the grade, the name of the child, the age on September 1, 1948, and the agency to which the child belongs.\n\nBernard F.

I attach herewith her school report which shows that she is promoted to Grade 11 in the subjects passed through the year.\n\nIn a letter to Mrs. Mabel Morven under date of July 8th, 1949, copy of which was forwarded to you, I informed this girl's mother that she should not expect assistance from the Department in view of her record during the year.\n\nThis record has been the subject of considerable investigation and also of several interviews with her mother and other interested Natives as a result of which I am now satisfied that part of the cause of this girl's academic recession last year was due to causes outside of her control. I have discussed her case with the school officials who are of the opinion that under different conditions, Gloria would do alright. She has the intelligence to go ahead as is evidenced by her Grade 9 report in which year she gained 31 credits, 3 more than the required 28. Last year Gloria was at the Salvation Army Hostel where I have now discovered she was the butt of an inter-tribal feud plus a religious problem as between her and the Salvation Army officials. It is my opinion that if she could be placed elsewhere she would make a satisfactory adjustment.\n\nTo this end I am arranging for her to stay with an Uncle and Aunt at Port Edward this winter. They offer her a home if the Department will assist with school fees, books and transportation costs by bus. I have had a long talk\nwith Gloria and believe that she has reached a definite conclusion that under the proposed setup she will make good and proceed to Grade II. She has the ability to make a useful school teacher and I believe that we should not stand in the way of her possible success in this endeavour.\n\nIt should be remembered in this case that this girl's father is dead and her mother's ability to earn is limited, by the fact that she is endeavoring to support three children.\n\nThe grant of $255.00 is made up of $150.00 for fees, $25.00 for books and $80.00 for bus transportation. The grant is recommended and the Department's instructions will be appreciated.\n\nF.

It will be noted that Mr. Anfield makes a strong plea for the continuation of this grant at a lower rate and that he attributes her failure to the environment in which she was living. However Miss Morven's grade 9 report was only fairly satisfactory.\n\nIn view of these circumstances I cannot recommend a continuation of a grant to enable this student to take the academic course which she has been following.\n\nW.S.

He is a bright lad who would have gone further at an earlier age if it had been possible for him to attend day school more regularly. His parents are employed at a cannery for most of the year and Roderick has not until his admission to residential school had a very satisfactory school career. I have discussed him with Principal Hives and Miss Findlay who taught him last year, and both recommend that he be given an opportunity to go on with his high school studies. His parents are placing with us their share of his tuition costs which is made up as follows:\n\n| Item                | Cost   |\n|---------------------|--------|\n| School fees         | $150.00|\n| Books               | $25.00 |\n| Board and room 10 mos. @ $5.00 | $450.00 |\n\nTotal: $625.00\n\nHe has passed the necessary medical examination and the grant is recommended.\n\nF.

Parents and guardians are advised to read carefully this part of the report, and to discuss matters pertaining with the teachers to cure, wherever necessary, the defects of their children. If an item is unchecked, it is because the teacher has not sufficient facts to make a definite judgment or because the item does not apply to the child at his present stage of development.\n\n### OUR INDIAN SCHOOLS ENCOURAGE EACH PUPIL TO LEARN\n\n|                  | FALL | WINTER | SPRING | FINAL |\n|------------------|------|--------|--------|-------|\n| **1.

I note that the Department is prepared to allow the Tuition Grant for the above-mentioned pupil to enable her to continue her studies at the Booth Memorial High School.\n\nAs suggested in Mr. Doucet's letter, I have asked Mr. Anfield to keep as close check on this girl's progress as possible. Mr. Anfield reports that the difficulty last year at the Prince Rupert hostel was encountered for the first time and was likely due to changes in the administrative staff.

He is simply unable to accommodate all the children who the Superintendents are endeavouring to enrol in the St. George's Residential School.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, giving an estimate of the cost of the uniforms, clothing and incidental expenses that will be required by Jessie Walker and Margaret McIntyre, pupils of the St. George's Indian Residential School, who will enter the Moosejaw Hospital for a course in nursing at the beginning of September, next.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will allow a grant of $125 for each of these girls towards their hospital outfits and incidental expenses for the first four months of their course. A cheque in payment of this grant will be drawn in favour of each of the girls and forwarded to you when you consider it timely to request same. Our funds this year are extremely limited, and this is the full amount that can be provided to assist these girls.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A. R. Lett,\nPrincipal, Indian Residential School,\nLytton, B.C.\nMr. C. C. Perry,\nActing Commissioner,\nIndian Office,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Perry:\n\nI am writing on behalf of Williamson Walkem, pupil #680, Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, who matriculated from Chilliwack High School a year ago.\n\nAt a conference on his case at which were present Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn, Mr. Inspector Barry and the Rev. Principal Lett, he was advised to take his Senior Matriculation at Chilliwack High School, preceding Normal training. He failed to make his year and cannot repeat it at Chilliwack as the Trustees decided not to continue the classes for Senior Matriculation work this year. This places Walkem in a difficult position.\n\nI received a letter a few days ago from Mr. Indian Agent Barber of Merritt, inclosing one from C. Walkem of Spences Bridge, father of the boy, both anxiously inquiring what could be done. Upon receipt of a letter from Capt. Barry which, on account of the probably difficulty of securing a suitable position even if he secured his teacher's certificate, discarded the idea of Normal training, I sent for Walkem to come to see me and talk the matter over concerning his future. He is anxious to repeat the year at the University of British Columbia, assuring me his Father and Brother could and would help him to the extent of $250.00. I would recommend the Department of Indian Affairs make a grant of $250.00. With care he can get through the year on $500.00 including fees, board, and other expenses. I would favor his repeating the year because I believe he will make good. He is not the quiet student Percy Gladstone was but he is a plodder with a great deal of character. He lost no time last year but he is somewhat handicapped by his English, which is apt to be wondered at. His Mother is absolutely illiterate. His father has very little and it is greatly to the credit of this quiet and unassuming Indian boy that he has the ambition to make something of himself. If another trial is not provided for him the affect upon the students who could take further training will be discouraging.\n\nSince the Indians met some years ago, as you will remember, the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, Hon. Mr. Stewart, and the Deputy Minister, the matter of advancing training was agreed upon and the manner in which the Department has fulfilled such undertaking is highly creditable, for if ever a race, dependent upon any Government, had a chance to make good along educational lines, that race comprises the native tribes of British Columbia.\n\nLet me again say the boy is deeply in earnest and what I have written is in harmony with the wishes of the staff here and I feel sure that of his former Principal, Rev. A.R. Lett. I believe it would be a good investment on the part of the Department for many reasons to take this action, to make this grant on his behalf.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"G.H. Raley\"\n\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6491, file 42169-3, part 1)\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nOTTAWA\n\nCommissioner's Office\nP. O. Box 666.\n\n15/9/26523.\n\nVictoria, B.C., October 4, 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Raley:\n\nIn regard to Williamson Walkem: I am prepared to recommend that this boy be given a Technical High School Course at Vancouver, provided he can be admitted on his present qualifications; that his parents are able to meet one-half of his expenses in Vancouver as in other cases; and that he can be recommended for any particular Course that will be calculated to help him in after life.\n\nI could not recommend his admission to the University under circumstances mentioned in your letter of September 19th, ultimo; also in view of Inspector Barry's indisposition to recommend him for a teaching profession. I shall await your further observations.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nRev. G. H. Raley,\nPrincipal, Coqualeetza Residential School,\nSardis, B.C.\nSardis, B.C., October 12th, 1932.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nActing Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nBox 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Perry:\n\nIn further reference to your letter #15-9-26523 dated October 3rd, let me say I have been in communication with the Principal, Mr. Sinclair of the Technical School, Vancouver and also with Williamson Walkem. In regard to Mr. Sinclair I may say he is willing to admit Williamson into the school whenever he is ready. And I think Williamson sees the futility of attempting the teachers profession in view of the opinion of Captain Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools. Williamson has elected a vocational course in which he will be deeply interested and I feel sure successful. The course he selects is electrical engineering. He can be depended upon to make good. Personally I have every confidence in him and am writing to him today to be ready to proceed without delay to Vancouver the moment he hears from the Department.\n\nThe manner in which the officers of the Department are keeping faith with their intention to advance the interests of the native people by giving them advanced training wherever they show capability speaks volumes for the Department and in British Columbia is having a splendid influence on the minds and lives of the people who are the wards of the country.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"G. H. Raley\"\n\nPrincipal.\nSir:\n\nI beg to transmit herewith copies of three letters, dated September 19th, ultimo, October 4th, and 12th, instant, being correspondence between the Principal of Coghataetza Indian Residential School and this office in regard to the proposal to give pupil No.680, Williamson Walzem, an advanced educational training, either at B.C. University in preparation for the teaching profession, or at Vancouver Technical High School in preparation for a career in which a Technical Course would be helpful to him in after life.\n\nThe boy Walzem took his Entrance and Junior Matriculation at Chilliwack. He did not take Normal subjects, but tried Senior Matriculation at Chilliwack and failed totally, presumably through lack of essential home work. The Senior Matriculation class at Chilliwack High School has been done away with; and to qualify for Normal the student must either repeat his attempt at a Senior High School elsewhere or take First Year Arts in B.C. University or at Victoria College. The application was received and the boy was admitted to his entrance to either of these Courses. Moreover, the B.C. Education Department objected to the High School Course being taken in some other city; and the Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia\u2014Capt. Barry\u2014is not satisfied that this student, if allowed to take an advanced Course in preparation for the teaching profession, would ever make an efficient teacher. The Inspector felt that he might not be accepted at B.C. Normal School nor recommended for an Indian school.\n\nUnder the foregoing circumstances, it has been decided, following a full discussion had personally with the Reverend Principal prior to the date of my letter to him of October 4th, instant, to recommend that this boy be given the advantage of a Technical Course in electrical engineering at Vancouver Technical High School, the cost of which is estimated at about $500.00, one-half of which amount would have to be provided by the relatives of the boy, which it is understood they have undertaken to do.\n\nIt is therefore recommended that the Department be good enough to consider the matter and decide if this boy may be allowed to take the Course in electrical engineering at Vancouver Technical High School, for the academic year 1932-33 to which he can be admitted at once if approved by the Department. Perhaps the Department will be good enough to advise me by telegraph so that the necessary arrangements may be made for the boy's care at Vancouver.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6491, file 42169-3, part 1)\nOttawa, October 25, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 15/9/26618 of the 17th instant, enclosing copies of correspondence between the Principal of the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School and your office with reference to the providing of a grant towards the fees and other expenses of Williamson Walkem, an ex-pupil of the above named school, in order that he can take a technical course in electrical engineering at the Vancouver Technical High School.\n\nIn this connection I have to confirm the following night lettergram to you of today's date:\n\n\"Grant Two Hundred Fifty Dollars approved for Williamson Walkem to attend Technical School during present academic year.\"\n\nI may say, however, that the Department is in doubt as to whether this boy, from the educational qualifications which he possesses, would be able to take full advantage of the course. We are not aware as to the length of time it will take him to complete the course. However, in view of the recommendation of yourself and the Principal of the Coqualeetza Institute, the Department is allowing him to enter his name on the above. It is noted that the cost for the current year will be approximately $500. The above amount is all the Department can provide, and the balance of the cost must be met by this boy's parents.\n\nYou or the Principal of the Coqualeetza School should make the necessary arrangements to have him enter the Technical High School as soon as possible. It is also presumed that suitable arrangements will be made for boarding accommodation and for his proper oversight while he is continuing his studies.\n\nPayment of the grant allowed will be made in two installments - the first upon receipt of a voucher, in triplicate, properly certified, when considered timely to request same. The second instalment will be paid early in the new year. The above grant will be paid from B.C. Special Appropriation.\n\nI would request that at the end of the current school year a report be obtained from the Principal of the Technical School as to the progress this boy made in his studies, and same should be forwarded to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Mr. Raley reports that he is deserving of consideration and could proceed immediately and would be able to do his share financially. He has recommended that this opportunity be given to Wilson and has asked if I will hold the cheque until you have had an opportunity of approving or disapproving of this application.

Kindly be good enough to submit an official voucher to the Department for the sum of $250.00 for the above mentioned purpose and quote the Department's telegram of the 25th instant, received at this office today, as authority for the same. The voucher should be in your name in trust and the amount when received should be placed in a savings account for expenditure as required as you have similarly done in the case of other Indian boys attending the same school. Rev. Mr. Raley will no doubt be calling on you or writing you in this matter. It is desired that you be good enough to do what you can to help this boy through the important stage in his educational career.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nP/AC\n\nF.J.G. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 26th instant, Williamson Walkem arrived in Vancouver and called at the same boarding house as Cyril Mahone is staying and made arrangements to board there. Later in the day he called saying he had been to the Technical School and could not get the course which he wanted. Since then I have heard nothing from him. I advised the Department accordingly and also wrote Mr. Raley asking him to find out what the boy intended to do. If he has abandoned the idea of taking the course, I will return the remittance received from Ottawa. I did not see this boy.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"Fredk. J.C. Ball\"\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nB/HM.\n\nC.C. Perry, Esq.,\nAssistant Indian Commissioner for\nB.C., Victoria, B.C.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCommissioner's Office\nP. O. Box 666\nVictoria, B.C., September 22, 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Ball:\n\nThe Department has decided to allow a grant of $450.00 for the academic year 1932-33 to cover cost of board, fees, books, etc., for Cyril Mahone, pupil No. 418 at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, who will be taking a course immediately at the Vancouver Technical High School, the course being Course C, compulsory Indigenous selective science electricity. This boy belongs to the Clo-cose Band, West Coast Agency. His father, Luke Mahone, a former student, having been killed in the war, the Department holds a pension on behalf of this boy in Savings Account 4641 and proposes to pay one-half of this grant from that account and the remaining half from the B.C. Special Vote. The boy will board with Mrs. Hunter, whose address you have on file in connection with George Wilson of Bella Bella, who took a course at the same school and in looking over his file you will see that I paid for his board and other expenses from this fund as they were presented, by arrangement.\n\nI shall forward a voucher to the Department in your favor for the first half of this grant and the Department wishes a voucher for the balance sent in January next. I think it would be best to have the second voucher go from your office as you will have charge of the grant in trust, although I would be pleased to send it from here if you prefer. Of course, it will be necessary to obtain receipts for all expenditures, accounting for the advance, and forward same to the Department. I have requested Ray Mr. Raley to call on you on his next visit to Vancouver to discuss the arrangements for this boy's admission to school, board and other expenses to be charged to this account. I would suggest that you open a savings account so that the expenditure may be kept separate from your Agency bank account. That is what I did in the case of George Wilson.\n\nThe Department is anxious to give this boy a chance to make good and I hope that in asking you to undertake supervision of the foregoing details it will not unduly inconvenience you. I may say Mrs. Hunter was usually paid monthly in advance as long as the boy remained at school but she was not paid in full during the vacation period, but the full payment was resumed on the return of the pupil to school. I do not know whether or not Mr. Raley has seen Mrs. Hunter. You will have her address on file and I think her name is in the telephone book. No doubt she could come to the office and meet you and Mr. Raley in this connection. I have informed Mr. Raley that I will not send the voucher to Ottawa until after I hear from him or yourself on the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.J.C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nC. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6491, file 42169-3, part 1)\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 22nd regarding Cyril Mahone attending Technical School.\n\nI have already handled three similar cases, Mark and David White and Percy Gladstone.\n\nAs you have sent the first voucher to the Department for the first half of the grant, it would appear more regular for you to send for the second half of it.\n\nI do not think it necessary for Mr. Raley to call unless he wishes. It is a simple matter to make the necessary arrangements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"Fredk. J.C. Ball\"\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nB/DH\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAssistant Commissioner,\nBox 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to refer to Departmental letter No.103-169, dated October 25th, last, in which authority was given to arrange for the admission to the Technical High School at Vancouver of Indian pupil Williamson Walkem of Coqualeetza Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection, I beg to say that subsequent arrangements were made with Reverend Principal Raley and Mr. Agent Ball at Vancouver whereby these gentlemen were expected to come together at a convenient date and discuss all phases of the matter and to arrange the details regarding other matters. Copy of my letter dated October 26th addressed, respectively, to Mr. Agent Ball and Rev. G.H. Raley, are enclosed herewith. Subsequently each was also furnished with copy of the Department's letter dated October 25th above mentioned.\n\nIt is quite inconvenient as well as unnecessarily expensive for me to go to Vancouver every time a boy is to be admitted to the Technical School, and therefore it was hoped that the Principal and Agent Ball would be in good position to arrange all the details especially as to receipt of the Department's grant to be forwarded by the Agent in Vancouver and also because it is a fact that the Principal of Coqualeetza is frequently in Vancouver purchasing goods and otherwise transmitting business in connection with the School at which times it would be quite easy for the Agent and Principal to meet and discuss the matter of boys attending the Technical School.\n\nNot having heard anything further from the Agent or Principal as to what arrangements were made in Walkem's behalf, I wrote to the Agent on November 28th making inquiry. I received a letter from Mr. Agent Ball dated November 28th, ultimo, copy of this letter is being sent herewith. As a result of this latter I wrote Reverend Mr. Raley to know why the suggestions contained in my letter of October 26th had not been fruitful of good results, and I received reply to the effect that everything possible had been done by him in the matter.\n\nI am satisfied from further inquiry that Walkem had made up his mind to train for the teaching profession for which he could not be recommended by the Inspector of Schools and myself. He agreed to take a technical course but afterwards changed his mind, leaving us with the grant available and unused.\n\nI suggested to Principal Raley that Walkem be given another chance to consider what action he would take and in the meantime asked Agent Ball to hold the grant in abeyance as Walkem may be willing to take the course commencing in January.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nShould......\nShould Walkem decide not to go to the Technical School, the Department might be asked to transfer the grant for the benefit of another bright pupil\u2014Fred Wilson\u2014who was willing to take Walkem's place and who was strongly recommended by the Principal for this privilege.\n\nMr. Ball advised me on December 20th, that he had been instructed by the Department to return the cheque \"stating that they are in doubt in a number of cases where grants have been provided for young Indians to take courses in technical schools if they use the training received to any advantage.\" I hope the matter will be reconsidered and restated in the light of the Department's educational policy. It is felt that the time has arrived when there should be a meeting of such Church and Government officials who are most interested in the policies which bear upon the progressive education of the Indian youth of this Province. Such a convention was asked for by resolution of certain school principals held with a few of our officials in Vancouver about a year ago. We do not know what the Department thinks of these resolutions, but I would with such respect suggest that it be kept in view that it is most desirable that a meeting of the kind should be held for the purpose of discussing what phases of Indian educational advancement should be best recommended in British Columbia. I was exceedingly sorry to receive this letter from Agent Ball, and feel that the Agent acted with undue haste in disposing of the matter. Some patience and sympathy must be exercised if we are going to get the best results from our aids to Indians under the General Vote, particularly in regard to the progressive education of the more promising of the ex-pupils of Indian residential schools.\n\nI regret being under the impression that Mr. Agent Ball has not shown sufficiently sympathetic interest in the Indian pupils to be willing to go to any great inconvenience in regard to their advancement along technical lines. I believe the Department should find an earnest investigation among those best versed in Indian Affairs in British Columbia that the provision which has been made for the technical training of the Indian youth promises greater possibilities than any other phase of our aid system. It is the best step ever taken by the Department, in my opinion, for the furthering of the interests of Indian boys who leave school and face a world of realities in which training of this nature counts so much. Such training helps the Indians on their reserves as well as in the competitive fields of labor which their natural ambitions might explore under their right to live in the enjoyment of progressive Canadian citizenship towards which the Indians are becoming more and more inclined through primary training. What is the use of our school system if such a result cannot be achieved?\n\nIn addition to the case of Williamson Walkem there is another Indian boy for whom a Departmental grant was made. His name is Cyril Mahone (see authority of Departmental letter No.103-155 dated September 13th last.) In this case I wrote to Agent Ball on September 22nd, copy of my letter to him being enclosed here-with together with his reply dated September 23rd. The Agent's reply should be enough to assure any one that he means that he is on the wrong track if he thinks it unnecessary to discuss with the school principal the case and interests of any ambitious Indian boy who has sufficient snap to make something of his life. If the Agent could come down from his high horse and show a little more willingness...\nwillingness to bear with a few necessary inconveniences to himself whereby an Indian lad, unaccustomed to the ways of the city could be made to feel more serene in his new found environment, much more good might be accomplished than is at present the case.\n\nThe Department's letter as quoted by Mr. Agent Ball, if correct, is most disappointing, and I hope it is not the last decisive word on so vital a question. I feel that the Department may not be in possession of all the facts, hence my appeal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG. G. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, January 26th, 1933.\n\nSir,-\n\nIn a letter received from Assistant Commissioner Perry, the Department infers that he considers that Williamson Walkem, for whom we had promised a grant, was not given sufficient encouragement when he reached Vancouver. The Department has reviewed your letter of November 8th, last, and we have, also, received from Mr. Perry a copy of your letter to him of November 26th, but we are not exactly certain whether or not you saw Walkem when he was in Vancouver.\n\nIn cases such as this, the Department expects Indian Agents to discuss with the school principal the interests of any Indian boy who desires higher education and to continue his interest by giving every possible encouragement.\n\nPlease state if Walkem called at your office and what action you took to assist him in starting the course which he first desired to take.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I am writing to Mr. Agent Ball in connection with this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6491, file 42169-3, part 1)\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo with reference to Williamson Walkem.\n\nThis lad arrived here on a Sunday evening. I did not see him at any time but understand I called at this office on the following day when I was out of town and the stenographer directed me to the boarding house where he had made arrangements for him to stay. He called there and left his baggage, but returned later in the day and said he could not get the course he wanted at the Technical School and that it was useless for him to attend there. He then took his baggage and returned home. I did not have an opportunity of speaking to him but when I found he had left Vancouver I consulted Reverend Mr. Raley about him and he said he would get in touch with Walkem and let me know what he intended to do. Since then I have heard nothing from Mr. Raley until today, when he informed me that he had written three times and telegraphed once to Walkem who has never replied to any of these communications.\n\nMr. Raley now advises me that Walkem was working at cross purposes. He wanted to attend normal school and take up teaching as a career, but was disappointed in being unable to do so because he lacked training in two or three necessary subjects which the Coqualeetza School was unable to give him. Mr. Raley thinks that his visit to the Technical School was rather half-hearted, which would explain his sudden return home.\n\nMr. Raley advises me that he understands Walkem now wants to take the engineering course at the technical school and his letters and telegram were to try and arrange for him to attend the next term course.\n\nI should have been glad to do everything possible to assist Walkem, the same as I have done in a number of similar cases, but did not have the opportunity. I had no idea when he would arrive in Vancouver, but all arrangements were made ready to receive him both at the technical school and boarding house, and I can not quite see where there was any lack of encouragement in Vancouver as stated by Mr. Perry.\n\nMr. Raley is again trying to get in touch with Walkem and will advise me as to the result, when I will report further to you.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6491, file 42169-3, part 1)\nOttawa, February 9, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nAs you were informed in official letter of the 26th ultimo, the Department wrote Mr. Agent Ball with reference to Williamson Walkem, about whom you wrote in your communication of December 28th, last.\n\nEnclosed is a copy of Mr. Ball's letter, and it would appear that he did everything possible for Walkem.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

D. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMr. A.H. Barber,\nIndian Agent,\nMerritt,\n\nDear Mr. Barber-\n\nYou no doubt are aware of the fact that the school had a 100% pass in Provincial Examination. This includes the two Bent children with whom I am especially pleased as they both worked hard. I am anxious that Smith should get a year in Technical, which with his present woodwork training should be of great benefit to him. He should be given a year in Woodwork and Drafting as he is very good in both and will do his best.\n\nI have been in touch with Inspector Kyle of the Provincial Technical work and he has recommended the Trapp Tech. at New Westminster stating that the lad would receive more individual there than in the Vancouver School.\n\nWhen coming through last Saturday I saw the teachers of the Trapp School and they were very interested and said that if the boy came to them they certainly would give him every credit for his present training and would give him every attention individually.\n\nInspector Barry and Acting Commissioner Perry are in favour of giving the lad this advanced year and it remains now for yourself to recommend the suggestion to these gentlemen, and through them it will go on to the Department for consideration.\n\nPlease see Smith's parents and have their consent, so that there will be no hitch at home.\n\nThe cost for tuition and board would be about $400.00 adding another $100.00 to this for clothing and pocket money making $500.00 in all, which would have to be wholly carried by the Department, as the Bent Family I presume have no help to give.\n\nPlease let me know if there is any further information I can give you and trust you will give the above your favourable consideration. Smith is at home now and you can have him into the office for interview.\n\nSincerely\n\n(AR.LETT)\nPrincipal.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a copy of a letter received from the Rev. Mr. Lett, of the St. George's Indian Residential School, in regard to recommending that an Indian boy, Smith Bent, of this Agency, be given a year at Technical School at New Westminster.\n\nI have interviewed this boy, and he is very anxious to be sent to Technical School for one year, and I am sure that he would make the most of it. I therefore strongly recommend that the Department authorize this expenditure of approximately Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00), which is the cost given by Mr. Lett, and would appreciate very much if you would take the matter up with the Inspector of Schools, and the Department, with your recommendation, if at all possible.\n\nThe Technical School, I understand, opens on Sept. 6th. Therefore I would be pleased to be advised as early as possible as to the views of the Department. It is unfortunate that Mr. Lett's letter arrived here during my absence on vacation leave, as it does not give very much time to take the matter up with the Department. Though, as Mr. Lett has apparently already mentioned the matter to yourself and Mr. Barry, possibly you are in a position to advise me if there is a possibility of the Department sanctioning this boy going to the Technical School.\n\nI would appreciate an early reply.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n\"Alfred H. Barber\"\nIndian Agent.\n\nAHB/ES\n\nChas. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nVictoria, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith copy of a letter dated August 30th, ultimo, received from Mr. Barber, of Nicola Agency, together with copy of the enclosure mentioned, being a letter received by Mr. Barber from Rev. A.R. Lett, Principal of St. George's Indian Residential School at Lytton, dated August 8th, these letters being in advocacy of the proposal that the Department should provide a grant of $500.00, if possible, to meet the expense of sending Smith Bent, pupil of the school who has passed his Entrance Examination, to the Trapp Technical School at New Westminster, B.C., for a year's tuition. I beg to say, I have discussed the matter with the Inspector of Indian Schools, Capt. G.H. Barry, who states that the Trapp Technical School at New Westminster is a Provincial institution similar to the Vancouver Technical High School except that the Trapp School also provides a three-year High School Course in addition to the Technical training. Inspector Barry strongly advocates the assistance asked for in behalf of this pupil. It is rather unfortunate that the matter has been left to the last minute before making recommendation, and prompt action is necessary if the boy is to be admitted to the Trapp School for the session which opens about September 6th, instant. I shall thank the Department to be good enough to consider the representations made by Principal Lett and Indian Agent Barber and advise me by return so that if today's admission is approved the necessary preliminary arrangement can be made at once. Inspector Barry informs me that he is advised by Principal Lett that suitable accommodation for the boy's board can be obtained at New Westminster. I may say I am in favor of sending promising boys from the Residential Schools to efficient Technical Schools for training provided these pupils are recommended by the School Principal, the Inspector of Indian Schools and the Indian Agent, and for this reason would recommend that the boy Smith Bent be afforded the opportunity which he is seeking of taking a suitable Technical Course in woodcraft and drawing for which he appears to be particularly adapted.\n\nOn the other hand should the Department feel that this matter is being unduly rushed and that further data is required, further particulars could be sought for the Department's information but immediate session would in this case be lost and there would be somewhat of a setback to this boy's ambitions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

He is also being requested to have Mr. Agent Daunt give Smith Bent some personal supervision, in order that the boy may take full advantage of the opportunity given him.\n\nIf, in future, you recommend any pupil for similar assistance, the Department would appreciate your advising us a month or two before the schools re-open, in order that the matter may receive more careful consideration and to allow time for any correspondence that might be necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It will be in order for you to allow a small amount for pocket money.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. O'N. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster,\nB.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge, with thanks, receipt of Departmental letter dated September 9th, instant, No.103-169, in regard to the proposed admission of Smith Bent, an Indian pupil of the St. George's Indian Residential School at Lytton, B.C., to the Trapp Technical School at New Westminster for a year's tuition for which purpose a grant of $500.00 has been made by the Department for which I should state those interested in this boy's welfare are duly grateful to the Department. I have been in touch with Mr. Agent Daunt, Mr. Agent Barber (Nicola) and the Rev. Principal Lett, with whose co-operation arrangements have been made for the boy's admission to school as well as obtaining for him a suitable place to room and board. A. Mrs. Huddleston, of 464 Kelly Street, New Westminster, will, it is understood, take the boy as a boarder at the rate of $30.00 per month, laundry to be additional, which appears to be quite reasonable, an advantage being also that the quarters were chosen by the Church authorities and are therefore satisfactory to them. Mr. Agent Daunt has conferred with Rev. Principal Lett and with the Principal of the Technical School and a discussion of the boy's training was had so that there should be no further difficulty in regard to the matter. Mr. Daunt will submit a voucher to the Department for such portion of the grant as he may consider necessary for present use as required and will make request for the balance in January as directed by the Department. I would therefore recommend that when Mr. Daunt's voucher is received the Department be good enough to send him the advance asked for as early as may be convenient.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP/AC\n\nG. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSIR:-\n\nWith reference to your communication dated the 5th instant, File No.103-169, in connection with Smith Bent from the Nicola Agency and ex-pupil of St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, B.C., who is being given a course embracing woodworking at the Trapp Technical School of this City.\n\nI beg to inform you that this youth has expressed his desire to take a Night School course in Motor Mechanics at the same School, and which will cost $7.50 for the six months' course. This will mean two nights a week instructions and the boy claims that he can manage the extra work without interfering with his present studies.\n\nIf the Department are prepared to countenance this extra cost, I would recommend it, as the knowledge gained thereby is likely to be of assistance to him in his future life.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O.N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 25, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, relative to the request of Smith Bent, an ex-pupil of the St. George's Indian Residential School, who is taking a course at Trapp Technical School, New Westminster, that a grant be provided to also assist him in taking a night school course in Motor Mechanics at the same school. It is noted that you state it will cost $7.50 for the six months' course.\n\nIf $7.50 is the total extra amount that will be required to cover fees and any text books that may be necessary, the Department would approve of the expenditure, provided, however, you are assured that the taking of this course will not interfere with his work in the course which he is taking, embracing woodworking. As you are aware, the Department is allowing a grant towards his board and other expenses, to the amount of $500. If only the sum of $7.50 is required for the six months' course at the night school, it might be possible to include same in the grant allowed for him in attending the Technical School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

He is well taken care of and I think we were very fortunate in getting him into such good surroundings.\n\nI allow him $5.00 a month pocket money, which should leave him a good deal more per week, after paying his carfare, than my own boys, going to High School, have to spend.\n\nThe Department, it is true, allow $500.00, but that does not mean that we are to expend the whole amount simply to teach this youth a trade or vocation and I personally think he is getting quite as much as is good for him now. Furthermore, it appears to me that when the Department go to such expense to provide training for an Indian youth, that the least his family can do is to make an effort towards his support. It is really too much to expect the Department to finance his board, education, clothing, pocket money and all expenses. The Department in the past has relieved the Indians of too much responsibility, which is probably one of the reasons why so many of them are shiftless now.\n\nI spoke to the Principal of the Trapp Technical School, upon the subject of changing his social studies to a wood-working period. This cannot be done, as these studies are an obligatory part of the course, and no exceptions can be made.\n\nPersonally, I do not think that Technical Schools, as they are run, form a satisfactory means of training Indian pupils in advanced craftsmanship, as a comparatively small portion of their time is devoted to the particular art they are desired to acquire.\n\nSmith Bent's periods at wood-working last term only covered the ground he had already been over at St. George's School before coming down here. It appears to me, therefore, that where it is desired to give boys special training in such subjects as wood-working, motor mechanics etc., it would be far better to apprentice or otherwise attach them to some shop where they would have more days' work due to their particular course, instead of two periods a week the Technical School schedule allows them. The academic portion of the Technical School class work is, of course, of no use to the Indians we desire to benefit, especially in cases where they are only getting one year.\n\nAnother advantage of this line of action would be that the Indian pupil could be kept more or less in his local environment and placed in some small country town, where he would not be so likely to become accustomed to the glamour of white lights, as in the City.\n\nThe boy is doing well, and his last report was extremely satisfactory, but just the same, I think he would have derived far more advantage from a year spent in some wood-working plant than he will obtain from his time at the Technical School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA.G.M. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nRev. A.R. Lett,\nPrincipal, St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, B.C.\nINDIAN OFFICE\nNEW WESTMINSTER\n\nJAN. 20, 1933\n\nMr. A. O'N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Daunt:\n\nI have a letter from Smith asking if he can change his boarding house as it is costing so much for street car fare. I am not at all anxious that he should make this change if it can be avoided as he evidently has a good place to stay and his landlady is evidently very good to him and is interested in him.\n\nI do not know what you have spent to date in connection with the lad's course of studies but would suggest that if it is possible at all to increase his monthly allowance and still stay within the grant, this should be done. However, if you feel this is impossible it would be well to get into touch with Mr. Douker, soliciting his help. Please do what you think best.\n\nSmith has also written about his period in social studies asking if he could perhaps take woodwork instead, if this can be arranged with the principal I think it would be a good move as Smith is not up in his social studies, taking for his entrance examinations art instead. There is no possibility of the boy taking any more government examinations and training is all that he is expected to have. Please get into touch with the principal regarding this matter.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA. R. Lett,\nPrincipal.\nSIR:\n\nI beg to forward you herewith, for your information, a communication received by me from Reverend A. R. Lett, Principal of St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, B.C., in connection with Smith Bent, who is attending the Trapp Technical School, in this City, together with a copy of my reply to him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O.N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEncs.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Mr. Lett:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated the 25th instant, with reference to Smith Bent. Student's car tickets for this youth are forty (40) for $1.00, good up until five o'clock, and as he is in School on an average of twenty-two (22) days a month, $1.00 practically covers his legitimate needs, he has, therefore, close on a $1.00 a week to provide extra transportation to night classes.\n\nIt appears to me that to supply him freely with money, would merely mean an inducement to shirk his studies. You must remember that we pay for his board, laundry, clothing and books, so the only legitimate expense he is called upon for, is the transportation above alluded to, and in view of the given figures, I fail to see how you can make out that this cost should be more than the $5.00 a month I am giving him.\n\nI would like to point out also, that my boys are in a different position to Smith Bent, and while they may not have much expenditure for carfare, they have social obligations that far exceed his.\n\nI am surprised at your attitude in the matter, as you must know that any youth turned loose in a City, with unlimited cash, is open to grave temptations.\n\nI am, however, forwarding your communication to the Department, and will be guided by their instructions, as to the amount of pocket money Smith is to receive.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nA.O.N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nReverend A.R. Lett,\nPrincipal, St. George's Indian Residential School,\nLytton, B.C.\nMr. Daunt\nIndian Agent\nNew Westminster.\n\nDear Mr. Daunt,\n\nI do not wish to go into your letter in detail but wish you would consider again the amt of $5.00 as a monthly allowance for Smith. I think a little figuring will show you that if he travels by street car to and from his school it would take more than the stated sum to cover this expense so that it would seem he is obliged to spend some time walking which walking time he would very much like to spend in study. There should be no question of extravagance taken into consideration as the lad merely asked for a little greater monthly allowance in order that he might make better use of his time. If it is therefore possible without overstepping try and consider his needs.\n\nWhen in the city last I did take up the fact that Smith could take more advanced work in woodwork and drafting and he told me at Christmas that this was forthcoming, and I expect this is now being done. You might make enquiries to this effect if you will and let me know.\n\nAs you live in the centre of the city I do not think a comparison should be made between your own Boys and Smith.\n\nYou have touched up your views a bit but let me ask if you have ever spent some of your off time in putting these into writing when they could be compared with others especially men like myself whose heart and soul bleeds for these peoples.\n\nAs for the Lads parents being able to offer any assistance I do not think they readily can but if you would wish further information in this regard write Mr. Barber at Merritt.\n\nAlso I am asking for on behalf of the Lad and at his own request a little extra consideration in order that he might make better use of his time. I shall be glad to hear from Smith that you have been able to do so.\n\nI appreciate the Principal's inability to rearrange the study hour or period.\n\nSince the Dept. has no schools wherein these Boys can receive training for which they are qualified then surely it remains for you and I to do the best possible with the confidence the Dept. has placed in us and also for the Boy concerned. It is not the saving of a few poultry dollars but the training of a Boy who with it may not only take care of himself but be an example to many others of his race.\n\nYours very sincerely\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nSIR:-\n\nWith further reference to my letter of January 24th, under cover of which I forwarded you a communication received from the Reverend A.R. Lett, Principal of St. George's Indian Residential School, in connection with Smith Bent, Indian pupil of the Nicola Agency, attending the Trapp Technical School of this City.\n\nI now beg to enclose herewith, a further letter in this connection, and I shall be much obliged if you will inform me whether it is your desire that I increase the issue of pocket money to this youth.\n\nSo far as the contents of the letter are concerned, I would like to point out that Smith Bent can purchase forty (40) student's street car tickets for $1.00. As he attends school about average on twenty-two (22) days per month, this expenditure practically clears his necessity in attending his usual classes while leaving him the sum of $4.00 in hand. On two nights a week, however, he attends extra classes for motor mechanics, but I consider the $4.00 is ample to cover this extra expenditure, as we have provided him with clothes and books and pay his laundry with his board. There is, therefore, nothing for him to spend the money on, and I personally think he is getting sufficient. Any youth turned loose in a city, will find what he has in his pocket, and an Indian, even though he is a good one like Smith, is certainly no better than a white boy in this respect.\n\nIn my view, we would not be assisting Smith in his studies, as indicated by Reverend Mr. Lett, in giving him any more spending money, but on the contrary we would be giving him the means to neglect his studies. I may, however, be wrong, and I shall be very much obliged if you will let me have your instructions at your early convenience.\n\nI know Indians practically, for the last twenty-one years in the service of the Department and for a considerable time before that, and if I am to be in charge of this youth, while he is down here, I do not think that Reverend Mr. Lett should interfere on the representations of the Indian.\n\nReverend Mr. Lett does not seem to appreciate that City Technical Schools have to be run according to standard rules and regulations, and that when a boy enters a class, he must stay with that class and follow its work, he cannot be given special tuition. The Authorities will not do this for the children of City taxpayers, and naturally they will not do it for Indians from outside points. I have spoken to the Principal of the Technical School and he has pointed this out to me.\n\nEnclos.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G.M.

Under these circumstances it is felt that, if he wishes any advice, he should apply only to Mr. Daunt.\n\nIf Smith Bent again writes to you, you should immediately inform him that he must be guided by Mr. Daunt's advice. By following this line of action, the Department considers that the best results will be secured.\n\nThe amount now allowed Smith Bent for pocket money is considered sufficient but, if circumstances at any time warrant any additional amount, the Department considers that the matter may be safely left to Mr. Daunt's judgment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This is a reasonable request from the lad as he lives some three miles away from school and his street car fare is costing him 85\u00a2 per week.\n\nI might say that it was through the advice of Mr. Daunt's office that the boy wrote to me asking for advice. I then asked Mr. Daunt to consider his requests. However while I do not feel the boy received a real sympathetic hearing, I will advise Smith Bent to be governed entirely by Mr. Daunt. It does seem as though the boy should be allowed to seek advice from one who has been responsible for his care for a great number of years and cutting off this source is not very encouraging.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\nA.

We have no record of having received your vouchers of May 12th and 18th, viz., voucher No.139, board of Smith Bent May 12 - June 12/34, for $35.00, and voucher No.140 for incidentals $5.00. From your statement it is observed that you received a refund of $11.50 from Mrs. Huddleston for board June 21-30. This should have been sent to the Department.\n\nKindly send the above mentioned vouchers without delay, and, since it is the close of our fiscal year, you may deduct the refund of $11.50 from your voucher No.139. The total of your two vouchers, less the deduction, will be $28.50, the amount shown as outstanding.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH.C. Allen\nRepresentative of the Treasury.\n\nA.O.N. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nSIR:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter, File No. 103-169, of the 20th instant, in which you show a balance against me of $28.50, in connection with Advances made for the tuition of Smith Bent.\n\nUnder date of April 18th, I mailed you a full statement of this account from the beginning, from which you will doubtless have seen that the difference is caused by your failure to credit me with vouchers 139 and 140 in May 1934, amounting to $5.00 and $5.00 respectively, and you also failed to charge me with $11.50, refund of board collected by me from Mrs. Huddleston in June, when Smith Bent left for home before the period for which we had paid expired. This $40.00, less the $11.50 makes your difference of $28.50.\n\nThese items were all shown on the statement which accompanied the vouchers monthly, but apparently you took no notice of it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O.N.

Barber,\nIndian Agent,\nMERRITT B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Barber,\n\nI have Edith Walkem, Pupil No.0122 of this School, who is in her Junior Matriculation year and is a girl who intends to proceed with her studies to Senior Matric and then on to Normal. I would recommend her to you for any assistance she may need in this regard.\n\nHer family, as you know, for Indians are very much better in a position to help her than many white families but, being Indians, (and especially from this family the expectation that the Dept. should undertake full liability) I do not expect she will receive help to any great extent from this source. You may, however, be able to induce from them some assistance for the girl.\n\nIn conversation with Edith, she is very anxious that, if possible, she should, at least to a degree, be found sufficient employment to enable her to finance her own advanced education, which is a very admirable inclination and I may be able to make some provision for her to carry out her feeling. I am, however, laying her case before you and have no hesitancy in writing what, in conversation, I told you some few days ago, that I very strongly recommend her advance and assistance if needed.\n\nIf there is any information you may need on her behalf, I shall be glad to give it to you.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA.R. Lett\n\nPrincipal\nDear Mr. Lett:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, in regard to Edith Walkem, and have noted your remarks and recommendation that any necessary assistance be given to her to enable her to continue her studies through to Normal.\n\nI would suggest that at a later date, when it is assured that she will pass her Junior Matriculation, that you write me again making a definite suggestion as to the manner in which she could be assisted.\n\nAs you state, her family, as Indians, are much better able to assist this girl than many white families, and I would not recommend that the Department bear all the expense of putting the girl through Normal. But, would recommend that any assistance her family are prepared to give her, be supplemented by the Department, perhaps on a half share basis.\n\nHowever, as you know, I am not in a position at this time to give any definite assurance that the Department would agree.\n\nI think that if you are of the opinion that Edith is capable of going through Normal, and would justify the expense of the Department giving the necessary assistance, and that she will not want to quit and get married (?) in a year or so, that Inspector Harry be also requested to make a recommendation on her behalf.\n\nPlease write me again in this regard at the end of the school year, when I will take the matter up with the Department.\n\nRegarding employment for Edith, I only wish I could assure her of this, but am sorry that in so far as my Agency is concerned, there is little likelihood of anything but the usual work available to the Indian girls, in the fields or working for a crew on a ranch cooking, and even these jobs are few and far between.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Mr. A.R. Lett, Principal,\nSt. George's Indian Res. School,\nLyton B.C.\n\n(Alfred H. Barber)\nIndian Agent.\n\nARB/ES\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6491, file 42169-3, part 1)\nMr. A.H. Barber,\nIndian Agent,\nMerritt B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Barber:\n\nAgain regarding the further education of Edith Walkem, I might say that I have no doubt at all in my mind that the girl will qualify in her examinations for Senior matric. and is very well up in her work.\n\nAt the last inspection of the School by Capt. Barry, I spoke to him of her work here and approached him, as you suggested, regarding her future and understand he spoke to you stating that he had nothing to do with any advanced education and that the proposition was entirely in the hands of the Principal and the Agent. I think it would be well, therefore, for the question to be taken up with the Dept. at an early date, suggesting that they be prepared to assist this girl.\n\nCharlie Walkem, the father, was here a week last Sunday and, I understand, wished to see me but as I was unavoidably absent from the School, I have not heard further from him. I understood from Edith that her father wished to see me at your suggestion and I expect he will probably be sympathetic towards helping.\n\nI made enquiries through the Secretary of the High School Board at Chililwack and find that there is a fee of $10.00 per month charged to all Senior matriculants and I have also taken up the possibility of Edith being able to work for her Board, and it may be that I shall be able to arrange for her Senior Matric year with very little expense to the Department. May I ask, therefore, that her name be placed before the Dept. at an early date so that they may be prepared to consider her as potentially needing assistance?\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA.R. Lett\nPrincipal.\nAccording to Mr. Lett's letter of the 10th instant, there is a charge of $10.00 per month for Senior Matriculants attending the Chilliwack High School. Room and Board would cost at least $30.00 to $35.00 per month, and text books around $20.00 for the year.\n\nI would be pleased to be advised as to the views of the Department in this regard.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nAHB/ES\n\n(Alfred H. Barber)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOttawa Ontario.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith copies of correspondence between this office and Reverend A.R. Lett, Principal of St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton B.C., in regard to his recommendation that assistance be granted by the Department to enable Pupil No. 0122 - Edith Walkem - to continue her studies through Senior Matriculation.\n\nThis girl will pass her Junior Matriculation this year, and I am informed that she desires to obtain further education, with intention of becoming a teacher. My views in this regard are expressed in my letter to Mr. Lett, dated April 17th, a copy of which is hereto attached.\n\nI have spoken to Charlie Walkem, father of this girl, who is a member of the Cook's Ferry Band of this Agency, in this regard, but at the time he did not care to commit himself, until after he had had an opportunity to discuss the matter with his daughter Edith.\n\nWalkem has been in steady employment on the railway as section man for many years; and in addition has a very nice small ranch and a number of cattle. He is also able to operate a car bought a few years ago, and with the exception that he lives on the Indian Reserve and is a member of the Band, leads the life of an average white wage earner, and is in a position to bear part of the cost of any advanced education his daughter receives.\n\nShould this girl qualify for a position as teacher, I wonder what opportunity would arise for her to obtain a position. Further, I find that these girls, on leaving the Residential School, appear only too anxious to find a husband(?) .\n\nHowever, Edith is a nice girl, and Mr. Lett recommends her highly, and I would also like to recommend that the Department make a grant to enable her to take her Senior Matriculation providing her father will be agreeable to pay $10.00 or $15.00 per month towards the cost.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOttawa Ontario.\nOttawa, June 8, 1939.\n\nRe: Edith Walkem\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 31st ultimo, regarding the claims for a tuition grant of the above noted pupil.\n\nI note with interest that the circumstances of this pupil's parents are comparatively good and that they should be in a position to contribute to the education of their daughter. In view of this fact, the Department is prepared to pay the actual tuition costs of the girl, should she decide to proceed with her high school course at Chilliwack. This grant will be subject to the approval of Inspector Barry, to whom this case should be referred, and will be made on the understanding that the parents of the girl assume responsibility for her board and lodging.\n\nIt is just possible that the Principal of the School might be able to place this girl in a home at Chilliwack, where she could do a certain amount of work in return for her board and lodging. In any event, the Department is not prepared to pay more than the actual tuition costs. It is noted that these costs amount to $10.00 per month.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.
