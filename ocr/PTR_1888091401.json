The Senate and people of the great American Republic are threatening all sorts of vengeance on unhappy Canada. They have even now dispatched their extra navy men to Canada, following up the fact that Yankee fishermen and poachers are not punished as they deserve in their lackless acts. Our Dominion might tremble for the result were the Yankees to land in force, but as it consists only of one rotten limb which they are pleased to call a flag-staff, the danger is not so great as to cause much alarm. We would call the attention of Senator Frye to the fact that the Fisheries Question is a little like the Panama Canal; there is a little market which might be available in case of an emergency. The person referred to was last heard from at St. Thomas, Ont., and judging from the tone of his remarks we believe he would be most happy to assist Uncle Sam with the above-mentioned market, especially as he has not had the opportunity of using it against Canada for some time. The United States is now passing retaliatory laws. They expect by denying Canada certain commercial facilities to force her into surrendering her valuable fisheries. But the consequences of such a course will suffer as much from pursuing such a course as we will. We are no longer dependent on American roads to do our carrying trade. We have our own shipping lines, steamships, and lines of railway, and can very secretly smile at the pettish actions of Brother Jonathan. The London Times says, editorially, that \"Retaliation will prove enough to make a grip on some necks within Canada, and put a hand against it, and that the British Government will stand by the rights of Canada.\"\n\nThe Hon. Walter Laing, of Saskatchewan market fame, and leader of the Reform party in the Dominion Parliament, has been heard from again. This time in connection with the Fisheries Treaty. Speaking at St. Thomas lately he boldly took the part of the United States as against Canada, and declared that the time had come when there should be closer relations between the two countries, in short that Canada should surrender her rights and her existing prosperity to Uncle Sam. This is the position taken by the Liberal leader, but fortunately he does not voice the sentiments of the Canadian nation. The Reform party, under Mr. Laing, are reputedly by the phrase \"Canadian,\" such topics as the Globe being especially strong in its denunciation of his unpatriotic utterances. It declares that the Conservative Government has been so successful in its administration that the Liberals would have had to do what they have done in power and that the people should support the Government in this crisis, and that the fisheries question will yet have to be settled by an International Commission. The Globe, although it regards the annexationists, also condemns Laing's language, and upholds the Government in a hearty manner.\n\nGabriel Dumont has announced his intention of returning to Saskatchewan this month.\n\nThe Manitoba wheat crop for this year is estimated at 20,000,000 bushels. This will be 8,000,000 bushels in excess of 1887. In Dakota, on the other hand, the crops are a failure, the damage resulting not only from them from frost, but from wind, heat and disease.\n\nSir Chas. Tupper, Canadian High Commissioner in England, has been created a G.C.M.G. His Excellency, the Hon. J. H. Thompson, Canadian Minister of Justice, has received the honor of knighthood, he being created a C.C.M.G. These honors have been conferred by Her Majesty the Queen in recognition of services rendered to Sir Charles and Mr. Thompson as members of the late Fisheries Commission. We congratulate the worth knights on being made the recipients of such high distinctions.\n\nThe Bathfield Herald has its personal Indian scare in a recent number. The only reason given for the panic is the statement that some Indians have been seen about where perhaps they ought not to be, namely, idle white man; and then Bathfield wants more Police. We do not believe there is any necessity for more Police or elsewhere from the Indian, but to allay the fears of the fearful and give a greater feeling of security, we would like to see either more Police in the district or militia organizations.\n\nTHOS.
