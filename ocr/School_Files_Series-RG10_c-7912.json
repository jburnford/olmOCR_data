To do this the children should all be at the school at the time of his visit. Mr. McCallum has been requested to notify you of the date on which the doctor's visit will be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nMiss S. E.

You will be good enough to inform the teachers of the date on which the doctor will visit the schools. Kindly report to the Department after his visit.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nTheo. A. McCallum, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nSir:\n\nYour letter received today and desire to thank you for the copy of \"Regulations\" regarding Indian Schools. In the future I shall know the law regarding my school and service.\n\nPermit me to explain that when I came here, I was told that salary was paid quarterly and at the end of Sept. the amount would be paid ($150). Agent Mr. Collins told me about the Indians to my school and got his name on in but never in any way mentioned a teacher's return report. Since Sept. 30th we have been told several times that he was effecting our degrees every day \u2014 he said so.\nYesterday upon receipt of your letter I went to his house to consult him. I asked what report I was to send in. He said \"I don't know\". I said \"what have the other girls done in the past?\" \"They sent reports in July and December but no other times\", he said. I left the matter with him to look up.\n\nWe were both strangers in the school and it was his duty to inform us of such reports the first time at least. I had no school law in my school except the course I studied and I follow that.\n\nI have spent my own money too freely on books, pencils, soap and clothes since I came here and I do think in such a school as this soap, clothes and towels are\nabsolutely necessary. I cannot teach dirty pupils.\n\nYou can rest assured that a trip I have done has been because of my interest in the pupils, and I need Agent McCallum's assistance in getting necessary articles for my school\u2014not to be told \"you will just have to wait.\"\n\nMy returns have been made out and I shall send to the Agent without delay\u2014\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT. E. Wilson.\nOttawa, November 10, 1915.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant stating that you have spent your own money too freely on books, pencils, soap and combs since you took charge of the Walpole Island No. 1 School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that all articles of this kind for the Indian schools are furnished by the Department. If you will forward to the Department through Mr. Agent McCallum receipted accounts for any of these supplies that you have purchased you will be reimbursed for the money you have expended. In future when you require supplies of this kind you should forward a requisition to the Department through Mr. McCallum's office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss S.

You will be good enough to forward these accounts to the Department as soon as you receive them from Miss Wilson. She has also been informed that in future when she requires any supplies of this kind she should forward a requisition to the Department through your office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

I return Miss Wilson's letter herewith.\n\nMiss Wilson taught in S.S.No.26 Bembra, Becher, under my inspectorial supervision. She is a capable teacher and her work was good as far as I was able to observe but she did not get along well with the people.\n\nThe stories I heard about her would seem to indicate that she is not easy to live with. If you could communicate with Mr. Fred Jones by phone he would doubtless give you some information about her.\n\nI would esteem it a favor if you would notify me when the appointment has been made. I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(signed) Henry Conn\nPublic School Inspector.\nRegarding Mrs. Silver and the children in her school in regard to the school we have had three daughters here in this school since June last and we had no trouble until Miss Wilson came down enclosing letters received from me through the Public School Inspector into letters of confidential nature giving it to you confidentially and I submit it seems to me I have had to take my way out of the school the way myself not being able to control her and she needed help on a little way so when possible to get the correct feeling the Board removed from the attendance list by this means what they took me was in their way very urgent name among missing when heard at school and finally request us come into the field.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nExtract\n\nREPORT OF INSPECTOR CONN ON THE WAIPOLE ISLAND, NO.1 school.\n\nMiss Wilson is a capable teacher and she is doing effective work. I am very pleased with the attendance, attention she is paying to physical culture and to something hygienic. Manual training and domestic science will be taken up as soon as the necessary materials are provided.\n\nMiss Wilson taught for a short time in one of the public schools of my inspectorate. Her record there would seem to indicate that she is not easy to get along with, and when she quarrelled with the parents, the children seemed to suffer. I am afraid-frustrated\u2014afraid friction may develop and have thought it well that the failure of the young woman should such situation arise.\n\nReport dated\u2014October 25th, 1915.\nINDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSir,\n\nI am requested to inform Mr. [Name] that I have just received a letter from Mr. [Name] in which he informs me that he has been unable to attend the meeting scheduled for today due to unforeseen circumstances.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n[Name]\n[Position]\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\n[Signature]\n\n475618\n\nJan 15th 1915\n\nSir,\n\nRegarding school matters that I should find out more the coming up 2nd and 3 schools. So I told my wife she was not going to stay very long. I don't think he will be in any case because I would not stand him the demands my ing at Chipol. He could have had both in his hands and then days, and he would have come & night we would not have been able to carry for the next day was so much less than it did not give me reason why he would hold his hand to allow to go out. We would pay no attention to him or the other but he would not do what he could not. Then you must go if you let me in out of Denver. I wrote to Mr. Jackson about moving the store and getting a pocket around it to make more room in the house. I said he did not care but that it was not yet the time not going to live there. But the house was not other than the church for the beginning of the new year.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, November 30, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant in which you complain of the treatment received by your little boy at the hands of the teacher of the No. 1 School on Walpole Island.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the teacher has been informed that she must be more careful in future to pay prompt attention to the requests of her pupils who wish to leave the school in obedience to the calls of nature if she wishes to remain in charge of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. A. McCallum, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nOttawa, November 30, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant enclosing a communication sent you by Mr. Public School Inspector Conn in regard to the teacher of the No. 1 School on Walpole Island, which is returned herewith as requested.\n\nIf Miss Wilson will agree to carry out the instructions given her in letter of even date in regard to granting permission to pupils to leave the room when necessary there will be no reason for your removing your children from the school as you suggest.\n\nWhen the Department wrote you on the 3rd instant instructing you to request Dr. Cathcart to make a personal examination of the children of the Walpole Island schools and take the necessary steps to insure the eradication of pediculi it was expected that he would comply with this request. As he has apparently not done so up to the present he will be written to personally and again instructed to make this inspection, as long as he remains the medical officer of the Walpole Island Band he must comply with the Department's instructions. You report the doctor as saying that he has one patient with spinal meningitis, contracted from washing her head at school. It is to prevent cases of this kind that the doctor is asked to make an examination of the pupils and prescribe\n\nThos. A. McCallum, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nthe necessary remedies.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOtter, November 30, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nOn the 3rd of November, last, Mr. Agent McCallum was instructed to request you to make a personal examination of the children of the Walpole Island schools and take the necessary steps to insure the eradication of pediculi.\n\nMr. McCallum reports that he showed you the letter which was sent him on this subject and you said you wondered what they take you for.\n\nWhen the letter above referred to was sent to Mr. McCallum you were and still are the medical attendant for the Walpole Island Indians and as long as you act in this capacity the Department will expect you to carry out its requests in regard to attendance on the Indians of this band. Other medical men in the employ of the Department have had similar requests made to them and have not hesitated to act on the Department's suggestions. I trust that it will not be necessary to again call your attention to the desire of the Department to have the children at these schools looked after.\n\nAll you are expected to do is to satisfy yourself as to their condition and prescribe the necessary remedies. The Department will see that your instructions are carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nV. A. Cathcart, Esq., M.D.,\nPort Lambton, Ont.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, November 30, 1915.\n\nMadam,\n\nMr. Agent McCallum has complained to the Department that he has been forced to remove his little son, who was a pupil at your school, on account of your refusing him permission to leave the room to obey the calls of nature.\n\nMr. McCallum has been informed that you will be instructed to use more discretion in future and that it will not be necessary for him to keep his child away from school on this account. I trust that you will govern yourself accordingly in future.\n\nMr. McCallum also states that it is rumored that you do not intend to remain on at this school after the Christmas holidays. If this is the case you will be good enough to send in your resignation at once so that the Department may be in a position to look out for another teacher. If this rumor is incorrect be good enough to let the Department know that it is your intention to remain on and endeavour to work harmoniously with the Agent and the parents of the pupils attending your school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMiss S. E. Wilson,\nTeacher,\nWalpole Island No. 1 School,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nGentlemen:\n\nMr. Agent McCullum called at my school today and informed me that I was not going to teach in your school for the coming year. I told him when I made my agreement with the Department? Understood it was for a year or at least until services were terminated by either party giving thirty days.\nnotice. Will you inform me if I am correct?\n\nI am perfectly satisfied with conditions in my school. Between myself and Indian pupils there is perfect harmony and work with them is very interesting. No complaints have been made to me, but with out boasting in any way whatever, my work has been well spoken by Inspector Owen and Indian parents.\n\nHowever, since I wrote you and enquired about my salary, Mr. Agent McCallum has taken a dislike to me and has done everything to discourage me. (Reported me to\nInspector Conn, concerning his son, came into my school room and with out any reason hurled sarcastic remarks at me before the pupils. I bore it all patiently but still it is impossible to please him.\n\nMiss Warnock and I were hired on the same conditions but Agent McCallum failed to tell her she was not engaged for next year, so kindly let me know if I have your support and confidence in this matter or can Agent McCallum discharge me.\n\nWalford. Yours very truly\n\nNov. 30th 78. H.E. Wilson\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSir,\n\nDear Mr. Benson,\n\nI have a letter before me received from Mr. Scott regarding your teacher in School. I am not in a position to say what it was about, but I will say that I believe he was very kind and that he will continue doing so. We are very grateful to you for your kindness.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, December 4, 1915.\n\nMadam,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 30th ultimo I beg to say that the services of teachers in the employ of the Department are continued as long as they give satisfaction; should they fail to do so due notice is given them that their services will be no longer required, save in exceptional cases where they are guilty of gross misconduct which would justify the Department in their summary dismissal.\n\nIn your case Mr. Agent McCallum wrote the Department stating that it was rumored that you did not intend to remain on at this school after the Christmas holidays and he was told that if this were the case he should obtain your resignation in writing, and if the rumor was not correct the Department had no wish to dispense with your services. The Department regrets the strained relations existing between you and Mr. McCallum and he will be written to and instructed to do what he can to assist you.\n\nYour services will not be dispensed with without due notice from the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMiss G. E. Wilson,\nTeacher,\nValpole Island No. 1 School,\nValpole Island, Ont. Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, December 6, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Miss Wilson, teacher of the No. 1 School on Walpole Island, in which she states that you informed her that she was not engaged to teach for the coming year.\n\nI should like to know whether you so informed her and, if so, what authority you had for making this statement. You were advised by official letter of the 30th ultimo that, unless the teachers of the two schools on Walpole Island voluntarily resigned their positions, the Department was prepared to keep them on, as there is no good reason why their services should be dispensed with.\n\nSince the summer holidays in 1914 we have had four teachers at the No. 1 School and when we have teachers that are competent and are willing to remain the Department considers that it is your duty to give them every encouragement instead of throwing cold water on their efforts and trying to get rid of them.\n\nThe Department has just received your report on the No. 1 School for the month of November, last, which shows that the teacher is, in your estimation, competent and no complaints have been received from the Indians. Mr. Inspector Conn, who visited this school on the 25th of October, last, states in his report that Miss\n\nThos. McCallum, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nWilson is a competent teacher and is doing efficient work. He mentions, however, that her record seems to indicate that she is not easy to get along with and, from correspondence the Department has received from you, Mr. Smith, has advised you to this effect. As she is a competent teacher you should, in the interests of the school, make allowance for her uncertain temper.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nWalpole, Ont.\nDec. 31st 18\n\nGentlemen,\n\nYour letter has been received and I am quite sure had you known the true state of affairs, you would not have written me as you did.\n\nMr. Agent Mr. Callum's reports are false. I never on any occasion refused a single child in my care from going out to learn the room. On no account was any accident to happen to the child until I heard from my inspectors down. I asked my children to stand up and let me know if I had refused them such permission, not a single child stood. I then asked Robert Mr. Callum if I had refused him permission. He said \"notables.\" He said \"I told you that once you did not see any harm when I let it go.\" I said this I let you go when I knew your facts. We replied that I did. Would you say I had refused him permission to obey the laws of nature? The boy is a very nervous disposition and scarcely think the accident happened in a short time. It may have. His chief has a weakness which means that he must learn the room new plan.\nand they knew this was all my room from nine till five times daily. I still more when I worked in their house. I let the mother be too late to come take the room with me adding so often. What more could I do?\n\nI told you that I sent Mr. Callum was ordered at one for working for him in my salary and I did not repeat the labour that I have taken from him since that date.\n\nI am now under the Indian Affairs and was forced to complain of the poor living being treated my work and refused any other means of life. The master has been very kind and considerate and even able to leave all his client Mr. Callum and I seem to be satisfied there. But still I am not paid.\n\nI am receipt and very bad conditions, as you say, and can only tell that I am working conditions that I know would be paid and sent the balance by writing them I would come home with out my salary but doing this no harm.\n\nIt was sent Mr. Callum who first told I was leaving at Ymas. I did not know it\nuntil he informed Miss Warnock she had no intention of leaving as\nthe establishment had been kind enough to grant all my requests\nand I enjoyed the work both\nthe pupils and I. I understand if it\nis such business to have me\nthere I shall do so when you\ngive me notice of same.\n\nI feel quite sure that\nthe ladies at Walpole Bay will\nwould love your kindest sympathy\nif you need what they think\nsuffered at the hands\nmust die from effects the Indians.\nThe cook of all without stopping\ntime and to say where they\nfeel inclined to send back this\nlittle man in all treat him\nso kindly as I did before\nthe father took him home.\n\nPlease be kind enough\nto inform Miss Warnock that\nhe turned me in school and\nthere will be no trouble,\nfor\nmy\nschool\nexpectation\non\nbusiness matters and\nbeautiful manners, but am\nsure very\nkindly.\n\nF. E. Wilson\n\nN.B. I have other white pupils in my\nschool and I seem to be able to\nplease them and they get the\nsame kindness as Robert the Coloured\nSir,\n\nI am writing to inform you about the recent visit we made to the school. We met with some difficulties in arranging transportation, but we managed to get there eventually. The children were very enthusiastic and eager to learn. We also had the opportunity to meet with the principal, Mr. Smith, who was very accommodating.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S.

I have been\nthere in his absence and\nhave kept it up since then.\nPerhaps he will send him or the\none who was just going to stay here very\nlong when I asked her about keeping\nthe teacher.

Regarding our little child I can prove that she has been, some time, in a hospital that she was in very a short time in me. I understand your fact. I could make known her condition and nothing to make any allowance but she took her charge on my side. In my way it is very easy for you to help this poor child. If in my place had the little boy and had to go high out of school I wish you had signed your name to this letter. For circumstances would be like to be grave which I was writing this letter to you about that there is no complaint from the Indians. I have written let me pray will never end their children's lives. There is not much they children's lives. So this child will need a good care. You will find water for their needs. I don't believe there has ever been a man here for as much you are.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss S. B. Wilson,\nTeacher,\nWalpole Island No. 1 School,\nRe R. No. 5,\nWallaceburg, Ont.\nWalpole, June 14th.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nYour letter today and contents noted and will endeavor to frankly explain charges against me. In the first place I have no habit of closing school at any time of the day. Since I took charge of your school one year ago, I have failed to open only one day that will be a lost day. That day I was confined to my bed.\n\nMay 12th. With the Indians' first cold wave it was difficult to keep up our part to please them. Students when a favor was asked explained the matter before my pupils and told me I would make up the day for them. So the day was not a lost day.\n\nThe day lost thirdly after I had been ice-bound in the school and living in an Indian town for weeks, I asked Mr. McCullum to close at three so I could make train connections for home. He said I could do so, I... has reported me for the same. When I returned after Easter I was absent first\nmorning till eleven o'clock because it could not be helped. I came to inform the day before school opened, but the river was full twice and no money we were able any one to take me there at. I went miles out of my way and much expense but I could not arrive at school at nine o'clock.\n\nThere been the custom on this island to close school on Fridays at 3:30 p.m., as a sort of reward to pupils for good work & to truly be found little done I don't see.\n\nI have taught fifteen minutes longer on the noon hour than before too...\n\nI think I've been lucky & my time lost my time except the day I was ill.\n\nBut not one to say I am a human being and have an conscience. I feel that I have done for more work in this school than I shall ever be paid for and few would do such work for people as we teachers & I don't care few if any\u2014girls would stay one year and live in an Indian house. I took on my register\nand see that other teachers have remained but three months here. They had a white house to board in and most of them got home every spring night.\n\nI have done my very best to please the Department and indian parents also done my utmost to advance pupils during entire year. I hear no complaints except from the one named above. Time and again I wrote against McCollum & Co. tried to turn indian parents and pupils against me, but still they did not yield. Surely if I have made things plain to you, I am.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nS. E. Wilson\nWalpole, June 31st\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am closing my school today, June 30th, as I explained to you intended to teach June 30th for the day. However, I must inform you that Indians schools did not close on June 29th as in the case in white schools. My plans failed, so now I must register that this school has closed for at least two years from now. I have certainly not had during my year in this school.\n\nWill you write Mr. Scott McCollum at once to have our school gate put on securely. All the cattle and horses in the common land come in and are destroying our garden.\n\nPlease send my cheque to my home address which after today will be H. Wilson Box 493.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPoor Copy\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOnt.\nOct 15th 1841\n\nPost Office\n\nWill you send my cheque to Essex Post Office not to Malpole.\n\nS.E.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss S. E. Wilson,\nTeacher,\nEssex, Ont.\nGentlemen:\n\nI have just in one year service in your school on Haipole Island. Should the Deptt be willing to raise my salary to $660 per annum, I have a high school entrance, a new for this year and a new primary class book of which means much extra work and time. I await reply by August.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(Miss) J.E. Hamilton\nI would you be so kind to let me know the court law regarding alien land act and if we have in our file any legal documents pertaining to your case.\n\nWe have been unable to locate any record of your name or any other person who may have been involved in your case.

You should furnish the truant officer with the names of any of the pupils who are not attending regularly.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nMiss S. X. Wilson,\nAlgoma,\nMich. U. S. A.\nOttawa, September 19, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Miss S. E. Wilson, teacher of the No. 1, Walpole Island Day School, in which she states that the attendance is very unsatisfactory.\n\nYou will be good enough to instruct the truant officer to see that all school children of school age attend regularly.\n\nThe Department trusts that there will be no complaints about non-attendance at this school in future.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nThos.

Wilson.\nREPORT OF INSPECTOR CONN ON THE NO.1 TALPOLE ISLAND SCHOOL.\n\nDate of Inspection, October 23rd, 1916.\n\nNumber of pupils present, - 5\nNumber of pupils enrolled, - 16.\n\nI was unable to obtain an official statement of the number on the reserve. The Indian Agent places at 45, the number that should attend.\n\nThe pupils who were present showed satisfactory proficiency and are undoubtedly making good progress. The teacher is to be commended for the attention she is giving to hygiene and personal cleanliness. I examined samples of the pupils' work in plain sewing and am very pleased with the work that is being done.\n\nI believe the teacher is making efforts to secure better attendance but she is not meeting with much success.\nOttawa, November 14, 1916.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to Mr. Ogilvie's report on the Walpole Island Schools I beg to say that, as regards the attendance, it has certainly been going from bad to worse. They have a truant officer there and the teachers have done their best to keep the attendance up with no encouragement from the Agent, in fact it is a question whether he has not been a hindrance. I judge this from his own reports, as nothing apparently affords him greater pleasure than noting the falling off of the attendance. He has never said anything about assisting the teachers in this direction and his attitude towards them has been such that Miss Wilson, the teacher of the No. 1 School, has sent in her resignation, asking that it take effect on the first possible. Miss Warnock, the teacher of the No. 2 School, resigned after the summer holidays and Mr. Cork, who has taken her place, is not satisfactory to Mr.\n\nMr. Public School Inspector Conn, in his report\non the No. 1 School states as follows:\u2014 \"The pupils who were present showed satisfactory proficiency and are undoubtedly making good progress. The teacher is to be commended for the attention she is giving to hygiene and personal cleanliness. I examined samples of the pupils' works in plain sewing and am very pleased with the work that is being done. I believe the teacher is making efforts to secure better attendance, but she is not meeting with much success.\"\n\nMiss Wilson may have offended some of the parents on account of her desire to have the children cleanly in their habits and person and from what I can learn Mr. McCallum is rather pleased than otherwise at the teacher's unpopularity. Inspector in a previous report on this school states that Miss Wilson is a capable teacher and doing efficient work and that he is pleased with the attention she is devoting to physical culture and hygiene. He adds that Miss Wilson is difficult to get on with. Mr. McCallum apparently never made an effort to get on with her, in fact ever since she has been there he has done what he can to make her position untenable and I am of the opinion that he is prepared to do the same with Mr. Cork.\"\nOttawa, November 14, 1916.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant notifying the Department of your intention to resign your position as teacher of the Walpole Island No. 1 School on the first proximo.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department regrets that you have decided to sever your connection with this school. The Department wishes you to stay until the end of the current quarter, as it would be impossible to obtain a successor before that time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss G. F. Wilson,\nTeacher,\nWalpole Island No. 1 School,\nAlgonac, Mich.,\nI have been informed by Mr. Smith that he has received a letter from Mr. Johnson regarding the matter at hand. Mr. Johnson has requested that we provide him with additional information on the current status of the project. I have reviewed the current documents and believe that we are on track to meet our deadlines. However, we need to ensure that all necessary steps are taken to avoid any delays.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge everyone to remain vigilant and proactive in addressing any potential issues that may arise. We must work together to ensure the success of this project.\nSir,\n\nRegarding our Miss Wilson at the school (name of school) in [illegible] home on Friday morning 10th. I had heard from someone living there was not well and did not come when she wanted me back to school. She advised me to get a conveyance home and to take her place. Let me know what I will do.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, November 17, 1916.\n\nMadam,\n\nIn reply to your letter undated, which was received in the Department on the 15th instant, and also a former communication in which you tendered your resignation as teacher of the Walpole Island No. 1 School to take effect on the first proximo, I beg to say that if your health will permit you to resume your duties as teacher of this school the Department will be glad to have you remain on. Miss Myers may act as your substitute until you are sufficiently recovered to again take charge and Mr. Agent McCallum will be so informed.\n\nThe cheque for the salary for the current quarter will be made in your favour and you will be good enough to arrange with Miss Myers and pay her for the time she taught. Miss Myers should commence her duties at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss S. E. Wilson,\nBox 493,\nEssex, Ont.\nOttawa, November 17, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 15th instant I beg to say that Miss Wilson, teacher of the No. 1 Walpole Island School, has advised the Department of her illness and has stated that Miss Myers, the daughter of the resident missionary on Walpole Island, will act as substitute for her until she is sufficiently recovered to resume her duties.\n\nMiss Wilson has been informed that this arrangement will be satisfactory to the Department and that it has no wish to lose her services. She is being instructed to make the necessary arrangements with Miss Myers as to payment of salary for the period which she teaches. The cheque for the current quarter will be drawn in favour of Miss Wilson who will settle with Miss Myers for the amount due her.\n\nMr. Inspector Conn reports that Miss Wilson is an excellent teacher. It would be a difficult matter to get as good a teacher to take charge of the school, should she leave. The Department, therefore, trusts that you will render her every assistance in your power in the future and it will hold you responsible for an improved attendance at the school, which can be secured under the Regulations, if necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos. A. McCallum, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island, Ont.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nNovember 27th, 1916.\n\nDear Sir -\n\nMy attention has been drawn to the resignation (afterwards withdrawn) of Miss Wilson as teacher of the Valpole Island No. 1 School, and to school conditions generally on the reserve. In so far as the educational work is concerned the reports show that Miss Wilson has been an efficient teacher. She has not, however, succeeded in making satisfactory progress owing in a large degree to the lack of regular attendance on the part of the pupils. I am forced to think that this condition is to some extent aggravated by your attitude towards the teacher and towards the work generally. I am sorry that I have had to reach this conclusion.\n\nThe educational work on the reserve is perhaps the most important in our administration, and where agents are not thoroughly in sympathy with their work and with the people, whose interests we are trying to promote, satisfactory results cannot be obtained. It is also found that you have been negligent in attending\n\nThomas A. Macallum, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nValpole Island, Ont.\nto details in connection with the school buildings, etc., thus hampering the work of the teachers.\n\nThe educational work must not be neglected and I shall expect to find a decided change in conditions on the island, and will look to you to cooperate heartily with both teachers and give them such encouragement and assistance as you may be able. If it is not possible for you to work harmoniously with the teacher some remedy, even though it be drastic, must be found.\n\nIn the matter of attendance particularly the Department must to a certain extent place the responsibility on you as well as the teachers and the truant officer.\n\nFuller information respecting this will be given you in another communication.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\ngentlemen:\n\nRegret to inform you that it will be unnecessary for you to accept my resignation at the close of the present year.\n\nI am so completely exhausted for want of proper nourishment, that I am unable to do any work. A year and a half in an indian school has been too much for me or any other white girl. Don't put your teachers and the indians to live here. I have little to buy food for myself in order to keep body and soul together.\n\nThanking you for favors of the best, and regretting to have to leave your service. Please do just give my reason for leaving the agent's collection, etc., we will tell the indians.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nS.E.

All applications received should be forwarded for the Department's consideration.\n\nThe Department is anxious to have this school reopen on January 3rd, 1917, and you are, therefore, expected to give this matter your immediate attention.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n(Signed) McLEAN\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. A. McCallum, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nI am very sorry to learn from your letter that you blame me for the school conditions generally on this reserve being the cause this teacher turned meanly upon me against her own wishes. I have been unable to see the Indian families with my own eyes, but I have heard from the parents about their children's treatment by the teacher. After receiving your letter, I told them we needed more help and got two people to send their children to school. We tried three times now and they wouldn't come.\n\nPoor Copy\nMEMO.\n\nChildren to this teacher\u2014Indian people\n\nwe have now taken charge at the\nnails, the Indians there are very\nis going to resign today\nin fact just stop and think we in\nno need for a teacher written again\nthis teacher come our school was finished\nwhen she came here 36 scholars photographed\nwith the inspection and teaching the children\nnot many of the Indians will I\nwas informed of our success I sent a\npicture of them to show I knew the\neducational work in this Reserve is\nvery important and I am working\nin cooperation with the work and\nwith the Indians also how the change\nthat I have been requested in attending\nto business in connection with the Indian\nbusiness.

Think in a minute. Knows in my own mind this man could be trusted. He was this teacher but he was not doing if I had any reason back in the office to send three women did not run what kind of garbage they would talk and then at the dinner it in the end we three were met with the winter. Said were sick, we took them into our house and would of made arrangements and gave him good warm but they said not keep our time and two other went homes. Hope neither of them would take her are hard to go in an Indian.\nMEMO\n\nHave to hand don't let him promise to spare more that I am the only one to blame upon. I'm sure none the worse me one. I'm glad that if any Inspector he can send another man to teach here. He wanted send in new officers by now. Now we may have done this much more work and I know now how willing to do any thing. Can to make this school a success then come quickly Mr. Clark and look him over. We have another time and the Superintendent says we must have a new teacher. We must send him back and get another man. Only thing is I am going to bring this up in the council today. We will have to appoint a new trust officer if we can get one to act.

She was teaching in Muskoka before she went to Walpole Island and I firmly believe had she stayed there and never gone to Wal-\npole Island she would not be where she is today. She had to board with the Indians something she never should have done and was badly nourished although she paid a good place for board she had to buy milk from a white woman of take to school to exist after she got sick. The last two months she was there she should have been in bed in a hospital as she really had tuberculosis & didn't know it, as the doctor\nI told her she had bronchitis. She has the same symptoms today. She had the worst day she was ill, so she had tuberculosis from the first. I think she thought that rest and good nourishment would affect a cure when she came home thinking she had bronchitis but in spite of all mother could do to nourish her & care for her she got weaker & weaker. She was Doctor called the middle of Feb\u2014had fainting\nexamined the card she had tuberculosis. At first the board wasn't so bad but the Indian room got more & more dirty about the house & the way she took food was kept with fleas crawling over it she could not eat much. There was no other place to go and although I believe there are several white families on the Island\u2014they want a teacher but don't want to go and them. My sister\nand the other lady teacher did board at first with the agent on the Island who took care of the school, but it was not a fit place for good girls to board so they got out and were forced to board with the Indians. Of course had my sister known she had tuberculosis she wouldn't have stayed a day longer but the doctor she was depending on seemed strangely stupid. Her chance for recovery would\nWe have been so much better had she known at first & had proper treatment. Doctor says he hopes for improvement but we know she is a very sick girl. My mother is 70 and not very well - I am an invalid. Mother was very tired out taking care of my sister for the 2 months she was here & isn't able to take care of her. Mother's means are completely exhausted. My sister's\nmoney will soon be gone - she has $27 in the bank and we are sending her enough to pay several weeks' board $7 per week. She pays without washing. I am writing to ask will the Dept. of Indian Affairs assist her so she can be cared for in the Sanatorium. She was an excellent teacher as the recommend her inspector in Miss Robe gave her shows. She is a very determi...\nA girl other wise she never would have stayed at work as sick as she was at Waikam so long. She was helping keep the house when teaching.

The school should also be opened earlier in the afternoon.\n\nEnclosed herewith is a copy of the Indian Day School Regulations, in which the time that the school should be opened and closed for both the morning and afternoon sessions is given.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Some of the children have been sick lately, but not all. The teacher has been working hard and has had a lot of work to do. She has been trying to keep all the boys and girls busy and interested in their studies.\n\nI am sure you will agree that the teacher deserves our support and encouragement.\n\nJ.D. [Signature]\n[Position]\n\nIndian Affairs School Files\nUdo 10, Volume 6172, File 1-1, part 1\nSir,\n\nI have been informed that Mr. Abraham reported to the Department of Indian Affairs that neither teachers nor pupils arrive at No. I School until after 9 o'clock in the morning and after 12 noon or 2 o'clock in the afternoon. I can only say that Mr. Abraham has made a very unfounded unjust report.\n\nDuring the winter of 1817 I had so much trouble with pupils coming late\u2014even those who lived nearest the school\u2014that from December until March 1st I kept the clock fifteen minutes behind Eastern Standard Time. After March 1st the clock was advanced to the regular time.\n\nThe Indians as a rule do not come until daylight\u2014and morning\u2014so clocks are slow. And as there are six pupils living near the school who came to school during...\nThe winter months are coming a distance from me. I found that the majority of the pupils present at nine o'clock, and as the school hours were not shortened I considered the plan had to be altered. But even then some of the children were unavoidably late as owing to an unusually severe winter with drifted roads, those living at the three mile distance found it at times almost impossible to reach the school at nine o'clock. Since Easter I have not had any \"lates\". As a rule the majority of the pupils are both punctual and regular in their attendance from Easter until Christmas.\n\nI had heard during Mr. Abraham's last visit he had been speaking to the Indians that I should call the school at 1 o'clock in the afternoon. The half hour period has been in force for three years, I believe, as a means of gaining the greater part of the pupils time in which to go home for their dinner.\nMr. Abraham knew last June length of the noon period and I have always treated him with courtesy. I fail to see why he should not have discussed those differences with me.\n\nI have always been much interested in my school on this reserve and have endeavoured to be faithful in the discharge of any duties.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\nMrs. J.

The reason for closing schools was fearing an outbreak of Influenza. Quite a number on the Island have severe colds and the Doctor thought it advisable to close the schools in order to prevent an Epidemic of Flu.

Manager.\nAt the present time we have a Mrs. McDonald teaching in the No. 1 School, Walpole Island. For the last couple of years Mrs. McDonald has been coming late to school, sometimes a half hour and sometimes an hour late in the morning. She very seldom opens school after dinner until a quarter to two, sometimes later. The Indians have complained to me on a number of occasions and I have made a report of this to the Department before. I have been informed recently that she is still arriving late at school. Another point about Mrs. McDonald is that she never loses an opportunity to say something detrimental to the present Agent, to the Indians, which is very embarrassing at times to the Agent. On two occasions the former Indian agent, Mr. Thomas McCallum, now deceased, came to the Island and stayed over Sunday with her, alone in the Agency house. He was seen by the Indians, coming and leaving.\n\nThis sort of conduct leaves a very bad impression with the Indians. No doubt, Mrs. McDonald would deny these charges, and I have no doubt that it would be difficult for us to prove the latter. So far as her opening school late is concerned, of course, that can be proved.\n\nI beg to recommend that Mrs. McDonald's services be discontinued this mid-summer and that the Agent be notified to give her one month's notice.\n\nAt the present time there is a Mrs. Corman teaching in the Western school at the Deseronto reserve, who, I believe, would make a splendid teacher for this school. She\nhas expressed the wish to be stationed on some reserve where she could assist in missionary work. The Missionary at Walpole Island, the Rev. Mr. Fortiner, has expressed the wish to have a teacher in the school who would be able to assist him in the Sunday school work. Mrs. Corman has resigned at the Deseronto school. I beg to recommend that she be engaged for the Walpole Island school.\n\nW.H. Atkinson\n\nAgricultural Representative.\nOTTAWA, Nov. 15th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nIt has been brought to the attention of the Department that Mrs. Florence Macdonald, teacher of the No. 1 school on the Wikpole Island Reserve, has not been opening and closing the school at the regular hours.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of the Indian Day School Regulations, showing the teaching days in the year and the hours of opening and closing. You will be kind enough to hand this copy to Mrs. Macdonald, and inform her that it is expected she will open the school each day promptly at 9 A.M., and that the hour for closing is 4 P.M. All the pupils should remain the full time the school is in session.\n\nThe Department understands that certain of the pupils are home each day about 3 P.M. You should inform Mrs. Macdonald that the tardiness of certain of her pupils at this hour should cease, and that it is hoped there will be no further cause for complaint regarding this matter.\n\nIt is expected that the new school building will be ready for occupation about the first of the new year. Living quarters for the teachers are provided in this building, and it is expected that they will occupy the same. You should inform Mrs. Macdonald accordingly, in order that she can arrange to move in when the building is ready for occupation.\n\nIt will also be necessary to secure the services of a second teacher to be in duties after the new year, and I will be glad if you will make enquiries through Mr. Henry Conn, the local school inspector, or otherwise, with a view to securing the services of a qualified teacher for the junior room in the new schools. The salary allowed the second teacher will depend upon the qualifications which may be shown. You should submit the name, qualifications and experience of any applicant received by you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Fenton,\nSurf. of Indian Education.\n\nThos. Paul, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI have to remind you that the Department requires the services, from January first, of a second teacher for the No. 1 school on the Walpole Island reserve. I will be grateful for immediate information as to the action that Mr. Inspector Conn and yourself have taken. Offer, for the Department's approval, the names and qualifications of any applicants that come to your attention.\n\nI understand that there is a Miss Fortner, a daughter of the missionary near this school, who, although not qualified, might do in the event of no success meeting your efforts to secure a proper instructor. Your kind attention to the matter of securing a second teacher is requested at this time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\ndept. of Indian Education.\n\nTheo.

She is teacher of an Indian Sunday School Class, on the Island, and seems to be quite interested in Indian Welfare. She is nineteen years of age, quite bright and clever. I feel that I could quite conscientiously recommend Miss Fortner, as an assistant teacher for this school.\n\nI have just had a talk with Inspector Conn, and he tells me that he has nothing in sight, at the present time for this position.\n\nAwaiting your reply, with further instructions, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.B.

The Department will approve of the temporary appointment of Miss Fortner as assistant teacher, to begin duties after the new year. Her retention in the position will depend upon the success with which she meets in her work. The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $500 per annum, with any bonus provided by law.\n\nIt is hoped that the new school building will be fully completed and ready for occupation when the schools re-open after the Christmas holidays, and you should see that all arrangements to this end are carried out.\n\nYou may inform Miss Fortner of her appointment, and you should inform the Department as to the date upon which she begins duties, and also her full Christian name.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nThos. Paul, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nSir,\n\nOn my visit to Walpole Island yesterday, and in conversation with Mrs. Florence MacDonald, Teacher of the No.1 Indian Day School, on the Island, she informed me that she was going to resign as Teacher of this school, unless her salary was increased to $1000.00 per Annum, and no Bonus. She also stated that she would be willing to remain as Teacher of this school, for a few months, if we were not able to procure a suitable teacher. She said that she would expect to be paid at the rate of $1000.00 per year, for the time she remains, as Teacher of this school. I would recommend that Mrs. MacDonald's services be retained until such time as we can procure a suitable teacher for this school.\n\nAwaiting an early reply, with instructions, I remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 30, 1921.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th instant, informing the Department that Mrs. Florence MacDonald, teacher of the No. 1 Indian Day School, Walpole Island, intended resigning unless her salary was increased to $1000.00 per annum, without bonus.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, owing to the qualifications which Mrs. MacDonald possesses, it will not be possible to grant her any further increase in her salary at present. If, in consequence, she intends to give up duties, she should forward her written resignation to you, for transmission to the Department. It is hoped, however, that she will reconsider her intention to resign and will remain at least until the end of the present school year, June 30th, next, or until the services of a suitable teacher can be obtained. You should consult Mrs. MacDonald and advise the Department, as soon as possible, as to what arrangements you are able to make with her to carry on the work until the end of the present year, or at least until a successor can be secured.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

I expect will have the work completed today or tomorrow, and that Miss Evelyn Porter will commence her duties as Teacher on Monday, the 16th inst.\n\nThis school will have many advantages over the old one, in equipment as well as in nice, roomy classrooms. The slate blackboards are perfect and the location, one of the nicest on the Island.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, January 15, 1922.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 12th instant referring to your religious denomination and your wish to obtain a position in an Indian school in Ontario.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that there will be a vacancy in an Indian school near Wallaceburg, Ont., in the near future. The position in question is that of Senior Teacher in a 2-roomed school where both teachers reside in a residence above the classrooms. The building is new and we are desirous of getting a lady teacher to supervise the education of the Indian children at this point. It is desirable, in connection with this position, that we find an incumbent who will take over the work more or less permanently.\n\nThe salary we are offering at this point is $650 per annum, free residence and whatever bonus is allowed by law. At present the bonus is being paid at a rate of $15 per month. The school year is ten teaching months, and the course of studies is that of the Ontario Department of Education.\n\nIf you wish to apply for this school\u2014and the Department of Indian Affairs will await your reply before filling the position\u2014will you support your application with letters of recommendation from the Reverend Canon Elliot of Carleton Place, and intimate to me the name and address of a public school inspector who has supervised your teaching in the past. This information is desired as soon as possible. It might be possible for you to pay a visit to Ottawa in this connection, and I will be pleased to have a personal interview with you. The office is at 501 Booth Building, Sparks St.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMrs. R. H.

I may say that the Department has in view a qualified teacher for this school and it would be well, in view of all the circumstances, of which you are aware, if Mrs. MacDonald would forward her resignation, to take effect at an early date as convenient. Her notice should be given in due time, in order that steps can be taken to have her successor arrive to take up duties as soon as Mrs. MacDonald leaves. You should see Mrs. MacDonald immediately and inform her that the Department desires her resignation and that she give up duties by the middle of February, next.\n\nI will be pleased to hear from you regarding this matter as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

Before leaving, she should prepare a return showing the attendance and days taught during the months of January and February and hand this return to you for transmission to the Department, in order that the balance of salary and bonus due can be paid.\n\nYou will be good enough to see that all school material or other supplies in her charge are left under proper care, in order that they will be available for the new teacher who will succeed her.\n\nRegarding the appointment of a teacher to succeed Mrs. Macdonald, I beg to say that, as you have already been advised, the Department has a qualified teacher in view and you will be informed in due time as to the name, salary, etc., of the teacher appointed, who will be ready to take up duties on the 1st of March, next.\n\nThe question of furnishing the teacher's residence in the new school building is being left in the hands of Mr. R.

We understand that it is quite important to have the two teachers friends, as I suppose they live together. But Margaret\nI am quite willing to live with a lady teacher, that your department would engage. It is no doubt good manners are an important part of the teacher's qualifications.\n\nMy second daughter has her Lower School Certificate and a diploma from the Ottawa Infants' Hospital, which, of course does not help her to teach, but is certainly a help to the management of children. It is our\ndepartment finds it impossible to engage two friends, or a senior teacher that could be recommended to Marquet. Would it be impossible to engage both my daughters, Marquet as senior and Davis as junior teacher? They are both reliable girls.\n\nI can imagine from memory Mr. McLeans smile, and his \"name wants to push her whole family into the school.\"\nBut, if the junior division is still vacant and there is no do not appear, many willing to go as host.\n\nThanking you for your prompt reply, and your kindness.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMrs. M.

He could be paid partly from the Department's funds from the Indian people themselves. The Doctor is paid by the Methodist Missionary Society, who will assist in the equipment of the hospital.

Under the circumstances it will be impossible for the Department to forward the brushes.\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter about having a dentist come to the reserve to attend to the children's teeth, the understanding was that you were to enquire what a local dentist would charge to come to the reserve to do this work and report this to the Department when the matter would be considered, and you would be advised if the arrangement was satisfactory. If you have definitely engaged a dentist to come to the reserve you should cancel the arrangement until you have reported fully to the Department as to the fees charged and the method by which the children's teeth would be treated.\n\nThe matter of fixing up the Agency house as a place where a dentist could practice cannot be considered by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Harold Wells, her brother, teacher, of the Junior Room, does not intend to remain any longer than the present school year.

APRIL 7, 1924\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of April 1, in respect to the Indian Day School at Walpole Island. So far as I was concerned there was no promise to Mrs. McPherson in any way that she would have the Walpole Island school when she wished it.\n\nThe question as to whether Mrs. McPherson and her mother would be better suited to Walpole Island than Mrs. Savage and her mother live, Wells, I would not be in a position to say, as I do not know what kind of a teacher Mrs. MacDougall would make. So far as Mrs. Savage and Mrs. McPherson are concerned both are very good teachers, and both have good qualifications. Of course Mrs. Savage has a professional second class certificate, and has had many years of experience in some of the best schools in this vicinity, including a large school in the city where she taught for some years.\n\nI understand that Mrs. Wells taught school a number of years ago. The objectionable feature in connection with Mrs. McPherson coming back, was the fact that her younger sister was too much inclined to run around with some of the Indians. Of course that objection would be removed if Mrs. MacDougall takes her place.\n\nI think the school would be well served in either case, from the standpoint of efficiency. I do not think it would make very much difference.\n\nPersonally I would not be in favor of dismissing Mrs. Savage, as the Indians seem very well satisfied with the present conditions. The missionary just the other day\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, of March 21st, and also April 2nd, with reference to the teacher, of No. 1 Indian Bay School, Walpole Island. With reference to Mrs. Wells, as a successor, to her son, Harold Wells, who is the teacher, of the Junior Room, and in answer to your letter, of March 21st.\n\nI beg to inform you, that her age is 67, and looks much younger. She has a good public school education, and has attended the Emerson College, of Oratory, at Boston, Mass., for two years.\n\nI might say that Harold Wells only intends to remain, on the Island, till the end of the present month, and that Mrs. Wells will teach the Junior Room, for the months of May and June.\n\nI might further state that Mrs. Wells only intended to remain, on the Island, as teacher, till the end of the present school year, June 30th.\n\nI have written to Miss Lamb, a High School graduate, now attending the Normal School, at Winnipeg, Man., who will, I am informed, be completed will be a fully qualified teacher. Miss Lamb, has agreed if need be, to substitute, for Mrs. Savage, at the No. 1 Walpole Island School. I might further state that I made no promises, whatever, to Mrs. A. McPherson.\n\nIn fact, I expected her and her sister, to return to the Island, and open the school, after the summer holidays. The first intimation that I had that she was not coming was on the 13th day of August, less than three weeks before school, was to re-open again, when I received an official notice, from the Department.\n\nIn reference to Mrs. Savage, I believe that she will come back next spring, since coming to Walpole Island, and that the Indians, whom I have talked to, are well satisfied, and believe her to be a good teacher, after the Jr. Room, to the end of the present school year, or for the next school year.\n\nJ.

I have to inform you that the present incumbent of the senior room wishes to continue her services at this school. There is a vacancy at this school for one teacher, and, if you are interested, I shall be pleased to hear from you without delay, as there is another fully qualified applicant.\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Education reports that he has given careful consideration to the advisability and possibility of transferring Mrs. Savage, the present teacher, to some other school in the vicinity. There are two schools where the services of the present teachers are not wholly satisfactory, but no residences are provided, and further, the salaries are at the rate of $500 and $650 for the ten teaching months. The activity at the two schools mentioned is such that the Department cannot allow an increased item for teacher's services, and therefore, overtures to Mrs. Savage concerning her transfer cannot in fairness be made.\n\nAs intimated in the first paragraph of this letter, there is one vacancy at Walpole Island No. 1 School.

April 7, 1924.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing, with this, list of the school children at Walpole Island who should be attending the local school. You will note that there are fifteen or sixteen children who have never been to school. Some of these children are 12, 13, and 14 years of age. Of course there are some of them at a considerable distance from the school, the public school. I think it would be advisable to send them to one of our residential schools.\n\nI might say that there has been nothing done in connection with the Greenbird Williams children or the White children. I think it would be advisable to appoint a new Truant Officer. There is no excuse now at Walpole Island. There is plenty of school room for all the children. It is evident to me that the present Truant Officer is not doing his duty. I would recommend that when I am appointed a Truant Officer for the local school, also take this up. I do not see how it amounts of time the Truant Officer receives at the present time, but I believe it would be good policy to pay at least two visits per week.\n\nI might point out that Walpole Island is an exceptionally bad condition in respect to school attendance and something should be done to relieve the situation.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.H. Abraham\nSecretary\nDept. of Ind. Aff.\nOntario.\nOttawa, April 14, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 17-2-1 of the 7th instant, with reference to the non-attendance at the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School of a large number of Indian children in the vicinity. The case of the children of Joshua White has engaged the Department's attention, following your letter of the first ultimo; but I regret to inform you that the whitebread School District cannot consider allowing them to attend the public school, because of lack of accommodation. Mr. Indian Agent Paul has been instructed to apply for the admission of the white children to the Mt. Elgin Indian Residential School.\n\nUnfortunately, vacancies in Indian residential schools in Eastern Canada are so few that a genuine effort to relieve the situation at Walpole Island cannot be undertaken at the present time. The question of the appointment of Allan Isaac to the position of truant officer for both the No. 1 and No. 2 schools, at a salary of $100 per annum, is being referred to Mr. Indian Agent Paul for recommendation. The Department views your suggestion favourably.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAct. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. H.

I asked her to write to this effect and she promised she would. Much to my surprise, I received her letter of the 24th instant saying that she would like one room at Walpole Island.\n\nI have noted that she accepts her former position as senior teacher \"as offered me.\" No offer of this kind was made. I promised consideration would be given to the question of who was to be senior teacher if she accepted a vacancy at Walpole Island. In official letter of the 14th ultimo Mrs. Macpherson was offered \"a vacancy\" at this school.\nMay 30, 1924.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nMrs. H. Macpherson, who was formerly at the No. 1 School, wishes to return to Walpole Island for the coming academic year. She is willing to take either room in the No. 1 School or the No. 2 School. She is willing to accept $700 in the event that she takes the junior room and has no general responsibilities and will be content, in this event, to have one of the upstairs rooms only as her share of the residence.\n\nIt is understood that, if she takes the responsibility for No. 1 School or the No. 2 School, a salary of $800 would be offered.\nOttawa, May 30, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that Mrs. Harriette Macpherson, formerly Senior Teacher at the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School, wishes to secure a position in one of the Indian schools at Walpole Island for the coming academic year. As you are aware, there will be one vacancy in the Walpole Island schools, as Mrs. Wells is giving up duty at the end of June.\n\nThe Department wishes to give Mrs. Macpherson's application favourable consideration. She is willing to take either room in No. 1 School or the No. 2 School. If she takes the junior room at Walpole Island No. 1, she will be content to have one of the upstairs rooms only as her share of the residence, as she would arrange to rent a cottage in the vicinity.\n\nThe Department will agree to any arrangement which is considered in the best interests of the Indian children of the Island. If Mrs. George wishes to transfer to the junior room at Walpole Island No. 1 at the same salary she is now receiving, this action can be taken. If Mrs. Savage wishes to transfer to the No. 2 School because of the better residence facilities, such action would be approved.\n\nPlease give this question your careful and earliest consideration and discuss the matter with Mr. Indian Agent Paul as well as with both Mrs. Savage and Mrs. George. A copy of this letter is being directed to Mr. Indian Agent Paul, so that he will be prepared to make an intelligent recommendation when you get in touch with him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Mrs. George feels that she should not be asked to move from this school at the present time. She has just got there, and got acquainted with the people, and the school. I do not think it would be fair to her or to the people, who are very much pleased with Mrs. George, to ask her to move.\n\nOn the other hand, Mrs. Savage is very agreeable to make any arrangements that would be satisfactory to the Department. She states that she would be willing to accept your terms as offered in your letter of the 30th, to let Mrs. McPherson take the junior room at the No. 1 school, and that she would be perfectly willing to allow her to have the room under the conditions specified in the letter.\n\nI presume that Mr. Paul is also making a report, as he was with me when I discussed it with Mrs. Savage.\n\nTrusting that this will be satisfactory.\n\nI remain\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

After fully considering the arrangements that will exist for teachers during the next school year, the Department will be pleased to accept your services as teacher of the Junior Room at the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School. The salary allowed will be at the rate of $700 per annum, which will be supplemented by any bonus that may be provided by law. Payment of salary and bonus will be based on ten teaching months in the year. If you accept this offer, you should be ready to begin duties when the school re-opens after the coming summer holidays, on or about September 2nd, next.\n\nIn the event of your acceptance of the above position, you will have the use of one of the upstairs rooms only as your share of the quarters provided for a teacher's residence. Mrs. Sawyer, the senior teacher, is to have full responsibility for the general management of the school and you should join with her in every effort to make a success of the work at this school.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your acceptance of the above offer at your early convenience, stating at the same time whether you will be ready to begin duties on the date mentioned, in order that we can inform Mr. Agent and accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The resignation of Mrs. Savage as senior teacher of the No. 1 School on the Walpole Island Reserve is accepted from the last instant. In this connection I beg to confirm the following day letter of today's date which has been sent Mrs. Savage, Wallaceburg, Ont. -\n\n\"Your resignation accepted. October salary will be allowed. Inform Mrs. Macpherson she should take over temporary responsibility for school as from today's date and Mrs. McDougall is temporarily appointed assistant at salary of $600 plus bonus.\"\n\nYou are to assume responsibility for the management of the school, and the temporary appointment of your mother, Mrs. McDougall, is approved. You may take charge of the senior or the junior room - whichever you consider the most advantageous arrangement for carrying on the classroom work. It may be that you can devote considerable attention to the work in both rooms, and assist and advise your mother in the classroom activities. The salary allowed you as Principal will be at the rate of $750 per annum, and Mrs. McDougall will be paid at the rate of $600 per annum. Both salaries to be supplemented by the bonus provided by law, and payment of same to be based on ten teaching months in the year.

I have taken the remainder of the First Class into my room and thus divided the number of pupils attending in each room, more evenly. At present there are 33 pupils enrolled in the Junior Room and 32 pupils in the Senior Room.\n\nAs the principal work in the Junior Room consists in instructing the children in the English language and in the rudiments of education, I feel confident that my mother who has had much experience with children and who has a natural ability for teaching, will make a success of her work here.\nMrs. Savage taught 21 days and closed school for two days of Teachers' Convention held at Petrolia during the month of October.\n\nPraying that this information will be satisfactory and thanking you for your kind interest, I remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nHarriette H. Macpherson.\n\n(Mrs.) H. H. Macpherson,\nno. 1. Indian Day School,\nWalpole Island,\nOntario\nDear Mr. Carrier,\n\nWould you kindly tell me what action should be taken in the case of an Indian who absolutely refuses to send his boy to school? The child in question is about 13 years of age. He has only attended school 3 days in the past 5 months, and all efforts of the Agent Officer to compel him to attend regularly are fruitless.\n\nThe boy's sister attends, but the father has become stubborn in the case of the boy. The man is just ignorant enough to maintain his stand, encourage other Indians to follow his bad example and to openly criticize the whole school system.\nSilas Sande is the man\u2014Indian\u2014in question and the boy is his son Alexander.\n\nI would advise very strongly that this boy be sent to Chapleau Boarding School, as Mr. Sande acted in the same manner with an older son when my predecessor was teaching here.\n\nThe same action should be taken in the case of the two Chamberly boys, Chester and Floyd\u2014who although well over school age, do not attend the Indian School.\n\nThese are the only two cases of non-attendance and the parents in each case have become quite insolent about it.\n\nKindly advise in this case at your earliest convenience. Thanking you\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nHarriette H. Macpherson.\nOttawa, May 13th, 1925.\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, regarding the case of the three children mentioned by you whose parents refuse to send them to the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School. We note that all the efforts of the truant officer to induce their attendance are fruitless.\n\nMr. Agent Paul is being communicated with, and requested to state whether he would advise that action be taken under Section 10 of the Indian Act to compel their attendance, or whether he would advise that they be committed to an Indian residential school. We hope that the Agent will give this matter his serious consideration and inform the Department as to what he would advise be done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMrs. Harriette Macpherson,\nTeacher, No. 1 School,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nOttawa, May 13th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from the teacher of the No. 1 school on the Walpole Island Reserve, drawing attention to the case of 3 children who do not attend school in spite of the efforts of the truant officer. She especially refers to the case of the son of Silas Sands, who is 13 years of age and has only attended school 3 days during the past 5 months. She states that this boy's father absolutely refuses to allow him to attend, and is encouraging the other Indians to follow his example. Another case is that of the 2 Chaubway boys - Chester and Floyd - who, although of school age, do not attend the junior room. She states that the parents in both cases have become quite insolent and openly criticize the school system, and suggests that these boys be placed in a residential school.\n\nI have to request that on the occasion of your next visit you will enquire into these cases and report whether you would advise that action be taken under Sub Section 3 of Section 10 of the Indian Act. It may be that if a fine was imposed on the parents it might prove of salutary effect and induce them to send their children to school, or you should state whether you would advise that these children be committed to a residential school. The Department will expect a reply at an early date, stating your opinion as to what action you would advise be taken in the case of the son of Silas Sands and the two Chaubway boys. We are informing the teacher that you have been requested to report as to the action you recommend be taken in the case of the above mentioned children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos.

The Shobway children are now attending school every day and have promised regular attendance. Silas Sands has also promised that he will send his boys as regularly as conditions will permit. He also stated that he was going to try and have his children placed in a residential school. Those children have a long way to go to school; I would say three miles or more, and I believe that it would be in the best interest of those children to have them placed in a residential school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nUttes, Ontario.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 1, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, regarding the three children on the Walpole Island Reserve, who, the teacher of the No. 1 School stated, did not attend regularly. It is noted that the Shobway children are now attending school each day and that the Sands boy will attend as regularly as conditions permit.\n\nIt would, no doubt, be in the best interests of these children to have them placed in a residential school, and you might communicate with the Principal of the Mt. Elgin Institute, with a view to having them sent to that school after the coming summer holidays. If this school will have no vacancies, arrangements might be made to have them placed in the Mohawk Institute, Brantford. Please give this matter your attention and, if possible, arrange to have the children referred to placed in either one of the above mentioned schools after the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nTbos. Paul, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Education,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWould you kindly advice me to do something?\n\nThis year there are 35 pupils attending No. 1 School, with prospects of more coming.\n\nNow I am making accommodations for 25 pupils, but there in reserve, 8 pupils are attending daily, necessitating using chairs, tables and extra seats, all of which is very detrimental to proper class recitation and discipline. The classroom is only 12 feet square, so there is no children in class, naturally, it is almost impossible to raise school and dismiss in this crowded space. Would it be possible to use the reserve room for the 3rd and 4th grades until...\nand the kitchen as a separate entrance for the boys. They using the whole building for a dormitory. Several influential Indians agreed that the school might be used for educating a dormitory at the same time, and moving this in a resident manner.\n\n(2) Tracing the dormitory, the school facilities were arranged into a dormitory arrangement with rooms for the students. At present there are children living in the dormitory. Some are from islands (e.g., while those on Agawa and St. Anne's Islands cannot walk the distance at all and consequently are receiving no education at all.\n\n(3) The former teacher, Mrs. Grace, encouraged the boys to bring in the clothes they took the clothesline (a wire one) from the school in Sept. 1st claiming it was hers, though she had left a clothesline here.\nwhen let us have a new dress. Could you kindly give permission to Indians at St Paul to have a new nice clothes? I have been up for the use of the teachers.\n\nIn view of the excellent attendance which children make when they attend the school, consider very seriously the question of giving a teacher a promotion to what they consider her work merits.\n\nI trust to hear from you soon concerning this matter and thank you for your kind attention to my request.\n\nTruly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, Sept. 14, 1926.\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant and I note, with satisfaction, that the enrolment at the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School is very satisfactory. The Department cannot give favourable consideration to erecting dormitories for the children nor to the suggestion that the teacher's residence be used as another classroom. If the attendance warrants it, the Department might favourably consider erecting a third classroom. In the meantime, to avoid overcrowding, it might be advisable to re-arrange the classes and to refuse admission of those children who are under 7 years of age.\n\nI regret to state that it is not the practice of the Department to convey children to and from Indian day schools. With reference to the clothes line, you should make application to the Indian agent.\n\nI also regret that the Department cannot give favourable consideration at the present time to an increase in salary for the two teachers. Our funds are extremely limited this year. When the bonus was discontinued, the salaries of all day school teachers were increased \u00a315 a month and applications for further increases cannot be given favourable consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

R. #3, Wallaceburg, Ont.\nMr. Russell Ferrer\nDept. of Education\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWould you kindly advise me of the overcrowded conditions at No. 1 School. To date there was an average attendance of 63 for the two classes rooms, in spite of the fact that there is scarlet fever on the Reserve and that the Health Officer does not call. Under favorable conditions the attendance is approximately 75.\n\nIn the Junior Room, the attendance for this week averages 20, composed of 3 classes i.e., Beginners, Junior\nPrimer and Senior Primer.\n\nIn the Senior Room the attendance averages 40. There are three classes:\n\n1. Grade I (Grade 8)\n2. Grade II (Grade 5)\n3. Grade III (Grade 3)\n\nJunior I and Junior II (Grade 1-2) are combined teaching each two hours per subject six times a day (three to back class). In the Senior Room we are so overcrowded that we are using 3 tables out the rear of the old room and 6 of the big double seats from the little old school at the front of the class-room.\n\nThe plan for this room which is according to age and ability, meets with the approval of Mr. Horn, the Public School Inspector and Indian Agent Paul. All children in the Senior Room are over 10 years old.\n\nMay I make an suggestion that the First Class (Grades 4 and 5) be sent back to the Junior Room as not practical. There are 15 pupils in these classes.\nconsequently there is not seating capacity for them. Added to this the seats which were installed for a kindergarten grade are much too small for first class pupils. Their average age is 12 years and already they have been kept back in the junior room because of irregular attendance, until now it is only fair that they should be kept back senior grades.\n\nAlso have any steps been planned to remedy the smoke conditions in the junior room? It is so filled with smoke each morning that children cannot even see after the opening exercise, they must play outside for an hour or so until the class-room is fit for occupation. Added to this the pipes are dropping creosote all over the floor. There is one large puddle 3' square on the floor, which is eating into the boards. The odor from this\nliquid is most of noxious\nand bad for eyes and health.\nOn the Indian Agent's last visit\nto the school two weeks ago he\nadmitted that the matter\nwas beyond him. The popular\nbelief is that even a new chimney\nwould not remedy the situation.\nI might also add that the\npromised supply of school wood\nhas not been delivered for the\npast two months & school - Sept.\n& Oct. they burned our house\nwood in the fire place in the\nwinter. The man who has\nthe contract for firewood\nmust bring a small load at a\ntime and it is swept up before\nthe next comes. There is never\nan emergency supply.\nPraying you will take whatever\naction you deem advisable\nin these matters. Premise\nVery truly yours\nHarriette H Macpherson\nOttawa, November 17, 1925.\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant and I note that you consider the attendance at the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School warrants the establishment of a third class. I regret that there are no funds available for the providing of either the building or the equipment necessary for this purpose, and further, the Department cannot contemplate extending its educational system at Walpole Island at the present time. With reference to the use of tables at the rear of the senior classroom, I have to suggest that more desks be installed, if you feel that some of the less advanced pupils should not be placed in the other classroom. Would it not be possible to put the Grade 2 A in the junior room so as to make a more even distribution of the children and the work. The plans for this building indicate that each classroom will hold 40 pupils.\n\nSeparate communications will be directed to you with reference to the difficulties due to the smoking of the stove in the junior room and relative to fuel supply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

If you and the doctor are of the opinion that a guard is necessary to enforce quarantine, a man may be engaged for the purpose, but the Department desires to impress upon you that no unnecessary expense should be incurred yet every effort must be put forth to stamp out the disease on the reserve as quickly as possible.\n\nIt is assumed that Dr. Cowan has notified the Provincial Health Officer with regard to the scarlet fever cases.

The increase in student enrollment has put a strain on our facilities, particularly in the classroom space. We have been working closely with the Board of Education to address these issues.\n\nAs we discussed earlier, we have proposed a solution that involves expanding the current facilities. However, due to budget constraints, we need to find a way to implement this plan without further delays.\n\nI urge you to consider this proposal as a viable option for ensuring the future success of our students. I believe it will be essential to take action now to prevent any potential disruptions in the coming months.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, School Files, (G-1), Volume 6175, File 442-1, part 21\nSaskatoon Board of Education\n\nTo Mr. J.

The complaint alleged that the teacher had been rude and disrespectful to students. Upon investigation, it was found that the teacher had indeed been rude and disrespectful.\n\nThe Board decided to take action and suspended the teacher for one week. The teacher was also required to attend a training session to improve his or her teaching methods.\n\nThe Board also received a complaint from another parent regarding the tardiness of the school bus. The school bus was late in picking up students, causing them to be late for school.\n\nThe Board decided to investigate the issue further and ensure that the school bus was punctual in the future.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent of Schools\nThe following has not been written:\n\n- Mr. Thompson\n- Mr. Smith\n- Mr. Johnson\n\nThey are not present.\n\nI have no more information to provide.\n\n- Mr. Smith\n- Mr. Johnson\n- Mr. Thompson\n\n- Mr. Smith\n- Mr. Johnson\n- Mr. Thompson\n\n- Mr. Smith\n- Mr. Johnson\n- Mr. Thompson\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCHATHAM, ONT. Oct. 2, 1926.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing, herewith, a letter which was handed to me by Walter Sands, one of the store keepers at Walpole Island.\n\nIn explanation, I might say, that Walter Sands came over to my office and told me a long story about his boy being expelled from school for misbehaviour. He stated at that time that he was ready to back the teachers in every way in trying to control the boy; he said the boy was willing to promise to be good if allowed to go back to school. I advised Mr. Sands to get in touch with the Indian Agent, Mr. Paul. You will note that his letter states that he had been in touch with Mr. Paul, but that the teachers would not allow the boy to go back to school, unless he promised not to talk about them any more. This, he claims, he refused to do on the grounds that he did not think that this had anything to do with his son's conduct.\n\nWhile at Walpole Island on Monday last, I went with Mr. Paul and saw the teachers. We discussed the matter of allowing the boy to come back. Finally after a great deal of persuasion the teachers agreed to allow him to come back if he promised to behave himself, and if the father would promise to assist them in every way possible. We, therefore, brought the father and boy over to the school. The boy agreed to behave himself in the future, and the father agreed to assist the teachers as much as possible.\n\nI might say that we asked both parties not to bring up any of their grievances at this conference, as it would only lead to further trouble. Notwithstanding this, when Walter Sands and his son were leaving, the teachers subjected him to considerable abuse, calling him a jail bird and a number of other terms to which he objected. The father then said he did not think it would be any use sending the boy back, if the teachers maintained that kind of attitude.\nHowever, we talked it over with him and he has started the boy back to school, but I do not think the settlement between the teacher and Sands is permanent. I feel confident that the boy will be an angel if he escapes being expelled again, and the teachers will be severely condemned by Sands if his boy is punished for misdemeanor.\n\nI believe that Mr. Paul intends writing you in regard to this as well.\n\nYou will also note in the letter that I am enclosing, that several other Indians are making complaints against the teachers. I also understand that the whole matter is to be aired in the Indian Council on Monday.\n\nI remain\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.H. Abraham,\nAgr. Rep., Dept. of Ind. Aff.\n\nJ. D.

Aff.,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 6th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, enclosing a communication which you received from Walter Sands relative to the case of his son who was expelled by the teacher of the Malpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School on account of his behaviour. Your report regarding this matter has been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. H.

No. 3 Wallaceburg.\n\nMr. Russell J. Paul,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs you are no doubt now aware, there has been considerable trouble caused in this school by an Indian-White child\u2014owing to the fact that I was compelled to expel his son, Emerson, for continued smoking, insolence, and insubordination during school hours.\n\nMr. Paul, the Indian Agent, after a consultation with the boy and his parents, upheld my decision but Mr. Brown, the agricultural agent, came to the school and insisted that I allow the boy to return, on the terms he laid down, even humiliating me to the extent of making me promise to do as the boy wished with regard to his son etc.\nSince returning to school, the boy still causing trouble and consequently the discipline which has been excellent is hard to maintain. He bullies the younger children, destroyed a valuable map on a senior girl and resents any authority.\n\nMr. Copin, the Public School Inspector, on observing the boy's attitude in school, says he should never have been allowed in again and that upon his next offence, he should be expelled permanently and sent away to another school as the same conditions are an immoral and unfitting for the upbringing of children.\n\nThe boy, however, is rather kind-hearted, a true Christian soul which has always been a source of trouble for the Reserve. Further information to the side of the matter may be obtained from Rev. G. Clayton, United Church minister who resides next to the school or Inspector Hudson of the Canadian Mounted Police at Windsor.\nMr. Abraham instructed me not to whip the boy as this would annoy the father, but rather to overlook all his offenses which are most flagrant.\n\nI mildly advise in this case as the boy who is 14 years old feels that he can do just as he wishes in school. While Mr. Abraham has practically laid my hands by saying I must not punish him.\n\nI might add that I have prepared this pupil twice for his entrance examinations and he has failed both times, so little further can be done for him here along educational lines.\n\nIn this regard to the petition which Mr. Abraham obtained from this Walter Sande to forward to you, might I, as a great favor be allowed to see it or have Mr. Paul show me a copy of same as I have been informed by Indians that their names were written without their knowledge or\npermission, as in the case of Allan Boase, the truant officer.\n\nI also understand, that four of any of those who signed have children attending this school although the originators of the petition combed the Island for signatures.\n\nThis as an act of justice I feel that I should be entitled to see a copy of this petition.\n\nAwaiting the Department's advice in this matter,\n\nI remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nHarriette H. Macpherson\nOttawa, October 26, 1926.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, with reference to difficulty at the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School, caused by Walter Sands and his son.

No. 5, Wallaceburg,\nOnt.\nOttawa, October 26, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to inform you that the Department has received three communications with reference to difficulty at the Halpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School - such difficulty having been caused by Walter Sands and his son, Emerson. One correspondent indicated that the question might be aired in the Indian Council of October 4th. I note, however, that there is no minute in this connection. At your earliest convenience, please send me a full report, indicate who are at fault in connection with the difficulty and state what course the Department should pursue.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

One of the faults were that Emerson was smoking around the school during recess, and I am told, asked to go out, and when out, indulge in smoking a cigarette, and generally very mischievous. Emerson is about 14 years old. I investigated the matter, without success, on Sept. 22nd. I again investigated the matter, in company with Mr. Abraham, on Wednesday, Sept. 29th, when we were able to have suspension raised, and the boy allowed to return to school, and I believe that he has been going regularly ever since and I have heard no complaints since the 29th of Sept. I might add, that this matter was not aired in any form at the last Council Meeting.\n\nI have always considered Mrs. McPherson very earnest in her work as a teacher. I would not advise any further action at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLennan, Esq.,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. Parker also wrote:\n\nFor learning something,\nThis fell like a rain.\nOttawa, November 3, 1926.\n\nMadam:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 20th ultimo, concerning difficulty caused by Walter Sands and his son at the Walpole Island Indian Day School, I wish to state that all pupils at the school are subject to regular classroom discipline. If it is necessary to punish Emerson Sands, do not hesitate to do so; but, in view of the correspondence that the Department has had in this connection, I have to request that you will use considerable tact in dealing with this boy and that you will take no drastic action, such as expulsion, without reporting the matter to the Indian Agent and securing his approval.\n\nThe Department does not wish to condemn the action of this boy or his father; but I am convinced that some of the difficulty has been caused by your own attitude to Walter Sands. I believe you would be well advised to pay less attention to matters which are not definitely connected with your work among the children of the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Macpherson, Teacher of the\nWalpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School.\n\n\"This pupil, Earle Thomas, 14 years of age, is\na chronic nuisance to any school. He has only attended\n11 days out of the 55, yet during that time he broke one\nof the large school windows and wrote filthy notes accom-\npanied by filthy pictures. Unless placed in an institution\nhe will develop into a moral degenerate. His father is\ndead. His mother lives with another man to whom she is\nnot married. Earle receives a pension from the Soldiers'\nCivil Re-Establishment at London, Ont., as his father died\nof war injuries.

She states that Earle receives a pension from the Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment at London, Ont., as his father died of war injuries. I shall be pleased if you will state to whom this pension is paid. If you have the information, you should give the name of this boy's father, his regimental number and the unit with which he enlisted. If this boy should be placed in a residential school, it is considered that his pension should be forwarded to the Department and administered from here.\n\nRelative to Violet Pinnance, I beg to say that this girl's grandmother, Mrs. Esther McCoomes, was appointed her guardian, as her father was killed overseas and her mother is also dead. In this connection I would refer you to official letter of April 1, 1919. If this girl's grandmother does not provide a proper home for her, and she is not attending the day school regularly, the question of placing her in a residential school should be considered, and also the having of her pension money sent to the Department to be administered for her.\n\nI shall be pleased to have a full report from you regarding the case of these two pupils, stating whether you would recommend that they be placed in residential schools, and if a request should be made to have their pension money transferred to this Department to be administered for their use. You might also state with whom Earle Thomas is living, and to whom his late father's pension is paid. Your early attention to this matter will oblige,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nThos. Paul, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBarnes, Ont.\n\nJ. D. Holman,\nAct. Deputy & Secretary.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 15th ult., with reference to the report of the teacher of the No. 1 Indian Day School, Walpole Island, with reference to the case of two pupils, viz.: Earl Thomas, age 14, and Violet Pinnance, age 10, whom she recommends be placed in some school where they will receive proper training.\n\nMorgan Thomas was the father of Earl Thomas, enlisted in the 149th Battalion, regimental No. 845376. I believe that the pension is paid to his grandfather and guardian, Wm. E. Shaddey, Sr. I believe that this boy's attendance at the Indian Day School is very irregular.\n\nRelative to Violet Pinnance, this girl is living with her grandmother and guardian, Mrs. Esther McCoonsee, and the teacher reports that she attends school very regular, in fact, every day. Judson Pinnance, who was the father of Violet Pinnance, was killed overseas. He enlisted in the 149th Battalion, regimental No. 845113.\n\nThe Department of Soldier's Re-Establishment is working on these two cases, and apparently making arrangements to have them placed in the Protestant Orphan's Home in the City of London, with arrangements almost completed. I believe that it would be in the best interests of these two children if they were placed in a home of this kind, and will advise the Department if anything definite takes place.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 14th, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, furnishing information regarding the case of two pupils, namely, Earle Thomas and Violet Fimano, who have been regularly attending the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School.\n\nWe have noted, in each case, the person to whom the pension which is being allowed is paid, also, particulars regarding the regimental number, etc., of the father of each of these pupils. We have, also, noted that the Department of Soldiers' Civil Re-Establishment is endeavouring to make arrangements to have these two children placed in an institution in the city of London. I should be pleased to hear from you later as to whether they were successful in carrying out this arrangement and, also, if the amount of the pension received in each case would be sufficient to provide for their maintenance and tuition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Paul,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ontario,\n\nDear sir:\n\nWould you kindly request the Indian Dept. to consider our application for an increase in salary to begin with the new school term in Sept.\n\nThis application is based on the fact that both Mrs. Macdonald, the junior Room teacher and myself have carried on the school work here most successfully for approximately three years. We have a large school of nearly 75 pupils to handle. Last year by hard and careful preparation we had two successful candidates at the Ontario Entrance Examination held in Wallaceburg. They were the first in the history of this Reserve pass direct from the day School.\nThis year 4 pupils wrote their High School Entrance Examination. The two who wrote for admission to the High School at Algoma Beach were successful. To date the results have not been published for those who tried at Wallaceburg but I feel confident that one, if not both will be successful.\n\nEverything points to the fact that the school year of 1927-1928 will be the most successful of any in the past and so we feel that Dept will look favourably upon our request for an increase in salary. Especially so, because there are so many outside demands upon the teachers salaries to keep our school foremost in the ranks of schools in this district. At present we helping the school children prepare a \"Portfolio\" to be exhibited at the Toronto Exhibition under the auspices of the Junior Red Cross Society in Canada. Our own expert\nto date, in this matter has been nearly $2. It is these and similar expenses which leave us a very small margin for living expenses.\n\nI might state in closing that this school was selected by Inspector Smith C.A. of Chatham, Ontario as the highest type of Indian school in this part of the country. He brought the British Creeks teachers who were teaching in Canada for the year out to sell our school, although he is not our Inspector.\n\nPraying this application will meet with your approval,\n\nI remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nHarriette H.

Phelma went to Walla Walla High School while Phyllis Jacobs and Edna Louise Christie went to attend the High School at Virginia, Mich. \u2014 just across the river from the reservation.\n\nOur only failure this year, as last year, was in manual work. I will advise what would be the best advice to take with this boy. He has been disobedient for two or three weeks now and failed each time he refuses to submit to discipline. His a constant chatter during the school day. He cannot control bother in school and is either 15 or 16 years old. Mr. Smith, the Inspector, on observing this attitude strongly recommends that he should be expelled but I would like the Department to decide in the matter as I do not feel that after three chances he may be allowed to\ntake up time the other pupils are entitled to, in order that I may prepare for entrance while the will never pass.\n\nI might add that he is naturally a clever, likeable boy but has to have training and his parents have always been urged him to oppose the teachers and sit in authority. Last year his father, Walter Sands, came to the school and allowed me to handle myself without a fear. The pupils, having seen and heard statements which really left himself open for court action. The boy takes his attitude from his father who tells him he may do as he likes at school, and a little charm sided with the father, it made matters very unpleasant. However, it would be well if you kept seeing to have the boy continue his education elsewhere\u2014best for the boy and best of the discipline of the school.\n\nPlease advise in this matter at any rate. Could you not include our school, if you make a connection this year. Both teachers, and pupils would feel highly honoured. There are matters which could be discussed more effectively than by correspondence.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, August 12, 1927.\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, with reference to the activity at the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School.

C. M. Clayton several times with his sticks on the face and tried to hit him with his stick. Mr. John Bache, the Customs Officer intervened and pulled the Indians off. A charge of assault has been laid and the trial is to be held in a week. As Walter under his always been a menace to all the white people, no small amount of interest is attached to the trial. The missionary lawyer is anxious that we should be called for.\nwitness to tell of all the trouble Walter Vande caused us and the abuse he gave me.\n\nBeing an employee of the school, we do not wish to bring up an affair of this kind without first consulting you.\n\nRev. Wayton has been most patient and kind and very willing with these people who are most close to him and has instrumental in having the boy Emerson admitted to a white school on the mainland from which he was later expelled.\n\nKindly advise by return mail as to night Tues. Dec. 17th 1928\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nHarriette Macpherson.\nOttawa, December 15, 1928.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, regarding the advisability of testifying at a police court case, which follows an incident on the Walpole Island Indian Reserve. The Department is satisfied that teachers of Indian day schools should keep out of local difficulties as far as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAust.

School hours as held being very irregular.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nArchibald Macdonald\nIndian Agent.\nNo. 1 Indian Bay School\nCold Island Reserve\nWallaceburg, Ontario\nJune 10th, 1929\n\nDear Mr. Perrin,\n\nIn view of the fact that this year there is an Entrance Class of three pupils from this school, would it be possible to close classes for the other grades in June 25th rather than June 28th.\n\nThe boys write on their Entrance Examination at Wallaceburg on June 26-27-28. We usually drive them in and out each day\u2014a distance of 7 miles\u2014teach them in remaining outdoor exams and give them special lessons each evening on the exams for the next day. It takes a great deal of the homestay time. The boys, as the other pupils in the big school here, are also the pupil teachers used for summer vacation, while the Entrance Class are writing.\n\nAlso,\n\nThere is an epidemic of measles among the children of the school. So far there are no homes quarantined, including the school Church Missionary's.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJUN 12 1929\nwhere Mr. Boucher, the Indian Officer, is with whom the Indian agent, Mr. Withfield, resides. Last week there were 32 pupils absent from this school. Friday, June 9th, the junior room was dismissed for the day as there were only 5 pupils present out of 30 enrolled. This was done, pending a visit from the Indian Officer as to how many were really ill.\n\nWhat would the Dept advise in this case?\n\nalso\n\nOne of the officers on the island, Rev. Clayton, whose children attend this school, has drawn our attention to the fact that the water in the school well appears to be impure. Some of the school children have nasty little fevers (temperature of 103 and 104) which one doctor says might point to Typhoid. I asked permission to have the well water analysed, but fail to hear Agent Withfield's attention to the fact that all the refuse water, when the children drink, is in their hands. I have checked noses, rung back into the well because the socket around the pump - i.e., the lid over the well which seems to be cleaning, does not fit tightly. Incidentally, the well has not been cleaned in a while.\nYou will, no doubt, not be surprised in his report that the school floors are most unclean. The class-room floors have not been scrubbed since Christmas vacation. When the janitor's salary for this school was increased to $60.00 a year, it was definitely stated by the Dept. that the class-rooms were to be scrubbed and the windows cleaned once a month. We have drawn the agent's attention to this several times and feel we should not receive a black marking from the Inspector for something we cannot rectify.\n\nOtherwise school work seems to be progressing most favorably and should all feel highly honored. At some time in the near future, you will be paying school visit as we are very proud of our little Indian charges.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, June 12, 1929.\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to closing the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School on June 25th so that proper attention can be given to those pupils who are writing their entrance examinations. Arrangements may be made for the other classes to commence their holidays from the 25th of the month, and Mr. Agent Highfield is being informed. I note with regret that there is an epidemic of measles on the Reserve. The Department is writing to Mr. Indian Agent Highfield concerning the well water.

The other classes may be dismissed for the summer holidays on the 25th of the month, and Mrs. Macpherson has been so informed.

Highfield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Lambton, Ont.\nUnder the above circumstances, I feel that we might get better results, and a fuller cooperation for all concerned, with a change of teachers at No. I School, and quite probably that both Mrs. MacPherson and Mrs. MacDougall would secure better results at a new school where they would have the goodwill of all parents at least to begin with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nI. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, Ont.\nof both Mrs. MacPherson and Mrs. MacDougall, they have become very much disliked by the majority of residents on the Reserve, and it is just under threats of taking action under Section IO of Indian Act that we have been able to keep a number of the children at school at all. As it is claimed by Band members, that were the teachers have quarrelled with the parents, they do not give the children a fair chance\u2014for the above reason it makes it that much harder to keep the children attending school regularly. I would consider that the above two teachers are either directly or indirectly the cause of more petty disturbance on the Reserve than any other element that I know of. They have the Church divided against itself, and keep individuals and families continually at enmity with each other.\n\nAlthough the Department asked Mrs. MacPherson to dispose of her goat sometime ago, it is still in the schoolyard. They did send it away for a few weeks, but it was not long until it was back in the schoolyard again. While they keep it tied on a long rope most of the time, the parents still have the same complaints that they previously had in respect to the goat.\nthe whole term. One is liable to see children in the yard playing at any time of the day, as they seem to have no regular hour for calling school or taking recess, and will dismiss school for an hour or a half a day whenever they feel so inclined, both teachers at this school have been known to close school from a day to three days at a time to go to a fair or picnic, and I have a number of dates down when school has been dismissed from an hour to a half day for no apparent cause the Teachers insist on taking one and a half hours at noon claiming the department gives them this special privilege. If the Department has granted them this privilege it is certainly all right, but Mrs. George, teacher at No. 2 School feels that she is being discriminated against when asked to just take an hour.\n\nMrs. MacDougall, teacher of the junior room at No. 1 School, does not seem to have very much success advancing pupils, and seems to lack tact and in my opinion is too temperamental to be successful as a teacher.\n\nNeither the class-rooms, the residence or the yard or outbuildings are kept very neat or attractive.\n\nOwing to the peculiar temperament and disposition\nA number of children had the measles. And those parents who are not anxious to send their children to school, etc., by giving up they can get the children, etc., etc.\n\nIn reference to the waterloo school, I have been told that a number of the children are absent from the school.\n\nIn reference to each school and teacher, I might say, in respect to Mr. 2 School and the teacher Mrs. Smith R. George, her qualifications are not high. I believe her to be conscientiously doing her best at all times. She keeps school regular, etc., full time, never loses any if she can possibly avoid it. She keeps both the school and living quarters very neat and clean and takes splendid care of all the furniture, also keeps the yard and grounds quite very tidy.\n\nIn reference to Mr. Smith's teachers, Mr. MacPherson and Mr. MacDonell,\n\nI believe Mrs. MacPherson quite well qualified to teach any school if she would attend strictly to her duties in the school, but I have been unable to get her to keep school at anything like full time.

Your comments concerning the teachers of the No. 1 School have been seriously considered, and the Department proposes to write to Mrs. Macpherson at the commencement of the coming academic year, indicating that a change must be made in their work and other activity generally. The teachers will be given to understand that they are on trial for the year and that a change for the better will be expected of them.

I understand that the Department's regulations regarding the school hours have not been followed heretofore and that the school has been opened and closed at unusual hours and that holidays are taken without authority.\n\nThe Department is informed that you do not meet with general support from the parents on the reserve. I understand that this unfortunate situation is not caused by any failure in the classroom activity but is due to out of school activities. Please give this your most serious consideration and bend every energy towards making the school a success during the present academic year. If there is not a marked improvement in the situation, a change will have to be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.-J.-MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMrs. H.K. Macpherson,\nSenior Teacher,\nWalpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School,\nR.R. No. 3,\nBallanacburg, Ont.\nMr. J. F. Mackenzie,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of Sept. 12th, I beg to state that I feel it is a direct insult to the teaching ability and daily life of the teachers in No. 1 Indian Day School.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge and ability, all the statements therein contained are direct falsehoods. The statement that school is opened and closed at unusual hours and holidays taken without authority cannot be substantiated. This school is always opened at 9 a.m. and closed at 4 p.m., except when we teach till 5 p.m. during the spring term to help prepare the Entrance candidates.\nThere used to be some discussion regarding school being called at 1:30 p.m. rather than 1 p.m. But when I came here to teach in March 1922 Mr. Roy Abraham told me to call school at 1:30 p.m. partly because the teachers who must live in residence have their own lunch to prepare and partly because the majority of the children attending this school, including the white children of the officials, go home at noon then for lunch and cannot return till 1:30 p.m. To date this order has never been rescinded.\n\nThere have never been any holidays taken without authority. On the very rare occasions, when school has been closed, the Agent's permission has always first been obtained. This can be verified from the \"School Registers,\" always inspected by the Public School Inspector, Mr. Down of Sarnia and more recently, under the new regime, twice a month by you.\nIndian agent Mr. A. Highfield. He has always told us he has found the reports perfectly satisfactory.\n\nYou have been misinformed as not having the general support of the parents on this Reservation. The attendance at this No.1 Indian Day School has never been better than during the past few years. Just this last year, at least five Indian heads of households, have either bought or leased property in the vicinity of the school that their children might attend classes here. viz., Robert Kenwayworth, Juliana Smith, Raymond Hadden, Frank Day and Job Sands. Further, for the past 4 years the Indians of Woodside Island have always had both Mrs Macdonald and myself take full charge of their receipts $2000 or more from their annual Indian Fair held the latter part of August. Which facts scarcely show a lack of confidence. On the contrary we have both been asked to join the Chippewa Band - which fact, if\ncourse, your informer does not know. \nBut we or any other teacher has \nnever had the support of a small \nband of agitators known as the Treaty \nIndians. But we could not, in \njustice to the Indian Dept., work \nwith them as they approve of nobody \nnot even the Dept. of Indian Affairs \nitself and are constantly holding \nsecret meetings de novo being authority.\n\nPut part of the letter which states \nthat the unfortunate situation is \ncaused by activities outside the \nschool-room, is very ambiguous. Your \nletter is the first intimation that \nthere was any uneasiness re \nno.1 School. We do know that \nthere has been great dissatisfaction \nre no.1 School for some years past. \nFull that the word \"activities\" \nneeds explanation. You say there \nmust be a marked improvement. \nWould you kindly enlarge on this \nstatement as she can hardly \nbe expected to improve something of \nwhich they have no knowledge.\nThe only activities we indulge in outside of school hours are skating, swimming, golf, tennis and motoring\u2014always with ourselves. As far as possible we go away from the Reserve every weekend to Detroit where my brother has charge of an Anglican Mission and we like to help him as much as possible. Practically all our summer my mother, Mrs. Macdonald was in New York where my sister is taking a Post Graduate course in nursing while I was at the Meadowbrook Country Club Northville, Mich where my husband is located. My two children were in private summer camps.\n\nDuring the week, after school hours, we like very much to ourselves as we do not feel there is anybody on the Reserve fit to associate with. Except on rare occasions when we take our own two children to a picture show at Wellandburg, we always retire at 9 P.M. As far as possible, she and her been for the best interests of the Indians.\nIn justice both to the Indian Dept. and ourselves feel that this matter should be investigated. Statements that do not give date, day and explicit data leave a most unpleasant feeling where there should be perfect harmony.\n\nIt is only necessary to consult our files and refer to Inspector Conn's reports or to get in touch with such people as Inspector Smith of Chatham, Baron (name of name), Inspector Stickenson of Wallaceburg, Mr. Lorette O'Connor, Toronto, who is Ontario Director of Junior Red Cross, Capt. Ridderford, Western Ontario Organizer of the Arrangement, Rev. A. Turner of Toronto, Supervisor of Indian Missions for the United Church, in order to learn that to the utmost of our ability all our work here has been to make a success of No. 1 School both in our own interests and those of your Dept., by whom we are employed.\nSomehow, I feel that had there been a different type of Indian agent appointed, these silly childish stories of a few discontented Indians aided and abetted by one or two white people, would be considered too trivial to be conveyed to the Indian mind when there are much more important matters for the welfare of the Indian people needing attention.\n\nPraying you will look into this matter, much more fully and explain in detail, just what changes you desire inaugurated re No. 1 School for the best interest of the pupils etc we are always most anxious to comply with every wish of the Dept.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nHarriette Macpherson\nTo the new Agent, Mrs. Highfield authority to authorize school holidays as in the past? Twice on the instigation of the Anglican rector Mr. Smith, the Agent has told us to take a half-holiday to attend some special service at the Anglican church. On both occasions our better judgement led us to keep school open but send the Anglican pupils to church. They try to force us to make this an Anglican school and the rector calls for the attendance records etc., to forward to his Bishop.\n\nMrs. Highfield asked us to take a partial holiday Monday, Sept. 16th, to attend Somber School Fair at Wilkesport in order to glean new ideas for our own School Fair. In view of\nyour letter we shall refuse, as it would now seem, the officials for some strange reason offer us an occasional holiday and then complain if we take them. We might add that the United Church Missionary, Rev. E.M. Clayton never interferes in school matters except to be of some assistance.\n\nHarriette H. Macpherson\n\n(Mrs) H. H.

Most of them were excellent letters, coming in an intelligent manner for those before the election, and it is regrettable that all could not have been published.\n\nWALPOLE ISLAND AFFAIRS.\n\nTo the Editor of The Globe: In the issue of The Globe of Friday, Oct. 28 there is a reference to conditions on Walpole Island given to the semi-annual meeting of the I.L.U. While the conditions described are not given in the report, the whole tenor of the article gives a bad impression of the island. The very worst condition we have on the island is the persecution of Indians on such as you punish. If such persons would go into industry on the island it would be very much better. They appear to wait to at least an other week before they get a feeling that the gifts sent by the band are not distributed as they would wish. Last year they 25 the English Church with over 300 gifts for the Indians here from bands sent by the government churches, Sunday schools, A.Y.P.A.'s and others. These gifts were carefully made by a committee of Indians selected by the rector.\n\nIn a population of nearly 1,000 there are still many cases of poverty, but so soon as they are known they are dealt with. Referring mid news item Oct. 28, Mr. Hirstfield, Indian Agent, Chief Inspector, Mr. Brigham, Customs Officer, and Mrs. Brigham, who are the former, they know nothing of improper conditions spoken of. Nor do I.\n\nHenry Smith,\nParish Church of St. John the Baptist,\nWalpole Island.\nNovember 5th, 1929.\n\nDear Mrs. Macpherson,\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo in reference to matters at Walpole Island. I had seen something in the press regarding certain differences of opinion regarding conditions among the Indians.\n\nI regret that there should have been any friction and the only advice that I can offer is that you should confine your activities to the school and unrelated work, observe the regulations closely and give your best efforts as I think you have in the past, to the class-room work.\n\nI can see no purpose in your coming to Ottawa. It would mean closing the school for a day which might be further cause for criticism, and I fail to see what advantage could possibly accrue.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMrs. H. H. Macpherson,\nR. R.

In view of the fact that she never takes an extra holiday or even a day for sickness, could the Department kindly grant three extra days at Christmas? I wish to motor to New York and return with them.\n\nAlso, tell agent also.\n\nWith the Dept., please mail our cheques for December quarter salary to reach us here at the school not later than Dec. 20th \u2014 the last day of school.\n\nAlso,\n\nYou might be interested to learn that Walter Sands, the disgruntled Indian frequently mentioned before, is again taking around a petition to have us removed from the school. This time, Mr. Jack Bacheus, the Auditor's Officer is driving him around there as Mrs. Bacheus drove him.\nthree or four years ago.\n\nIt would appear that the Potteattomie Indians residing at the back of the Reservation are signing, but none or very few of the front Indians. I mention this fact because of the similarity of names among the Indian people. Only two parents from this school have signed. Whether this petition will materialize enough to reach Ottawa remains to be seen. Mr. Highfield, the Indian agent tells us it is \"just spite\" and for us not to worry, but still these petty annoyances are most unpleasant.\n\nHowever, in justice to ourselves, felt we should tell you that the complaints are the same old, untrue ones viz:\n\nToo many holidays & irregular school hours.\n\nOur holidays are only those allowed by the Dept. as shown in our registers and quarterly reports. While as we have already stated, we adhere most closely to doing nothing in school hours. We would not like you to think as the petition seems to indicate, that we are acting in open defiance of your regulations.\n\nThanking you for your very kind interest in all matters concerning this school. I remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nMarlette H. Macpherson\nOttawa, December 7, 1929.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, requesting extra holiday leave during the coming Christmas holidays for your mother and yourself, teachers at the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that you may close the school for the Christmas holidays on the afternoon of the 20th instant and reopen after the holidays on January 6th, next.

Highfield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island,\nOnt.\nOttawa, December 7th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on my recent visit of inspection to the Walpole Island Agency.\n\nThere are two day schools on this reserve. I had numerous complaints made to me regarding the teachers at No. 1 school. These were chiefly in regard to irregular school hours, absence from school during noon hour and discrimination against some of the pupils. I understand these complaints have already reached the Department through other sources. It will, therefore, be unnecessary for me to go into detail. I may say, however, that the general attitude of the Indians towards Mrs. McPherson and Mrs. McDougall is entirely antagonistic and there is no possibility, in so far as I was able to judge, of this being overcome. In my opinion these teachers have lost the respect and confidence of the Indian people which to say the least is unfortunate.\n\nI arrived at the school at 3:30 and found the pupils having recess. They were called into the classroom and gave an exhibition of a drill they are preparing for the Christmas season. What I saw of the classroom work was very good. The pupils were tidy and appeared to be well cared for, and in excellent health. This applies to both classrooms of No. 1 school. There is a Junior Red Cross Society in connection with this school.\n\nThos.

Kawagoe that we retain the present teachers & not receive any substitutes.\n\nCarried.\nIn connection with this motion there was a petition handed to me headed to whom it may concern, it is not mentioned in the motion and no instructions with it as where it was to be sent. No doubt it was intended for the Department, I will enclose it.\n\nI am of the opinion that it originated and was typed at the school and was handed to me in an envelope during the council meeting. When I received it there was no signatures attached, the names were added after the motion was passed. Three spoke in favor of the motion and five voted for it, the remainder did not vote at all. Judging by the hesitation and conversation the most of them signed it very reluctantly and one did not sign at all. I see Chief Wm. Peters signed the petition. I heard him lodge a complaint with Inspector McCookin, when Mr. McCookin was visiting the reserve late last year. Councillor E. Pinnance spoke in favor of the motion but stated that a year ago he was much opposed to the teacher owing to the many holidays and lost time but he thought that had improved considerably during the past year and on that ground they were worth another trial. I might say that there is not the lost time there formerly was but there is far too much yet.\n\nArchie Highfield,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 19, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of resolution No. 12 of the Walpole Island Council of the 12th instant, relative to retaining the services of the present teachers of the No. 1 School, and in reply to inform you that the same has been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

On Thursday the 15th May they were chased home from school during noon hour by big boys. They first ran to a house near the school to get away but the big boys still chased them. We live three miles and a half from school and they can't come home at noon. When I called the school teachers, Mrs. McPherson hung up the receiver and would not talk to me. I think when children have to stay at school the teachers should be there to look after them.\nThey often are not there during noon hour or recess, and on Monday, May 12, I saw Mrs. McPherson driving Arthur Miskokomon up the river at 5 minutes after two. This was a school day.\n\nWe want our boys in school but we want somebody there to look after them. If these teachers will not keep school hours, we want new ones. I have asked the agent several times before to make them keep school hours but they are bad as ever, so I am writing straight to you. I hope you will do something about this at once. If nothing is done I will have to take my children out of school, and send them off the Reserve to school. Please...\n\nAnd besides write to me yours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent - Mrs. A.

THOOP, B.S.A.\nRenfrew Collegiate and Vocational School\n\nIt has been pointed out in these articles in The School, that agriculture is a utilitarian subject, and we think should always be taught with this in view, and we believe that no subject on the curriculum lends itself so well to home projects of a practical nature, which really give significance to the work.\n\nSuccessful farming depends on the following factors:\n- Location of farm; accessibility to market.\n- Suitability of buildings for kind of agriculture carried on.\n- Kind and fertility of soil.\n- Tillage, including tillage operations to produce suitable tilth and drainage.\n- Improved live stock by selection and breeding.\n- Selection of seed grain.\n- Judicious use of fertilizers.\n- Control of plant diseases and insect pests.\n- Control of weeds.\n- Suitability of type of farming undertaken.\n- Rotation of crops.\n- Size of farm, machinery, and horsepower.\n- Judicious marketing.\n\nMost of the foregoing topics have been dealt with in previous issues of The School. Except for one or two of them they give a wide scope for home projects to supplement the work done in the class.\n\nIdentification of Trees.\u2014The summer months offer the best opportunities to study plants of all kinds in their natural habitation. The following key will enable us to become more familiar with our common Canadian trees, and trees are perhaps a more important factor in agriculture than we sometimes think.\n\nThe key to the common conifers includes both native conifers and those planted for ornamental purposes.\n\nThe Common Conifers\n\n1. Leaves opposite or whorled, mostly short and often scale-like\nA PET PARK\n\nThere is never a bell rung that Sammie does not answer. He comes running across the fields to march in with the pupils and usually sleeps at the back of the classroom until dismissal bell. Sometimes he follows a class to the floor, waits till they return to their seats and then marches back to his own place. He has learned many tricks due to the patient teaching of his little playmates and is a most useful model in all drawing classes. He will hold any pose until told he may relax and likes nothing better than to sit on a chair in the front of the classroom while the children \"draw\" him. He goes hunting with the boys on Saturday; serves as a patient for bandaging and first aid work, while with the other dog\u2014a police pup \"Peter\"\u2014he has been trained to pull the sleighs for the children. What merry races have been run off this winter, each dog having a cheering crowd of little \"rooters\" to urge him on to victory!\n\nBillie, the goat, was given to the school as a mascot when a mere kid. The children raised him on a bottle. As regularly as intermissions came he would come to the door calling \"mahl mahl!\" The children took turns feeding him. He afforded no end of fun when taught to pull sleighs and what jolly times all had while he learned. He has \"butted\" many a snow fort to pieces and eaten many things of value to small owners. Finally he had to be kept tethered to the fence but that did not prevent ambitious little gentlemen from \"riding the goat.\" In the summer he rests. All vacation, he is locked in the school yard where he keeps the grass cut as short as if it had been cut by a lawn-mower. He is most effectual in scaring away would-be picnickers and other trespassers.\n\nThe white mice were special friends with the girls who trained them to lie under their middy collars or run into their pockets. In this school, many of the children cannot speak English. I have seen little beginners quite forget their shyness and strangeness when given the school kitty or a baby rabbit to cuddle. Every small person becomes quite friendly when talking of a pet animal.\n\nAll our pets are accustomed to being brought into the classroom for nature study lessons, for art models or for geography and they add real interest to these lessons.\n\nThrough these pets our pupils learn kindness to animals, responsibility as to their feeding and housing requirements and above all a love for dumb animals, a love that will stay with them all their lives.\nA Pet Park\n\nHarriette MacPherson\nNo. 1 Indian Day School, Walpole Island Reserve\n\nFor several years, the outdoor activities at our school have centered around a collection of pets who live at the school. I thought perhaps others would like to hear of our experiment.\n\nFirst and foremost, ours is an ungraded school\u2014two teachers\u2014of about 60 or 85 pupils. Our pets consist of a Billy goat, a family of rabbits, a white rat, two dogs, a cat and a family of guinea pigs. There was also a rooster, Tommy, who recently died of old age. Yes, they all belong to the school, live in the shed in boxes constructed by the pupils who take turns looking after them.\n\nDuring the summer, they run at large around the playground. They are fed from scraps left after the children's lunches or from collections brought from home and the pride all the pupils take in them is wonderful. Wouldn't you like to hear more of them and their uses?\n\nSammie, a shepherd-collie comes first by virtue of his age. He is seven years old and came to the school as a puppy\u2014a gift to a little girl.\nstem after haying but when not easy to break it. As man cultivates the field, the rootstocks are torn in pieces and carried to different parts of the field where they grow. If very tough, they could not be separated and spread so easily. If very brittle they would break into small pieces and not be carried so far by animals or machinery. Notice the size of the rootstock. Within it there is stored considerable food which nourishes the cutting until it is established as a new plant. The leaves are rather prominently ribbed and quite hairy below, and, like the stems, they are coarse and not relished by live stock. Of course this is an advantage to the plant because it is not disturbed very much. At the top of the stem appear the flowers. How are they arranged on the stem? These are very unattractive in colour and structure and do not produce perfume. Like many other flowers they are cross-pollinated by wind and do not need to attract insects, but they produce abundance of pollen on their long stamens because the wind wastes so much. If we examine the heads or spikes late in the summer, we shall see the numerous seeds which are rather long and slender. This seed is distributed chiefly as an impurity in coarse grass seed but also by farm machinery, by water and to some extent by wind. Couch grass is propagated much more slowly by seed than by rootstock division, but the seeds as a rule are carried much farther and, therefore, have an important place in spreading the plant.\nMonday, June 16\n\nCapacity Assembly\nAt O.S.B. Concert\n\nMiss Ethel Charlton Presented Memorial Scholarship - Varied Program Heartily Applauded\n\nThe June concert of the Ontario School for the Blind attracted an audience that taxed the auditorium to its utmost. The varied program of work, musical, dramatic and physical, was much enjoyed and each and every number won well merited applause. Mr. W. B. Race, principal of the school, occupied the chair and conducted the programme while all assembled. A notable feature of the program was the presentation of the Ethel Charlton scholarship by Miss Ethel Charlton, twin daughter of the Hon. W. A. Charlton, former Premier of Ontario and former speaker of the Ontario House, and Mrs. Charlton, on whose behalf the presentation was made. Miss Ethel Charlton was a former pupil of the school. A brave array of silver trophies was presented to the respective winners by Mr. W. B. Race, who pointed out that the school curriculum was not concentrated upon any one phase of work but was after all but varied. Miss Charlton expressed her pleasure at being present and coming to the concert so well. She then presented the scholarship on behalf of her mother.\n\nVARIED PROGRAM\n\nThe program was a revelation to those who attended an O.S.B. concert for the first time. The variety and scope of the work accomplished by the pupils under the masterful instruction appeared exhaustless and reflected great credit upon the members of the school staff. The physical work under Major S. C. Geer, which has won such wide acclaim, was outstanding and pupils in the living pyramid building, general mat work, tumbling, handsprings, headstands and somersaults held the close attention of the large audience throughout and won the hearty applause.\n\nThe program opened with a one-act play beautifully staged and comical, \"The Clown of Doodle Dock\" in which Miss Draper's juniors earned the plaudits of the audience from the outset. The parts were filled with the spoken word and music and the enunciation was excellent. The costumes were cleverly designed by Miss Vera Kellett. The part songs displayed fine expression and modulation and were most creditably sung: \"My Bonnie Lass,\" German; \"In Twilight Hour,\" Horne, and \"I Know a Grove,\" Stafford. The solo of the class piano salon, \"Liebestraum,\" by Ella Koch and \"Un Souvenir,\" Listz and \"The Butterfly,\" Laval, by Grace Leaper, were exceptionally well interpreted. Surely of touch and technique were not lacking. Mrs. George Fairlie in her Bach's \"Prelude and Fugue\" scored great applause. Howard Shaw sang \"Captain Mac,\" Sanderson. In fine spirit and responded to a vociferous encore with \"The Road to Mandalay\" which was equally well appreciated. A tender trio of youthful pupils vied in friendly rivalry in their recitations which were inimitably given, as follows: \"Grandma's prayer,\" Helen Self; \"A Mortifying Mistake,\" Leola McWalter; \"Little Dutch Angel,\" Mildred Philips.

When all the parents and many guests from outside points gathered to hear and see the Patriotic Program delivered by the children. As Indians are the first Canadians this point is strongly stressed. Fourteen children were absent from the picture owing to the death of an infant relative.\n\n(2) The clipping from the Brantford Paper refers to Burton Jacobs - the Chief's grandson who was last year sent to the Provincial Blind School at Brantford where he distinguished himself in athletics and won a silver cup. He has been a pupil at No. 1 Indian Day School for 6 years previous.\nThe Annual Excursion to Belle Isle inaugurated 6 years ago was never a more outstanding success than this year. On July 5th we paid for the boat\u2014a slight fee given the Band and the balance provided a treat for the school children. Belle Isle Zoo is a never failing source of wonder and the trip down the River and lake is full of interest. Approximately 200 people attended this year.\n\nThe article in our \"Pet Park\" was written upon the request of Inspector Cowan who has always been interested in this unusual branch of our school work here.\n\nEdward Provance one of our Entrance Class boys won the prize donated by the Selkirk Garden Club.

The Walpole Island Indian School is an important one and care in the selection of new teachers should be taken.

The positions were filled on the recommendation of the Agent by Mr. and Mrs. James W. Daley, who appear to be well qualified.

KIRKBY,\n\nPursuant to telephone conversation with Mr. Burkard, concerning Mrs. H. Macpherson, former teacher of the Walpole Island Indian Day School, I wish to report that she has been employed for a total of 7 years. Complaints and difficulties, which have arisen during her incumbency, indicate that she is hardly suitable for a post on an Indian reserve, particularly when there are missionaries and other white people interested in the same Indians.\n\nMrs. Macpherson has shown a penchant for interfering in all reserve matters and will not confine her attention to the classroom activities, where she has been quite successful. She has been accustomed to close school at unusual hours, without authority, to attend fairs, picnics, court trials, inquests, etc. She would evince a lively interest in any matters affecting the Indians, even when entirely unconnected with school activity. As a result, the parents were divided in their allegiance.\n\nIn 1924, while Mrs. Macpherson was junior teacher, the senior teacher resigned, largely because they could not get along together. In 1925, the Department's Agricultural Representative tried to settle a dispute between Mrs. Macpherson and one of the Indians. Our officer's report reads in part as follows: \"So (the agricultural representative and Indian agent) therefore brought the father and boy over to the school. The boy agreed to behave himself in the future and the father agreed to assist the teachers as much as possible. . . . When Walker Bandis and his son were leaving, the teachers (Mrs. Macpherson and her mother) subjected him to considerable abuse, calling him a real bird and a number of other terms, to which he objected. The father then said he did not think it would be any use sending the boy back if the teacher maintained that attitude.\" At that time, the Department wrote to Mrs. Macpherson in part as follows: \"I believe you would be well advised to pay less attention to matters which are not definitely connected with your work among the children of the reserve.\"\n\nIn 1926, it was necessary to write Mrs. Macpherson as follows: \"I have your letter of the 11th\ninstant, regarding the advisability of testifying at a police court case, which follows an incident on the Walpole Island Indian reserve. The Department is satisfied that teachers of Indian day schools should keep out of local difficulties as far as possible.\"\n\nIn January of 1929, the Indian Agent reported in part as follows: \"Several times I have noticed the school closed when it should be open . . . . school hours being very irregular.\"\n\nIn July, 1929, the Indian Agent reported in part as follows: \"I believe Mrs. Macpherson quite well qualified to teach any school if she would attend strictly to her duties, but I have been unable to get her to keep school at anything like full time. One is liable to see children in the yard, playing, at any time of the day. . . . . Both teachers at this school have been known to close school from a day to three days at a time to go to a fair or picnic. . . . . Neither the classrooms, the residence or the yard or outbuildings are kept very neat or attractive. Owing to the peculiar temperament and disposition of both Mrs. Macpherson and Mrs. Macdonald, they have become very much disliked by the majority of residents on the Reserve, and it is just under threats of taking action under Section 10 of the Indian Act that we have been able to keep a number of the children at school at all. As it is claimed by Band members that where the teachers have quarrelled with the parents they do not give the children a fair chance -- for the above reason it makes it that much harder to keep the children attending school regularly. I would consider that the above two teachers are either directly or indirectly the cause of more petty disturbance on the Reserve than any other element that I know of. They have the children divided against itself and keep individuals and families continually at enmity with each other. Although the Department asked Mrs. Macpherson to dispose of her goat some time ago, it is still in the schoolyard.\" . . . . \"Under the above circumstances, I feel that we might get better results and a fuller cooperation for all concerned, with a change of teachers at No. 1 School, and quite probably both Mrs. Macpherson and Mrs. Macdonald would secure better results at a new school where they would have the goodwill of all parents at least to begin with.\"\n\nFollowing this report from the Indian Agent and reports from other Department officers who visited the Reserve, it was decided that there must be a marked improvement if their services were to be retained. The teachers were written to this effect in September last. I may say that petitions for and against Mrs. Macpherson and her mother have since been received, from Indians, by the Department. The Inspector of Indian Agencies, who visited the reserve in December, reported in part as follows: \"I had numerous complaints made to me regarding the teachers. These were chiefly in regard to irregular school hours, absence from school during noon hour and discrimination against some of the pupils. . . . I may say that the general attitude of the Indians towards them\nis entirely antagonistic and there is no possibility in so far as I was able to judge of this being overcome.\"\n\nPursuant to a report and request from the office of the Honourable Mr. Stewart, these teachers were dismissed in June, last.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nR.F. Ferrier B.A.,\nSupt. Dept. of Education,\nOttawa.\n\nWalpole Island,\nSept. 25/30.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWhen Mr. Mackenzie was here this summer he told me if I ever got into any difficulties in regard to the school to consult you about it. Well, I am in difficulties and of a nature that even a teacher cannot cope with. It seems that the former teachers are instigating a propaganda among the Indians which is bearing fruit among the parents. I have had two complaints about my methods of punishment and in trying to reason with these people find they don't want the children punished in any way. And to make matters more perplexing I get reminded that the other teachers didn't do that.\n\nThese teachers are on the Island nearly every day and the truant officer Mr. Wright tells me he has heard they are telling the parents not to send their children. Of course, Mr. Ferrier, this is all being done without any actual proof but it\nIt certainly very annoying.\n\nI have found the school advanced two and three classes further than they should be and I am told by the inspector, Mr. Conn, that this is usual in all Indian schools. Would you advise me to keep on feeding the children and parents this delusion?\n\nI gave the children in all the senior classes from the Sr. III to Sr. V the letters capital and small, written and printed, and only one pupil got them right.\n\nThe pupils are up well in reading and talk as fluently as white people but surely they are to be taught more than this.\n\nThe agent Mr. Highfield has been very helpful but I feel he cannot understand the situation having had no experience in educational matters.\n\nI hope, sir, you will pardon me for unloading my burdens on you but I surely feel I need help if I am to retain my temper and my school.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJames M. Daley, Wallaceburg R.R. 3.\nOttawa, September 29, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, with reference to difficulties at the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School. It is not unusual to have Indian parents complaining about school affairs, and, while I would always be courteous and pleasant to fathers and mothers, I would not take the matter too seriously. I regret that some of the trouble is caused by the attitude of the former teachers at this school. It may be necessary to advise them to stay off the reserve if their interference does not cease. I am inclined to the opinion that, if you are patient and deal with your problems thoughtfully and quietly, the main opposition to your efforts will cease. If the trouble continues, it may be necessary to look for evidence to the effect that Mrs. Macpherson and Mrs. MacDougall are telling the parents not to send their children to school. This, of course, would be better placed in the hands of the Indian Agent.\n\nWith reference to the classification of the pupils, I believe it would be well to act on the advice of Mr. School Inspector Conn. Generally speaking, the Department wishes the children to be classified strictly on their merits and in conformity with the practice in public schools.\n\nDo not hesitate to take your difficulties to Mr. Highfield, as I am sure you will find him very sympathetic and he will be the one who would have to take action in the matter in connection with anything outside of the classroom and playground activity.\n\nWith best wishes for a successful year,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

The teachers have put a number of the pupils back a grade, whether it was necessary or not, it does not suit some of parents very well.

Patchell, Esq.,\nBarrister,\nCarleton Place,\nOnt.\nRussell T. Ferrer Esq.\nDept. of Indian Education,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMrs. Daley and I are having considerable difficulty here due according to certain of the Indians, to severe punishment which we have given to their children. The objection however has not been to the harshness of the punishment but rather to the punishment in any amount shape or form.\n\nThe family most active in the complaint has a habit of complaining about any and everything and has taken their children from this school before and sent them to a school on the mainland, where they were put out because of unclear heads.\n\nWhen I first came here, I felt we stepped into a school far beyond behind standard in the knowledge they should have known since then Mrs. Daley and myself have worked hard to bring them to the efficiency necessary for the classes they were then in. In order to do\nthis as quick a time as possible we have had to detain after four certain lazy, careless or slow learning children and quite frequently at first to administer Corporal punishment. The chief objection was raised last winter when I kept two boys in till around half past five in order to get them up with their classes, at half past six the parents called me asking why their children were not home. I have witnesses to prove those boys were skating on the river till nearly half past five but still their parents blamed me. Then on the second of March I had trouble again with one of the same boys and from the third until the thirteenth he stayed at home, the parents refusing to send him until they took it before the Indian Council here on Walpole Island. But before this time came the agent got us together and the boy started to school on the thirteenth of March.\n\nLast week I received a complaint that this same boy had vermin and in the checking over I gave personally I found four in the school with vermin, two of them being his brothers following Dr Rowland's advice (the Island Doctor) and getting permission from the Agent, Mr Highfield, I sent all four home to get cleaned up since then a\nperson friend of theirs has lodged a complaint with Mrs. Daley about keeping his boy of whom this guardian is after four and using very insulting language to her over the telephone. The telephone has been used frequently also by the other family to find fault with our methods of running this school.\n\nThe family most to blame is Joe Sands' and Mr. Ferrier, what I want to know is are we doing wrong in keeping these children in after four and in punishing with a strap for continued tardiness or are we in the right? If we are right then I wish to goodness that your department would stop this bother and annoyance which we are subjected to.\n\nHoping to hear from you soon on this matter.\n\nRemain sincerely yours,\n\nJames W. Daley,\nPrincipal & No. 1 School\nWalpole Island.\nOttawa, May 11, 1931.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to trouble Mrs. Daley and yourself have encountered at the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School. It is difficult for one who is not in close touch with the situation to prescribe a course of action in connection with the discipline at a school. After all, discipline is a matter of personal equation. I believe you would be well advised to enlist the cooperation of Mr. Indian Agent Highfield.\n\nAt Indian schools generally, teachers will find a peculiar situation in connection with discipline. Indian parents are not in the habit of administering corporal punishment and, on the whole, they dislike it when used in schools. On the other hand, if teachers are fair and just, there is not often trouble from fathers and mothers. When you do receive complaints or are disturbed by parents, I believe it advisable to inform the Indian agent. He knows the particular father or mother and the home conditions. He can then advise you as to what action to pursue.\n\nGenerally speaking, I would not administer corporal punishment for continued tardiness. I would reserve it for real extremities. Be patient and deal with your problems thoughtfully and quietly.\n\nThe Department understands that you may have special difficulty with certain parents. Do not argue with them. Refer them to the Indian agent and do the best you can at your school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nArnold T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJames F.

The homes are indeed in a very poor condition and the children appear to be suffering as a result. I have arranged for a team of workers to come out and clean up the homes immediately.\n\nI am writing to request your assistance in this matter.

I examined both rooms and found from thirty children existed with three rooms. It was impossible to send so large a number home and they could not be certain that they would be cleaned. I suggested to the Agent and medical attendant that we procure the necessary things and clean the school. With the agent's assistance, I visited the school nearly two days and we washed the floors, walls, windows, etc., with a solution of borax and water. Then the following day we washed the meals at school.\n\nI told the Agent of the department would not pay the nurse the children would not get better sooner Red Cross paid, but I think the treatment should pay it. The charge being four dollars for the meal, two dollars for sweet oil, soap and twenty-five cents.\n\nMr. Mackenzie, I want to know if some means cannot be taken to clean up some of these homes in order to give these children...\na plan to keep healthy and clean\n\nwe have had a week or a note from the parents stating their child has had a bath but I am not sure they haven't seen water below the collar for over months.\n\nI would suggest a nurse visit as soon as possible and make a report on the conditions and suggest a means whereby the homes (of sick children) could be made reasonably clean. Also that the nurse be given authority to examine any child in any other school to see that their body and clothes are kept clean.\n\nIt has come to such a state that Mrs. Daley and myself fear to visit any of our friends for fear of carrying these different things into their homes.\n\nHoping our efforts meet with the approval of the department and that they will support us in cleaning up the children.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJames W. Daley.\nOttawa, November 9, 1931.\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, informing the Department of the action taken in cleaning the heads of a number of the pupils at the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School. It is noted that, with the Agent's permission, the services of a nurse were engaged for two days and some cleaning supplies furnished.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department will pay the expenses incurred for the purpose, and you should have the Agent prepare a voucher, in duplicate, for the amount due the nurse for her services and also for the supplies used. He should make out the voucher in favour of the person to whom payment should be made, certify and send to the Department. In future, however, I would request that before any action is taken involving an expenditure which the Department will be called upon to provide, permission be first obtained by the Agent. It is hoped that, as a result of the action taken, there will be a decided improvement in the cleanliness of the pupils.\n\nFor your information, I am enclosing copy of a circular giving the necessary instructions and treatment to be used in a similar case to that referred to by you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJas.

Whittle, Esq., K.C.,\nBarrister, Solicitor, Etc.,\nLomond Building,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nI beg to enclose the agent's monthly report and the truant officer's monthly report for Walpole Island No.1 and No.2 school for the month of February 1933.\n\nWe have had a very poor average attendance during the month of January and February. Ethel George, teacher at No.1 school, father died on the 21st and was buried on the 24th. Owing to sickness Mrs. Daly Teacher in the Junior room No.1 school was not able to teach for seven days. During the month of January there was quite a lot of influenza some of the pupils losing the whole month, there was some little influenza during February and a lot of persistent coughs in three cases there was some indication of whooping cough but as it did not spread it apparently was not whooping cough at the time Dr. Howland was not possessive but though it was a bad flu cough.\n\nAt the first part of February I went over the truant officer report with Dr. Howland for the month of January. Dr. Howland had seen all the children but three that had been absent from school and the Dr. stated that they were not able to come to school several of them he had told not to come to school. The attendance for February has been a little better but were a lot of absentee reported as flu and coughs and those who send their children because they have to use any excuse of that kind to the limit.\n\nThere are a few other cases such as Roy Newayoshk of No.1 school and Maisy Aquahh Lyron Sword of No.2 and others who are out several day every month to help saw wood or keeping baby at home. These boys are\nabout 15 year old and no doubt can help some at home\nand there are cases where girls stay home to mind\nthe baby or younger children. In some case it may be\nnecessary while the mother go out to work or to sell\nbaskets to get a little money to live on, and there\nare probably other cases where this privilege is abused,\nand it is rather discouraging to the teachers and officers\nwhen they are doing the best they can to have a regular\nattendance. Would the Department think it advisable to\nhave some of the parents of the last mention cases up\nunder section 10 of the Indian act if they persist in\nremaining away from school several days each month.\n\nYour Obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian affairs.\nOttawa Ont.\nMALLACBURG ONT 8\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nOTTAWA ONT\n\nMiss Daley taught junior room three days this week not\nall doctor Rowland said she was not to teach again\nat least ten days will I secure substitute\nVICKIFLD.\nRA32 30 COLLECTING\n\nWALLACEBURG ONT 8\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS 415\nOTTAWA ONT\n\nMS DALEY TAUGHT JUNIOR ROOM THREE DAYS THIS WEEK NOT\nEL DOCTOR ROWLAND SAID SHE WAS NOT TO TEACH AGAIN\nAT LEAST TEN DAYS WILL I SECURE SUBSTITUTE\nSONIE HIGHFIELD.\n\nThis is a Collect message and\nnot to be delivered until\nthe century.\n\nPiece Torn off\nOctober 9, 1877.\n\nA.

It is noted that, owing to illness of the teachers and a number of the pupils, the attendance during the months of January and February was considerably decreased. When weather conditions improve, it is hoped that the children will have regained their health and that a good average attendance will be maintained. The Department does not consider it advisable at the present time to enforce the compulsory attendance clause of the Indian Act. The teachers and yourself should endeavour as far as possible to have the Indian parents send their children to school regularly.\n\nI have your telegram of today's date, regarding the illness of Mrs. Daley, teacher of the junior room in the No. 1 School, and requesting to be advised as to whether you can secure a substitute.

There are 58 Indian children on the roll and 4 whites and there are 80 seats. The teachers have suggested that children between 6 and 7 be not allowed to come, but I do not ask those under 7 to come to school, but for myself I think where the parents want to send children over 6 years they should be allowed to come if there is room. What would the Department suggest in the above case?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ont.\n\nIndian agent.\nOttawa, April 18, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, enclosing your March monthly report and the report of the truant officer for the same period on the Malpole Island No. 1 and No. 2 Indian Day Schools.\n\nIn this connection it is noted that, upon a recent survey of the pupils that may be entering school after the Easter holidays, there is a prospect of 20 children 6 to 7 years of age entering the No. 1 School. It is further noted that there are 58 Indian children on the roll and 4 whites and that there is seating accommodation for 80 pupils. In view of the fact that ample seating accommodation can be provided, it is considered that any Indian children between 6 and 7 years of age should be allowed to attend. The two teachers should be able to manage up to 40 pupils in each of the classes. Therefore, if any of the parents wish to send their children between the above ages to school, they should be permitted to do so. All children over the age of 7 and up to 16 years of age should attend regularly.\n\nIt is noted that there are four white children in attendance. Please state who the parents of these children are and why it is necessary that they attend the No. 1 School.\n\nThe Truant Officer and yourself should put forth every effort to see that all Indian children over 7 years of age, who are in good health and who have no good excuse, attend regularly and also that children between 6 and 7 years of age are permitted to attend if they desire to do so.

George teacher at No.1 school, and the school quarterly reports from No.1 and No.2 schools.\n\nI think probably that the attendance for this quarterly is the poorest average attendance we have on Walpole Island for some time. We have some very severe weather here this winter, and in a number of cases the children were not dressed warm enough to stand long walks in real severe weather. We had no severe sickness, some minor colds and a few mild cases of chicken pox, but enough to keep the children from school. One family with three children attending school lost their home and all their clothes by fire in February and they did not get to school for some time thereafter. And then there is the usual chronic offender, six or eight families who never send their children regularly and never lose any excuse such as bad weather, sickness, lack of clothes, or any other excuse that they may think of to keep their children at home and the only reason they send them at all is that the law compels them to do so.\n\nThe truant officer is doing all he can with these people without bringing them before a magistrate under section ten of the act. They have been warned so often that they don't pay much attention any more. I often feel that it might be well to make an example of some of the worst offenders.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian affairs,\nOttawa Ont.\nHalpole Island\nNov. 19, 1937\n\nMr. A.

He stated that he considered the branch should advertise for these teachers.

Mr. MacKenzie, M.P., also spoke to me about the matter. It would seem quite clear that two new teachers will be required. He did not have any persons particularly in mind and thought the best thing to do would be to advertise in one of the local papers and in this way the best teachers available in the district would be secured. There is a weekly newspaper published at Wallaceburg called \"The Wallaceburg News\" and Mr. MacKenzie suggested that one or two advertisements in this paper would bring forward a good number of applications.\n\nWhen this has been done and the applications are received, will you please furnish a report for the attention of the Minister's Office with your recommendation as to which of the applicants you think should be selected.\n\nC.W.

W. Daley,\nActing Indian Agent.\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRev. Wm. Hall, our Church Missionary on Walpole Island, has drawn my attention to an advertisement in the Wallaceburg newspaper of July the 26th asking for applications for two female teachers possessing Ontario qualifications for the Walpole Island Day School.\n\nMr. Hall draws attention to section 100 Indian Act, Sub-sec.--2., Regulations made by chiefs:\n\nIf the majority of the band belongs to any one religious denomination, the teacher of the school established on the reserve shall belong to the same denomination.\n\nThe Missionary claims that the majority of both bands on Walpole Island claim affiliation with the Anglican Church, and he requests that I draw your attention to the above section of Indian Act.\n\nHe states that parents of the children attending the school complain that the children do not get religious instruction \"from the retired teachers\", and that they desire to see an Anglican appointed. He states also that in the past, teachers did not attend Church on the Reserve and that the influence of this is not good. He writes this not by way of complaint or criticism, since Churchgoing is an entirely\nvoluntary thing, but in the belief that if Anglicans were appointed, he would have an influence over them in this respect. His sole desire is, of course, to benefit the Indians.\n\nI am\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nCharles Thron\n\n[Signature]\n\nCH/O\nOttawa,\nAugust 5, 1940.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of August 3 with reference to the teachers at the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School. When appointing teachers for this school your representations will receive very careful consideration.\n\nIf you are aware of teachers holding Ontario professional qualifications who desire to secure a school for the academic year 1940-41 it would be appreciated if you would arrange to have them forward their applications to me at once. This school will be operated during the academic year 1940-41 for a nine-month term. Salary is at the rate of $25.00 a teaching month and teachers' living quarters are provided.

We could not recommend her for a certificate however even after the second half year. If discipline were not so difficult she might meet with success in our Junior School.\n\nHer standing in teaching was 60% when 66% in a passing mark.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nC. S. Mark\nOttawa,\nAugust 33, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nIMMIGRATION MINISTER\n\nRe: Employment of teachers -- Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School.\n\nI desire to refer to my memorandum to you dated July 17, 1940, and Mr. Jackson's reply thereto dated July 18.\n\nIn response to the suggestion made in Mr. Jackson's memorandum an advertisement was inserted in the Wallaceburg News and two applications for the vacant positions at the above-named school have now been received. We are also in receipt of a letter from Rt. Rev. C.A. Foster, D.D., LL.D., Bishop of Huron, expressing the hope that the Department will find it possible to appoint Anglican teachers to the vacant positions. It would appear that practically all the children in attendance at this school are members of the Anglican Church. Two applications for these positions have been received -- one from Miss A.C. Eileen Field, who is an Anglican and who has a first-class permanent teacher's certificate for Manitoba and 6\u00bd years' teaching experience. Miss Field has taught one year in a white school and 6\u00bd years in Indian schools in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. During the last 3 years she has taught in the junior room of the Indian day school on the Fairford Reserve and her services were eminently satisfactory.\nThe other application is from Dorothy E. Isaac, an Indian of the Walpole Island Reserve. This girl completed a high school course about 2 years ago, having received a tuition grant from the Department for that purpose. She has also taken 16 months' training at the London Normal School. The Principal of the London Normal School, in response to a Departmental inquiry, states:\n\n\"Miss Isaac is a young lady of considerable refinement of manner and fair ability as an academic student. We could not, however, recommend her for a certificate even after the second half year. If duties were not too difficult in the school she might meet with fair success. Her standing in teaching was 80% and 65% the minimum pass mark.\"\n\nIn view of the fact that we have but two applications for the vacant positions I recommend that Miss Field be employed to take charge of the senior room and that Miss Isaac be employed to take charge of the junior room, on the understanding that her employment is temporary and that her continuance in the school will depend wholly upon the reports received by the Department from the Public School Inspector.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum to;\n\nDr. H.W.

Mines & Resources\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFor some time I have been going to write you regarding the teacher in the Junior Room of Bo I school, Dorothy Isaac.\n\nAs far as I can see Miss Isaac is useless as a teacher, due directly to the fact that she does not manage the room at all. I believe that the girl is working very, very diligently but she is too mild and kindly in the Indian sense of kindness. I had hoped that as the year wore on she might have improved in this matter but as far as I can see she is no better.\n\nDuring Bishop Seagers visit to this Reserve the teachers and pupils were over to the church during the service Miss Field, the Senior room teacher became ill and had to leave, up until this time the children were under control, but after Miss Field left Miss Isaac made no attempt to curb the children. Finally it became so bad that I had to check them myself.\n\nI rather hesitate to write this as I have a selfish reason perhaps as our own son is ready to start to school and we cannot under the conditions send him to Bo I school. If it isn't the best for our son then it isn't the best for the Indian children either.\n\nCan a change be made at the summer holidays?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJames W.

She is a widow and has had considerable experience in Indian work as her husband was at one time principal of an Indian residential school in western Canada. She holds Ontario qualifications and for the past two years has taught at the Moraviantown Indian Day School.\n\nAssistant Teacher - Miss Ida G. Fairservice. This lady taught successfully for several years at the Fairford Indian Day School in Manitoba.\n\nI am hopeful that under the guidance of the above named two teachers good work will be done at the Walpole Island No. 1 School during the coming year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

I had the senior class at Windsor, if it is the junior Room...\nI'd prefer a classroom elsewhere with at least some remedial work if there is an opening in another school before October 1st.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAdam Thierservice\nOttawa,\nAugust 28, 1941.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of August 16 and have carefully noted your request. For your information I wish to quote from a letter sent to Mr. Jas. W.

I feel it would not be fair for me to expect her to teach the junior form and don't feel like teaching all primary grades when I haven't taught them for so long.\n\nMiss Ross wrote me and asked if I would be free to take her classroom, and that she would send my name in when she resigned so when I accepted the school I was\nunder the impression it was her classroom and wouldn't have accepted the appointment for all \"primary work.\" Therefore I would like to withdraw my application for the school at Walpole Island, and I trust the Department will understand that it was a mistake that I accepted and that I wouldn't withdraw my application otherwise. I feel sorry this has happened, but I felt another teacher can be procured that would be better at the primary work than I being away from it for too long.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAda Haifservice\nOttawa, September 5, 1941.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDear Madam,\n\nI am enclosing herewith cheque No. 9308, in your favour, for $34.61, refunding the amount of your contributions to the Civil Service Retirement Fund, together with interest.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nL.

Are you aware of any qualified teacher who would be willing to accept the appointment to the junior room at the Walpole Island No. 1 School for the coming academic year?\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Jas. W. Daley,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nOttawa, September 13, 1941.\n\nDear Doctor Christie:\n\nI have now acknowledged your letter of September 8, written by you on behalf of Mrs. R. J. Ross, who has recently been appointed by the Department to the principalship of the Walpole Island Indian Day School. The Minister is at present absent from Ottawa and is not likely to return for several days.\n\nI have discussed the subject matter of your communication with the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch. These officials feel that some misunderstanding appears to exist in respect to the appointment of Mrs. Ross to the Walpole Island School. The records in the Department indicate that the Reverend R. J. Ross retired from the principalship of the Round Lake Indian Residential School early in the year 1935. Immediately following his resignation he was re-appointed by the Home Mission Board of the United Church to a mission station at Moraviantown, Ontario. Mrs. Ross at that time was nominated for the position of day school teacher at the Moraviantown Indian Day School. It was pointed out, however, to the United Church authorities at that time that married women were not eligible for such appointments under the then existing regulations. In view of the fact, however, that Mrs. Ross was particularly well qualified to undertake instruction at the school, and in response to the representations made to us by the United Church, we appointed her to the position, in violation of our own regulations.\n\nThe Department was notified by the Reverend Dr. Dorsey, on behalf of the Home Mission Board of the\n\nDr. H. E. Christie,\nSupervisor of Medical Services,\nDept. of National War Services,\nOttawa.\nUnited Church, on June 14, 1941, that the Reverend R. J. Ross had died in May, and in the same letter the church authorities nominated F. J. Dodson to take charge of the Indian school and to act as missionary on the Moraviantown reserve. This decision on the part of the church authorities meant that Mrs. Ross was compelled to retire from the position of teacher at the Moraviantown school at the end of the academic year 1941. The Department, in a letter to the Reverend Dr. Dorsey dated June 16, 1941, intimated to the United Church that inasmuch as Mrs. Ross' services had been satisfactory, we were prepared to nominate her for the principaship of the Indian school at Walpole Island, provided that it was not the intention of the United Church authorities to nominate her for a school operated by the Department in co-operation with them. Dr. Dorsey, in his reply dated June 17, 1941, stated:\n\n\"I note what you say about Mrs. Ross. I may say that Mrs. Lovers, of the Woman's Missionary Society, has asked Mrs. Ross if she would accept nomination by us, but so far she has not seen her way clear to do so. Consequently, if you desire to communicate with her regarding the vacancy at Walpole Island, I think you should be free to do so. She can then make up her mind as to which position she will accept, as I know she has received a suggestion from the Woman's Missionary Society.\n\nImmediately following the receipt of this information, Mrs. Ross was appointed to the Walpole Island School. This is a two-room school. Mrs. Ross will receive $80.00 per month and, in addition, free furnished quarters, fuel, light, etc. The officials of the Indian Affairs Branch are not aware of any other school in the Dominion where conditions would be more congenial for Mrs. Ross than at Walpole Island. In addition to the accessibility of the island, she will have -\nhave the constant companionship of an associate teacher. In making this appointment the officials of the Department were prompted almost solely by personal considerations for Mrs. Ross. This school was in their judgment the best school available this year.\n\nYou can readily appreciate that it is somewhat difficult to give the full history of this particular appointment in a letter at this time. The officials of the Indian Affairs Branch would feel deeply indebted to you if you could find it convenient to call at the office of the Superintendent of Welfare and Training at any time and pursue the correspondence in respect to the employment of Mrs. Ross by the Department - first at Moraviantown and then at Valpole Island.\n\nIndian day school teachers are classified as temporary Civil Servants. They do not contribute to the Superannuation Fund and are not eligible for superannuation allowances. The superannuation to which you refer is no doubt superannuation allowance for which provision has been made by the United Church.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. J. F.

I met Inspector Pearson in Chatham and had a nice chat with him. He would have liked me to go to the Indian convention this last weekend\u2014but I told him I had not yet been appointed by the government. Then he asked me to send him the number of my certificate as soon as I heard of any appointment.\n\nI have heard nothing yet, but so I felt it was a matter of form. I have gone ahead getting ready to teach in Walpole Island. Tonight I rent my apartment for next week and hope to be on the right road. I could not wait today.\nas people must give two weeks notice to their tenant on leaving an apartment to take another.\n\nI have just been terribly busy every minute. I have reviewed some primary reading and number work and I hope to do more. Some of the city teachers are getting some seat work for me and everybody wants me to go so I hope I shall arrive. My painting pupils are pushing to get one to help them finish half done work but I'm trying to do as little as possible. I'm leaving my house to some military people and I'll have quite a bit to straighten up before they come so I hope I'll not overdo. As soon as I hear from fellows I shall feel more settled and certain of what I'm doing.\n\nRemember me to dear Rose, and\n\nmy kindest regards to dear Sally.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nOct. 16, 1941\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. Mines & Resources\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhile on a trip to London recently I interviewed Miss Phillips in regard to coming to Walpole Island as Junior Room teacher. She came to this Reserve and inspected the school and wished to be considered as a teacher. On her way home she called on Inspector Pearson who inspects Walpole Island school. He informed me at Teacher's Convention that he did not believe this lady was very practical.\n\nSince that time I have received a letter from her in which she states that she has made certain arrangements in order to come to Walpole Island. I am enclosing this letter.\n\nIn view of what Inspector Pearson said and my own opinion I do not believe it wise to hire this woman. If your department agrees with me in this connection I would appreciate you writing her a letter direct informing her of your decision.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJames W. Dale\nIndian Agent\nOttawa,\nOctober 28, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 16th instant with reference to Miss Phillips.\n\nAs you have conducted all negotiations with Miss Phillips the Department feels that it is your duty to notify her that her services will not be required at the Walpole Island No. 1 School.\n\nI trust you will continue your efforts to secure a teacher for this school.\n\nIn regard to your letter of the 15th instant salary will be allowed Mrs. Dalgety at the rate of $55.00 a teaching month.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Mines & Resources\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI went to Wallaceburg on Oct. 16, and interviewed Mrs. John Taylor as a prospective teacher for the Jr. room at No. 1 School. Mrs. Taylor informed me that she would let me know if she would consider taking the position. She has finally called and told me that if we could not get another teacher that she would take the school until Christmas. It is my belief that if Mrs. Taylor comes as teacher at No. 1 School that she will reconsider and possibly stay until the summer holidays.\n\nMany outsiders seem to be of the opinion that Walpole Island is a very desolate place during the winter but after they get here they find it not nearly as unpleasant as they thought. Mrs. Taylor comes highly recommended by Inspector Pearson who inspects the Walpole Island Schools and in fact, it was on Mr. Pearson's recommendation that I called on Mrs. Taylor. I would respectfully suggest that we look no further and if your department has not already hired another teacher that we notify Mrs. Taylor of her appointment to the school. Her address is Mrs. John Taylor, Wallaceburg, Ontario.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJames W.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Jas. V. Daley,\nIndian Agent,\nSalpole Island, Ont.\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI am writing you about the situation at No. 1 school for the coming year. I had written Mr. Arneil regarding the same but understand that he is away at present.\n\nFrankly we do not want Mrs. Ross back as teacher if it can be avoided. This is possibly a great deal of selfishness on our part but we feel that we do not care to have our own boy soured on school life and this feeling is also true of Mr. & Mrs. Bachus the Customs officer on the Reserve. In all fairness to Mrs. Ross I believe her to be a good teacher but feel that she came here at the wrong time. Her husband had died shortly before she came, she had her heart set on a school I believe on Lanesey or some other Reserve and as a result there wasn't anything right about Walpole Island or the school. Our Indians are much more stupid than other Indians (in her opinion) and as a result this attitude has been carried into the school room. It got to such a state that one of my most sensible Councillors stated in council that if things didn't improve that he would not send his children to school even if we put him in jail. Mrs. Ross was well liked and highly respected on Moraviantown Reserve as a teacher and it seems a pity that an exchange with some other teacher could not be made.\n\nThe Bachuses and we do not feel that we can afford to send our children to a school on the mainland but we will have to do so if things happen which we foresee will happen. Mrs. Bachus mentioned about her little boy being of a nervous disposition and Mrs. Ross answered her that when she gets to teaching him she would take the nervousness out of him.\n\nMrs. Taylor teacher in the Junior room last year is very efficient and on top of that has natural ability to understand children. Her husband has but recently been operated on for cancer of the bowel. She could come back when school starts if she were in charge of the residence and could bring him with her.\nHe is not bedridden and could help some around the school.\nIf Mrs. Ross comes back Mrs. Taylor may not be able to come until the end of October.\nIf you can do anything about this situation it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nJames W. Daley\nJAMES W. DALEY INDIAN AGENT\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nOctober 6th, 1943\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Canada,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been teaching in the Walpole Island No. 1 School since September 1st, substituting for Mrs. Ann Taylor, and expect to be here all this month.\n\nThe other teachers began some days ago.\nbut I have not received notice.\n\nYou deducted $16.36 from the June cheque. Will you please explain why so much was deducted.\n\nYours truly,\nCharlotte McClose\nOttawa,\nOctober 9, 1943.\n\nMr. Jas. W. Dalby, Indian Agent, Walpole Island, Ont.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter today from Mrs. Charlotte Walton requesting her salary for the month of September. If you refer to official telegram of August 31 you will note that you were requested to state the approximate date on which Mrs. Taylor would resume duties. If you had replied to that telegram we would have known how long Mrs. Walton would be in charge of the school and would have placed her name on the pay list. As you did not reply, we did not pay her and, therefore, any delay in the matter is due to your neglect to answer our telegram.\n\nMrs. Walton also requests information regarding the deduction of $15.56 from her June salary cheque. This was computed as follows:\n\nPayment from June 7 to June 30 inclusive\n(24/30 of $85.00) ........................................ $ 68.00\n\nBonus (17% of $68.00) ................................. 11.56\n\nTotal: $ 79.56\n\nIn computing the amount of income tax the basic salary is considered. This was $85.00, plus 17%, or a total of $99.45. The income tax on a person drawing salary at this rate per month is $19.20; 24/30 of $19.20 is $15.36, which amount was deducted from the gross cheque, leaving a balance of $44.20 which was sent to her.\nIf, at the end of December, 1943, Mrs. Walton has not earned the amount of $660.00 during the calendar year 1943, she can prepare an income tax return and apply for the refund of the tax.\n\nR.A.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nWalpole Island, Ont.,\nApril 12, 1944.\n\nDept. of Mines & Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRe No. 1 School\n\nAs you are aware the teachers at No. 1 School are Marybell Ross and Mrs. Walton. Mrs. Ross is the principal. Mrs. Walton is hired temporarily until another teacher could be secured for the junior room. As you will recall Mrs. Taylor was the junior room teacher and because of the illness of her husband, had to give up the school. She has since been made assistant principal for one of the town schools in Wallaceburg, and naturally is not interested in coming back here.\n\nMrs. Ross and Mrs. Walton do not get along well together, I do not care to take sides in the matter but believe that one or other should be let go, preferably Mrs. Walton.\n\nI make this suggestion because of Mrs. Walton's age, and also because she is only on temporarily. May I suggest that before anything definite is done that your department write Mrs. Ross regarding this matter, possibly a copy of this letter could be forwarded to her, but would appreciate it very much if she would keep it confidential.\n\nJames W.

I wrote you on August 9th with reference to Mrs. Dalgety but have not yet received any reply.\n\nI am not sure exactly what Mr. and Mrs. Anderson mean in their letter, but it appears to me that Mrs. Morrison would be willing to accept less money in order that she would not have to pay income tax.

I did not know this until the last minute as the school board did try to get someone to take her place. I believe that she wants to come here if the position is still open at that time.\n\nAfter talking with Mr. Hoey by phone I wired Mr. & Mrs. J.E. Anderson Kitchener C/O General Delivery and asked them to either phone or wire where I was to meet them in Kitchener but I have still received no word from them. Therefore I did not go from Brantford over to Kitchener yesterday but came back home. I phoned home from the school there on the chance that they might have wired after I left but of course they hadn't. I am proceeding to write them again giving them a copy of Mr. Phelan's letter to me and will direct them to write direct to you.\n\nJames W.

Would you consider such a teacher as a teacher?\n\nPlease advise us soon as possible as to your short and we are interested in your reply.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary\nF.

I went to Brantford but did not go to Kitchener as I had no street address.\n\nAs stated on the phone I had every hope of getting Mrs. Dalgetty but at the last minute her school board were unable to get another teacher and Mrs. Dalgetty felt that she had to go there. There is, however, a chance that she might be able to come yet at the end of September.\n\nI am writing again to the Anderson's in the hope that we might still get them if they would be satisfactory but in view of the circumstances I feel that they should be interviewed. I ask them when they wrote to you to state qualifications, ages etc. and I note that they gave you no information as to themselves. I shall report again later if anything comes from them.\n\nJames W.

As you are aware Rev. Marshall only took the Room in the school until such time as we were able to engage another teacher. Since that time I have tried several teachers but have been unsuccessful in hiring any. Myrtle Williams has been working in Detroit for sometime and certainly has the ability to handle the room under the supervision of Mrs. Dalgetty as Principal. In fact Mrs. Dalgetty was the first to draw my attention to Myrtle as a possible teacher in the junior room. I certainly would recommend her having known her for many years; in fact she is a former pupil of mine. If this application meets with your approval I would appreciate hearing from you at your earliest convenience.\n\nJAMES W.

W.

I am keenly concerned that adequate training be made available to our people.\n\nThanking you for any information you may have.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. A. R. Marshall\nJune 28, 1946.\n\n[Signature]\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of June 24.\n\nMr. Phelan, Chief, Training Division, will be in your vicinity next week and will visit both the Agent and yourself in connection with these schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBernard Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend A. R. Marshall,\nThe Rectory,\nWalpole Island,\nOntario.\n\nCOPY SENT TO INDIAN AGENT DALEY\nAttention Mr. Phelan\n\nDept. Mines & Resources Indian Affairs Branch Ottawa\n\nMorley McCracken from Sarnia called this morning by phone and informed me that you were trying to get me by phone yesterday. I was not in the office a great deal of the time yesterday but Mrs. Daley was at home and should have heard any calls here.\n\nAbout the school situation on the Reserve No 2 school is in charge of Mrs. Ethel George and it is her desire to stay. You are aware of her qualifications and I believe that her report from the Inspector is fair.\n\nAt No 1 we have Mrs. Maude Dalgetty in charge, part of the past academic year she taught the Junior room, and part of the year the Senior room after Mr. Marshal was relieved by Myrtle Williams, Indian, of this Reserve.\n\nThere would appear to have been misunderstanding about Mr. Marshal giving up the school. I understand that he said that he would take the senior room until another teacher could be procured; he now insists that he said that he would keep the room until another qualified teacher could be procured. Myrtle Williams was talking to Mrs. Dalgetty and told her she would like to take the junior room and it was agreed that if she would come to the room and work under Mrs. Dalgetty for a week or so and if she was then able to carry on, Mrs. Dalgetty would recommend her to this office. Mrs. Dalgetty was satisfied that Myrtle could do the work and under that recommendation, I recommended her to you. Her subsequent good work has justified that recommendation. The new school inspector has stated that she is doing the work all right but that she is using the older methods.\n\nMr. Marshal was here sometime ago and stated that he thought that the teachers of the school should be mission workers and that they would be a great help to him in his work; I appreciate his reasoning and if all things were equal I would\nfavour his plan but we have a qualified teacher in charge of the school, and we have an Indian girl doing a reasonably good job teaching the Junior room; the teachers get along well together, there is no question about the living quarters, I certainly am not in favour of a change.\n\nFrankly, I am not in favour of the church interfering with the day schools anyway, if ministers wish to enter the schools to teach their particular tribe that is fine but as the Department does the paying, the churches should stay out of the management. I have every respect for Mr. Marshal and did appreciate him stepping in when he was sorely needed, but now other teachers are there and I feel that he should run his church and the teachers, and the Dept. run the school.\n\nI hope that you do not think I am being too blunt in this matter.\n\nJames W. Daley\n\nJAMES W. DALEY INDIAN DEPT.\nOttawa, July 12, 1946.\n\nMr. James W. Daley, Indian Agent,\nWalpole Island, Ontario.\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to the teaching services on the Walpole Island Reserve.\n\nThe services of Mrs. Dalgety, as Principal of the Walpole Island No. 1 School, and also the services of Mrs. George, as teacher of the Walpole Island No. 2 School, should be retained for the academic year 1946-47.\n\nI note your report regarding Miss Myrtle Williams. While you state she has done reasonably good work, at the same time it must be realized that she is not a qualified teacher.\n\nDo you consider that it would be possible to secure a qualified teacher to replace her? Please give this matter your immediate attention and let me have an early reply.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F. Healy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nNo. 1 School, Walpole Island\n\nThe Indian Agent informs me that he does not intend advertising for teachers; this is a two-roomed school with a small teacherage for the two teachers. Last summer the agent did nothing to secure teachers and in September the school was unable to open.\n\nThe agent is interested financially in the Algoma-Walpole Ferry service, operated by his life long friend Mr. M. Dalgety. Mrs. Dalgety is a school teacher. Last year the Dalgetys were in a sad plight because they had to vacate the house they rented on Walpole Island and nothing else suitable offered. The agent then arranged for Mrs. Dalgety to take the No. 1 School, and the family (5) occupied the teacherage.\n\nI was asked to teach, and agreed to take the senior room until a teacher could be secured. Later the agent arranged for an Indian girl with only one year's high school (gained whilst an inmate of an American Home of Correction) to take charge of the Junior room, as Mrs. Dalgety asked for the senior grades and I was unwilling to take them.\n\nNow the position is that the teacherage is occupied by the Dalgety family so that a second teacher could not possibly be accommodated, and the Indian people feel that the arrangement was merely one to suit the Dalgetys and the agent whom they claim is a sleeping partner in the ferry business.\n\nIt should be noted that this year under my tuition the first pupil to qualify for High School passed, the first pupil in a number of years. This is not a church controlled school - it used to be, and in those days we graduated Grade VIII pupils regularly and sent one or two to University. I do not feel that the criticism of church operated schools is justified - and it is encouraged by the Indian Department officials because they want full control themselves. When we have Christian teachers, or missionaries serving a principal, we have people interested in the Indians, not teaching for a job.\n\nOn Walpole Island, as an example of a Departmentally run school, we have had only one real certificated teacher since the Department took over from the church. We need teachers who are interested in the moral and physical training, and these are best assured by securing missionary hearted people.\nNo. 2 School, Walpole Island\n\nThis is a one roomed school with a native teacher whom the Indians do not regard very highly. She is a married woman who was living apart from her husband, but I believe the husband has now died. I am concerned at the fact that the pupils never get beyond Grade VI, and the conditions around this school are notoriously immoral.\n\nRev. A. R.

Bryce, Member of Parliament for Selkirk, I am referring only to those sections of his letter which deal with the teachers and schools.\n\n1. Mrs. Maude Dalgety - Senior Room Walpole Island No. 1 Day School.\n\nThe Inspector's report on this school is dated June 25, 1946 and is signed by Mr. J.L. Barrett, Inspector of Schools for the Province of Ontario. Mrs. Dalgety has a Permanent First Class Certificate and has had eleven and a half years teaching experience with two and a half years in Indian schools. She taught last term at U.S. No. 16 in Chatham Township.\n\nThe Inspector rates this teacher as follows:\nA (excellent) for Appearance, Health, Personality, Initiative, Discipline, Relations, and Management. B (good) for Teaching skill, Preparations, Language, Community Service and Pupils' progress.\n\nUnder General Comments Mr. Barrett says:\n\"Mrs. Dalgety is a competent teacher and the work in general is good. A splendid craft programme is being carried on.\"\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn view of the above report I notified the Indian Agent on July 12th, that the services of Mrs. Dalgety should be retained in her present position.\n\n2. Miss Muriel Williams - Junior Room Walpole Island No. 1 Day School.\n\nThe Inspector's report on this school is dated June 25, 1946 and is signed by Mr. J.L. Barrett, Inspector of Schools for the Province of Ontario. Miss Williams has no professional certificate and no previous teaching experience.\n\nThe Inspector rates this teacher as follows:\nB (good) for Appearance, Health, Initiative, Relations and Community Service and C (fair) for Personality, Discipline, Management, Teaching Skill, Preparations, Language and Pupils' Progress.\nUnder General Comments, Mr. Barrett writes:\n\n\"Miss Williams is doing fair work for an inexperienced and unqualified teacher. She has profited by the help Mrs. Dalgety has given but she definitely needs professional training. It is only natural that she should teach as she was taught and, in consequence her methods are somewhat outdated. However, she is drilling on the fundamentals to such an extent that the children are leaving her room knowing a fair amount of factual material. The size of the class would present a real challenge to an experienced teacher and it is to Miss Williams' credit that she is doing as well as she is.\"\n\nConclusion:\n\nAfter reading the above report, I wrote as follows to the Indian Agent on July 12th:\n\n\"I note your report regarding Miss Myrtle Williams. While you state she has done reasonably good work, at the same time it must be realized that she is not a qualified teacher.\n\nDo you consider that it would be possible to secure a qualified teacher to replace her? Please give this matter your immediate attention and let me have an early reply.\n\nAs yet I have received no reply to this letter.\n\n3.

Barrett, Inspector of Schools for the Province of Ontario. Mrs. George has no professional teaching certificate but she has been teaching for some forty-four years with twenty-two years in Indian schools.\n\nNote: (She was first appointed as teacher of the Kettle Point School in the Sarnia Agency on January 1, 1907. She was transferred from that school to the Walpole Island School on January 1, 1924).\n\nThe Inspector rates this teacher as follows:\nB (Good) on practically the entire scale.\n\nUnder General Comments Mr. Barrett writes:\n\n\"On the whole the pupils are making fair progress. Many, however do not begin school soon enough and, hence, are over-age for their grade. More Manual Training would seem advisable in order to create an interest in school and help those not academically inclined. Additional copies of the \"Dick and Jane\" readers are needed. The teacher is to be complimented upon the neat and attractive appearance of the grounds\".\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn view of the great shortage of certificated teachers and Mrs. George's long and satisfactory experience I wrote to the Indian Agent on July 12th and told him that the services of Mrs. George should be retained for the academic year 1946-47.\"\nGeneral Comments:\n\nI have this day wired Mr. Phelan in care of the Indian Agent at Sarnia to proceed to Walpole Island and there to interview both Indian Agent Dalby and Reverend Mr. Marshall. I feel that there can be no complaint about the services of either Mrs. Dalby or Rev. George. We have already indicated to the Agent that he should replace Miss Williams with a certificated teacher. Insofar as the teachings being used by the Dalby family, I would prefer withholding comment on this until hearing from Mr. Phelan.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

Bryce from Reverend A.E. Marshall, Indian Missionary, Walpole Island, Ontario, I immediately phoned the latter and arranged to see him at ten thirty A.M. Friday, July 26th.\n\nI met him at the time mentioned above and had an interview with him lasting one hour.\n\n...POLE ISLAND No. 1 School.\n\nDuring the academic year 1945-46 this school was in charge of Mrs. Delgetty as Principal and Miss Myrtle Williams as Assistant. The former is a fully qualified teacher but the latter who is an Indian girl has no professional qualifications.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delgetty was appointed in September, 1945, the Indian Agent did not advise this Branch that the teacher, her husband and three children would occupy the teacher's living quarters at the No. 1 School. As a result, when the second teacher was secured it was necessary to obtain someone who would not live in the teacher's quarters as their would be no accommodation for another person in view of the fact that the quarters were being occupied by a family of five.\n\nNever Mr. Marshall admitted that Mrs. Delgetty was a good teacher but took exception to the situation that has existed with regard to the living quarters and also to the employment of an unqualified teacher as assistant.\n\nMr. Marshall who is an Anglican Missionary of the Walpole Island Reserve has held that position for the past year and appears to be extremely interested not only in the education of the Indian children but in their general social welfare. He expressed the opinion that if we could secure a man and his wife to take charge of this school, it would be the ideal situation. I agreed with him but pointed out that it was difficult to secure such teachers. He admitted that he did not know of such a couple at the present time but that it might be possible to secure such a couple in the future.\n\nFor the academic year 1946-47, he felt that it would be desirable to appoint two female teachers who would not only carry on the school in a capable manner but would give him some assistance in organizing boy scouts, girl guides, etc., and thus improve the general situation on the Reserve. In view of the difficulty we have experienced in obtaining teachers these past few years, I told Mr. Marshall that we were not aware of any two qualified female teachers. He expressed the opinion that he could secure them. I told him that if he could do so, he should let us know early in August and that I felt certain that the Department would approve of such appointments. Reverend Mr. Marshall intends to be present at an Anglican conference at Bayfield, Ontario, during the current week and I promised him that a letter would be written to him authorizing him to secure if possible two qualified female teachers for the coming academic year.\nThe Indian Agent appears to regard the services of Mrs. Dalgetty very highly and did not see any reason against allowing herself and family to occupy the living quarters at the No. 1 School. He also expressed the opinion that the Indian girl who served as assistant had done fairly well.\n\nI believe that Reverend Mr. Marshall can secure two qualified female teachers and that they would work in conjunction with him and that such co-operation would be beneficial to all the Indian children in the vicinity of the No. 1 School.\n\n**WILLOE ISLAND NO. 2 School.**\n\nReverend Mr. Marshall's letter to Mr. Bryce regarding this school reads as follows:\n\n\"This is a one roomed school with a native teacher whom the Indians do not regard very highly. She is a married woman who was living apart from her husband, but I believe the husband has now died. I am concerned at the fact that the pupils never got beyond Grade VI and the conditions around this school are notoriously immoral.\"\n\nIn discussing this paragraph with Mr. Marshall he agreed that the immoral conditions which he mentioned are not due to the employment of Mrs. George. I pointed out to him that she had been in our employ for many years and that the reports received from the Provincial School Inspector were always reasonably satisfactory. The fact that few of the pupils went beyond grade six was likely due in part at least to the apathy on the part of the parents. He agreed that such was a fair presentation of the situation. As Mr. Marshall stated that Mrs. George was still extremely active he withdrew any opposition he might have had towards her continued employment for the academic year 1946-47. I informed Mr. Marshall that we would write to Mrs. George and direct her to co-operate to the fullest possible extent with Mr. Marshall in organizing Boy Scouts, Girl Guides, etc., so as to improve conditions among the younger Indians living in the immediate vicinity of the No. 2 School.\n\nReverend Mr. Marshall appears to be a very reasonable man and is anxious to do everything possible for the Indians on the Willoe Island Reserve. He appreciated the fact that Mr. Hoey and myself had asked me to interview him.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\n\nOttawa, July 29, 1946.\nCOPY.\n\nHOUSE OF COMMONS.\nCANADA.\n\nOttawa,\nJuly 24, 1946.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI am enclosing a copy of part of the correspondence I showed you yesterday so that you can look into the matter and let me know if this is a correct statement or any information you have on the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nNo. 1 School, Walpole Island.\n\nThe Indian Agent informs me that he does not intend advertising for teachers. This is a two-roomed school with a small teacherage for the two teachers. Last summer the Agent did nothing to secure teachers and in September the school was unable to open.\n\nThe Agent is interested financially in the Walpole Island Ferry service, operated by his life-long friend Mr. H. Dalgety. Mrs. Dalgety is a school teacher. During the Dalgetys were in need of a place because they had to vacate the house they rented on Walpole Island and nothing else suitable offered. The Agent then arranged for Mrs. Dalgety to take the No. 1 School, and the family occupied the teacherage.\n\nI was asked to teach and agreed to take the senior room until a teacher could be secured. Later the Agent arranged for an Indian girl with only one year's high school (gained whilst an inmate of an American Home of Correction) to take charge of the Junior room, as Mrs. Dalgety asked for the senior grades and I was unwilling to take them.\n\nNow the position is that the teacherage is occupied by the Dalgety family so that a second teacher cannot possibly be accommodated, and the Indian people feel that the arrangement was merely one to suit the Dalgetys and the agent whom they claim is a sleeping partner in the ferry business.\n\nIt should be noted that this year under my tuition the first pupil to qualify for High School passed, the first pupil in a number of years. This is not a church controlled school\u2014it used to be, and in those days we graduated Grade VIII pupils regularly and sent one or two to university. I do not feel that the criticism of church operated schools is justified\u2014and it is encouraged by the Indian Department officials because they want full control themselves. When we have Christian teachers, or missionaries serving as principal, we have people interested in the Indians, not teaching for a job.\n\nOn Walpole Island, as an example of a Departmentally run school, we have had only one real certificated teacher since the Department took over from the church. We need teachers who are interested in the moral and physical training, and these are best assured by securing missionary hearted people.\nNo. 2 School, Walpole Island.\n\nThis is a one roomed school with a native teacher whom the Indians do not regard very highly. She is a married woman who was living apart from her husband, but I believe the husband has now died. I am concerned at the fact that the pupils never got beyond Grade VI and the conditions around this school are not ideally in order.\n\n(Sgd) Rev. A. R. Marshall,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nWalpole Island Ont.\nJuly 29/46\n\nDept. Mines & Resources Indian Affairs Branch Ottawa\n\nRe your letter dated July 12/46 No. 40-1-1 W.T.1\n\nI do not believe that we have a chance to get a teacher with the proper qualifications for the Junior Room at No. 1 school. The salary offered comparatively speaking is too small to induce teachers to come here from mainland schools. However I will try to procure one if possible.\n\nJames W. Daley\nJames W. Daley Indian Agent\nAugust 24th 1946\n\nBernard J. Murray Esq.\nOntario\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThank you for the information re the teaching staff at the day school here.\n\nI hope you can secure their means but regret having failed in securing a second teacher who has the necessary qualifications. Had I been authorized to seek teachers sooner I am quite sure I could have had the cream of those attending our summer schools, where I was lecturing during the summer - but there I met were all engaged up.\n\nAs I complained too he before, we need more than merely qualified teachers or workers as the situation calls for whole hearted cooperation to meet a sad moral condition. In this respect I felt very strongly that the young native women engaged last year for the teachers was a mistake engaged last year for the Indians was a mistake, williams is a capable girl but disliked by her own people, and without that school training she can't be expected to serve effectively.\n\nIf we take Indian girls with public school standing it becomes difficult then within the work of teaching native children and makes them teachers it becomes difficult then within the work of teaching native children.\n\nSincerely yours,\n[Signature]\n\nThe Rectory\nWallpole Island\nOntario\nI am sure that Miss Williams could make a capable teacher if she were prepared to take up her education where she left off.\n\nI am very anxious that both rooms be opened in September. Last year no one knew what was going to happen\u2014and we found nothing did happen until October when, with my taking the senior room, we secured his Delay. I spoke to Arch Bishop Ranger at that time about the possibility of continuing as teacher missionary as in our northern schools, and if we find great difficulty this could be affected, with, I believe, the good will of our Indian people, but I could not manage the junior room except as an emergency \"fill-in.\"\n\nThere is a young white woman on the staff of the Blue Water Christian Conference\u2014near Walpole\u2014which I propose nominating for a supervisory position on our Residential staff. She has her High School grades but is not a teacher although remarkably capable. If nothing better offers I could have her meet the agent here and he could decide.\n\nI am sorry I have been unable to do better in such a short time, but I do appreciate your efforts. You did feel last year that nobody cared about the situation.\n\nSincerely,\n\nA. R.

I informed Mr Arneil that we (our church Board of Management) had located a teacher prospect whom we wished to nominate, and was somewhat shortly informed by Mr Arneil that he was appointing Mrs Daley, wife of the Indian Agent.\n\nIn view of the fact that we do not feel Mr Arneil has the right of appointment in this case and in view of your own most fair and considerate attitude in the matter, I decided after consulting with my Board to go ahead and nominate a Mrs Sharen of Wallaceburg.\n\nMrs Sharen is an Anglican, and if appointed will be the first Anglican teacher appointed here in many years. Mrs Sharen is married with two children not young enough to be an impediment. She is teaching as substitute teacher in the Wallaceburg Public Schools, and was strongly commended to me by the Rector of Wallaceburg.\n\nI wish it made clear that this is no reflection upon Mrs Daley, and if she is anxious to teach it might be possible to replace the High School Boy now teaching the Junior room, (that of course is your affair), but our Board of Management which incidentally was the best attended in years demonstrating the interest of our people in this matter did feel that the time had come to fight for a break for the Church... doing all the work on the island, and needing help and encouragement in a stiff job rather than a vindictive 'hands off' attitude.\n\nThanking you and with every good wish\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Rectory,\nWalpole Island,\nOntario.\nApplication FOR EMPLOYMENT IN INDIAN DAY SCHOOLS\n\nI hereby make application for employment in the\n[Signature]\n\nI PERSONAL QUALIFICATIONS\n\nName in full (please print): DALEY, Verna Muriel\nSurname: Daley\nChristian Names: Verna Muriel\n\nDate of Birth: Sept. 27, 1904\nPlace of Birth: Simcoe County\nSex: F.\nReligion: United Church\nCanadian Citizen: Yes\nService in HM Forces: None\n\nII ACADEMIC QUALIFICATIONS\n\n| Type of Education | Dates       | Name of School          | Diploma, Certificate or Degree Granted |\n|-------------------|-------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| High School (or equivalent) | 1919 - 1923 | Wallaceburg High School | Junior Matriculation                   |\n\nUniversity:\n\nAdditional (Technical Agricultural etc.):\n\nIII PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS\n\nWhere and when did you take your teacher training?

I have received your letter of February 6th addressed to him.\n\nMr. Arneil had phoned the Department immediately he heard that Mrs. Daley was willing to teach in the senior room for the remainder of the year. In view of her qualifications and fifteen years of teaching in both white and Indian schools, the Department appointed Mrs. Daley as teacher of the senior room at Balpole Island No. 1.\n\nIt is unfortunate that we had not your nomination for Mrs. Sharon previously. The Department advertised in the Chatham Daily News for this position recently but received no applications.\n\nIt has never been the policy of this Department nor Provincial Departments of Education to replace teachers in the middle of the term unless there is good reason. You can understand the disrupting effect that such a change has on the pupils of a room and the unfairness to the teacher concerned.\n\nWe do appreciate your efforts to obtain a teacher for this school. It is understood that Mr. Stratton only intends remaining in our service for the remainder of the academic year. Would Mrs. Sharon be interested in a position at this school for the academic year 1947-48?\n\nIn the meantime, we have a vacancy for the position of principal of a two-room school at the Kettle Point\n\nReverend A. R. Marshall,\nThe Rectory,\nBalpole Island, Ontario.\n\n..... School\nSchool near Parrott, Ontario.

It will be necessary for us to have this and other information before being able to offer her a definite salary. We enclose an application form for this purpose.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Beary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa, February 10, 1947.\n\nMr. James E. Daisy, Indian Agent,\nWalpole Island, Ontario,\n\nThe Department has appointed Mrs. Verne Muriel Daisy as teacher of the senior room at the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School at a salary of $131.00 a teaching month, with effect from 3 February, 1947. Attached please find T.D.I and staff questionnaire forms for completion by Mrs. Daisy and return to this office as soon as possible.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEnc.\nDear Mr Neary:\n\nThank you for your letter regarding the recent appointment to the vacancy at No I School here. When I phoned Mr Arnell he was then at the Agents' house or office. I informed him that we had a lady in view but he said he had appointed Mrs Daley, and I understood he said he had not yet sent the appointment to Ottawa. When I said we still wished to nominate Mrs Sharen and if necessary I would send to Ottawa, he very shortly said \"Do that\". I do not feel that the appointment had then been made by Ottawa, and I am asking your re-consideration of same on grounds which I hope to make clear.\n\nI have recently been appointed by the Archbishop to head up our Indian Workers committee, and I believe that this situation at Walpole is a good test case of the ability of church and Dept to co-operate. I am certain that with men like Mr Phelan, or at least the attitude he took when here last year...we should have no difficulty in co-operating for the good of the Indian. I am sorry to say however that the decisions he made seem to have been over ridden, and however much we desire to co-operate we are now conscious that the welfare of the Indian or the church is not very likely to be considered first.\n\nOur denomination has been working for a Century here. We own the allegiance of by far the majority of the people. During the Anglican Advance Movement last year we took a new person to person canvas, and actually discovered that very few families did not either belong to us or look to us as their church for every purpose. There is no other denomination working here. I have an official letter from the United Church giving me their blessing in taking all the people under my wing...and stating that the only block was one or two local Indians headed by Elder Soney who for personal economic reasons wished to retain the United faith. Nor have I restricted myself to our people in my ministry...and rejoice that the few outside my flock are able to claim some Christian allegiance.\n\nDespite the fact that we held the majority of the people and had been here so long...when I took over here two years ago I was asked to build up (or attempt to build) a broken down work. Mr Daley in conversations was not slow to inform me that the reason for the breakdown was that every Minister here no matter what denomination was either a rogue, immoral, or useless. Under the circumstances it did not take me long to appreciate that little real co-operation could have been possible between my predecessors and the Agent. I am in somewhat of a position to claim to know the Indian...can talk a bit of their language, and have given up a lot to work with them. In two years we have made remarkable recovery....but I have been very conscious again and again that where co-operation from the Dept is to be delayed, I am absent. When I mentioned to Mr ARNEILL that Mr Daley was non-co-operative he used much harsher terms...which makes it still more difficult for me to understand how...having such a poor opinion of the Agent would do anything to inflict him upon our work and people any longer than necessary.\n\nAppreciating Mr Arnell's difficulty last Fall I did all I could to co-operate, and even went to the former teacher Mrs Dalgity, and together with Mr Arnell persuaded her to carry on. It was then that Mr Arnell said he would not appoint Mrs Dalgity except for the full scholastic year so that her leaving in January was a surprise. I had nothing against Mrs Dalgity...but she was not in sympathy with our church...and of no help to us. The same is true of Mrs Daley whom I respect...although there will be opposition to the family going back into the teachersage. Mr Phelan thoroughly understood that apart from any rights our denomination might claim under the Act...the work facing us on Walpole demanded all the co-operation and sympathy any of us could give each other. We do not feel we are getting it in this matter, and unless a clean cut decision is made now I do not believe we shall stand much chance of successfully nominating anyone next September.\nI think perhaps at one time we need to settle whether we have any moral or legal right under that section of the Indian Act which grants 'majority' denomination the privilege of nominating the teacher? I think too that with two rooms teachers provided here the Dept may well insist that the teaching staff be accommodated there... without having to board a teacher out. In this regard of course the difficult times have to be considered as with the qualifications of the teacher.\n\nI am aware that much of this will be outside the province of your department of Training... except that it might make clear our reasons for heartily desiring that the teachers be missionary hearted and at the least willing to work with us. If anyone could show me one piece of work being carried out on this reservation for the good and welfare of the Indian, outside of the church, I would be surprised. The people can be led but are hard to drive anywhere.... We have just paid for an eleven hundred dollar electric organ... every cent raised by the Indian... on the island!\n\nIt is time that we realised that the Indian resents and hates the white man because every white man having official or other business with the Indian has an ulterior motive... and this is just as true I fear of some of us who are missionary workers. I do believe however that when that natural suspicion on the native part is overcome by a man with a sincere desire to promote his welfare... almost miracles can be worked.\n\nYou will forgive the lecture which I know you have no need of. I do assure you that I have no restriction upon my desire to fully co-operate, and I might add that in former days I found Mr Hoey most delightfully co-operative.\n\nI shall not commend Kettle Point vacancy to Mrs Sharen as I am vitally interested in Walpole Island and not Kettle Point. I shall ask Mrs Sharen to place her application with you as I believe despite the policy of the Dept not to replace teachers in the middle of term... it has been done here twice in the past year or so... and no doubt can be done again.\n\nThanking you, and with kind regards\n\nYours sincerely\n\n[Signature]\nReverend A.R. Marshall.\nDear Reverend Marshall:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of February 11th.\n\nIt is felt that there should be no difficulty in co-operation in this matter between the Church and the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\n(a) You wrote on June 24 concerning the situation and pointing out the unsatisfactory condition in the Junior Room of the No. 1 School.\n\n(b) We answered on June 28th, and I informed you, Mr. Phelan would be visiting the Island.\n\n(c) We\n\nTo review the situation\n\n(a) On August 3, 1940, we received a letter from the Bishop of Huron requesting the appointment of two Anglican teachers at this school.\n\n(b) On August 6, 1940, the Director acknowledged the Bishop's letter and requested that applications be forwarded for these positions.\n\n(c) On September 10, 1940 we appointed two Anglican teachers -\n\n1. Miss Field - recommended by the Rector of Christ Church in Saskatoon. She resigned, to be married, in June 1941.\n\n2. Miss Isaac - who gave as a reference the Rev. Mr. W. Hall, your predecessor at Walpole Island. Miss Isaac proved a poor disciplinarian and we dispensed with her services in June, 1941.\n\n(d) In September, 1941 we appointed Mrs. Ross, United Church, as principal. Teachers were becoming scarce by this time and after some difficulty we obtained the services of Mrs. Taylor, recommended by Mr. Pearson, Inspector of Schools. Mrs. Ross, though of the United Church, taught Sunday School in the Anglican Church on\nthe Island.\n\n(e) In May, 1943, Mrs. Taylor's husband became seriously ill and we hired Mrs. Walton as a substitute.\n\n(f) In October, 1944, Miss Chinnick replaced Mrs. Taylor.\n\n(g) In June, 1945, both teachers resigned and Mr. Pearson, Inspector of Schools, informed us he was unable to suggest teachers due to the great shortage thereof.\n\n(h) In September, 1945, the Department appointed Mrs. Dalgety as principal and you as teacher of the Senior Room on a temporary basis.\n\n(i) In February, 1946, you were replaced by Miss Myrtle Williams.\n\n(j) On June 24, 1946, you wrote concerning the unsatisfactory condition in the Junior Room of the No. 1 School.\n\n(k) As a result of your letter and the Inspector's report, we dismissed Miss Williams.\n\n(l) On July 26, 1946, you were visited by Mr. Phelan, Chief of the Training Division, and informed him that you were of the opinion you could nominate two Anglican teachers for this school.\n\n(m) We tried to obtain the services of Miss McNea, an Anglican teacher, for the school, but she obtained another post. You were unable to nominate another teacher as per your letter of August 24.\n\n(n) Largely due to Mr. Arneil's efforts, Mrs. Dalgety was persuaded to stay on in the Senior Room and Mr. Stratton\ntook the Junior Room.\n\n(o) Mr. Daley has done his best to obtain the services of a teacher to replace Mrs. Dalgety who intended moving from the Island.\n\n(p) The position was advertised in the Chatham Daily News on December 10 - 11- 12 and 13 but no applications were received.\nas follows:\n\n\"If the majority of the band belongs to any one religious denomination, the teacher of the school established on the reserve shall belong to the same denomination.\"\n\nIs it to be inferred from the last paragraph of your letter that you would wish the Department to replace Mr. Stratton with Mrs. Sharon as teacher of the junior room at this school?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard J. Heary,\nDept. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, February 24, 1947.\n\nDear Reverend Marshall:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of February 11.\n\nIt is not felt that there should be any difficulty in cooperation in this matter between your Church and the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nIn 1940, at the request of the Bishop of Huron, we appointed two Anglican teachers at the Walpole Island No. 1 School. Unfortunately, they only remained for a year, and since then the teacher situation has been such that we have been forced to accept whatever teachers were available.\n\nLast summer, as you know, Miss Williams was dismissed as a result of representations made by yourself and after receiving an unsatisfactory inspector's report. At that time you were informed that we were willing to put in two Anglican teachers at this school. However, it was not possible for you to nominate qualified teachers at that time.\n\nWhen Mrs. Dalgety indicated that she was resigning, Mr. Daley advertised in the Chatham Daily News on December 10, 11, 12 and 13 for a teacher, but no applications were received. As Mrs. Sharen's application has not reached us as yet, the Department has approved the appointment of Mrs. Daley as teacher of the senior room.\n\nIt is presumed that you are referring in your letter to Section 100 (2) of the Indian Act, which states\n\nReverend A.R.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI have not previously answered your letter of Feb 24th as I have been waiting Mrs Sharen's application. The delay was I understand caused by Mrs Sharen's understandable reluctance to make application whilst Mrs Daley was engaged. I am personally supporting Mrs Sharen in applying for the Principalship of the school on the grounds that with the majority of the people members of our church, and the remainder almost wholly looking to us for ministration, we have under Sect 100 of the Indian Act the right to expect that consideration which the Indian Affairs Branch have ever extended to the churches operating for the welfare of the Indians.\n\nI am not seeking a drawn out discussion in the matter for no good can be served...but I am insisting with all my power and influence upon the right of the church to be interested in the people entrusted with the teaching of the Indian. I would further add that I am not even vitally concerned as to the teachers being members of my denomination providing they are here to do a job of work for the good of the Indian...and willing to give and accept our co-operation. When I arrived here two years ago the Principal was Miss Ross...the widow of an United Church Clergyman........She was certainly not Anglican...but she suited us admirably...was loved by the people and detested by the Agent...so she went.\n\nIn Mrs Sharen's case I am glad she is an Anglican...It will save many complications...and if a qualified second teacher cannot be secured she has a lady living with her at Wallaceburg who would suit us excellently, and while not a qualified teacher has had many years experience among children in church work etc.\n\nYes, Sir I am referring to Section 100 (2).....with five hundred and eighty nine resident Indians on my church membership I see no reason why I should not expect your co-operation. As for the Dept policy of not changing teachers in mid term....it happened last year without necessity...and can happen again I am sure.\n\nI must take exception to your statement that as a result of my representations last Summer...Miss Williams was dismissed. Miss Williams is or was a member of my church...and much bad capital has been made of this untruth. My representations last Summer were made in relation to the whole work of the schools on the island...Mr Daley, himself engaged Miss Williams pledged that it was only for the present term...and himself stated that I could go ahead and find teachers. It was merely because his friend Mrs Dalgity wanted to stay until her house was ready for occupancy...that Mr Daley engaged Miss Williams again...knowing that no teacher would accept the Junior room when the teacherage was occupied by Mr & Mrs Dalgity and three small children...one too young to attend school. Your Mr Phelan had a co-operative and understanding attitude in the matter...and it is my hope that he interpreted rightly your Departmental reaction.\nI have stated that I want to avoid controversy. I cannot ask you to replace Mr. Stratton with Mrs. Sharen, although you must do as you wish about that. I want teachers, and especially the teacher handling our pre-confirmation age children (Seniors) to be Anglican, or at least sympathetic towards us. The Junior room teacher is not nearly so important, but here too we would very naturally value a church person.\n\nI think too in view of the progress we are making on the island, and our future plans, we should have your departmental policy in regard to such a situation as Walpole provides, in relation to Section 100(2), because we are not always going to be satisfied with the obvious disregard of the needs of our people by those entrusted with their welfare.\n\nIt must be a bad headache for you and your field staff, but I feel with you that there ought to be no difficulty in co-operation between your Dept and my Church.\n\nI might say that I doubt very much that Mrs. Sharen would take the Junior room under Mrs. Daley, who has been out of practice for several years, and has a young family. Mrs. Sharen would have a boy in the Senior room, a girl going to High School at Wallaceburg. I should most certainly suggest Mrs. Sharen as Principal if Mrs. Daley is to continue this term.\n\nThanking you for the court by\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nReverend A.K., [Name]\n\nIndian Affairs - School Files\n(RG 10, Volumes 6175, File 462-1, part 4)\nMr. Wolfert\n\nWould you care to make a copy of this letter with your to Walpole Island?\n\nWJ\nDept., Mines & Resources Indian Affairs Branch Ottawa\n\nAttention Colonel Neary\n\nRe: Voucher 246\n\nI regret that we have not been able to get the tear sheets in regards to the above, as requested.

The lack of qualified teachers has been a significant issue, and I believe it is essential to address this promptly.\n\nI understand that you have been working tirelessly to find suitable replacements for Miss Ross, who recently left the school. However, I urge you to consider the long-term implications of this vacancy. Our students deserve the best possible education, and we cannot afford to compromise their future.\n\nFurthermore, I would like to bring to your attention the comments made by Miss Ross in her March 17th letter. Please note that the reason Miss Ross left Halpole was...\nthe fact that Mr. Daley would not hire a janitor....I have Mr.\n\nDaley's own comment on Miss Ross that she was not 'for the Agent'\n\nand in view of the fact that a good janitor was hired when Miss\n\nRoss left...one can only hold one's own opinion. I repeat that in\n\nMiss Ross' Walpole lost a good friend and excellent teacher who\n\nwhile not of my denomination I could have worked with happily in\n\nview of her love for our Indian people.

In addition, the living quarters which were only intended for two persons, would possibly be required to accommodate five persons.\n\nIn different places in the past we have had the experience of employing a married teacher whose husband resided in the residence and invariably difficulties have arisen between the husband and the Indians on the reserve.\n\nOur new schedule of salaries, effective September 1st, 1946, will be contained in the current issue of our bulletin which will go forward within\nthe next few days. We believe that the new salary rates are attractive and should permit you to nominate two qualified teachers.\n\nWe are prepared to leave this matter in your hands until June 1st and it is hoped by that time you will be in a position to nominate two qualified single teachers for this school, or a man and his wife, both of whom are qualified.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Marshall\n\nI can see no reason in the world why the Teacher-Missionary set up in vogue in the North cannot be more largely used in such places as Walpole...at least in this teacher 'depression' period. There may be a little objection, but I am certain it will be very little, and certainly it would be better than this hiring of untrained high school boys. I hope you will not find this suggestion...I can make it now as I am not involved in preparing to assume the Supervision of our Indian Missions in the Fall. I have had seventeen years experience in the Indian field, and still am personally interested in the work conducted by the Teacher-Missionary in the North. The group is a compact group...allied mostly to one denomination and no fixture of Romanists-Protestants.\nJune 6th.\n\nCol/B.F. Neary,\nWelfare & Training Service,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr Neary;\n\nI am so glad you are able to get hold of Miss McMeans for the No I School here, and would think she would be suitable.\n\nThere was a Chatham lady who had taught here a number of years ago whose name evades me...and who has been around to look over things. However if she does apply I presume you will be able to arrange which of the two would be Principal. It is no easy matter to secure teachers even with the new adjustments of salary, and I hope a second teacher will be forthcoming.\n\nI had written you a rather personal letter regarding our Mossonee Mission at Mistisinni Lake in N, Quebec and I hope you will not feel it impertinent. I am very genuinely interested in the Indian, and am still making some sacrifice to retain my connection with the work until my children are through High School...when we all plan on returning 'down North'.\n\nYours sincerely\n\nReverend A.R. Marshall.\nJune 18th.\n\nThe Rectory,\nWalpole Island,\nOntario.\n\nColt\n\nD.F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr Neary;\n\nRegarding the securing of a second teacher for the No I School, Walpole Island.\n\nThe difficulty seems still acute even with the new stipends, etc., and I would say by all means secure a teacher of another denomination if necessary. My own feeling is that we want a Christian who is interested in the Indian...and with such a person I don't believe we need bother too much about denomination. The difficulty is we often get a teacher who has no interest in the reserve life of the child and gives no co-operation with those who are interested.\n\nThe teacher I mentioned who resides at Chatham has been teaching at North Bay and will be back when school closes there. I will then interview her at Chatham if you haven't been able to fill the vacancy, and meanwhile will do what I can here to secure a Junior teacher. I am taking the liberty of inserting a note in our local paper of our need, and of course if you decide to advertise that may help.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAlbert Marshall\nOttawa, July 4, 1947.\n\nMr. James F.

Henry,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nExtract from report of Robert J. Stallwood,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency Walpole Island,\ndated April 8, 1948.\n\n(original on 75-40)\n\nIt will be noted that our No. 1 School has been too crowded this year. Attendance has been quite good. Due to the fact that some Indian children who wished to commence school after Easter were turned away, there has been some talk of requesting white children in attendance to leave. However, I have learned that the only children refused admission are those below six years of age. If the over-crowded condition continues in September, I shall set the example by having my child attend a Wallaceburg Public School.\n\nDuring the past winter the heating arrangement for the classrooms and the teacher's residence have not been too satisfactory. The classrooms have very old box stoves. It may be necessary to replace these before too long. Perhaps the most satisfactory arrangement would be a central heating system to cover the classrooms and the residence, and a coal oil range for cooking. It is quite a task for the teacher to operate coal and wood range and heater.\nApril 30,\n\nMr. R. J. Stallwood,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nWalpole Island, Ontario.\n\nWalpole Island No. 1 Day School\n\nWe have noted your comments with regard to the heating arrangement at the above school. I also noted the unsatisfactory condition during my autumn inspection trip.\n\nI would agree that a central heating system would be the most satisfactory, but I am afraid that it would be very difficult to install in such an old building. I would suggest the installation of oil space heaters in both the classrooms, were it not for the difficulties encountered in obtaining a steady supply of oil. However, you will know local conditions better than we and I will await your recommendation as to what can be done this summer to improve conditions.\n\nI would also like to suggest that some arrangements be made with regard to the making of storm windows, particularly for the junior room. Would it be possible to obtain a quotation on these windows from a millwork firm in Wallaceburg, or elsewhere?\n\nBernard F.

The resident Anglican rector, Rev. Mr. Bradbury, came to Walpole Island in September 1947. His daughter, Mrs. Margaret Holm has lived with him since they have been on Walpole Island. A few weeks ago Mrs. Holm signed a contract with a School Board near Wallaceburg for $1700.00 per annum. Her husband is on a construction job in northern Ontario and cannot provide a home for her there. Due to the fact that the position in our school would be much more convenient for her, she is willing to seek her release from the outside school and teach here. She has a First Class Teachers' Certificate and has had four years teaching experience which would entitle her, I believe, to $1650.00 per annum with Indian Affairs.\n\nIt was noted in the report of Inspector F.L. Barrett that it is recommended that a third class be started at No. 1 School. I have been exploring the possibilities for a third classroom and the only suitable building appears to be the Parish Hall of the Anglican church. Mr. Bradbury has stated that he is certain that this could be rented from the church for this purpose. Furthermore he has stated that he would be willing to take charge of the Beginners and Junior Classes. He states that he has a First Class Teachers Certificate (Newfoundland). I do not know of any other local residents of Walpole who have Teachers' Certificates.\n\nDuring the past few days I have had a School Board Chairman seeking to employ our Senior Teacher, Miss Mclean, but she states that she does not intend to leave. She does request several improvements to the Teacherage which I shall outline in a separate letter with estimates. She would be quite in favour of Mrs. Holm and Mr. Bradbury for the coming year.\n\nA.J. Stallwood, Supt.\nIndian Agency.\nJuly 8, 1948.\n\nMr. R. J.

Our records show the following average attendance figures:\n\nQuarter ending September 1947 - 63\nDecember 1947 - 61\nMarch 1948 - 65\nMonth April 1948 - 78.5%\nMay 1948 - 64.4%\nJune 1948 - 60.5%\n\nIn view of these facts the Department is prepared to consider the opening of a third classroom on a trial basis for one year. If this is done, it will be necessary for the Reverend Mr. Bradbury and yourself to make a concerted effort to have as many children as possible attend the day school and thus reduce the number sent to the Shingwauk Residential School.\n\nYou are aware that we intend to close the Shingwauk Residential School and that many of the pupils formerly attending there will have to be transferred to Pelipula. Therefore we are anxious that you review the list of pupils from various bands who are attending the Shingwauk School and consider whether it is possible for some of them to attend your day school. Naturally,\nchildren from home whose conditions are unsatisfactory will continue to attend the residential school.\n\nTEACHERS\n\n(a) Mrs. Margaret Hulm - We are forwarding an application form for completion by this teacher. If she has a first class certificate and four years' experience, she would be classified as a Grade 3 teacher at the fifth year on the scale ($1740 an academic year).\n\n(b) Reverend Mr. Bradbury - It will be necessary to settle his salary after submission of an application form. As it is usual for a female teacher to look after the beginners, it might be preferable for him to teach the intermediate grades and to leave Mrs. Hulm handle the juniors.\n\nWe will expect to hear further from you regarding rental of the Parish Hall, desks, and blackboards required, etc.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard J.

Mrs. Holm requested me to interview the Chatham Twp. School Board to secure her release from the teaching contract signed for 1948-49. The Chairman appeared to take a reasonable view of the situation and said the board would consider her resignation. Their decision has not yet been received.\n\nThird Classroom: It will be possible to obtain the use of the Parish Hall at a monthly rental of $15.00. The Board will make some necessary repairs to the windows and doors to make it more comfortable in winter. The main problem will be to heat the hall.\n\nI would recommend that a coal burning heater be provided, and a 2 or 3 ton storage bin be built. If it were built outside, it could be moved to the school when the temporary use is ended. The same would apply to the stove. As has been mentioned in previous letters, it may not be long before the two wood-burning stoves in No. 1 School classrooms will have to be replaced. Would it be possible for the Purchasing Agent to obtain a suitable coal-burning stove. It should need to be a unit that would be large enough to heat one of the classrooms at the school eventually.\n\nDue to the fact that the present desks in the Junior Room of No. 1 School are so small and also to the fact that it can be heated satisfactorily, I would recommend that grades 1-3 (incl.) be accommodated there and that Grades 4-6 be accommodated in the Parish Hall. If any desks are purchased, they would need to be of intermediate size. However since the Parish Hall will be used.\nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDept. of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA\n\nRe: Walpole Island Indian Day School - continued.\n\nbe used for other functions, it may be desirable to build cupboards as lockers along the walls and to use tables for desks.\n\nBy separate reply I am estimating the number of children who will not be returning to Shingwauk.

Mrs. Holm has had her resignation accepted by the Chatham Twp. School Board. Miss McMeans is anxious to have her status clarified as soon as possible. Last year Miss McMeans assumed the responsibility of a principal and this responsibility will be increased this year. Five out of eight Grade 8 pupils passed this year, two of which obtained honours.\n\nThe diocese executive advised Mr. Bradbury that $15.00 per month rental for the parish hall as a Third Classroom was not sufficient. They do not suggest any amount and Mr. Bradbury has written to them to give further details, and he anticipates that the above rental will be accepted.\n\nI have been investigating the possibilities of the Orange Society Hall as an alternative. The Society at a recent executive meeting has offered us the Hall for two years for the cost of certain necessary repairs. I estimate the repairs as follows - 1) re-shingling -$150.00; 2) boarding up foundation and banking -$50.00; 3) building toilets -$50.00. Total $250.00 A new stove would be necessary as well.\n\nIt is estimated that 30 chair type desks will be required (intermediate size).\n\nHere is the list of pupils home from Shingwauk showing those who will not be returning.\n\nRobert J.

The circumstances are these. The husband of Mrs. Holm has been employed on construction work in Northern Ontario for the past year and has been unable to provide a home for his wife. She and her child have resided with her father, the Rev. Mr. Bradbury, rector of the Walpole Island Anglican Church, on Walpole Island. Mrs. Holm decided to teach this year and obtained a school on the Mainland. When the vacancy occurred in our school, her release was obtained from outside and she applied for our No. 1 School. A week ago Mr. Holm secured a position with a Power & Light Company at Sault Ste. Marie, Ont., which included a house. The result is that they wish to be together and Mrs. Holm wishes her release here. She will commence duties on September 7th and has stated she will stay until a substitute can be obtained. However, Mr. Holm has written this office that she must join him, so that it is very uncertain how long she will stay under such pressure.\n\nAlthough her father, Rev.

Leal.\nSeptember 9, 1948.\n\nMiss Susan Seal, R.N.,\n2605 King Street West,\nKingston, Ontario.\n\nDear Miss Seal:\n\nI have received your reply to my telegram concerning the Walpole Island Indian Day School.\n\nUp until this year, this school was a two-room one, but due to the increase in population, we have opened a third room. We had engaged a full staff of teachers but one of these has been forced to resign suddenly. She was a married woman and her husband has now obtained a position in London, Ont. She wishes to join him at once.\n\nTherefore, you could begin your duties at Walpole Island on either September 13 or September 20.\n\nYou would probably have the intermediate room. I cannot furnish many other details concerning grades, etc., as the division of the pupils has been left in the hands of Miss Metcalf, the Principal.\n\nYou would share the teacherage with Miss Metcalf. She is 56 years of age and has had some 22 years of teaching experience, mainly in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. There is ample room for two or even three teachers in this teacherage. The school is situated on Walpole Island, near Wallaceburg, Ontario. If you wish any further information, I would ask you to write directly to Mr. H. J. Stallwood, Indian Superintendent, Walpole Island, Ontario.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard J. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nSeptember 9, 1948.\n\nMr. R. J. Stallwood,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nWalpole Island, Ontario\n\nWalpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School.\n\nI have received your letter of September 4th and I note that Mrs. Holm will not be reporting for duty pending at this school.\n\nIf she does teach from September 7th for a few days, will you please report to the Department the exact dates during which she does teach.\n\nThe Reverend Mr. Bradbury has been notified of his appointment as the third teacher at this school. I note that you do not favour his continuing in this position and it is presumed that the Reverend Mr. Bradbury is prepared to withdraw when the Department is able to find a suitable replacement teacher.\n\nI immediately sent telegrams to three teachers upon receipt of your telephone message. To date I have had a reply only from Miss Susan Seal of Kingston, Ontario, indicating that she is interested in further details. Miss Seal is a registered nurse who has not taught school since 1931. She is 55 years of age, has a second class teaching certificate with 8 years' experience. I am rather dubious of accepting her for Walpole Island, in view of the fact that she has not taught school during the last 27 years. However, I would emphasize that there is a very serious shortage of teachers and that we cannot always get the type of teacher whom we would like to have.\n\n... I have\nI have, therefore, written to Miss Seal and have asked her to write directly to you for any further details which she might require. I am attaching a copy of this letter and you can expect to hear from Miss Seal within the next day or so. The Department is prepared to appoint her to the Walpole Island School, in view of the great shortage of trained teachers.\n\nIf we can locate a third female teacher, would there be sufficient room in the teacherage for her? As I recall my visit last year, I think there would be sufficient accommodation but I would like this confirmed.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nSeptember 9, 1946.\n\nDear Mrs. Anderson:\n\nAs you are probably aware, the position of teacher at the Jacker Creek Indian Day School has been filled. However, we have two other positions in which you might be interested.\n\nOne of these is at the Walpole Island Indian Day School near Wallaceburg, Ontario. This is a three-room school and you would be required to share the teachers' residence with Miss Mclean, the principal.\n\nThe other school is at Constance Lake in the Chapleau Agency. This is a one-room school and you would have the teacherage to yourself and your family. Please find attached one of our application forms which I would like to have you complete and return here if you are interested in further details of either of the above positions.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMrs. B. A. Anderson,\nBox 49,\nWillshire, Ohio.\nDFN/131.\nSeptember 9, 1946.\n\nDear Mrs. Davidson:\n\nI am writing to enquire whether you have been successful in obtaining a position as teacher this year.\n\nWe have two vacancies in our Indian Day Schools which might interest you. One of these is at the Walpole Island Indian Day School near Wallaceburg, Ontario, where we require a qualified teacher for one of the three rooms operating.\n\nWe also have a vacancy at Constance Lake Indian Day School in the Chapleau Agency. If you are interested in further details as to either of these two positions, I would be glad to provide you with them.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard P. Henry,\nJt. of Indian Education.\n\nMrs. Alvina Davidson,\nBriar Hill Avenue,\nToronto 10, Ontario.\n\nDPS/1946.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe. No.1, Indian Day School,\n\nFurther to our telephone conversation of September 7, regarding a replacement for Mrs. Holm as teacher of the Junior Room in the above school. We have been able to secure the services of an Indian girl, Alice Lalean to supply for Mrs. Holm. Alice is 13 years old and I believe has passed Grade 10. While attending Shingwauk she assisted the teachers there.\n\nIf a qualified teacher cannot be obtained Miss McMeans and I are prepared to recommend Alice for this room this year. Miss McMeans will help her as much as possible.\n\nIt appears that the enrollment at the above school this year will be approximately 95. The Mission parish hall is accommodating 30 at the present time. No. 2 school has 31 pupils.\n\nMay approval be given to employ Alice Lalean as a substitute teacher this year.\n\n[Signature]\nR.J.

Stallwood,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nWalpole Island, Ontario.\n\nToday we had a visit from Miss J. G. Adair,\nformerly teacher at the Kama Indian Day School. Miss Adair was\nforced to resign in April, 1948, due to the illness and subsequent\ndeath of her mother.\n\nShe is now prepared to accept another school\noperated by the Department.\n\nI immediately thought of the vacancy at Walpole\nIsland and gave her details concerning this school. If Miss\nSmal accepts the position as offered to her, we could use\nMiss Adair in the third room to replace the Reverend Mr.\nBradbury. These moves, of course, are contingent upon the\ntwo points I raised in my letter of yesterday,\n\n(1) that there is sufficient accommodation in the\nteacher's residence for three female teachers,\n\n(2) that the Reverend Mr. Bradbury is prepared to resign,\neffective September 30, 1948.\n\nMiss Adair is prepared to accept the position\nat Walpole Island on October 1, 1948, in either the primary\nor the intermediate rooms. She has an Elementary (Quebec\nCertificate and 15 years of experience in Ontario and Quebec.\n\nWould you please advise me as soon as possible concerning the two problems raised above and also let me know what additional furniture will be required at the teacherage. For your guidance I attach our standard list of furnishings for a one-room school. You can use this as a guide in preparing a requisition for additional requirements at the teacherage.\n\nEnc.\n\nBernard F.

Her address is:\n\n2605 King Street West,\nKingston, Ontario.\n\nI note from your letter of September 9th that Miss Alice Lalean has been teaching as a substitute for Mrs. Home.

Seal, R.N.,\nTaholah, Walpole Island Indian Day School.\n\nOne of the regulations in effect covering our Indian day school teachers is the following with regard to medical examinations:\n\n\"Teachers in Indian day schools are required to be protected by successful vaccination against Smallpox, and by the toxoid treatment against Diphtheria, and evidence of such protection, in the form of a certificate from a qualified physician, should, if possible, be included with the application for employment.\"\n\nWe have received information to the effect that one of our three day school teachers at Walpole Island School is in a physical condition which would warrant a check by one of the doctors of the Indian Health Services. This teacher is Miss Susan A. Seal. She has been employed since September 20, 1948. Her application form stated that her health was good. However, we have now been advised that Miss Seal had been suffering from a cancerous infection before she began work at this school. She is, apparently, troubled with a cough and we wish to make\ncertain that the health of the children in her classroom is in no way impaired by her illness.\n\nWe are naturally most anxious to avoid any sickness at this school which might be caused by one of our teachers and would appreciate it if your local Doctor could examine Miss Eanal at an opportune time.\n\nBernard F. Heary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nFebruary 3, 1949.\n\nDear Miss Seal:\n\nI have received your letter of January 25 and am naturally perturbed over its contents.\n\nWe will attempt to have an investigation made on conditions which you report to exist in the teacherage shared by yourself and Miss McMeans.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Heary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Susan A. Seal,\nWalpole Island #1 Day School,\nR.R.# 3,\nWallaceburg, Ontario.\nI would appreciate it if you would quietly investigate this situation when you are in Walpole Island. Naturally, it is impossible for us to make a decision until you have had an opportunity of looking into local conditions. I would ask that this be done quietly as there is, doubtless, some justification for the complaints made by each of these two teachers. I would, normally, write to Mr. Stallwood but I feel that when you are in the vicinity, you could no doubt report to me on this situation when you return to Ottawa.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMr. J.E. Morris,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nc/o Georgian Hotel;\nMidland, Ontario.\n\nBFR/HH.\nFebruary 3, 1949.\n\nDear Emmett:\n\nFor some time, I have been aware of rather strained relations between the two teachers sharing the teacherage at Walpole Island. In fact, I think I have mentioned this to you in previous conversation.\n\nDuring the Christmas holidays, Miss McMeans visited the Department and advised me that she felt that Miss Seal was not well and that she had been suffering from a cancerous infection before she began work at this school. She reported that Miss Seal was troubled with a cough and that she was worried about her own health.\n\nIn fact, I prepared a memorandum to Dr. Falconer in which I requested that one of their Doctors take an opportunity of giving Miss Seal a physical check-up to determine whether she was presenting a possible source of infection to the children in her classroom.\n\nThis memorandum was never sent to Dr. Falconer because Miss McMeans phoned me a few hours after leaving my office and advised that she did not wish to be quoted in this regard.\n\nThe attached letter is self-explanatory, and it seems to reveal a condition which is definitely not conducive to good teaching conditions at this school. Miss McMeans is a highly nervous woman but is a good teacher - or so we have found in the past. If we do build a new classroom at Walpole Island she has asked that she be permitted to use the teacherage attached thereto as she prefers living alone and does not wish to share the accommodation.\nOct. 26th/49\nIndian Affairs\nOffice\nOttawa\n\nCol.

On the following Monday, Dr. Card visited her and took her back to Sarnia with him to the hospital. In conversation with Dr. Card today, he stated that her temperature is normal again but that he wishes her to remain in the hospital a little longer for examination. I believe that tomorrow he will be able to report on her ability to resume teaching or not.\n\nIn the meantime I have arranged with Mrs. B.F. Huffman, Port Lambton, to substitute in Miss Seal's room. Mrs. Huffman has a Permanent First Class certificate and has had 5 years experience, two years of which were in an eight grade school and three years as principal of Cedar Springs School. She is approximately 37 years old. Since she has a small child, she will only be able to relieve for a week or so with a maximum period until Easter.\n\nI shall report on Miss Seal's condition again as soon as possible.

Walpole Island, I am applying for a teaching position if there happens to be a vacancy in any of the Indian schools in Ontario, for the end of the present term and for the school year beginning in September.\n\nAs my resignation stated, I gave it on the advice of Dr. Card, who was advised by the doctor of the X-Ray dept. of Sarnia's St. Joseph's Hospital. Apparently they believed a serious condition might be developing and that I should have the attention of Dr. Burr of the Cancer Clinic Kingston, under whom I had received treatment after an operation in Nov. 1947.\n\nOn March 21, Dr. Burr gave me a chest examination and had two more X-Ray plates taken. He said that he could find nothing\nwrong and that I was in a good condition in spirit of recently recovering from \"flu\" and Bronchitis. However he said that he would re-examine all plates and have a consultation with Dr. Boucher who performed the operation and for me to return April 7.\n\nOn April 7, Dr. Burs told me that there was no indication of anything serious; a few marks showed on the plates. These were scars on the lung, burnt by the Deep X-Ray treatment. It was these spots, and the severe bronchitis cough that must have influenced the doctors at Sarnia.\n\nWhen the doctors in Kingston and physicians of Gananoque emphatically tell me that I am able to continue work, and I feel well, I wish to get work as soon as possible.\n\nTrusting you may be able to give me a chance to prove to others as well as to myself that I am capable of giving faithful service,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSusan A.

There was a school on the Gibson Reserve but this was filled over the Easter holidays. However, I shall keep you in mind and will write you again if a suitable vacancy occurs.\n\nI presume that you would not want to go to a school that is too isolated or too far distant from a doctor.

I hope I will be able to fulfil the required duties there.\n\nI still feel greatly embarrassed when I think that Mother wrote you. I honestly don't know how she had the nerve to do so. I only wish we had had longer to discuss some matters.\n\nNevertheless it was a pleasure to have you and Mrs. Neary here.\n\nWe shall look forward now to such a visit at Walpole Island.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEdith Roberts.\n\nP.S. You'll see by the heading that I am surely \"heading\" back to Ontario.\n\nE.K.\nJune 25, 1949.\n\nMr. R.J. Stallwood,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nWalpole Island, Ontario.\n\nWalpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School\n\nI have just received letters from both Miss Roberts and Miss Reesor indicating that they are both prepared to accept the teaching positions offered them in the intermediate and junior rooms at Walpole Island.\n\nWould you please review the situation at the old school with regard to furniture. I am attaching our standard list of furniture provided for one-room schools which will give you an indication as to the type provided. This could be used also in ordering the furniture required for the new classroom when it is partially constructed. Normally delivery takes about two to four weeks so that you can submit a requisition by the end of July for a full scale for the new school and whatever are the requirements in the old building. I presume that new mattresses and pillows will be required, but this is a matter for you to settle locally. I understand that Mr. Phelan has written to you concerning the painting and other repairs required to have this old school in good condition by September 1.\n\nBernard F.

Box 302, London, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDear Bishop Lurton:\n\nI have for answer your letter of July 14 concerning the Reverend Wilfred Murray formerly to come at the above school. Please find attached a self-addressed letter which I sent to the Reverend Mr. Murray on July 14.\n\nWhen we were advised by Mrs. Bradbury in May of his resignation, we immediately began the search for a replacement. Upon an inspection trip to Calgary in June, I found two qualified and experienced teachers who were friends and who were willing to share the teacher's residence at Algoma Island. Therefore, I immediately wrote arrangements for them to take the intermediate and junior rooms while Miss Smith will of course carry on with the senior room.\n\nJust after I had advised these two teachers of their appointment, I heard from Mrs. Bradbury advising that it was not possible for him to continue to come. As the appointments of these two teachers had been confirmed and they had both made their plans accordingly, I wrote to the Reverend Mr. Murray as indicated above.\n\nI regret sincerely this instance and will do everything possible to employ the Reverend Mr. Bradbury again.\nWhen a vacancy occurs at either of the Walpole Island or Oka schools, we do not hesitate to recruit his services last year and feel that he is a capable teacher.\n\nMiss Roberts and Miss Benson are both capable and qualified teachers with many years of experience in provincial schools. Their work at Oka last year was favourably reported on, and they are both genuinely interested in the improvement of conditions on our Indian reserves. I do hope that their work is satisfactory at Walpole Island and that we can look forward to a year of progress at the school. The Entrance results this year were most satisfactory, and the high school pupils have done well at Wallaceburg.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMargaret F.

Neary:\n\nI would appreciate being relieved of the Music Teaching in No. 1 School this year. I have had a very busy year and summer and I would rather not be tied to teaching this fall.\n\nRooms One and Two were quite enthusiastic about their music last year and made very good progress. Room Three was less enthusiastic, probably because of the lack of encouragement between the regular lessons.\n\nThe Junior and Intermediate Rooms sang at the Music Festival in Sarnia last May and received 79 marks in each of two choruses. Our girls' solo made a mark of 78.\n\nThe year was finished with a recital in the Parish Hall. The proceeds from a collection at the door, amounting to $17.11, were spent in treats for a school picnic.\n\nAll in all, I think the children have made a good start with their music and with their teachers' help will continue to make progress. I enjoyed working with the Indian children and will continue to help them whenever the opportunity arises.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nMrs. Dorothy Stallwood.\nMrs. Dorothy Stallwood.\nAugust 23, 1949.\n\nMrs. Dorothy Stallwood,\nWalpole Island, Ontario.\n\nWalpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School\n\nDear Mrs. Stallwood:\n\nI have for answer your letter of August 12 and would suggest that you discuss the teaching of music with Miss Rossor when she arrives.\n\nI think that either she or Miss Roberts is a qualified music teacher and will be glad to take over this responsibility.

The reason I am doing this is because our family needs extra income at this time due to the support of our children out of work. My husband's father has had a very bad year on the farm and my father-in-law is unemployed. We happen to be the sole support in both cases and it would help us greatly to have ready cash each month.\n\nWe also carry heavy insurance which we must keep up.\n\nIt does not seem to put the Department to a lot of bother in this matter. Whatever we can do to help, we shall be only too glad to cooperate. We need write at the end of each month if you so desire.\n\nThank you for past favours in this regard and trust that this request will meet with your approval.\n\nYours sincerely,\nMrs. James Daley\nHalpole Island No. 1 School\nOttawa, October 5, 1933.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the last instant, I beg to say that, if you apply at the end of each month, the Department will be prepared to favourably consider granting you an advance on your salary as teacher of the Walpole Island No. 1 School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Mr. Macdonald has quoted for delivery to Mr. Macdonald at White Island. $65.00\n\nAnd the amounts for which Mr. Macdonald (name of) tendered (Indian of White Island) will appear in the labor list.\n\nMaking the whole cost of labor $17.10\n\nThis $17.10 is over the amount of the estimate, so it is thought that the ceiling would not require to be fitted. But on going to work to remove the plaster it was found to be all loose from the lath work or less, and new plaster could not be applied to the old. So it was thought better to take it off first and plaster it all over.\n\nThis is written to give the advance in respect of all building material.

Where there is adequate provision for ventilation there should be 250 cu. ft. of air space per pupil, based on the maximum attendance. On this basis there is air space for 18 pupils and there 32 Indian children and 2 white children present on the occasion of my visit, and there are 57 children who should attend this school.\n\nThe class-room has a pine floor but I think it should be oiled. The oil renders the floor more sanitary, inasmuch as it keeps down the dust. If floor is oiled it is easier to sweep it properly. And there is the further advantage that the oil preserves the floor and makes it wear longer.\n\nSgd. Henry Conn,\nInsp.\nExtract from Report of Mr. R. H. Abraham, Undergraduate of the O. A.

Size 17 x 20 x 10 = 4590 sq. ft. According to the Ontario Education Dept's Regulations there must be 250 cu. ft. for each pupil that would mean that the school was large enough for 18 pupils. The day I was there there were 34 present. This is rather important when we consider the number of Indians that die of consumption. Also the drinking arrangements at the school could be improved with a view to checking this disease. Each pupil could be provided with a cup as is done in many of the rural schools.\n\nSgd. R. H.

CO.\nLIMITED\nBROCKVILLE, ONT.\n\nWESTERN BRANCH OFFICE AND WAREHOUSE: 230 PRINCESS ST., WINNIPEG\nFEATURES OF SUPERIORITY IN THE SILENT SANITARY SCHOOL DESKS\n\nIt is Sanitary.\u2014The one-piece standard, with its perfect shield for the book-box, presents no dust pockets or germ-breeding ledges, either inside or outside. Even the feet have been fitted with rubber caps so that round surfaces are prevented from catching dust, and germs cannot lodge.\n\nBeauty of Design.\u2014The prevailing idea of simplicity is splendidly carried out. The proportions are unusually graceful, and the desks make a fine appearance in the school room.\n\nComfort Curves.\u2014The seat and back are so shaped that they insure restfulness, at the same time keeping the pupils body in proper position.\n\nStrength\u2014Construction.\u2014By scientific calculation and practical test, we have distributed the weight so that the greatest possible strain is taken by the legs. This distribution ensures the essential feature of any school desk\u2014a absolute rigidity.\n\nPest Rent and Protection Board.\u2014This is thoroughly protected. Each end rests in an iron socket in the leg, and is further secured by screws passing through the iron standard into the floor. The board is made of hard wood, so that the dust slides off, and cannot accumulate. This also acts as a protection board, preventing one pupil from annoying the pupil in front and soiling his or her clothing.\n\nNOISELESS AUTOMATIC SEAT HINGE\n\nThe Automatic Seat Hinge is absolutely noiseless and will not loosen. In operation, the parts automatically tighten themselves.\n\nFigure \"A\" shows the parts of the \"Sanitary Noiseless\" Hinge.\n\nThe ball on the inside of the seat arm casting (1) rests in the socket in the hub of the seat bearing (2). The hardened steel roller (3) rests in the hollow (4) of the hub. This roller bears against the eccentric (5) as the seat is lowered or raised. The bolt (6) passes through the seat arm casting and the hub, and is held in place by the nut (7). The nut lock (8) prevents the seat (7) from working loose.\n\nThe seat arm and bearings operate entirely on the hub, and the bolt is used only to hold the parts in place. The construction of this full arm and bearing system (instead of the usual seat movement), and the hardened steel roller working against the eccentric, gives a gradually increasing resistance until the seat is brought to a full stop. This permits such perfect adjustment of the parts that the hinge is absolutely frictionless and noiseless. The greatest strain on any hinge is when the seat is brought to a full stop. Any other hinge would be forced to bear the eccentricity is located. With this hinge any spreading where the eccentricities are located forces the hinge-strap more securely in place. The result is that the hinges, therefore, simply automatically tightens the parts.\n\nFigure B shows the hinge with part of the iron cut away so that you can see the position of the hardened steel roller and the eccentricity of the seat arm bearing. Like metal, working against like metal, would rapidly wear away. The resilient steel roller, however, permits a slight yielding, so that the seat arm bearing is always kept in place. The hinge is absolutely noiseless, and its ingenious construction forces it to tighten itself when in operation.\n\nTABLE OF SIZES, WEIGHTS AND MEASUREMENTS OF NEW SANITARY DESKS\n\n| Size | No. 1 | No. 2 | No. 3 | No. 4 | No. 5 | No. 6 |\n|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Ages Accommodated | Adults 15 to 18 | 12 to 15 | 9 to 12 | 6 to 9 | 3 to 6 | 0 to 3 |\n| Distance Across Top, Singles | 40 ins. | 40 ins. | 38 ins. | 36 ins. | 34 ins. | 32 ins. |\n| Distance Across Top, Doubles | 40 ins. | 40 ins. | 38 ins. | 36 ins. | 34 ins. | 32 ins. |\n| Width of Top | 16 ins. | 16 ins. | 14 ins. | 14 ins. | 12 ins. | 12 ins. |\n| Height of Top | 29 ins. | 29 ins. | 27 ins. | 26 ins. | 24 ins. | 23 ins. |\n| Height of Seat | 17 ins. | 17 ins. | 15 ins. | 14 ins. | 13 ins. | 12 ins. |\n| Distance Back to Back | 24 to 30 ins. | 21 to 27 ins. | 18 to 24 ins. | 15 to 21 ins. | 12 to 18 ins. | 9 to 15 ins. |\n\n*ALL SIZES FURNISHED WITH ALL SIZES*\n\nWEIGHTS, PACKED FOR SHIPMENT\n\n| Single Desks | 55 lbs. | 55 lbs. | 48 lbs. | 48 lbs. | 39 lbs. | 39 lbs. |\n| Single Rears | 37 lbs. | 37 lbs. | 35 lbs. | 35 lbs. | 32 lbs. | 32 lbs. |\n| Single Fronts | 42 lbs. | 42 lbs. | 38 lbs. | 38 lbs. | 32 lbs. | 32 lbs. |\n| Double Entire Desks | 71 lbs. | 71 lbs. | 63 lbs. | 63 lbs. | 50 lbs. | 50 lbs. |\n| Double Entire Rears | 50 lbs. | 50 lbs. | 44 lbs. | 44 lbs. | 34 lbs. | 34 lbs. |\n| Double Entire Fronts | 53 lbs. | 53 lbs. | 47 lbs. | 47 lbs. | 37 lbs. | 37 lbs. |\nSILENT SANITARY SCHOOL DESKS\nWITH FOLDING SEATS\n\nVIEW OF ROW OF SILENT SANITARY DESKS IN POSITION\n\nMADE IN THREE FORMS:\n\nSINGLE\u2014Each Accommodating One Pupil. DOUBLE\u2014Each Accommodating Two Pupils.\n\nDOUBLE, WITH SEPARATE SEATS:\nEach Accommodating Two Pupils, with Separate Seat for Each Folding Independently.\n\nTHE CASTINGS are of the best grade of iron, finished in finest glossy Baking Japan or Dead Black as preferred. They are of the greatest possible strength, and will withstand not only the severest use, but abuse. Having made School Desk Castings for more than thirty-five years, we can absolutely guarantee our work in that line. In the design of the Silent Sanitary Castings the strain is so distributed as to give the greatest strength where it is most required.\n\nTHE WOODWORK of the Silent Sanitary Desks is of best selected Hard Maple or Birch, thoroughly seasoned with tongued and grooved and glued joints, making them as solid as if made from one piece of wood. The wood parts are fastened to the irons by screws and a dovetail and lug device, which is exceedingly secure, and at the same time easy to apply. The backs and seats are shaped so as to afford comfort and a correct position of the body to the pupil. The woods are coated with moisture-proof varnish and will not warp, crack or check. The tops are finished in a rich mahogany color to prevent the light from being reflected; the backs and seats in the natural colors of the woods making an attractive color combination, which has a fine decorative effect in the school-room.\n\nINK WELLS, with handsomely nickel-plated covers, lying flush with the top, and iron castings to protect the glass (see cut), are furnished with each desk. Two ink wells for each desk, the extra one to contain a sponge, will be furnished when ordered at a small additional charge.\n\nDESKS may be shipped either \"set up\" or \"knocked down.\" In either way we pack them so that they will come to hand in perfect order. Freight is lower when they are shipped \"knocked down,\" and for long distances the difference will more than pay the cost of setting up, which is a work of no difficulty whatever.\nJune 29th, 1916.\n\nJ. D. Kelton, Esq.,\nDeputy Sup't General, Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are advised that you are making certain extensions to your school, in which school buildings a considerable quantity of new desks will be required. In this connection we write to call your attention to our silent sanitary pattern of desk, as shown on the enclosed circular.\n\nAs the name implies these desks are constructed on strictly sanitary lines, having perfectly smooth seating, preventing accumulation of dirt or dust. It is also fitted with the silent hinge joint, a very valuable feature, which does away with any unnecessary noise and confusion on lifting or lowering seat part.\n\nThe wood is of finely finished white maple, the seat and back part being in the natural color with a mahogany colored top. In constructing this desk we have followed out the lines of simplicity as closely as possible, and while doing so have not sacrificed the strength of same. It is a strong and durable desk, and one if installed by your board will be an ornament to your school.\n\nWill you kindly give us a list of the number of desks that will be required, stating a set of plans with same, and with this information before us, we will then gladly quote you our lowest prices.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nArchitect.\nOttawa, July 8th, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated 29th ultimo in reference to school desks at Walpole Island, and in reply to inform you that it is not anticipated that any new desks will be required at this time as the addition to this school contemplated is more the improving of conditions thereby increasing the floor and air space for those already in attendance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

This is the action taken in respect to boarding and industrial schools and should work satisfactorily in day schools.\n\nMy reason for calling your attention to the matter particularly at this time is the steadily declining attendance at No.1 school from an average of 24 in 1915 to less than 14 in 1916 notwithstanding that the reports of the public school Inspector are favourable to the teacher in charge.\n\nI am of the opinion that if the responsibility for non-attendance is placed on the agent and he requested to enforce regularity with the assistance of a truancy officer, if necessary, there would then be less opportunity for friction between their parents and teachers and more satisfactory results obtained from the school.\n\nThe enforcing of attendance at the No.2 school would no doubt have an equally beneficial result.\n\nThe providing of a residence for the teachers would also assist in the retention of capable ones, as at present there is no suitable stopping place except with the agent and this apparently has not been satisfactory to either the agent or teachers. The teachers have had therefore, to put up with accommodation in Indian houses in the vicinity of the schools.\n\nIn the village where a new school is erected the old school might be converted into a residence for the teachers at small cost.\n\nArchitect.\nOttawa, November 14, 1916.\n\nMemorandum\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nOn October 26 last I made an inspection of the Walpole Island Agency building repairs and while there made inquiries with respect to condition of school affairs at that place, which are anything but satisfactory.\n\nIt was reported in 1915 that on this reserve there were 120 children of school age; 86 pupils enrolled in the school and an average attendance of 48 at the reserve schools and 7 at industrial schools. The enrollment at the village school (No.1) in 1915 was 50 with an average attendance of 24 during the year and as the school building provided accommodation for 18 only, plans were made for the erection of an addition to this building to accommodate 40 pupils, but owing to the tenders being unduly high the addition to the school was not provided. I am of the opinion, however, that a new school should be built here as soon as possible after the opening up of spring to provide accommodation for all children of school age in the vicinity of the No.1 school, and that the attendance of all pupils be enforced regularly. To do this the Agent would have to act as truant officer and be responsible to the Department for the regular attendance of the pupils.\n\nThe teacher might report to the agent at least once a week or oftener the names of all delinquents with particulars as to attendance and the agent should then enforce attendance or punish the persons responsible for the pupil's absence, which\nwhich would ensure regular attendance. This is the action taken in respect to boarding and industrial schools and should work satisfactorily in day schools.\n\nMy reason for calling your attention to the matter particularly at this time is the steadily declining attendance at No.1 school from an average of 24 in 1915 to less than 14 in 1916 notwithstanding that the reports of the public school Inspector are favourable to the teacher in charge.\n\nI am of the opinion that if the responsibility for non-attendance is placed on the agent and he requested to enforce regularity with the assistance of a truancy officer, if necessary, there would then be less opportunity for friction between their parents and teachers and more satisfactory results obtained from the school.\n\nThe enforcing of attendance at the No.2 school would no doubt have an equally beneficial result.\n\nThe providing of a residence for the teachers would also assist in the retention of capable ones, as at present there is no suitable stopping place except with the agent and this apparently has not been satisfactory to either the agent or teachers.

They have a truant officer there and the teachers have done their best to keep the attendance up with no encouragement from the Agent, in fact it is a question whether he has not been a hindrance. I judge this from his own reports, as nothing apparently affords him greater pleasure than noting the falling off of the attendance. He has never said anything about assisting the teachers in this direction and his attitude towards them has been such that Miss Wilson, the teacher of the No. 1 School, has sent in her resignation, asking that it take effect on the first proximo. Miss Warnock, the teacher of the No. 2 School, resigned after the summer holidays and Mr. Cork, who has taken her place, is not satisfactory to Mr. McCallum.\n\nMr. Public School Inspector Conn, in his report\nOn the No. 1 School states as follows:\u2014 \"The pupils who were present showed satisfactory proficiency and are undoubtedly making good progress. The teacher is to be commended for the attention she is giving to hygiene and personal cleanliness. I examined samples of the pupils' works in plain sewing and am very pleased with the work that is being done. I believe the teacher is making efforts to secure better attendance, but she is not meeting with much success.\"\n\nMiss Wilson may have offended some of the parents on account of her desire to have the children cleanly in their habits and person and from what I can learn Mr. McCallum is rather pleased than otherwise at the teacher's unpopularity. Mr. Inspector, in a previous report on this school states that Miss Wilson is a capable teacher and doing efficient work and that he is pleased with the attentionshe is devoting to physical culture and hygiene. He adds that Miss Wilson is difficult to get on with. Mr. McCallum apparently never made an effort to get on with her, in fact ever since she has been there he has done what he can to make her position untenable and I am of the opinion that he is prepared to do the same with Mr. Cork.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Reuter\nIN THE OFFICE OF THE INDIAN AGENT\n\n[Signature]\n\nNovember 8th\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 5th instant I did not know that the school roof leaked until you wrote about it.

In regard to the cows being in the school yard some of the Indians was quite angry because I turned them out, I told them at least if I found them there again I would put them in pound.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Office\n\nWalpole Island\nNov 2nd 1917\nSir,\n\nThe fence has been down in front of the school house. The clouts was damaged some days ago. That's $5.00 over the expenses I think.\n\nSincerely,\n\nH.S. H. Hillman\nIndian Agent\n\nJ. D.

I thought we could change to Xmas gifts for the scholars always took fun time then I think it was $4.50 for each school that we did get a grant from the Department. However, I would suggest that they bundle to $15.50 and $2.50. The reason for this difference between the two schools is on account of the attendance in your two new towns in the matter.

Paul [signature],\nIndian Agent,\nGarnia, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to yours of the 18th inst., referring to No. 1 school and wood shed at Walpole Island. With reference to the school I might say that the side walls was bulged a little possibly two inches on each side but have not spread any since the floor was put in two years ago, as the floor shows no opening at either side. At the school house the floor is worn some and a little rough but would not advise doing anything with floor at present, as it has only been in about two years.\n\nWith reference to the wood shed I might say there are a few boards off the side of the wood shed, I would estimate about 60 ft. of lumber and $5.00 for work and delivery of lumber which would be sufficient to repair the wood shed, or a total estimate of $5.00.\n\nTrusting this information will be satisfactory, I remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nJ.D.

The Inspector states that, if the present attendance keeps up, it will be necessary to put the pupils on half time during the winter, as it will be impossible to accommodate them all at one time.\n\nMr. McKay, who recently returned from Sarnia, informs me that this school is very much overcrowded, the children being packed in as close as they can be seated. Both the teacher and the agent spoke to him about the necessity for more accommodation.\n\nA new school building is badly needed at this point, as the present building, besides being too small, is very old and in poor repair.\n\nIn June, 1916, tenders were called for alterations and additions to this school, plans having been made to provide accommodation for 40 pupils. Only one tender was received, which was unduly high, and the work was not carried out.\n\nThe Chippewas of Walpole Island have about $16,000.00 at the credit of capital in their band funds and they could provide the money required to erect a suitable building.\n\nMr.\nMr. McKay states that the teacher and the agent suggested that, until a new building is erected, accommodation could be provided for all the children in the parish hall. This building is owned by the English Church authorities and, if a few repairs were made, it would be quite suitable and large enough to provide the necessary accommodation. It might be well to instruct the Agent to arrange with the church authorities for the renting of this building and to have the seats and equipment in the present school moved there. The teacher informed Mr. McKay that there would be no difficulty about making arrangements with the church authorities for renting the building. The only expense involved in using the parish hall would be the payment of the rent and the providing of a few more desks. I may say that Mr. McKay agrees that this would be the best arrangement that could be made, pending the erection of a new building.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, November 6, 1929.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nAs the building in which the No. 1 Indian Day School on Walpole Island is at present conducted is very old and too small to accommodate the number of children who attend it has been suggested to the Department that it might be possible to obtain the use of the parish hall, which would be quite suitable, to carry on the work until such time as a new school building is erected, which it is planned to do in the near future.\n\nI have to request Your Lordship to be good enough to state whether there would be any objection to the Department obtaining the use of the parish hall for school purposes and, if not, the amount of rent per month that would be charged the Department for the use of the same. If the parish hall can be secured it will simplify the situation at present existing there. The desks and other equipment at the present school could be moved and placed in the hall.\n\nI will be pleased if Your Lordship will give this matter your early attention and forward a reply as to whether you will consent to the parish hall being obtained for school purposes, or not.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRight Rev. David Williams, D.D.,\nBishop of Huron,\nLondon, Ont.\n\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, 6th November, 1918.\n\nSir:-\n\nWalpole Island Agency\n\nI enclose herewith the voucher amounting to $8.96 which you submitted recently in favour of Messrs. Shaw and Shaw of Wallaceburg for supplies furnished for No. 1 School, Walpole Island, and I also return the voucher amounting to $1.23 in favour of the same firm for supplies furnished the said School.\n\nEach of these accounts should be amended so as to indicate on the face thereof the date and number of the official letter in which the expenditure was authorized.\n\nIn this connection I may say that in cases where expenditure is incurred without authority from the Department, full explanation as to the authority for the outlay should be furnished, and I may add that it is only in exceptional cases that expenditure should be incurred without authority.\n\nWhen you send amounts to the Department, you should endeavour to furnish full particulars relating thereto in order to obviate the necessity of correspondence, as it is desirable that accounts shall be promptly paid when received and this cannot be done unless good explanation are furnished when they are presented.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nThe Bishop's Room\nBishop Gregg Hall\nLondon, Canada\n7th Nov., 1919.\n\nA. Macdonald, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of November 4th received. In reply let me say that I am communicating at once with the Rector of Walpole Island in connection with our request, and as soon as I hear from him, I shall let you know. Believe me yours faithfully,\n\nDavid Williams\nBishop of Huron.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFollowing my letter of the 7th inst., acknowledging the receipt of yours of the 4th inst., I now enclose to you a copy of the Resolution which was passed by the Indians of the Select Vestry of St. John's Church, Walpole Island, consenting to the renting of the Parish House. I am quite prepared to rent the Parish House for the purposes of a school.

The Department was under the impression, when requesting Your Lordship's permission for the use of this building, that the Indians would be prepared to allow it to be used for the purpose of providing more accommodation for their children at a nominal rental. The Department would hardly feel warranted in taking from the funds at the credit of the band, the amount of the rental asked, and would be very pleased if Your Lordship would again refer this matter to the vestry of St. John's Church with a view to securing the rental of the building at a greatly reduced figure.\n\nThanking Your Lordship for the trouble taken in this matter, I have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRight Rev.

We will continue to monitor the situation closely and take appropriate action as necessary.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\nThis situation is very serious that the pupils should be left at liberty.\n\nI have written to Mr. Smith about this matter.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of the letter I wrote to Mr. Smith.\n\nI hope this will help.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Name]\nOttawa, December 1, 1919.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo with reference to the obtaining of the parish hall for the purpose of a school-room for the children of the No. 1 School on Walpole Island, as the present school is too small to accommodate the number of children who attend.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is endeavouring to obtain the hall at a much lower rental than at first asked, and will await a reply before dealing with the suggestion offered by you, namely,\u2014that half the pupils attend one session and the remainder the other session each day. If the Department is unable to obtain the parish hall upon reasonable terms, your suggestion will receive serious consideration and you will be further advised. I may say that a reply is expected from His Lordship the Bishop of Huron, who is arranging with the churchwardens as to renting the parish hall.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMrs. Florence Macdonald,\nTeacher,\nWalpole Island No. 1 School,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nI had an interview with the Indian authorities in reference to renting the Parish Hall at Walpole Island for a School, and we discussed the matter at great length. Considering that the Hall would be used five days of the week, and much wear and tear would inevitably ensue, notwithstanding the greatest care, it is felt that $20.00 a month is a fair rent to ask from the Department. Of course, it is understood that the Hall will be free on Saturdays and Sundays for the use of the Congregation, and also that the expense of heating and cleaning the Hall will belong to the Department.\n\nBelieve me, yours faithfully,\n\nDavid Williams\nBishop of Huron.\nOttawa, December 5, 1919.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 29th ultimo in further reference to the question of renting the parish hall at Walpole Island for school purposes.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will accept the offer made by the Indian authorities and will pay a rental of $20.00 per month for the period the hall is used for school purposes. It is understood that the hall will be free on Saturdays and Sundays for the use of the congregation. The Department will undertake the expense of the heating during the days the school is in operation and will also be responsible for cleaning the hall while in use by the pupils. The Department will assume payment of the rent at the above rate from January 1st, next, until such time as the new school building is ready for occupation.\n\nInstructions are being sent to our Agent to have the equipment in the present building transferred to the hall and to have it ready for the re-opening of the school after the Christmas holidays.\n\nI beg to thank Your Lordship for the trouble you have taken in this matter.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRight Rev. David Williams, D.D.,\nBishop of Huron,\nLondon, Ont.\n\n(For Asst. Deputy and Secretary.)\nOttawa, December 5, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nAs the building in which the No. 1 Indian Day School on Walpole Island is at present conducted is too small to accommodate the number of children who attend, the Department has arranged with His Lordship the Bishop of Huron for the renting of the parish hall from the vestry of St. John's Church at a rental of $20.00 per month from the first day of January next. It has been represented to the Department that this is the most suitable arrangement that can be made to provide accommodation for all the Indian children until such time as a new building is erected, which it is planned to have done in the near future.\n\nI have, therefore, to request that, during the coming Christmas holidays, you will make the necessary arrangements to have the equipment in the present building transferred to the parish hall. The desks should be transferred and arranged in suitable order and also, if possible, the blackboards should be transferred and set up in the hall. It may be that some new desks will be required to provide seating for all the pupils and, if so, you should forward a list showing the sizes and the number of each size required. The name and address of the manufacturer of the present desks should also be given, so that any new desks ordered can be of the same kind as those at present in the school.\n\nIn renting this hall it is understood with the church authorities that the hall will be free to them on Saturdays and Sundays for the use of the congregation, also that the expense of heating and cleaning the hall during the days the school is in operation is to be undertaken by the Department.\n\nIt is hoped that you will attend to the matter of having the equipment transferred and the hall ready for the teacher to resume duties after the holidays. It might be well to consult her in the arranging of the desks, etc., in the parish hall. Any expenses that are incurred by you in having the removal made will be paid upon the receipt of properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure.\n\nAny fuel which may be on hand at the old school should be transferred for the use of heating the hall, and, if a further supply is required, you will be good enough to inform the Department of the amount of the same and the price at which it can be obtained, when authority will be granted for its purchase.\n\nYou will be good enough to forward at the end of\n\nThos. Paul, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\neach month vouchers for the payment of the rent at the rate above stated, namely, $20.00 per month.\n\nIt is expected that you will give all the above matters your prompt attention, and you will be good enough to inform the Department at the beginning of the new year as to whether the above instructions for the transfer of the equipment have been carried out and the hall made ready for school purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nWalpole Island Agency.\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 5th inst., and previous correspondence in regard to the No.1 Indian Day School, on Walpole Island, and with reference to the renting of the Parish Hall, for school purposes during the winter, beg leave to advise that I attended a meeting of General Council held by the Indians, on Walpole Island, in the Parish Hall on Monday, Dec. 29th, and would not unhesitatingly say that it will be impossible to heat the Parish Hall during the winter. I am very doubtful if it could be successfully heated even with two stoves, as it would necessitate the purchase of a stove along with a great deal of extra fuel, and would further advise and recommend that as the average attendance will not likely increase during the winter months we'd advise that school be conducted in the present building until a new school is erected.\n\nFurther I learned that the Indians hold a great many meetings in the Parish Hall, and believe if we move the school to the Parish Hall, it would be a great deal of confusion.\n\nAwaiting your reply, I remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, January 3, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo with reference to the renting of the parish hall for the purpose of providing accommodation for the pupils of the No. 1 School on the Walpole Island Reserve during the present winter.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department understood, before making arrangements for the renting of the hall, that it would be quite suitable for school purposes in all respects. An officer of this Department, who visited Sarnia last fall, was informed by both the teacher and yourself that the parish hall could be heated and made comfortable.\n\nYou were instructed by official letter of December 5th, last, to make the necessary arrangements to have the equipment in the present building transferred to the parish hall. As it is understood that you visit Walpole Island each week there has been unnecessary delay in informing the Department that you now consider the building unsuitable, as it will be impossible to heat it during the winter.\n\nIn view of the report which you now furnish regarding the unsuitableness of the parish hall and in which you recommend that, as the average attendance will not likely increase during the winter months, it would be advisable that the school be conducted in the old school building until such time as a new building is erected, the Department will approve of this arrangement being carried out. You should assist the teacher in making the best possible arrangement for the accommodation of the children in the present building.\n\nThos. Paul, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nbuilding.\n\nYou should inform the authorities of St. John's Church, Walpole Island, who have charge of the parish hall, that it is not the intention of the Department to take over the building for school purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

The error consisted in paying Mr. Nicholas $6.37 for 1257 ft of lumber at $5.00 per ft, while you should have paid $6.28. The amount of this payment must be deducted from the Indians; the next time the payment is made to him by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAnt.

When the Indians have all the lumber sawn, we will consider your suggestion. If it is too late this season, we might defer building till next year. In the meantime we will have our site and this amount of the material ready.\n\nR. H. Abraham, Esq., B.S.A.,\nR. R. No. 1, Chatham, Ont.\nOttawa, July 24, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, in which you advise that the work of constructing the new school building on Walpole Island be postponed until next year.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department considers that, owing to the cost of material at the present time, it would be well to postpone this work until next year. You should state, however, what disposition is being made of the lumber and other material that is being saved for the building. This should be stored in some secure place, where it will not deteriorate or be lost.\n\nIn the meantime you should arrange to complete the purchase of the land for the site and have the quit claim deed signed as soon as you can arrange to do so. When the document is completed it should be forwarded to the Department.\n\nVouchers should be submitted by you at a later date covering the advance made for the saving and hauling of the building material and for the purchase of the site.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

I may add that the Department is not prepared to go to any large expense at this school, in view of the fact that it is the intention to erect a new school building at this point, probably in the spring. In the meantime any minor repairs that will make the building more comfortable will receive attention. You should look into this matter at once and furnish a full report to the Department, together with an estimate of the cost of any repairs which you consider necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

First he states that the classroom is cold in winter. I believe that I have visited this school oftener in the winter than Mr. Conn has visited it and never found the room cold. The room is too small for the number of children attending and I would report that this room is not hard to heat.\n\nWith reference to the porch, I believe that this porch could be repaired at an estimated cost from $5.00 to $7.00.\n\nTwo new blinds might be purchased which I believe are necessary at an estimated cost of $3.00.\n\nWith reference to making the classroom more comfortable during the winter I do not believe anything could be done in view of the fact that it is the intention of the Department to erect a new school, at this point, in the near future. I would not recommend any extensive repairs on the old building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst.

You may, however, arrange to have any minor repairs required to the porch and the repairs for this purpose should not exceed your estimate of \u00a37.00. You may also purchase two new blinds which you state are required.\n\nBoth the repairs to the porch and the purchase and putting up of the blinds should be done as expensively as possible.\n\nProperly receipted vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred for the above purpose.

It is true that I made a mistake in transferring the item of $247.41 in making the return for the year 1920 my statement was $249.41 a mistake of $2.00 which is due. This balance $9.52 is not a refund that should be made.\n\nIn the year of 1919 the Dept sent me two cheques one for $500.00 which I accounted for $247.41 plus .00\u00a2 by voucher and $252.51 by cheque the other was for $100.00 for which I sent in a voucher for $109.52 this left a balance due me not the amount of $9.52 this amount was sent me by cheque and I deposited it in my private account as I had a perfect right to do as it was paying me back for money which I had advanced the Dept. Therefore the $9.52 was not properly charged against me as shown in your statement of June 16th as I did not receive it as an advance.\n\nIn making my returns for 1920 I made this explanation on the voucher as in a previous statement I had credited the Dept. with it as an advance.\n\nTrusting that I have made the transaction clear and that you will forward the balance due me by return mail.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.D.

F. Vilas, Cowansville, Que.\nSept. 21st, 1921.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nHonourable Sir James Lougheed,\n\nIn March last you approved the erection of a two-roomed school house on Walpole Island, the cost of which was to be paid from the funds of the band. The Indians supplied the lumber, which was cut on the Reserve, and the work was done by day labour, under the supervision of our Agricultural Representative, Mr. R. H. Abraham.\n\nMr. Abraham states that the building will be completed and ready for occupation by the middle of next month, and has asked that the desks and school furnishings be supplied. There are about 100 children of school age who should attend, and the two class rooms provide seating accommodation for 40 children in each room, and it is intended to provide desks for that number. The following supplies will be required, and will cost approximately the sum of $1100.00, viz:\n\n- 80 single desks.............. $936.00\n- 2 teachers' desks............. 50.00\n- 2 teachers' chairs............ 20.00\n- Visitors' chairs.............. 34.00\n- 2 bookcases................... 62.00\n\n$1100.00.\n\nAs the cost of erecting the building will be about $5,000, the funds at the credit of the band will not allow for the expenditure involved in the purchase of the above school furniture. The appropriation for Indian education can provide the necessary funds, and I would request your authority for the above expenditure to be approved.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nOctober 6th, 1921.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nPurchasing Commission\nof Canada,\n\nI beg to recommend for your approval that acceptance of the tender of the Globe Furniture Company Limited, Waterloo, Ontario, for school furniture required for the Walpole Island (Ontario) No. 1 Indian Day School be accepted. The tender of this firm is recommended for the reason that the total cost of the desks, etc., is the lowest except in the quotations for the teachers' chairs and the bookcases. The tender of the Globe Furniture Company is as follows:\n\n| Item                  | Quantity | Unit Price | Total   |\n|-----------------------|----------|------------|---------|\n| 20 single desks       |          | $3         | $184.00 |\n| 20 chairs             |          | $5         | $175.00 |\n| 20 chairs             |          | $6         | $175.00 |\n| 5 routes              |          | $7         | $65.00  |\n| 2 teachers' desks     | 120      | $25        | $44.00  |\n| 2 chairs              | 1562     | $8         | $16.50  |\n| 2 bookcases           |          | $32        | $64.00  |\n| 4 visitors' chairs    | 1563     | $9.65      | $38.60  |\n\nTotal ...........$434.50\n\nplus sales tax.\n\nThe total of the tender submitted by the St. Lawrence Furniture Company, Riviere du Loup, P.Q., is $979.40. This firm is slightly lower in their quotation for the two teachers' chairs, two bookcases and four visitors' chairs. They quote $6.00 each for the teachers' chairs, $30.00 each for the bookcases and $5.00 each for the visitors' chairs, which compared with that of the Globe Furniture Company is $2.25 lower for the teachers' chairs, $2.00 lower for the bookcases and $4.65 lower for the visitors' chairs.\n\nIt is necessary that uniformity of design and finish in the equipment of the school be obtained and as the quotation of the Globe Furniture Company for all the supplies required is lower in the total amount, I am recommending that this firm be awarded the order.\n\nThe tenders received are attached herewith. I will be pleased if you will have them returned with your minute authorising the purchase of the above school equipment from the Globe Furniture Company.\n\n[Signature]\n\nF. H.

Tuttlewood\nChair of School Board\nDepartment of Education\n\nH. L. Macdonald\nFor P.E.I.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nHonourable Sir James Lougheed.\n\nIn March last you approved the erection of a two-roomed school house on Walpole Island, the cost of which was to be paid from the funds of the band. The Indians supplied the lumber, which was cut on the Reserve, and the work was done by day labour, under the supervision of our Agricultural Representative, Mr. R. H. Abraham.\n\nMr. Abraham states that the building will be completed and ready for occupation by the middle of next month, and has asked that the desks and school furnishings be supplied. There are about 100 children of school age who should attend, and the two class rooms provide seating accommodation for 40 children in each room, and it is intended to provide desks for that number. The following supplies will be required, and will cost approximately the sum of $1100.00, viz:\n\n- 80 single desks..............$936.00\n- 2 teachers' desks.............50.00\n- 2 teachers' chairs............20.00\n- 4 visitors' chairs............34.00\n- 2 bookcases..................60.00\n\n$1100.00.\n\nAs the cost of erecting the building will be about $5,000, the funds at the credit of the band will not allow for the expenditure involved in the purchase of the above school furniture. The appropriation for Indian education can provide the necessary funds, and I would request your authority for the above expenditure be approved.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nReport and other documents have been examined and found to be in order.\n\nThe following is suggested:\n\nIn accordance with the recommendation of the Accountant and Purchasing Agent, authority is granted for the acceptance of lowest aggregate tender that of the Globe Furniture Co., Ltd., Waterloo, Ont., plus sales tax, f.o.b., Wallaceburg, Ont.\n\nAUTHORIZED\n\n15-1864\n\nOCT 6 1921\nOTTAWA, October 7th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Purchasing Commission of Canada has approved of the order for the desks and school furniture required for the new school building, which is being erected on the Walpole Island Indian Reserve, being awarded to the Globe Furniture Company Limited, Waterloo, Ontario. The Department is today placing an order with the firm to ship to you addressed to Wallaceburg, Ont., the following:\n\n- 20 single desks, $35 each = $184.00\n- 20 chairs, $15 each = $175.00\n- 20 chairs, $16 each = $175.00\n- 5 desks, single, $35 each = $175.00\n- 2 teachers' desks, $120 each = $240.00\n- 20 chairs, $15 each = $300.00\n- 20 bookcases, $40 each = $800.00\n- 4 visitors' chairs, $15 each = $60.00\n\nTotal = $943.50.\n\nThe above price is F.O.B. Wallaceburg, Ont., plus sales tax.\n\nThe desks will be shipped in a knocked-down condition, with all the necessary parts to assemble and flatten them to the floor. Ink-wells will also be included.\n\nThis firm has been requested to notify you of the date of shipment in order that you can arrange to meet delivery and have them run to the school and assembled in their proper places in the class rooms.\n\nThis firm will also send their account, in duplicate, to you, which, upon arrival of the desks, if in good condition, you will be able enough to certify me for me to the Department in order that payment can be made.\n\nI might say that the blackboards for this school have been ordered to be supplied through the Government Stationery Office.\n\nIt is hoped that the desks will soon arrive; also the blackboards, so that all the school furniture will be on hand when the building is ready for occupation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. Abraham, Esq.,\nAgricultural Representative,\nChatham, Ont.\nOTTAWA, October 7th, 1921.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nI beg to inform you that your tender of the 24th ultimo for the desks and school furniture required at Wallaceburg, Ont., has been accepted. I have, therefore, to request that you will be good enough to ship as soon as possible addressed to R. H. Abraham, Esq., Wallaceburg, Ont., the following:\n\n- 20 single desks, $3.\n- 20 chairs, $4.\n- 20 chairs, $5.\n- 20 chairs, $6.\n- 5 pairs, single, $5.\n- 2 teachers' chairs, $1562.\n- 2 teachers' desks, $120.\n- 2 bookcases, $4.\n- 4 visitors' chairs, $1563.\n\nThese desks should be a cherry colour and ink-wells should be supplied with all desks.\n\nThe desks should be shipped in a knocked-down condition, securely packed, with all the necessary parts supplied to assemble and fasten them to the floor. All the above should be delivered at Wallaceburg, Ontario, at the price quoted by you in your tender; the aggregate amount being $943.50, plus sales tax.\n\nYou will be good enough, when shipment has been made, to immediately notify Mr. Abraham, whose post office address is Chatham, Ont., of the date of shipment in order that he can arrange to accept delivery. When these supplies are shipped, you should, at the same time, forward your account in duplicate to Mr. Abraham, who will be instructed, upon receipt of these desks, if in good condition, to certify the account and forward to the Department when payment will be made.\n\nThe above school furniture is required for a new two-roomed school which is nearing completion on the Walpole Island Indian Reserve, and I will be pleased if this order will receive your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nF.

Manager.\nJanuary 22nd, 1920.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nHon. Mr. Neighan -\n\nThe Department has had under consideration the erection of a new school building on the portion of the Malpole Island reserve occupied chiefly by the Chippewas. The present building, which has become quite dilapidated and beyond repair, has adequate accommodation, as required by the Provincial regulations, only for about twenty children, whereas there are in this section approximately seventy-five children of school age. At the present time the enrolment is almost sixty and the average attendance over forty. We made arrangements this winter to use a public hall on the reserve for school purposes, but unfortunately it was found that the building could not be heated. As it is, some of the children are unable to attend, and the teacher proposed some time ago to adopt a half-day system. One teacher cannot give efficient instruction to so many Indian children and I would propose to erect a two-roomed building and provide salary for an additional teacher.\n\nThis band has a capital of \u00a316,000.00 and I would recommend that we expend therefrom an amount sufficient to erect the building and purchase a new site. There is considerable timber on the lands belonging to the Indians in common, and there are two saw-mills on the reserve.

Mr. Leighen -\n\nThe Department has had under consideration the erection of a new school building on the portion of the Walpole Island reserve occupied chiefly by the Chippewas. The present building, which has become quite dilapidated and beyond repair, has adequate accommodation, as required by the Provincial regulations, only for about twenty children, whereas there are in this section approximately seventy-five children of school age. At the present time the enrolment is almost sixty and the average attendance over forty. We made arrangements this winter to use a public hall on the reserve for school purposes, but unfortunately it was found that the building could not be heated. As it is, some of the children are unable to attend, and the teacher proposed some time ago to adopt a half-day system. One teacher cannot give efficient instruction to so many Indian children and I would propose to erect a two-roomed building and provide salary for an additional teacher.\n\nThis band has a capital of \u00a316,000.00 and I would recommend that we expend therefrom an amount sufficient to erect the building and purchase a new site.

In reply, beg to advise that I took this matter up, as advised, with Mr. Zavitz, Hardware Merchant, of Wallaceburg, Ont., and that he recommended cutting a hole, 3in. in diameter, in the 2nd length of pipe, above the stove. This hole would admit air from the school room, which he says, in many cases, prevents the smoke from condensing. And, if this does not give result, the only remedy would be, to build another chimney on the side of the school, that we might be able to install a shorter string of pipes, which would eliminate the condensing of creosote, and smoke. I might add, that I believe that we have enough dry wood at this school, to carry us through the winter, which I believe will also give us less trouble with smoke and creosote.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.D.

There are 65 pupils enrolled so I would ask that twenty dollars ($20) be added. That is $1 per dollar for each pupil.\n\nAs the Walpole Island Post Office has been closed, would you kindly make arrangements to have a special route box put up at the school. Otherwise a nine mile drive is necessary in order to procure the school correspondence.\n\nWith regard to the hot lunches, kindly inform me at your earliest convenience if it is the policy of the Department that these should be served. Last year the pupils were served with hot cocoa at noon. Now however the\nattendance has so increased that it would be necessary to have more lunches, a moderately priced coal oil stove and an issue of cocoa and biscuits or an allowance for same. We would willingly instruct and supervise the older pupils in the preparation and serving of these lunches should the Department deem them advisable.\n\nYou will be pleased to learn that since the fires have been wrapped with asbestos, there is no bother now with smoke. The placing of the two ventilators in the floors of the upstairs rooms in the teacher's residence, has completely solved the heating arrangements.\n\nThanking you for all past kindness,\n\nYours very truly,\nHarriette Macpherson\n\n(mrs) H.H.

Macpherson, senior teacher of the No. 1 School, Walpole Island. In reply I have to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding $15 in the purchase of suitable gifts to be given the pupils before the school closes for the Christmas holidays. If the teacher makes the purchase, she should obtain itemized accounts covering the expenditure incurred, not exceeding the above authorized amount. These accounts she should hand to you and you will be good enough to attach them to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and send them to the Department for payment.\n\nWith reference to the teacher's request that she be furnished with a rural mail box, I have to request that you will take this matter up with the proper local post office authorities, arrange to secure a box and have it set up at a convenient point. You should forward properly certified vouchers covering the cost of the box and the expense of having it installed. The procuring of this mail box should receive your early attention.\n\nRegarding the teacher's request for the providing of a hot lunch to the pupils, I have to say that, if the teachers will undertake to serve a hot drink at midday, you may furnish them with a small supply of cocoa. The teacher can, no doubt, arrange with the pupils to furnish the milk required in serving the cocoa. We are not prepared to authorize any further expenditure for this purpose, except, if a number of cups to serve the cocoa are needed, you may purchase and supply one dozen.\n\nPlease inform the teacher of the contents of this letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This work\nwas performed by Tomico, after the new school\nwas constructed. For some reason or other, he\nleft and did not present his bill for his work\nuntil this last summer.\n\nI might say that the work consisted\nof cutting down a number of old trees, digging\nout the roots, and levelling the ground up after-\nwards.\n\nI beg to recommend payment.\n\nI remain\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.H.

We informed him that the Department would pay the cost of the box and any expenses in having it installed upon receipt of properly certified vouchers from him covering the cost. Please take this matter up with Mr. Paul, referring him to our letter, with a view to having him take immediate action to obtain the same.\n\nRegarding the repairs to the pump, we were informed by Mr. Abraham, who visited the department yesterday, that the services of a man were secured to make the necessary repairs. It is, therefore, hoped that this has been attended to by this time.\n\nI may say that we wrote the Agent yesterday relative to a change in the janitor. Mr. Abraham suggested the name of Mrs. Coonoe, who lives near the school, and stated that he thought she would perform the duties satisfactorily. We asked Mr. Paul to consult you in this matter, and, if you were both satisfied that a change is advisable, the Department will approve of the appointment of Mrs. Coonoe. The Agent was instructed to inform the new janitor regarding the duties to be performed and also that the work had to be carried out to your satisfaction. I hope that you and the Agent will be able to arrange this matter satisfactorily and that the new janitor, if one is appointed, would be prepared to take up duties on the last possible date.\n\nI presume that the Agent is arranging for the supplying of the mattresses and bedding required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Macpherson\n\n(Mrs.) H. Macpherson,\nNo. 1 Indian School,\nWalpole Island,\nR.R. No. 3, Wallaceburg,\nOntario.\nOn the first week in January a requisition for school supplies was forwarded to the Department through Agent Paul. To date no information has been received re it. Kindly inform me if the requisition reached your office.\n\nWould you kindly instruct Agent Paul to make the necessary arrangements to have the class rooms scrubbed and cleaned during the Easter vacation which begins I believe on April 8th? From the school records it would appear that the floors have not been scrubbed for over a year and they are in a very dirty state. It would be more satisfactory if Mr. Paul were instructed to keep our supply of floor oil replenished and the floors kept oiled as formerly. This preserves the floor and decreases the dust.\n\nIn this connection, I might ask, if it is the Department's wish to discontinue the present janitor service as intimated to Mr. Paul in a letter about Jan. 20th. The woman in whose name the said position was granted, has been sick.\nover two years and her grand-children\nand great-grand-children are endeavoring\nto carry on the work. If a change is to\nbe made it would be advisable to\nhave it come into effect at the end\nof this quarter, ending March 31, 1942.\nArrangements could probably be\nmade to have the new janitors do\nthe scrubbing as part of their\nwork, rather than pay extra for it\nas is now the case.\n\nBecause of the fact that the chimneys\nare defective and the pipes have\nsmoked so much during the past\nthree years, the interior walls are\nvery dirty and smoky. Could you\nplease allow us to paint the\nschool room walls tinted or painted\nduring the Easter holidays. A\ncream colour or some shade that\nwould not show the dirt would be\nbest. I should very much like to have\nthem cleaned before Inspector\nConn makes his semi-annual\nvisit of inspection in May. We will\nhave the walls of the teachers' dept. repainted\nat our own expense.\nWhile awaiting \"Requisition Forms\" which have been obtained from Mr. Paul, may I request:\n\n- Two large boxes of white 13-13 chalk.\n- 1 dozen 7B-4B erasers or brushes.\n\nThis supply will be equally divided between the two rooms, as the supply is very much depleted.\nOttawa, March 9th, 1925.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, relative to the various matters mentioned by you in connection with the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department did not receive the requisition for school supplies which you state you handed to the Agent early in January, last. We are instructing him to forward this requisition as soon as possible. I may say that a requisition is now being forwarded to the Government Stationery Office to send you 2 boxes of chalk and 1 dozen black board brushes.\n\nRegarding the tinting of the walls of the classrooms, we are instructing Mr. Paul to arrange to have the walls tinted during the Easter holidays, using a cream colour or some shade that will not show the dirt. After the tinting has been done, he is to arrange to have the floors thoroughly scrubbed and oiled, also the windows washed.\n\nRegarding the janitor services, we are again drawing Mr. Paul's attention to our instructions of January 20th, last, authorizing him to appoint a new incumbent for this work. We are instructing him to give this matter his prompt attention and to consult you in the matter. We suggested to him in January the name of Mrs. Oconee whom Mr. Abraham stated would perform the work satisfactorily. He is to arrange with the person appointed to scrub the floors of the classrooms once each month. An increase in the salary usually allowed will be given to the new janitor, provided this scrubbing is done each month. It would be advisable for you, acting in conjunction with the Agent, to select a competent person to perform janitor services.\n\nAny suggestions you may have regarding the tinting of the walls as to colour, etc., will no doubt be accepted by the Agent, as he has been requested to consult you in the matter. We hope that he will arrange for the appointment of a new janitor to begin June 1st of April, next, and also in due time arrange for the tinting and cleaning required, in order that the work can be completed during the coming Easter holidays.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a few forms \"Requisition for School Material\", as requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n\nMrs. H. H. Macpherson,\nTeacher, No. 1 Indian Day School,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nOttawa, March 9, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nWe are informed that during the first week in January the teacher of the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School handed you a requisition for school supplies. This requisition has not yet reached the Department. It is considered that you should attend more promptly to these matters, and this requisition should be forwarded as soon as possible.\n\nThe interior walls of the classrooms are very dirty and smoky, occasioned by the defective chimneys and pipes before they were repaired. The Department would like you to arrange to have the classroom walls tinted during the coming Easter holidays. A cream colour or some shade that would not show the dirt should be put on. You should make arrangements so that this work can be commenced immediately after the school closes for the Easter holidays. You are to purchase all material required and arrange to have the work done by a competent person by day labour. Proper time sheets, in duplicate, should be kept for the labour employed.\n\nAfter the tinting has been completed, you should arrange to have the floors thoroughly scrubbed and given a coat of oil. The windows should also be thoroughly cleaned. If there are double windows, they should be removed and properly stored when the weather becomes warmer.\n\nThe Department expects that you will see that this work is satisfactorily carried out during the Easter holidays. We are informing the teacher that you have been instructed to have the tinting of the walls of the classrooms carried out and the floors scrubbed and oiled.\n\nProperly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the cost of the material and time sheets, in duplicate, properly certified, should also be forwarded, when payment will be made. No unnecessary expense should be incurred in having the above work completed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos.

Paul\nAgent.\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nThis year I am taking 5 of the pupils of No. 7 School out to Wallaceburg to try their junior high school Entrance. They range in ages from 14 to nearly 17 years, and I collected them in from the various grades to form an Entrance Class. Have worked very conscientiously with them all year, even teaching them once Saturday morning.\n\nCould you kindly inform me if the Dept. will make any allowances towards the expenses of the examinations, which would be \u00a31 each for fees (\u00a35 in all told) and transportation charges of \u00a31.0 day each, for the three days of the exams (June 24, 26, 28) - \u00a33.0s., making a total in all \u00a31.20. I will have to provide\nthe money myself, if the Indian Dept. does not make any allowances in such cases.\n\nWe will go out together each morning to Wallaceburg (18 miles away) so I wish to help them between examinations and will take our lunches with us thus arranging the trip as cheaply as possible.\n\nTrusting to receive a favourable reply in the near future,\n\nI remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\nHarriette H.

If the parents of any of these pupils can pay the fees and travelling expenses, arrangements should be made to have them do so, and the expenses should not be a charge against this Department. Please make out a statement, in duplicate, showing separately the fees paid and also the transportation charges. This you should certify and hand to Mr. Agent Paul, who is being informed of the authority granted you to incur the expenditure. He has been requested to attach this statement to the necessary voucher forms and send them to the Department, when you will be reimbursed for the outlay not exceeding the amount mentioned. We hope that these pupils, with whom you have taken so much interest and trouble to prepare for the examinations, will pass successfully.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

It is so filled with smoke each morning that the children cannot even go in. After the opening exercises, they must play outside for an hour or so until the classroom is fit for occupation. Added to this the pipes are dropping creosote all over the floor. There is one large hole 31 square on the floor, which is eating into the boards. The odor from this liquid is most obnoxious and hard for eyes and health. On the Indian Agent's last visit to the school two weeks ago, he admitted that the matter was beyond him. The popular belief is that even a new chimney will not remedy the situation.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note]\nHe is very much with us at this time.\nOttawa, November 17th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nThe teacher of the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School has again complained of the smoke condition in the junior room. She states that this room becomes so filled with smoke each morning that the children have to remain outside for an hour or so until the classroom is fit for occupation. Added to this, the pipes are dripping creosote all over the floor and the odor from this liquid is most obnoxious.\n\nAs stated in our letter of today's date, File No. 45-40, this condition may be due in part to the wood that is being used. I have to request that you will arrange at the earliest possible date to have the stove pipe in the junior room wrapped with asbestos, and the cost of this material and the labour in putting it on should be kept down to the lowest possible point. The Department will expect to hear at an early date that the instructions given to have the pipe wrapped with asbestos have been carried out. When the work has been completed, please forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJno. Paul, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nOttawa, November 18th, 1925.\n\nMadam:\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter of the 12th instant relative to the fuel supply and the condition of the stove pipe and chimney at the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School, I beg to inform you that Mr. Agent Paul is being written and requested to see that the full supply of wood for the use of this school is delivered at the earliest possible date.\n\nIt is thought that the present condition regarding the stove pipe and chimney in the junior room may in part be due to the kind of wood that is used for fuel. We have requested the Agent to see that the wood supplied consists principally of red oak and soft maple, also that the stove pipe be wrapped with asbestos. We have further requested the Agent to see that the wood is delivered and the pipe wrapped with asbestos at the earliest possible date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMrs. H. Macpherson,\nTeacher, No. 1 Indian Day School,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of Nov. 17th, inst., with reference to complaint received by the Department from the Teacher of the Fulford Island No. 1 Indian Day School, in the Junior Room, stating that the room becomes so filled with smoke each morning that the classroom is not fit for occupation.\n\nThis condition, I am sorry to say, is too true. I have tried different schemes to eliminate this trouble without success. I will arrange, when at the Island, on Monday, to have pipes fitted with asbestos, as directed.\n\nWith reference to wood purchased for this school, F. 45-40; I might say, that I purchased from Chas. Jacobs last winter, 20 cwt. green wood, 3 ft. long, to be delivered, that we might have dry wood for this school during the winter of 1926-26, this contract has only been partly delivered by Jacobs, and no payments made.\n\nI advised him, when at the Island, last Monday, the 16th inst., to deliver said contract at once, which he agreed to do. The 20 cwt. of wood supplied to each of the No. 1 and No. 2 schools by Allen Isaac, at $2.50 per cwt. dry wood, was for the Teacher's residences, that they might have dry wood for the coming winter. This wood was delivered before vouchers were sent in for payment.\n\nJ.J.L. [Signature]\nOttawa, Ontario.\nI would recommend that Mr. R.G. Off, Architect, of the Department, on his next visit, of inspection, to the Kettle Ft. Indian Bay School, also visit Walpole Island, and make an inspection of the Jr. Room at the Joel School, Walpole Island, that he might be able to make some recommendation to eliminate the smoke and creosote trouble in this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nI would request that, on the occasion of your next visit to the Bandia or Wainiie Indian Agencies, you will visit the school at Wainiie Indian Agency and examine the chimney and roof for any signs of disrepair.

The smoke was so bad in the dort room that it was absolutely impossible to carry on school in that room. I am not one to encourage complaints but I could not remain in the room, and it is unreasonable to expect the teachers and pupils to do so. Surely the Department will take measures to rectify this condition even if it should be necessary to build an additional chimney.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nChas. T.

Both the Agent and the Doctor state that it is necessary to build an additional chimney.\n\nI have to request that you will arrange to have a new brick chimney, suitably located, erected during the coming Easter holidays. You should arrange for the purchase of the brick and other materials required, and for the labour in building the chimney. The Department is placing this matter in your hands, and hopes that you can make the necessary arrangements to have the work done, and at the least possible expense. Properly certified vouchers should be forwarded in the usual manner covering the cost of the material and for the labour employed.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear as to whether you can make arrangements for the purchase of the material and the erection of this chimney.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In this connection I have to inform you that Mr. H. H. Abraham was instructed to arrange to have a new brick chimney erected, in a suitable location in the building, during the coming Easter holidays. In a reply from him, dated the 19th instant, he stated that he was making the necessary arrangements and would have this chimney built. We regret the inconvenience that is being caused to the teachers and the pupils; but it is hoped that it will be possible to carry on without renting another place until such time as the new chimney is finished.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

E. Abraham. The Department wrote the late Mr. Abraham on that date, authorizing him to have a new brick chimney, suitably located, erected during the coming Easter holidays. In a letter dated the 15th instant, he replied stating that he was making the necessary arrangements to have the chimney built. The Department is not aware exactly what arrangements the late Mr. Abraham made, but it is not likely that he had done very much in regard to the matter.\n\nIt is most important that the erection of this new chimney be given early attention, and, in view of Mr. Abraham's death, I have to request that you will look after the matter personally, and make immediate arrangements for the purchase of the brick and the securing of the necessary labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.
