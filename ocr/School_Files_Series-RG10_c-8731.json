Webb of our Vancouver office asking him to review the matter with the Indian Commissioner and to arrange for a member of his staff to investigate conditions at the site and to submit a report to this office covering the project as soon as possible.\n\nWe have now received from Mr. Webb, a Report by Mr. A. Unsworth of his staff, dated September 1st which is self explanatory, together with a sketch plan of the building, and two copies of each are transmitted to you herewith.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Unsworth recommends taking the building completely apart as the only practical method of removal, and suggests salvaging and reusing the material in a building of standard plan.\n\nWe concur in his recommendation against moving the building as a whole or in sections to the Bella Bella Indian Day School Site, and it would appear questionable whether, if the building were demolished and the material salvaged, much of such material could be economically utilized in a standard building.\n\nCopies of Mr. Unsworth's report have been forwarded to the Indian Commissioner for his information.\n\nThe further information referred to by Mr. Unsworth has not been received in this office. We are writing to Mr. Webb and will advise you as soon as we hear further from him on the subject.\n\nEnclos.\n\nJ.M.

The enclosed sheets are an estimate on material available, the estimated cost of dismantling and delivery to school site, and estimated value of material at school site.\n\nThe estimated cost of salvage and delivery, ($1120.00), does not cover the replacement of 320 feet of roadway from main road to school grounds in the Indian Village.\n\nIt will be necessary to hire and bring in a 2\u00bd-ton lumber truck, either from Vancouver or perhaps Bella Coola. It is also necessary to hire a scow and tow boat, probably from the British Columbia Packers at Namu. These items will be of considerable expense, but should be covered by the $1120.00.\n\nIf white men are brought in some costs should be added for fares and subsistence.\n\nThe present school is supplied with electric lighting only from the R.W. Large Memorial Hospital, 115 Volt D.C. plant. The capacity of this plant will not permit further expansion from this source. It would appear that the hospital authorities have in mind the installing of a larger A.C. unit but have insufficient funds to do so. The hospital supply is the best for school use as it is a 24-hour service. The village plant\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6385, File 802-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nonly runs in the evenings during the winter months. There is no justification in running the village plant through the day, but the continual cloudy weather makes it necessary to have the school rooms lighted during most of the school term. A small plant would be a means of supplying power, but would require some attention which may not be possible from the teaching staff. Therefore, it would appear that some agreement with the hospital authorities in respect to new equipment in that institution would result in the most satisfactory lighting supply for the school.\n\nIt would appear that the removal of a building from Air Base to the Indian village is not very profitable if any purchase price is involved. However, if one building is removed it may be considered reasonable to remove others to make up sufficient material for a school. Therefore mention is now made of Building 4 which is fundamentally a duplication of Building 5, with partition rooms added, and would yield about the same amount of material.\n\nThere is also Building 40, a prefabricated type, which would yield some 150 whole panels of 4'x9'6\"-1/2\" fir 3-ply, plus much of the same material about 2'x9'6\". These panels have been layed with few nails on walls of rooms. The siding of building 40 is of tongue and groove material 1-5/8\" thick, 4/8\" face, of cedar equivalent to No. 1 common fir (there are some tight knots in it).\n\nThis material is toe-nailed very lightly from the inside to 2\"x3\" studding.\nThe salvage from this siding would be high with comparably little labour. The roof and floor of this building are of no salvage value, except the floor joists of 2\" x 8\". Further data have been collected and can be submitted if of interest. The size of building is about 24' x 120', and has five water closets, 10 wash basins, and 2 oil furnaces with circulating fans, all in good condition.\n\nA. Unsworth.\n\nAPPROVED\n\nIndian Affairs.

The memorandum is self explanatory and duplicate copies are transmitted herewith for the information of the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nYou will note from previous correspondence that the building referred to is located at the Denny Island, R.C.A.F., Sea Plane Base at Bella Bella and that we were advised that Indian Affairs had arranged to purchase and remove it across an inlet to the site of the present Indian Day School for use as additional class rooms and teacherages.\n\nMr. Unsworth estimates the present salvage value of the material in the building as it stands, at about $1400.00 and the cost of dismantling the building and removing the materials to the new site by Indian labour at $1120.00\n\nIf, however, white men have to be employed to operate a lumber truck, saw and tow boat which it would be necessary to hire, additional costs would be involved that would probably make the cost of salvaging at least equal to the value of similar new materials.\n\nAs previously stated, it is doubtful whether any large proportion of salvaged material could be utilized to advantage in the construction of a new standard building. Also the degree of care exercised in dismantling the building and the condition of the salvaged material are factors which would of course affect its value. The question of the procurability of new materials and the suitability of that salvaged, are matters upon which we cannot advise at this distance.\n\nIt would appear from Mr. Unsworth's list, that the material most likely to be worth while salvaging short of dismantling the whole building, are the window sash and doors, plumbing fixtures and some piping, heating equipment and electrical lighting fixtures and wiring. The estimated cost of removal and delivery of the above named materials, including the amount for contingencies are given at about $191.00 and its value at the school site at $475.00.\n\nCopies of Mr. Unsworth's memorandum were forwarded to Indian Commissioner MacKay of Vancouver by Mr. Webb at an earlier date.\n\nEnclosure\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6385, File 802-5, part 3)\nWith reference to the pre-fabricated building No. 40 mentioned by Mr. Unsworth, Mr. Webb states that - \"If of lighter construction it might be knocked down and reconstructed as teachers residence or as a two room school. Actually in an 80 ft. long building there are just enough windows to provide for two 42 ft. by 24 ft. class rooms and with wastage there would not be enough material to also build a two teacher residence. It would, however, be possible to build a combined one room school and two teacher residence. However, before making a recommendation in this connection I would require to discuss it further with Mr. Unsworth who has seen the building in question\".\n\nChief Engineer.\nDecember 30, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 24th instant, file 2-11-1, in which you state that after conferring with the officers of the Lands and Development Services Branch in Vancouver it has been decided to leave the question of an addition to the Bella Bella School in abeyance until the cost of transferring the buildings is determined.\n\nAs you know, we have already purchased building No. 5 at the R.C.A.F. Seaplane base, Benny Island - see your voucher 133 of August 28, 1947.\n\nBernard F.

A copy of my letter of December 11th to R.C.T. Webb in this connection is enclosed for your information.\n\nD. W. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDec. 11, 1947.\n\nC. H. Webb, Esq., District Chief Engineer, Dominion Water and Power Bureau, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of Mr. Indian Agent Pruden's letter of November 26th in connection with building requirements at Bella Bella for day school use.\n\nIn your letter of October 23rd you advised that the proposed use of one of the buildings from the Bella Bella Air Base would be the subject of a further recommendation following discussion of the matter with Mr. Unsworth but I now understand from my recent discussion with Col. Whyte that it might be feasible and more economical to transfer buildings from Port Hardy by freighter and that you will be in a position to advise definitely regarding this point at a later date when costs of transferring buildings to Campbell River in this manner have been determined.\n\nI am also enclosing a letter dated November 15th from Mr. Pruden regarding the transfer of another building from the Bella Bella Air Base to Klemtu for school use. It is understood that this proposal also will be given consideration in the light of information secured regarding transfer of buildings from Port Hardy to Campbell River.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nEnclosed for your information is a copy of a memorandum just received from the Chief Engineer of the Lands and Development Services Branch. He attached to his memorandum a report from Engineer Unsworth in connection with the proposed removal of a building to Bella Bella as an addition to the school.\n\nWe understand that you have already received a copy of Mr. Unsworth's report.\n\nPlease let me have your comments on the information submitted by Mr. Unsworth and you might also state if the expenditure required to dismantle and remove the buildings to the new site can be paid from the amount already allotted for construction of new school buildings in British Columbia during the current fiscal year.\n\nBernard F.

McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nA.W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nVictoria, B.C.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn answer to yours received by last mail I would say that I am quite satisfied with my position as teacher at Bella Coola Indian School. I cannot honestly say, however, that I like the work with the present accommodation. When I first accepted this school (three years come June) the Indian agent promised a new building. Then Mr. Lorenz - the late agent - visited us, and said he would lay the urgency of the need before the Government. Mr. Green - Inspector for British Columbia - also assured us that we would have a new school house as soon as possible. But there has been no official word of commencing work.\non one as yet. Last year we built a very nice church, but as we fully expected that school accommodation would be provided, we made no provision for the children. For many reasons it is impossible to hold sessions in the church, so we are using a small room at the rear which was erected as a small class room. It is 12' x 14' and only about 7'6\" high. The light is very poor as the windows are small and placed very high. The desks are placed against this wall and at times, in fact as a general thing, the children, especially those sitting at the rear of the room, cannot see the blackboard at all. I find it utterly impossible to give proper instruction as the little ones have to sit three and four in an ordinary school desk and I cannot reach the inside ones at all. There is no ventilation at all except\nby doors, there are no cupboards whatever,\nand the blackboard space is very\nsmall. These, and many more\ninconveniences, make the work\nvery hard and most discouraging.\nThe children here are increasing\nin numbers and are a strong\nhealthy lot. I would like to see\na thoroughly equipped school in\nBella Coola for I know it would be\ntaken advantage of by many who\ndo not at present attend and the\nvalue of the work would be\nincreased one hundred fold.\n\nAs regards the salary, I may say\nthat I think it is not in proportion\nwith the work. The poorest paid\npublic school teacher receives $600\na year, and by experience fits herself\nfor a higher position. An Indian\nschool unfit one for an advanced\nposition and not only that, but even\nwith the greatest care, any education\npreviously gained by the teacher, is\nOne has to simplify everything to the last degree in order to be understood, as the children cannot understand any English when first entering school. The position looks easy, but I believe it is one of the most trying in the world; the sameness of it all\u2014the drilling to get one single idea into their heads and the very simplicity of everything decreases the teacher's intellectual value. For this reason I think the salary should be increased. I had notice from our Indian agent last August that I was to receive $6-00 instead of $400. But the chairman of this District has had no word of such an increase, so it remains as before\u2014$400.\n\nYes, I am quite willing to accept the position for the coming year and will do my best with the children. I do hope that a new school will be provided, however.\nTrusting I have not written at too great length,\nwith kind regards\nI remain\nYours truly,\nEveline Gibson\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI enclose you a letter from the teacher at Bella Coola B.C. This is written in answer to a number of questions I have been asking all our teachers in the Indian work.\n\nThe Department will see from this the great need of a new school building at this point\u2014which I trust will receive immediate attention.\n\nIt will be also seen that unless we give our teachers every encouragement possible, it will be impossible to retain them in our service.\n\nWould you be kind enough to let me know if any thing can be done at Bella Coola for a building this year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. Ferrier.\nOttawa, April 25, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant enclosing a communication from the teacher of the Bella Coola school, in which, among other things, she asks for an increase in salary from $400.00 to $500.00.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the records of the Department show that the average attendance at this school is very poor, as you will see from the following statement\u2014\n\n| Enrolment | September quarter | Average attendance |\n|-----------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| December  | 31                | 7.6                |\n| March     | 32                | 7.5                |\n\nIt is recognized that the poor accommodation may be responsible to some extent for this poor attendance, but, even under the present conditions, there is room for a great improvement. The Department, as you have already been advised, hopes to erect a new building this summer and, should the attendance then warrant it, a further increase in Miss Gibson's salary will be granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nSupt. Of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nMission House\nBella Coola\nB.C.\n\nJune 5/14\n\nDear Mr. Faquier,\n\nThere is always more or less sickness among the Indians here, and many of the women know very little about the care of new born babies, and as a result there is much disease of eyes, and other sicknesses that might have been obviated had there been a nurse or doctor who could visit the people in their homes and teach them how to care for and look after the sick, especially the children.\n\nI understand the Dept. at some point have appointed or made a grant for such a person (would be a nurse) whose duty is to visit the sick etc. Do you think it would be possible to have a grant made for such a person at Bella Coola. I think maybe our Church might be able to get a nurse if you could get a grant for her.\n\nTrusting this matter will receive your favorable consideration.\n\nI beg to remain\n\nYours Faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a letter from the Methodist missionary at Bella Coola, asking for the appointment of a field-nurse. I can endorse the statements made in the letter. It would, no doubt, be a good thing for the Indians if the Department could see its way clear to make the necessary grant. The matter was discussed when the Inspector was here; and he will likely send in his report on the subject.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 30th June 1914.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to inform you that the Department has received a letter from Mr. Fouger, Indian Agent at Bella Coola, in which he enclosed a letter from the Methodist missionary at Bella Coola asking for the appointment of a field-nurse. Mr Fouger states that the matter was discussed when you were at his Agency and the Department therefore desires to receive a full report from you in the matter at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.W.Tyson Esq., Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSir:\n\nRe Appointment of a field nurse at Bella Coola\n\nYour letter 164513-1 June 30th received, and in reply beg to say that this question of appointing a field nurse at Bella Coola was discussed with Mr. Founger on my recent visit to that district, but owing to the absence of Mr. Gibson, the missionary in charge of the Methodist Church, nothing definite was decided on. Mr. Gibson only arrived on the steamer by which I was leaving there, and I had but a few minutes conversation with him on the subject. He, however, promised to discuss the question with Mr. Founger and report to me at a later date. As the Methodist Church has charge of this field it was thought advisable that if a nurse should be appointed, it would be well to select one in sympathy with this Church. However, on receipt of Mr. Gibson's report I will communicate with you further.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nTHE SECRETARY,\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nOTTAWA, CANADA.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to report that I, by concurrent mail, by parcel post, send three samples of well-water taken from the Indian village of Bella Coola.\n\nThe water in the wells here has a bad reputation, a white froth comes to the top, when boiling.

It is only a waste of money to continue this school under the present conditions of attendance. If, in future, the Indians promise to send their children regularly and there is a sufficient number of children to warrant it, the question of re-opening this school will then receive consideration.\n\nMr. Agent Fouger is being instructed to advise the teacher that her services will not be required after June 30th next.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nRev.

(RG 10, Volume 6385, File 803-1, part 1)\nOttawa, May 28, 1919.\n\nSir,-\n\nReferring to your report of inspection of the Bella Coola Indian Day School for the month of April last, forwarded under cover of your letter of the 9th instant, I beg to say that it is noted that the attendance at this school is so low as not to warrant the school being kept open after the end of the present quarter.\n\nThe quarterly returns received during the past year show that there was an average attendance of about four children. As you state that the older children of this band are attending boarding schools, it is considered that the day school should be closed from June 30th, next. You will, therefore, be good enough to inform the teacher that her services will not be required after the 30th of June next. Before leaving she should forward her quarterly return of attendance for the current quarter and also see that all school material is put under lock.\n\nIf, at a future date, there are sufficient children that would attend regularly the question of re-opening this school will then be considered. To continue the school with the present attendance is only a waste of money. Rev. T. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, is being informed accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nIver Fougnier, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola,\nB. C.\nReferring to your letter of May 24 received last week, after an absence from the office of six weeks, I have the honor to state that the teacher has been notified of the closing of the day school at Bella Coola owing to poor attendance. She had previously received notice, presumably through Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Indian Schools, Methodist Church.\n\nPersonally I have often urged the parents to send the children to school more regularly, and they have promised to do so; but added that the children do not learn anything at school. As in other coast villages the parents take the children with them when they go away handlogging, or to the canneries. Last winter the influenza was followed at Bella Coola by the whooping cough; this of course reduced the attendance to a minimum.\n\nViewing the declaration made by the parents at Bella Coola in the letter to Mr. Ferrier, copy of which is enclosed herewith, I most respectfully ask that the natives be given another chance of proving their interest in the education of their children, and that this school be re-opened on October 1st, this year. It would also be important that Mr. Ferrier recommends a teacher in whom the natives have confidence, if there is to be a choice of teacher.\n\nThe Secretary, Dep't of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This is the first time this has been brought to our attention. We therefore called a meeting of our people to talked the matter over. We hold make our request that this school be not closed & we promise to see that the attendance is kept up to what it should be.\n\nWe wish to draw your attention to the fact that we have 25 children attending various Boarding Schools; remaining in the village are 30 children under 6 years of age & 28 of school age. We do not want these to be without education, therefore we urge you to use your influence in having the school kept open.\n\nWe wish also to draw attention to our request, made so often, for a boarding school to be built here at an early date.

His daughter Phyllis Gibson is prepared to take charge of the school at Koksilah. I would like the sanction of the Department to this appointment. Miss Margaret Founger has been recommended to me as an excellent young woman. She has made good progress in college work and while she has had no normal training I think would do good work at Bella Coola. She is the daughter of your Agent and if there is no objection to her appointment I would be pleased to have the Department endorse her as teacher. As the Department is aware it is very difficult to secure properly qualified teachers for the Indian schools for the salaries we are able to offer. Before taking further action I shall await your reply.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTF/GF\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have therefore to request that she be removed from her position as teacher of this school. My reasons for making this special report and recommendation are that, as you will see from my report on the Bella Coola Indian Day School, the teaching is not satisfactory, the progress of the children most unsatisfactory, and the health of the teacher a very doubtful quantity.\n\nBelow will be found a copy of a letter from the teacher in which she requests me to cancel her application for a transfer, and in which she admits that even to herself the progress of the children is unsatisfactory.\n\nCopy:-\n\nDear Captain Barry,\n\nBy this letter I wish to cancel my application for a change of school. A suitable change would be pretty hard to find for me. I have been worried over what you think of the school. The progress is not at all satisfactory to myself. But I worked hard & faithfully & did a lot which is not seen.\n\nAt first I felt like resigning but I'm young yet, only 48, and surely with the facilities now available I can do as well as any other teacher. I'll do my best.\n\nYours faithfully,\nIsabel Snodgrass.\n\nI do not consider that Mrs Snodgrass will make a success of teaching in an Indian Day School. When inspecting at Bella Coola I advised her to try to get an appointment in an Indian Residential School if she could hear of an opening. She might be able to supervise the laundry or kitchens. She is certainly not fit enough in my opinion to teach school at Bella Coola, and to visit around the Indian homes to look after the interests of the children. She admits to heart disease and lameness.\n\nIf it is not considered that the above are sufficient grounds for a change of teacher, I shall be very glad indeed; but from a professional point of view I have no other course open but to recommend the Department to remove Mrs Snodgrass from her present position. Last year she resigned as Field Matron as she did not feel she could carry on as both Teacher & Field Matron.\n\nJune 13, 1932\nGerald H. Barry.\nVictoria, B.C.

The total salary allowed her as teacher will be as stated in official letter of the 23rd ultimo, viz., $105 per teaching month, ten months in the year. You will, therefore, discontinue her name on the pay list from the above date. Vouchers in payment of her salary as teacher will be prepared in the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

The reasons stated for Mrs. Snodgrass' desire to relinquish the position of field matron have been noted.\n\nThe Department will approve of her discontinuing field matron's duties, and will allow her an increase in her salary as teacher of the Bella Coola Indian Day School from May 1st, next. Our funds are extremely limited for the present fiscal year, and the amount of the increase we could allow her for teaching services would be at the rate of $10 per teaching month. This will make her total salary as teacher from the above date at the rate of $1050 per year. I shall be pleased if you will take up this matter with Mrs. Snodgrass and ascertain if she will discontinue field matron's duties, in view of the increase allowed her for teaching duties, and advise the Department accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F.

It was necessary last winter to obtain a substitute teacher owing to the illness of Mrs. Snodgrass.\n\nI would request that the matter of a change in teacher at this school receive consideration, and I shall be pleased to learn, at your convenience, what action the Church authorities desire to take in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Beaton, B.A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. W.,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of June 24th, informing us that the Inspector of Schools for British Columbia, Mr. G. H. Barry, is dissatisfied with the services of Mrs. Snodgrass at Bella Coola. From the observations that I made when I visited Bella Coola myself a year ago, I am inclined to agree with this statement of the situation. I wish, however, that we had known three months ago that the Department was considering a change in the teacher. A letter from Mr. Barry today does not mention specifically this school as one for which he is planning to recommend a new teacher.\n\nRev. Arthur Barner, our Superintendent of Indian Missions, is at the present time in Western Canada and I would like to hear from him before writing definitely to Mrs. Snodgrass, stating that her services are no longer required. I was not in this department at the time of her engagement and I know nothing of the circumstances under which she came to us. As soon as I hear from Mr. Barner, I will communicate with you again.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The teacher in charge seems to be rather a hot tempered person and imagines our school Inspector had it in for her. There were 23 in attendance when I visited the school, though this attendance will not probably keep up, as directly hunting or fishing starts they will be taken away by their parents. I spoke earnestly to the Indians about this, and they promised to do their best. The school was clean and tidy, and the children had good discipline. This teacher, however, would appear to have a somewhat peremptory way with her, but perhaps as she has been at this school a long while, she requires a change, in fact she spoke to me as though she would like it.\n\nGeo. S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nVictoria, B.C., November 28, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith the inspection report No. 3 Bella Coola agency, B.C. by C.S. Pragnell.\n\nSchools:\n\nReference might be made to the report of the Inspector of schools regarding the teacher Mrs. Shoemaker. I also reported in connection with the School Inspector's report. She has no cause for complaint against the School Inspector, except that his standards of efficiency are not understood by her through lack of experience.\n\nC. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nMrs. Snodgrass was a pupil teacher in Ireland and later had training in the Church of Ireland Training College, Dublin. She held a Second Class Certificate in Ireland; but this is not valid in B.C. Attended Indian & Rural Course at Provincial Summer School, Victoria, 1932, and obtained the usual certificate.\n\nHealth is stated to have improved. Mrs. Snodgrass states she has a leaking valve in her heart. She certainly looks as if her health was not very satisfactory. She is not well enough to make a success of this school. She suffers from pains in her leg.\n\nThe standing of the school has improved since my last report. Had this not been so, and in view of Departmental letter 168-29-1 dated July 19, 1932, I should have recommended a change of teacher for the present school year. This was not done as the teacher had improved things to a certain degree; but I consider the time has arrived to appoint a properly certificated B.C. teacher at Bella Coola. I would recommend that the question of a change of teacher here be taken up with the Indian Agent and the United Church, so that a new teacher may be placed here in September, 1934.\n\nThe Indians are very much dissatisfied with Mrs. Snodgrass and the attendance is not what it should be. I understand that the Indian Agent and the Church are of much the same opinion as that expressed in this report.\n\nI would ask however that Mrs. Snodgrass be permitted to finish the school year 1933-34 at Bella Coola, and that she be given at least three months notice should it be decided to retire her at the end of June, 1934, when she will be about 50 years of age. This teacher has had about 20 years teaching in this Province.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE\nP. O. BOX 666\nVICTORIA, B.C., September 1, 1933.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith letter dated August 24th, ultimo, received from Capt. G.H. Barry, District Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C., covering his inspection report on the Bella Coola Indian Day School, dated May 12th, 1933.\n\nIn regard to the matter of dispensing with the services of Mrs. Snodgrass after the end of June 1934, this matter must be left to the Department to be dealt with from a technical point of view and also on the basis of its policy with respect to the matter of qualifications required for Indian Day School teachers in British Columbia. I have taken note of the fact that there are several schools in British Columbia where the teachers have no qualifying certificates such as would be required for the conduct of a Provincial school under which circumstances it would appear that the Department is not committed to a policy which requires that the teachers of the Indian Day Schools shall be qualified under British Columbia Normal Certificates as an essential indication of their efficiency.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosure\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 8, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your 15/30890 of the first instant, enclosing the report of Inspector Barry on his visit to the Bella Coola Indian Day School on May 12th, last. The Department has carefully noted the Inspector's remarks regarding the teacher, Mrs. Snodgrass. She may continue in charge of this school for the academic year 1933-34. The question of replacing her for the school year 1934-35 will be discussed with the officers of the United Church Missionary Society.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER SENT TO MRS. ISABEL SNODGRASS,\nBELLA COOLA, B.C. DATED JULY 6th, 1933.\n\nWith the desire of the Department to raise the standard of teaching and leadership in Indian Day Schools, we are in entire agreement. The fact is that we could fill all of our Indian Schools with University graduates, who have taken special training along modern educational lines in recent years, if they were suddenly to become vacant. You have had a long term as teacher, and apart from the short course which you received at the Summer Normal School last year, have not been in touch recently with the technique of modern pedagogy, as it is now taught in our professional schools. I think, therefore, that it will not be regarded as unfair by anyone if we ask you to accept this as an intimation that at the end of June 1934 we intend to appoint a younger and more modernly trained teacher to our day school at Bella Coola. It will give you twelve months in which to arrange your plans and look for some type of congenial employment elsewhere.\n\nIn the meantime, we hope that you may continue to enjoy the best of health and be happy in your associations with the Indian children and their parents.\n\nCopied - JGA.\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSeptember 11th,\n1933.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nRe: Bella Coola Indian Day School.\n\nThank you for your letter of September 6th, enclosing an extract from Inspector Barry's report regarding his visit to the Bella Coola Indian Day School. Anticipating that his report would be somewhat of this nature, I wrote Mrs. Snodgrass on July 6th and am enclosing an extract from the letter. I feel that there is nothing more that needs to be done about the matter at the present time. My letter would reach Bella Coola during the vacation and Mrs. Snodgrass has probably not had opportunity to reply to it yet.\n\nAgain thanking you for your courtesy in giving me this information,\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nKenneth Beaton.\n\nKJB.MT\n\nEnc.\nSpecial Recommendation made in accordance with standing instructions on this subject.\n\nI have the honour to refer the Department of Indian Affairs to my reports on this Bella Coola Indian Day School made after inspections on May 13, 1932, May 12, 1933 and to the special recommendation dated June 13, 1932, as well as to my present report on the school made after my inspection of May 14, 1934.\n\nI beg to state that I do not consider that Mrs. Isabella Snodgrass should be retained as teacher of the Bella Coola Indian Day School after the end of the present School Term ending June 30th, 1934.\n\nMy reasons for making such a recommendation have been stated several times. The children are not making the progress which I should like to see in this well equipped school, though it is fair to the present teacher to state that the progress lately has been much greater than in former years. The health of this teacher is a very doubtful quantity. She admits having a leaking valve in her heart. She has had inflamed veins in her leg. I have every reason to consider that her health is such that any energetic teaching is out of the question while this teacher is in charge of this school.\n\nMrs. Snodgrass appears to have been warned by the authorities of the United Church of Canada that her services would not be required after the end of the present term at the end of June.\n\nShe wishes to stay on for another year for financial reasons, and will so request the Department through the Indian Agent at Bella Coola. I do not wish to be hard on this teacher; but I have a duty to the children, and I have every reason to believe that Mrs. Snodgrass will not be left without any money should her services be terminated this June. She has mentioned all about her financial resources to me during my inspection, and have advised her to write to the Department should she so desire. I have however recommended her to take a rest from teaching in an Indian School mainly because her health may not hold out another year, and also because she has a small child of about 8 years of age growing up among the Indians where the exposure to T.B. infection must always be considered.\n\nI would recommend that in place of making a new appointment to fill the vacancy caused by the retirement of Mrs. Snodgrass the position of teacher here be filled by the transfer of Miss Lois Kinley from Division 2 of the Skidegate Indian Day School. Miss Lois Kinley informs me that the United Church is considering recommending a missionary as teacher at Skidegate. Of this I know nothing. I do consider that Miss Lois Kinley would be able to make a very great change in the school at Bella Coola, and that she would be able to take an active interest in the United Church work among the young Indian girls in this village.\n\nMiss Kinley is at present staying with Mr. Indian Agent Todd at Alert Bay; but will be attending the Provincial Summer School in Victoria in July.\n\nI would ask that should the Department agree with me, this recommendation be brought to the attention of the authorities of the United Church of Canada, it being most important to place Miss Lois Kinley a very experienced teacher.\n\nIn any case I am unable to recommend the further retention of the services of the present teacher at Bella Coola, Mrs. I. Snodgrass.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGerald J. Barry,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

C. C. PERRY, ASET. IND. COMMISSIONER,\nVICTORIA, B. C. (LETTER DATED MAY 11, 1934.)\n\nWhile I recognize that Mrs. T. Snodgrass has made every effort to improve the standing of the school during the past two or three years, I have no hesitation in making the various recommendations contained in my report.\n\nWe require a very fine type of experienced teacher here, one who can take an active part in the out-of-school activities of the Indian girls. I know that Mrs. Snodgrass is physically unable to take such an active leadership as we require here. I have therefore recommended the transfer of one of our best qualified teachers to the position which will be left vacant should Mrs. Snodgrass be retired at the end of June.\nOttawa, June 2, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department has just received Inspector Barry's report regarding his recent inspection of the Bella Coola Indian Day School.

She is a married woman with one minor child in her care; her husband lives in Vancouver.\n\nAs a teacher she has shown considerable energy; her manners in the school room are somewhat brusque, and at times snappish. Indians have complained of her manners at times, but not this last year as far as I can recall. Her health has not been of the best. I would say that the attainments of the children in school are like those of the average day school in the agency.\n\nFor some time it has been felt that there would be a change of teacher at Bella Coola; and when Rev. Arthur Berman was here about Easter time I understood from him that the United Church wanted a change and that Mrs. Snodgrass had been so informed. What Captain Barry, Inspector of Indian schools desires in the matter the Department will likely know from his reports.\n\nToday Mrs. Snodgrass came to me asking me to write to the Department recommending that she be allowed to keep on for another year. The first part of last May she had herself made a similar request to the authorities of the United Church; to this she has not yet had a reply. If neither the Church authorities nor the Inspector has decided on a change by this time then I can say that she may be allowed to continue.\n\nObediently yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

She has had a long experience in Indian work. Mrs. Snodgrass looks to be in better health this year. It will be remembered that this teacher has heart disease, leaking valve, etc. Her health as previously reported has made her work here unsatisfactory.\n\nBetter school work has been done this last year. The teacher is being replaced by the United Church at the end of the present school year.\n\nA well qualified and much younger teacher is required here. It is hoped that the Department will not sanction the appointment of any but well qualified teachers at Bella Coola. This is not one of those places where a MISSIONARY TEACHER would be a success as there are a very large number of children. These children certainly require the whole time of whatever teacher is appointed, and such teacher would not have time to carry on the actual Church work in addition to the teaching of the school.\nOttawa, May 29, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is informed that Mrs. I Snodgrass, teacher of the Bella Coola Indian Day School, is retiring, on account of ill health, at the end of the present academic year.\n\nMr. Inspector Barry, who recently inspected the school, states that better work has been done by Mrs. Snodgrass during the present school year.\n\nHe recommends that a well qualified and much younger teacher be obtained for the work at Bella Coola. He further states that this is not one of those places where a missionary-teacher would be a success, as there are a very large number of children and these children require the whole time of whatever teacher is appointed, and such teacher would not have time to carry on church work in addition to teaching duties.\n\nI would request that you nominate a fully qualified, suitable teacher for this school for the coming school year, and forward the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated by you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

She was formerly Miss Clarke and has been a day school teacher under the direction of the Department of Indian Affairs and the Church for over twenty years.

I have great pleasure in nominating for the position Miss Ruth E. Young. Miss Young was born in the village of Port Simpson, B.C., where her father was a merchant and has been in contact with Indians all her life. She taught for three years in the Primary Room of the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School and, according to Dr. Riley, she was the most successful Primary Teacher that he had during his period as Principal. She was one year in the Day School at Skidegate. Four years ago she found it necessary to resign and secure a position near Vancouver, in order to assist a younger sister who was in University. The sister having graduated, she is now free to return to her \"first love\", namely, the teaching of Indian children.\n\nI am quite sure that Miss Young will fulfill in every respect Captain Barry's request that we should get a younger and more energetic teacher for Bella Coola. In fact, both the Department and the Church are to be congratulated on receiving her application.\n\nHoping this will meet with your approval,\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB.MT\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nMrs. Isabel Snodgrass, teacher of the Bella Coola Indian Day School (Bella Coola Reserve, No. 1, Electoral District of Skeena), B.C., has retired as from June 30th, last.\n\nThis school is conducted under the auspices of the United Church of Canada, and the church authorities have nominated the services of Miss Ruth E. Young. Miss Young has been in contact with Indians all her life. She taught for three years in the primary room of the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, and, according to the principal of that school, she was the most successful primary teacher he had during his period as principal. She also taught one year in the day school at Skidegate, Queen Charlotte Islands.\n\nMrs. Snodgrass, when teacher at this school, was allowed salary at the rate of $105 per teaching month, but she had given continuous service in Tudor schools for a period of 22 years. I would suggest that salary at the rate of $90 per teaching month, which is the average salary rating for British Columbia, be allowed Miss Young, and I beg to submit, for your approval, her appointment with salary at the rate mentioned - her duties to commence when the school re-opens after the present summer holidays, September third, next.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, August 3, 1935.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, nominating the services of Miss Ruth E.

I understand that these salary scales attached to positions and had already communicated with Miss Young in asking her to accept this position concerning the salary standing which was being paid at this particular school. I presume that this is merely a mistake and that it can easily be rectified. After having gone through a long list of applicants to find one who possessed the qualifications requested by the Inspector, I feel that we should treat her at least as generously as her predecessor.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J.

Sutherland,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nNovember 28th,\n1935.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nRe: Salary of Teacher, Bella Coola Indian Day School\n\nFollowing our conversation the other day and my reference to your communication of August 12th, in regard to the serious decrease in the salary allowed to Miss Ruth E. Young, the teacher of the Bella Coola Indian Day School, I would like to put something on file in regard to the matter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Snodgrass retired, it was the wish of the Inspector and of our Superintendent in British Columbia that we should appoint a married teacher at that point. The school is large and very difficult to control, due to the fact that there is a white village in such close proximity. The teacherage, however, was in poor shape and devoid of furniture, as Mrs. Snodgrass had supplied her own furnishings. Miss Young understood in going there that the question of appointing a married teacher was under consideration. I presume that in setting her salary the Department files were not consulted and that she was regarded as a new appointee, although she had previously served the Department for years.\n\nI am not objecting so much to the rate of $900.00 which has been set for Miss Young for this current year as to the fact that the salary rating having been lowered, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to get it raised again when the teacherage has been repaired and furnished and a suitable married man is available. Miss Young is not using the teacherage but is living in the white village. It might be advisable to get a report from the Indian Agent as to what it would cost to put the teacherage in shape.\n\nWith very kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6385, File 803-1, part 1)\nOttawa, December 3, 1935.\n\nReverend Sir,-\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to the salary allowed Miss Ruth Young, teacher of the Bella Coola Indian Day School.\n\nThe information contained in the second and third paragraphs of your letter has been noted and, in the event of your finding it advisable to nominate a married teacher to take charge of this school from September 1st, next, the Department will keep in mind that he should be allowed more salary than is being paid Miss Young.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B. A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\n\nPP/O'M.\nSCHOOL:\n\nI visited the Indian Day School on the Bella Coola Reserve. I was most agreeably surprised at the tremendous improvement since my last visit, in every way.\n\nMiss Young, the new teacher, deserves every congratulation. There were 35 children present at the time of my visit out of a roll of 38. This is a big improvement in attendance. The children were well, happy and attentive, instead of scared to death as they were before.\n\nThe discipline, however, had not suffered, in fact was really better. Grades 1a and 2 read very well for their ages. Grade 4 was good at reading. Their arithmetic was quite fair and their writing good. The singing of the whole school was good as was their physical training. The scholastic side also was therefore vastly improved. The school room was nice and clean and tidy. Altogether the school is a credit to the teacher and a pleasure to the Indian parents.\n\nMiss Young informs me that her orders for school supplies was delivered very short of request or necessity, particularly in writing paper.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Geo. S. Fragnell)\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nVictoria, B.C., December 19, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith report of Col. G.S. Pragnell x x x on his inspection of the Bella Coola Indian agency, B.C. In connection with this report, I beg to make the following comments.\n\nSchool\n\nThe Inspector has furnished the Inspector of Schools with a copy of his report on the school. It is pleasing to note the reported improvement under Miss Young's direction.\n\nC. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nI visited and inspected the day school at Bella Coola. Both Indian Agent Gillett and myself were perfectly satisfied with the ability of the teacher and the response given to my questioning by the children. There were 28 in class on the date of my visit, the 4th of June, out of a total roll of 46. All grades up to Grade 4 were very good. Those in the higher grades read well. They sing well and were all clean and tidy as was the school itself. If I recollect correctly this is a big increase in attendance to what it used to be.\n\nSchools, General\n\nOne thing has struck me in connection with the day schools in this agency and that is the large increase in attendance, really beyond the accommodation we have and the number of teachers.\n\nHowever, this agency is not alone in this as I have found the same large increase in nearly all the day schools I have visited this year. Day school accommodation is now one of the most pressing and urgent necessities before the Department.\n\nGeo. S. Pragnell.\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nVictoria, B.C., November 30, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that Mr. Indian Agent Gillett of Bella Coola Agency has furnished me with copy of his report addressed to the Department on November 23rd, instant, in regard to the recent flood which he believes makes it necessary and advisable to change the location of the Indian settlement, day school, etc.\n\nIn view of Mr. Gillett's report above referred to I would recommend that arrangements be made immediately with the Bureau's Director to have Mr. Warren make a complete and comprehensive report bearing upon all the suggestions which Mr. Agent Gillett has offered for Departmental consideration.\n\nThe school would have to be established wherever the new village will be as the present site across the river would not be accessible without a bridge save by boat which would be hazardous. I feel that it will scarcely be necessary to emphasize the serious predicament in which this band of Indians finds itself at present and that most sympathetic and serious consideration should mark the progress of the investigation, which is now recommended.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C. Perry.\n\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nThe only school visited by the agent during the month was the Bella Coola Day school. Because of the influenza having appeared in the village, I ordered this school closed on the 19th, in order to prevent a possible epidemic.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\nBella Coola, B.C., April 7th, 1937.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT FOR MARCH 1937.\n\nAll the schools were visited and an almost perfect attendance was found in all of them. I found also that progress is being made, although at Bella Bella school the children do not answer very readily. The average attendance at that school was 54-9. At Bella Coola the average was 28.12, with twelve of the pupils showing perfect attendance for the last three months. I have not as yet received the averages for Klemtu and Kitimaat Schools.\n\nJ. Gillett.\nIndian Agent.\nEXTRACTS from Inspector Barry's Report regarding his inspection of the BELLA COOLA INDIAN DAY SCHOOL on June 2nd, 1937.\n\nName of teacher: Miss Ruth E. Young.\n\nThis teacher is old-fashioned in her teaching of Reading. As mentioned in my last report on this school, she attempts to teach the beginners by a Phonic Method accompanied by pictures which she leaves on the blackboard. She thinks that this is the modern Look and Say Method, which it is not. As mentioned last year, this foolish method of teaching Indian children has led to a very slow \"Word for Word\" type of Reading now spreading up the school as far as Grade 3.\n\nThough Miss Young is so certain that she is right and that I am wrong, she is not carrying out any modern type of education here that I could discover. Miss Young has purchased the new B.C. Programme of Studies and states that she is following it in part AS THE INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH HAS INSTRUCTED HER TO DO ON THE BACK OF HER REGISTER. She intends to ignore my own instruction that this course must only be used as an aid to teachers owing to the fact that in great part it is quite unsuited to our Indian children and their needs.\n\nMuch time was given during the previous inspection to outlining limits for the various Grades and Sub Grades and in the teaching of short Demonstration or Type Lessons. This time as well as additional time during the present visit to the school appears to have been wasted. For various reasons touched on later, Miss Ruth Young tells me she has no intention of following my instructions or suggestions, except where she is shown to do so. She states that she has had greater experience of Indians than I have had, having been born and brought up amongst them.\n\nI may say that I was much disturbed by the very strong and hostile statements made by this teacher, as last year she appeared to be very anxious to learn.\n\nThe reason for her refusal to follow my suggestions, and I may say that those made last year HAVE NOT BEEN FOLLOWED in any great part, is as follows:\n\nThe last Indian Agent, here, Mr. Fouger, while waiting to hand over the Agency to the present Agent, Mr. Gillett, received a copy of my report on the inspection of April 24th, 1936. This report was sent to him from the Assistant Indian Commissioner in Victoria in the usual way. For some undetermined reason, Mr. Fouger permitted Miss Young to have access to and in fact to read my report on the school.\n\nThere\nThere were other factors in the case also and I am of the opinion that Miss Young was very badly advised by others. Mr. Indian Agent Gillett is aware of some of these factors and will no doubt report in confidence to the Indian Affairs Branch if necessary.\n\nThe result of all this was that Miss Young became unwilling to follow my advice in her work. She tells me she does not use Two Little Indians as a Pre Primer because she does not like the pictures of the Indians. She says it humiliates the Indian pupils and upsets her to see these pictures. I may say that even if the pictures are not very like the Coast Indians it is the first time in any part of the Province that I have heard that the pictures upset the Indians or teachers.\n\nShe tells me that she will not use the Alberta Writing Manuals sent by the Branch to the schools. She is quite hostile to the Indian Affairs Branch and its administration of the Indians as far as I could understand.\n\nThere are no teaching posters such as I asked should be made on display. There is little if any of the children's work on display. I regret to say that my efforts to help this teacher have not succeeded.\n\nGeneral:\n\nThe school is clean and well ventilated.\n\nThe teacher was very impertinent in general. While entitled to consider me useless as an inspector and teacher if she wishes to do this, I do not consider that she is within her rights in speaking to an official of any Government Department in the way she did.\n\nI was so much upset that I asked the Indian Agent to come back into the schoolroom and listen to the definite statements of Miss Young so that there should be no error on my part in recording them.\n\nMiss Young asked if there was no way she could have an independent inspection of the school made, and I replied that as far as I knew there was not, as I was at the moment the only Indian School Inspector in B.C.\n\nThe teacher stated that she would make an effort to have someone see my report, probably the Member of Parliament for her own constituency or the Provincial School Inspectors who had seen her work gave her good reports. I may say that so far I have not investigated this matter.\n\nThe teacher was most insubordinate.\n\nI have done my very best for her, but I am afraid that fact that she considered my last report on this school adverse, though it was not intended to be such in general, has made it impossible for me to do anything more for Miss Ruth Young.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a letter from Mr. Indian Agent Gillett, together with resignation of T.

Gillett,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola,\nB.C.\n\nDear Mr. Gillett:\n\nMy resignation as teacher\nof Bella Coola Indian Day\nSchool has been sent to you\nunder separate cover.\n\nI am resigning because\nCaptain Barrie Inspector of\nIndian Schools complained of\nmy inefficiency.\n\nI formally wish to protest\nCaptain Barrie's inspection of\nthe school and any report\nhe may have made.\nBut this year and last his inspection of the school was perfunctory. This year he stayed about an hour. Many subjects were not properly examined. He antagonized the children by his manner and his utter lack of sympathy and understanding.\n\nHe spent much time complaining because we had followed the provincial curriculum in accordance with instructions from the inspector. In any case when I had not used this system it was because they were utterly impractical in this school where the children speak little English and are rather nomadic. Captain Barrie has had little experience teaching Indian children and his systems are not always practical.\n\nI feel his criticisms of teaching methods, school management etc., are utterly unjustified. I have taught in white and Indian schools and have excellent credentials.\nLast year Colonel Magness, Inspector of Indian Agencies, examined the school thoroughly and gave us good reports\u2014these are on file. Mr. Fosgate, who was Indian Agent last year, holds a professional certificate. He too adjudged the school satisfactory! We have examined the children every month and have been satisfied. Other qualified persons who have visited the school have commended it.\n\nSurely the observations of such unprejudiced persons should be added to the fact that Captain Barry's report is doing a grave injustice to the teacher and the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMiss Ruth Young\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Inspector Barry's report regarding his inspection of the Bella Coola Indian Day School on the 2nd instant. I enclose extracts from Mr. Barry's report.\n\nThe Department cannot understand Miss Young's attitude towards Inspector Barry. When teaching in Indian day schools, teachers are expected to carry out our Inspector's instructions regarding teaching methods. Apparently, Miss Young is not prepared to do so and, under these circumstances, I trust that you will nominate a fully qualified teacher to replace Miss Young at the Bella Coola School when it reopens on September 1st, next.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Geo. Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. W.,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nDuncan, B.C.\nMarch 21st 1936.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 8,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nThe file of correspondence forwarded with your 15/2/2576 of the 17th instant is returned herewith.\n\nMr. T.H. Kelly is the only Indian we have on the teaching staff of the Indian Schools in this Province at the present time.\n\nHe was moved from Kitselas Indian Day School, Skeena River Agency, to Bella Coola, in September 1937. This transfer was made as he much desired a wider field of action than he could possibly have at Kitselas. His total experience has been a little over one and one half years.\n\nWhen he called at my office in Vancouver at Christmas time he gave me no warning whatever of a desire to resign.\n\nWhile I am much displeased, as I know that Dr. Osterhout will also be, at this young man's curt letter of resignation following the hours of work given to aiding him in his professional work, I would recommend that such resignation be accepted by the Department as from Friday afternoon, April 15th and that he be paid up to and including that day only.\n\nI could not recommend the Department to accept a substitute provided by Mr. Kelly, whether such a substitute hold a B.C. Certificate or not. I particularly do not wish to have a local Bella Coola girl placed in charge of the school, where we had so much trouble during my inspection last year.\n\nI would recommend that The Rev. S.S. Osterhout, D.D., 411 Dominion Bank Building, Vancouver, B.C., be supplied with a copy of this file of correspondence, and that he be asked to nominate through you and his own church authorities in Toronto a United Church certificated teacher to take charge of the Bella Coola Indian Day School till June 30th 1938.\n\nI happen to know that Dr. Osterhout has on his list of candidates a well qualified and experienced male teacher, a member of the United Church with Provincial School experience, who would be just the person for Bella Coola in this emergency. I spoke to Dr. Osterhout about this candidate when last in Vancouver.\n\nFollowing the receipt by telephone or otherwise of the name and qualifications of a qualified teacher nominated by Dr. Osterhout, I would recommend that such teacher be appointed as temporary teacher of the Bella Coola Indian Day School as from April 15th till the end of the school term on June 30th, that is following the Easter vacation. I do not believe that Mr. Kelly is entitled to pay for the period of the Easter Holidays as he does not intend to teach for the remainder of the school year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6385, File 803-1, part 1)\nDear Sir:\n\nI am forwarding herewith a letter of resignation received from Mr. T. R. Kelly, Indian, the present teacher of the Bella Coola Indian Day School, together with a copy of Mr. Indian Agent Gillett's covering letter, my letter to Inspector Barry and his reply to same.\n\nOn receipt of this correspondence, I requested Rev. S. S. Osterhout, D.D. to nominate, on behalf of the United Church authorities, a suitable trained teacher to fill the unexpected vacancy at Bella Coola until the end of the present school year.\n\nI am now in receipt of the following night letter from Dr. Osterhout, who is at present in Toronto:\n\n\"FOLLOWING RESIGNATION OF MR.

In addition to the ordinary qualifications, this man knows something of manual training, tinsmithing, and machine shop practice. He is unmarried, and strongly recommended by Provincial Inspector of Schools V. Z. Manning.\n\nI consider that the resignation of Mr. T. R.

At Kitimat there were 64 on the roll in the beginning of October with a possible attendance of 75 which is far too many pupils for one teacher. This situation may be alleviated when certain families go down to Butedale. At Bella Coola there were 55 pupils on the roll and 45 in attendance at the time of my visit on October 24. A second room with an additional teacher is required at this point. The Bella Bella School was visited and appeared to be away to a very good start this year but one of the basement rooms will have to be utilised as a classroom in the near future employing a third teacher.\n\nWm.

Christie,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Christie;\n\nSome time ago I wrote to Captain Barry asking for permission to teach the Bella Coola Indian Day School on the half day system, and was told to write you all the details.\n\nThe average attendance for October was 38.1, November 35.3, December 46.7 and for January 5 & 6, 51, with an enrollment of 59. Attendance can not be enforced as the school is already overcrowded, and there is no room for more seats. At present two girls are using my desk, four are using an old table and others are sitting at makeshift desks.\n\nThere are 29 pupils in Grade 1, and 6 in Grade 2, that need individual attention, which can not be given with all the grades in attendance. Consequently all are losing interest in school work. The half day system, starting at 9 o'clock instead of 9.30 for the older pupils, would enable me to accomplish much more than can be done at present.\n\nAnother matter which I would like to bring to your attention is the matter of lighting in the school. The school is finished with dark varnish, so it is very dark most of the time. Due to the high Mountains to the East and South of us the sun can only shine for about an hour during the winter, and we have no artificial light. It is impossible for those sitting at the front to see their work. I would suggest that the walls and ceiling be painted white.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian AFFAIRS. (RG 10, Volume 6385, File 803-1, part 2)\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of December 23, regarding Miss R. Lau's application to operate the Bella Coola Indian Day School on a half-day basis, this matter has been discussed before with Miss Lau, who was asked to make a full report so that I could lay the matter before the Department.\n\nThere is no doubt that this school is badly crowded at certain seasons of the year, but on account of the poor attendance during the last quarter\u20141940 and 1940, I have hesitated in recommending an additional room and teacher. The quarterly average attendance for the past years is as follows:\n\n| Month    | 1939-40 | 1940-41 | 1941-42 |\n|----------|---------|---------|---------|\n| September| 6.6     | -       | -       |\n| December | 16.6    | 46.32   | 36.6    |\n| March    | 33.4    | 37.8    |         |\n| June     | 16.5    | 13.3    |         |\n\nDecember and January are usually the months showing largest attendance no doubt due to the fact that all the Indians are home during these months.\n\nThere are 51 children on this reserve now under school age and about 8 children on the average will be available for school yearly for the next six years. Those discontinuing school will possibly average about four yearly for the next four years.\n\nThe question of a second room and an additional teacher has also been considered and the Indians have been approached with a view to obtaining their consent to sell the old school house back to the Department. It has not been possible to get a vote\non this yet but I have spoken to some of the Band members who purchase this building for Band practice. They will be prepared I think to move the old building and do the necessary work to make the two buildings into one unit of two rooms for $500.00.\n\nHowever, the Department will no doubt seriously consider the advisability of employing two teachers at this point for longer than six months, that is from October to March since the attendance has always dropped very sharply during the remaining quarter the average for the last two years being 16.3 for 1940 and 13.3 for 1941. There is no question, however, that an increased attendance can be expected with the right kind of teachers and more time by them for individual instruction.\n\nIt is of course too late this season to consider the employment of another teacher should same be available, but I would suggest that since the present missionary apparently expects to retire this year, that the United Church should be asked to find a young missionary capable of teaching the older grades from October to March, 1941-42.\n\nIn conclusion I would strongly recommend that the Department approve of Miss Lau's suggestion to operate the Bella Coola Indian Day School on a half-day system until the end of March or such time as the average attendance drops to thirty. I am quite sure that more will be accomplished by the children and I have always noted that much more can be got from the junior grades when they are separated from the older pupils.\n\nWith the half-day system the teacher will be able to intensify the instruction with a smaller class without the distractions attendant upon trying to teach an overcrowded room of 50 or more pupils in seven different grades.\n\nMiss Lau is in my opinion a conscientious teacher and it will be noted she is prepared to open school half an hour earlier should the Department decide in authorizing the half-day system.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\n\nMajor D. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith copy of a letter dated the 12th instant, with enclosure as stated, received from Mr. Indian Agent Christie requesting authority to conduct the Bella Coola Indian Day School on a half day basis during the period that the school attendance remains abnormally high. I have discussed the matter with Mr. Inspector Barry and he concurs that I recommend approval of the application and that Mr. Christie be authorized to have the school maintained on a half day basis at his discretion during the period that the attendance justifies such a course, thereafter the school to return to a normal full day period. It is understood that the older children will take the morning session from 9 a.m. to 12 noon, and the primary classes the afternoon session.\n\nThe question of enlarging the school accommodation mentioned by Mr. Christie by addition of the old school building to the existing school is one that will necessarily have to await further information on the likelihood of sufficient increase in attendance to warrant such action and the willingness of the Bella Coola Indian musical band to transfer back to the Department the old school building which was purchased by them. A report in this connection will be made at a later date.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. Mackey,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nMiss Lau, teacher at the Bella Coola Indian Day School, has been in the Office making some enquiries regarding her salary so that she may be able to fill up her Income Tax form correctly.\n\nI understand that Miss Lau is receiving $100.00 per month salary, and in addition 11% bonus which would amount to $111.00 per month. She informs me that the cheque she receives from the Department amounts to $98.23 per month and she is unable to determine just how the $12.77 deductions per month are allocated.

The school at Bella Coola is overcrowded. Repairs have been done at Klemtu and the building at least looks clean inside. It will last until better days come and a proper unit can be put up, with teachers quarters attached. It is suggested that at Kitamaat a local Indian with Grade XI standing be appointed interim teacher, to get one room going at least. He seems a fine kind of young man, and he could not be any worse than some white interim or temporary appointments at present in action.\n\nF.

L. Paul, the daughter of the Dominion Government Telegraph Service employee and a fully qualified teacher with a First Class B. C. Certificate, would be available on January 1st for three or four months at this school but did not wish to be \"frozen\" as a teacher. As she is a Protestant, I have submitted the matter to the Reverend W. P. Bunt for his nomination with the hope that she could be induced to finish out the term. As teachers are not available, particularly for schools without teacher's quarters, there does not seem to be much we can do about the matter for the time being except make the best possible arrangements.

Attendance is not satisfactory at all; Klemtu and Bella Coola have most unsuitable persons as teachers; and the closing of the latter school has been recommended. I am afraid that the School at Bella Bella will suffer a serious attendance lapse. War services take men and women in a wholesale manner from the villages winter as well as summer, and if the war goes on much longer, the entire social economy of these Indians will require serious review. In the old days there were at least six months in which the parents would be home; today in some villages, they are home for two weeks at Xmas or for a wedding or funeral; and children by the score are not attending school at all. It is very moot point in my opinion, as to whether home life in Indian villages will ever return to its former status, and I foresee the possibility of \"ghost Villages\" not long hence. Just where Councils will fit in to the picture of the future is a baffling problem, and future objectives along these lines will need careful study.\n\nF.

Salary will be allowed her at the\nrate of $100 a teaching month. The necessary\nforms should be forwarded as soon as possible.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI have received an application from Miss Grace L.M. Farr of 2771 Burdick Avenue, Victoria, for a position as teacher at Bella Coola Indian Day School which has been vacant during the entire term owing to the serious shortage of teachers for such positions.\n\nMiss Farr has had no previous teaching experience but took her Senior Matriculation in 1940 and her second year University in 1942, followed by two years undergraduate nursing training at Victoria Jubilee Hospital. She holds a St. John's Ambulance Certificate and completed a business course including typewriting and shorthand. She is the daughter of Professor Farr who is well known in Victoria.\n\nIn view of the lack of professional experience, I referred Miss Farr to Mr. MacKenzie, the Provincial School Inspector in Vancouver, who interviewed her and gave a most enthusiastic report on her fitness for the position considering her lack of training. I also referred her to the Rev. W.P. Bunt of the United Church Home Missions in Vancouver and I understand that he is asking Dr. Dorey to nominate her for the position, expressing himself very well satisfied with her.\n\nAs the boat leaves for Bella Coola only once a week, it would be appreciated if you would kindly air mail your approval of this appointment subject to Dr. Dorey's nomination which I am satisfied will be forthcoming and I will then have Miss Farr take the boat sailing on May 2nd as it is felt that she could complete the term and enable both the Department and herself to judge her fitness for continuation of this work for the duration of the war. I understand that it is Miss Farr's intention to take summer school during the vacation. She will have experienced guidance in her work by Mr. Indian Agent Anfield.\n\nFor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nREPORT ON BELLA COOLA INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF MARCH, 1944.\n\nSchools;\n\nTwo inspections of the Bella Bella Day School have been made in the month, and one at Klemtu. Improvement was noted. It is to be hoped that the nominating body will be impressed with the importance of securing teachers for the Kitamat and Bella Coola schools, both of which have been closed during the present school year.\n\nF. Earl Anffeld,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON BELLA COOLA INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH APRIL, 1944.\n\nSchools;\n\nNo schools were inspected during the month as arrival times at Klemtu and Bella Bella were inconvenient or on Saturdays; there is a possibility that Bella Coola Day School may re-open shortly, as the United Church have nominated a teacher for the remaining two months of the academic year; Mrs. Anfield has consented to provide board and room for this girl who is expected May 4th. A report has been sent to the Indian Commissioner for B.C. recommending that Kitamaat, if re-opened, be confined to a one room school, and the dispensary be moved to the Day School basement, and the nurse quartered in the teacherage. Inspector Thorstenstein expects to visit the Bella Bella and Klemtu schools, also Bella Coola if opened, in the latter part of May.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nYour File 162-7-1\n\nI enclose herewith Forms T.D. 1 and Departmental Questionnaire, in connection with the employment of Miss Grace L. M. Farr as teacher of the Bella Coola Indian Day School.\n\nThe Department, in their letter of April 27th, approved of this appointment stating the salary to be $100.00 per teaching month but, as no mention was made of Cost-of-Living Bonus, it is presumed that $100.00 is the gross salary. Cost-of-Living Bonus Forms have not, therefore, been completed and, in any case, Form C.T. 256 is not applicable to Miss Farr who is single without dependents and who does not maintain a self-contained domestic establishment.\n\nD.

It was not possible to inspect any other Agency Schools. Inspector Thorstenstein inspected the Bella Coola Day School but informed the Agent that it was not likely he would be able to inspect the Klemtu or Bella Bella Schools this term, due partly to the \"Brendan\" being tied up and partly to pressure of work.\n\nF.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nExtract from Indian Agent Anfield's Report on the Bella Coola Indian Day School.\n\nThis teacher continues to make a fair effort and with her summer school experience, she should do fairly well, though I am not at all sure that she will be able to handle this room when the full attendance turns up after fishing. It might be necessary to put the school on a division basis, with the little ones attending in the afternoons only.\n\nThis teacher is not giving as much time to preparation of her work as she should, due I think to a bad case of heart trouble with a local R.C.A.F. man. I have asked her to pay more attention to business.\nOttawa, August 18, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY.\n\nRe: Bella Coola Indian Day School, No. 803\n\nThe Department has approved an increase in salary to Miss Grace L.

On reviewing our file I find that we have not received any resignation from Miss Grace L.M. Farr, who was nominated as teacher of this school in your letter of April 25, 1944. The last information we had from the Indian Agent regarding Miss Farr was to the effect that she had taken a summer course and under these circumstances we hoped that her services would be more satisfactory during the academic year 1944-45. It is possible, of course, that she has submitted her resignation to you. Please let me hear further from you regarding this school, in order that I can communicate with Indian Commissioner MacKay.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Geo.

These schools were inspected during the month and reports rendered to the Dept. and Commissioner. An appointment at Bella Goola was made late in September, and the new teacher, Miss Laura Fleming reported on Sept. 26th, and started duty in October. No appointments were made to the school at Kitamaat, and as a large number of these people plan to spend the winter at Butedale, on the herring operations, it is doubtful if the school could support a teacher at Kitamaat. The suggestion has been made to the Commissioner that a winter school be established at Butedale if a suitable building and teacher can be secured.\n\nF.

An interview was had with Archbishop Duke of the Vancouver Archdiocese (R.C.) relative to securing a teacher for the Ulkatcho Seasonal school. Following interviews with Rev. W.P. Hunt (U.C.) a nomination was presented to the Department, and accepted for the appointment of Gordon Robinson, a Kitamaat Indian with Grade XII standing, as pro tem teacher at the Kitamaat Indian Day School. Following discussion with Major MacKay, Indian Commissioner, it was decided to try and secure accommodation at Bella Coola to open a second classroom at that point, where overcrowding has compelled the use of a platoon system of attendance.\n\nF.

F. Earl Anfield.\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\n\nPEA/D\nREPORT ON BELLA COOLA INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OCTOBER, 1944.\n\nSchools;\n\nDuring the month inspections were carried out at the Bella Coola, Bella Bella (two division) and Klemtu Day Schools. In all three schools, satisfactory teaching is being carried on, but the problem is still one of securing better attendance.\n\nIf the herring run materializes, the attendance at Bella Bella will drop sharply. In Bella Coola we are fortunate in securing an exceptionally good teacher in Miss Fleming and the response of the pupils is excellent. If a continuity of this type of teacher could be secured, better progress would be noticeable among the Indian children.\n\nF.

Authority is requested to bring them from Kitamaat Indian Day School on a loan basis; also such further equipment as may be required in the way of texts, exercise books, pencils etc.\n\nIt will be necessary for the Department to provide two, twelve foot sheets of green hyloplate board for this room, and a sum of $40.00 for paint, varnish etc. for redecoration of the room. A teacher's desk will also be required.\n\nFuel can be taken care of from present funds on hand for Agency Schools fuel account. The building has a good stove which the Band will loan until a new one can be purchased later.\n\nIn conversation with Rev. W. P.

The Band are agreeing to the use of this building by the Department for school purposes rent free. I also enclose a survey of the children on this reserve as at March 31, 1944, from which it will be noted that there are 74 children of school age and 56 children of pre-school age, a number that is hopelessly beyond the capacity of one teacher.\n\nIt will be noted that desks can be taken from Kitamaat Indian Day School together with other classroom equipment but that it will be necessary to provide two sheets of blackboarding, redecoration of the room at a cost of $40.00 for material, and a teacher's desk. If authority can be given for the opening of this additional classroom, the United Church could be asked to nominate a teacher for the position.\n\nIn view of Inspector Thorsteinsson's reports of over crowding and the conditions as known to us, I would recommend approval of the application.\n\n[Signature]\n\nD.M.

The schools at Bella Bella and Bella Coola were inspected by Mr. Thorsteinsson, the Provincial Inspector. The Agent attended the Christmas concert put on by the Bella Coola Bay School pupils and a very creditable performance was staged, indicative of the good work done by the teacher, Miss Fleming.\n\nF.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C\n\nFurther to yours of January 3rd, 1945, file 2-11-1, I have had the temporary room finished and the blackboards installed. The work cost more than anticipated, but a good job has been done and the set up will make a very nice classroom.\n\nRe desks, there are only very old ones at Kitamaat and really they are not worth moving, especially as there is no steamer service from Kitamaat any more. We would have to hire a boat to bring them to Butedale; then they would have to be shipped to Vancouver and up to Bella Coola. They are the old fashioned type, large and cumbersome and would occupy a high capacity freight rate.\n\nThere are desks in the present Bella Coola Day School. Some of these could be moved to the temporary room.\n\nCould you purchase twenty-one desks for pupils as follows:\n\nSize 4 fronts - 3\n\" 4 backs - 3\n\" 4 Desks - 18\n\nF.

Schools at Bella Coola, Bella Bella and Kitamaat were inspected by the Provincial Inspector of Schools with very satisfactory reports in all cases. The school at Klemtu was inspected on several occasions by the Agent, who found teaching and other conditions satisfactory. In general there is a noticeably improved interest being shown in all day schools by pupils and parents and the standing of the children is good. Attendance at all schools has improved with the exception of Kitamaat, where the industrial requirements of the adult population resulted in a very unsatisfactory attendance record. At Bella Coola, a second room has been prepared. The teacher during the past year, Miss L. Fleming, has resigned. At Bella Bella, Mrs. D. Martin, senior room teacher resigned and a successor, Mrs. Scott, has been appointed for Sept. 1st. At Kitamaat, Mr. Gordon Robinson, senior room teacher has resigned in order to attend Normal School this winter. Only one teacher will be required at this School this winter.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 18, 1945.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI desire to refer you to my letter of June 13, last, with reference to the resignation of Miss L. M. Fleming as teacher of the Bella Coola School. Since that time we have not received any nomination of another teacher and I would appreciate it if you would let me know if there are any immediate prospects of securing a teacher for this school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. George Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n239 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2B, Ont.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Allan's letter of October 1st approving the appointment of Miss Anne Wright as teacher of the Bella Coola Indian Day School, I enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Anfield's letters of September 7th and 28th wherein he advises that he has secured accommodation for the teachers at this school and has assumed responsibility for payment of the rent of $10.00 per month. There is no doubt that lack of accommodation at this point has contributed largely to our difficulty in obtaining and keeping satisfactory teachers and Mr. Anfield's proposal to reduce the teachers' salaries by $5.00 a month each and to provide accommodation this way has considerable merit. I would, therefore, recommend that Miss Wright and any subsequent appointee for the second classroom be paid at the rate of $100 per teaching month plus bonus and that the Department pay the rent of the furnished house secured by Mr. Anfield.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nKT\n\nIndian AFFAIRS. (RG 10, Volume 6385, File 803-1, part 2)\nOttawa, October 12, 1945.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant,\nwith reference to the Bella Coola Indian Day School.\nI note that Agent Anfield has secured a furnished\ncottage, which he considers suitable for a teacher's\nresidence. We are prepared to pay rental for this\nbuilding at the rate of $10.00 a month, effective\nfrom September 1, 1945.\n\nWe have already promised to allow Miss\nWright a salary of $105.00 a month and consequently\nI feel that we should not make the suggested deduction\nof $5.00 a month from her salary.\n\nEvidently two teachers are required, and if\na second teacher can be secured we will allow her $100.00\na teaching month. Possibly you have already taken up\nthis matter with Reverend Mr. Bunt.\n\nInformation on our file indicates that a\nsecond classroom is available. If there are a few extra\narticles of furniture that you think should be supplied,\nyou may purchase same, but it is not our practice to\npurchase either quilts, blankets or linen for teachers'\nresidences. We expect teachers to supply these, and\nthey can be removed when the teacher gives up duties.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nEducation:\n\nDay Schools have re-opened at Bella Bella, 2 divisions; Klemtu, 1 division; and Kitamaat, 1 division. No teacher is yet in residence at Bella Coola, but advice has been received of the appointment of Miss Anne Wright to this post. There is a need of a second teacher at Bella Coola where some 70 children of school age are not at home. At this village, the Agent is negotiating for the rental of a nice little cottage as a teachers' residence.\n\nAttendance at the Day Schools opened to date has been very good, reflecting in some measure the value of the Family Allowance payments. A few children from the Agency were admitted to the Residential School at Alert Bay, none to Alberni.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nAGENCY'S REPORT FOR THE QUARTER ENDING DECEMBER 31ST, 1945.\n\nEducation: During the past quarter the senior teacher at Bella Bella resigned and has been replaced. It has not been possible to secure a second teacher for Bella Coola. A new school has been established at Upper Dean River at Anahim Lake, but so far no appointment has been made. A second teacher was secured for the Kitamaat school. Attendance on the whole has improved but education in the broader sense of the word is the real weak link in the Indian programme. Right now in B.C. there is no inspector of Indian Schools, qualifications for teaching and calibre of appointments made is generally very low and most schools are seriously overcrowded. These conditions are not conducive of a good response by the pupils and a complete overhauling of the entire educational policy of the Department appears more and more urgent as time goes on. There is a great deal of criticism by the parents of the operation of the Residential Schools and some of this is undoubtedly based on real grievances, caused by unsuitable staffing of the schools in question.\n\nF.

Findlay,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Findlay,\n\nWould you kindly forward to the Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, this letter - and I would be grateful if you would give my request your favorable recommendation.\n\nAltogether, my experience as a teacher covers thirty-three years, plus, - as follows, - in Ireland as a pupil teacher 3 years, in a teachers' college 2 years as principal of a school 2 years, in Indian schools in British Columbia 25 years - 9 being in Home schools and 17 in Day schools.\n\nIn addition I have always taught in Sunday school, given music lessons and helped in various ways. But this year I have taken on no extra work. My age is 63.\n\nWhen I came here last September it was my intention to stay at least two years, but circumstances may not permit me to do so. The doctor has advised me that I have a heart condition which demands rest and care, which fact coupled with advancing years makes me think that perhaps I should not attempt another year, but retire at the end of this year, instead. I am sure it would be advisable in the interests both of the school and myself.\n\nI am fully aware that there is no pension scheme, in effect, for teachers in Indian schools and knowing this fact I have always been very economical and saving, but it takes a lot of saved money, invested safely (Government Annuity) to give one a liveable return. I feel that after serving the Department as a teacher for over a quarter of a century I would deserve some consideration in the line of a pension. Therefore I would ask the Indian Department for, say, $20.00 per month, which along with what I have would, I think, meet my needs and would help to make the last lap of the journey of life somewhat more comfortable.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Signed) Mrs. Isabel Snodgrass\nBella Coola, B. C.\nMarch 12th, 1947.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C., Vancouver, B. C.\n\nEnclosed is copy in triplicate, of a letter received from Mrs. Isabel Snodgrass at present teacher in the Indian Day School, Bella Coola. Mrs. Snodgrass, during her teaching career, has spent some twenty-six years in Indian Schools.\n\nIn her letter she is making application to the Indian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources for a pension. She realizes that no provision is in effect at the present time for such a scheme but on the basis of long service in teaching in Indian schools, she requests special consideration of her application.\n\nI requested Mrs. Snodgrass to furnish me with details as to her years of service in Indian schools, which information is herewith listed.\n\n| Institution                        | Years       |\n|------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Coqualeetza Institute              | 1908-1912   |\n| Kitamaat Girls Home (W.M.S.)       | 1913-1918   |\n| Port Simpson Girls Home (W.M.S.)   | 1919-1920   |\n| Bella Coola Day School             | 1925-1935   |\n| Klentu Day School                  | 1943-1946   |\n| Bella Coola Day School             | 1946-1947   |\n\n26 years 6 months\n\nI am thoroughly convinced that Mrs. Snodgrass has, on the basis of the above record, every right to expect the most careful and favorable consideration on the part of the Department to her request for a pension. Despite the fact that no pension scheme is in effect, the granting of Mrs. Snodgrass' request would not, in my opinion, necessarily be setting a precedent, since to my knowledge there are very few teachers with such a service record to warrant any consideration of such a request.\n\nI most urgently recommend that favorable consideration be given to the application made by Mrs. Isabel Snodgrass.\n\nActing Indian Agent,\n\nIndian AFFAIRS.

The absence of such a scheme makes it very difficult to retain efficient teachers in our schools. It is hoped that in the near future some scheme will be developed which will provide for the retirement of our teachers.\n\nR.F.

We have also begun preliminary work on having our Indian day school teachers classified as permanent for the purposes of the Civil Service Superannuation Act.

As yet I have had no answer to that letter, therefore I believe it will be in order for me to regard myself as teacher here for the 1947-48 term.\n\nDuring the past several weeks I have had excellent health\u2014no fear\u2014always have had and I believe that with judicious care and rest I could carry on the work of the Senior Division for another year. I have not missed a day from work during the past year and probably would not during this next year. I like these people and I like the senior work. Teaching does not involve\nthe climbing of hills, neither does it necessarily entail attendance at social affairs.\n\nHowever, the matter rests with the Department\u2014\nand if they grant me a pension as requested,\nI shall quit; otherwise I shall return here\nand teach the more year after, and I should\nbe very happy indeed to do so.\n\nI would appreciate very much the word of\nan early decision.

Snodgrass, teacher at the Bella Coola Indian Day School.\n\nOur records show that Mrs. Snodgrass was born on October 3rd, 1863. This means that she is now sixty-four years of age. It is, therefore, most unlikely that she will be accepted for superannuation. As I previously pointed out to you, it is most unfortunate that we were never able in the past to have these teachers accepted into the Civil Service Superannuation Plan.\n\nFurthermore, Mrs. Snodgrass does not hold a Canadian Teaching Certificate. The regulations for classification as a Permanent Civil Servant for Indian School Teachers require that teachers be in possession of a Permanent Teachers' Certificate as granted by the Provincial Departments of Education.

The reasons stated for Mrs. Snodgrass' desire to relinquish the position of field matron have been noted.\n\nThe Department will approve of her discontinuing field matron's duties, and will allow her an increase in her salary as teacher of the Bella Coola Indian Day School from May 1st, next. Our funds are extremely limited for the present fiscal year, and the amount of the increase we could allow her for teaching services would be at the rate of $10 per teaching month. This will make her total salary as teacher from the above date at the rate of $1050 per year. I shall be pleased if you will take up this matter with Mrs. Snodgrass and ascertain if she will discontinue field matron's duties, in view of the increase allowed her for teaching duties, and advise the Department accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It is noted you recommend, also, that an enclosed entrance be erected at the front of the building.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may arrange, during the present summer holidays, to have the partition removed and the enclosed entrance provided. The entire cost, for materials and labour, should not exceed your estimate; viz.: $150. I enclose an encumbrance certificate, authorizing an expenditure to that amount.\n\nYou should arrange for the purchase of any materials required, from firms on the approved list, and also for the labour. Indian labour should be utilized as far as possible. Please obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of the materials. These, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. Please state, on each copy of the voucher, that the expenditure was authorized by E. R. No. 3429. You should also prepare vouchers, in triplicate, covering the cost of the labour. Please state definitely the number of days or hours employed and the rate paid. The Department will expect you to see that a satisfactory job is completed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nI. Fouger, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B. C.\nBella Coola, B.C.\nJune 28, 1935.\n\nReferring to your letter No. 162-7-5 of May 20th, I beg to say that the removal of the partition in the school-room at Bella Coola would give an additional floor space of 6 x 20 ft. When this is taken away it would appear necessary to add an enclosed entrance to the front of the building where pupils could hang their caps etc. This could be made 6 x 12 ft., and the entire cost of this work should not exceed $150.00.\n\nThe cost of putting up a new fence along the three sides of the school lot, with clearing off some brush growing up on the grounds, would cost about $50.00.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6385, File 803-5, part 2)\nOttawa, May 29, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Barry, in a report on his recent inspection of the Bella Coola Indian Day School, recommends that, in order to accommodate the increasing number of children at this school, the partition between the actual schoolroom and hall be removed. He states that this would not cost much and would provide space for the number of children expected in September. He states that, if this is done, and a number of extra desks supplied, it would not be necessary to conduct the school on the half-day system, as there would be ample accommodation for all the children.\n\nI have to request that you will furnish an estimate of the cost of having the partition removed and the enlarged classroom placed in good condition. Your early reply is requested, in order that, if the work is authorized, it can be carried out during the coming summer holidays.\n\nThe Inspector has given the number and sizes of the extra desks that would be required if the classroom is enlarged, and we would be prepared to supply same.\n\nThe Inspector recommends that the new fence, which was placed along the front of the school lot only, be continued around the remaining three sides. You should furnish an estimate of the cost of the material and labour required in fencing the balance of the school lot.\n\nA small looking glass is required at this school, and you may arrange for the purchase of same, forwarding a certified account, in triplicate, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nI. Fougner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\nEXTRACT FROM INSPECTOR BARRY'S REPORT REGARDING HIS INSPECTION OF THE BELLA COOLA INDIAN DAY SCHOOL ON APRIL 26, 1935.\n\nThe buildings, which belong to the Department of Indian affairs, consist of a schoolroom with a small walled off hall, a teacher's cottage of four rooms which is not furnished by the Department, a small woodshed, and two toilets. Everything was perfectly neat and clean when I inspected. The new fence previously recommended to be placed around the school grounds of about one acre, has now been placed along the front only. I would recommend that the new fence be continued around the remaining three sides.\n\nTo accommodate the increasing number of children at this school, I would recommend that the partition between the actual schoolroom & the hall be removed. This would not cost much and would provide space for the number of children expected in September. If the Department agrees to this and provides the extra desks recommended below, I do not think that it will be necessary to conduct this school on the HALF DAY SYSTEM which the Indians dislike so much, but which gives fairly good results nevertheless. I could not recommend the building of a second schoolroom here at the present time.\n\nA small looking glass is also needed.\n\nThe following school desks are required: (Numbers refer to Crown Desks, Vancouver, B.C.)\n\n- 2 Rear Sections Number 4\n- 6 Desk Sections Number 4\n- 4 Front Sections Number 3 and 2 Desk Sections Number 3.\n\nThe above is the minimum necessary to care for the increased attendance, and if supplied will make it possible to have all the children in school at once if the necessary structural changes are made to the classroom as recommended above.\nOffice of the Bella Coola Indian Agency,\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. .........................................\n\namounting to $........................................ in favour\n\nof .........................................\n\nfor .........................................\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental\n\nLetter No. ........................................ dated .........................................\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\n| Name       | No. of Hours | Price Per Hr | Total |\n|------------|--------------|--------------|-------|\n| Miller, Fougner | Carpenter    |              |       |\n\n**Amount of Wages**\n\nReceived Payment\n\nWitness\n\nI hereby certify that the services have been performed and prices are fair and just.\n\nCheque No.\n\nRecommended for payment\n\nBalance\n| Name       | Nature of Employment | No. of Hours | Price Per Hr. | Total |\n|------------|----------------------|--------------|---------------|-------|\n| M.

There is now a school building and a teacher's residence on their present site. I recommend that both these buildings be taken down and the lumber from them put into one school building, as I think a teacher's residence will not be needed in the new locality because it is so close to the white townsite.\n\nAs both the present buildings are old, and some of the lumber will be useless, I believe there will only be sufficient saved to build a one-room school a little larger than the one now standing.\n\nThe approximate cost of partly clearing a lot on the new site, dismantling the old buildings, transferring the lumber and the erection of a new school, including tools etc., will be about $750.00. This is, of course, by using Indian labour. If a contract is given white people it is likely to be considerably more.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6385, File 803-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nHas the Department a plan of a one-room school suitable to accommodate approximately forty children? The Department is aware that when the Bella Coola Indians move to their new townsite, a school will have to be erected. I had thought that it would be economical to take down the old school building and teacherage, and use the suitable lumber, but on account of the cost of transportation across the river, breakage, extra handling etc., I think it would be far more practical to provide an entirely new building. The two old buildings could possibly be sold to Indians, so that they could be taken down at their own convenience, for what good lumber there is in them.\n\nOn account of the delay in getting the new townsite sub-divided, it was not possible for the Indians to make any preparations last spring towards moving, as they had anticipated. The survey is now being carried out, but the Indians are away fishing and will not be returning until October. They will then have to clear the lots and streets, and lay in the water system etc. In the circumstances, therefore, it is not likely that they will be able to move over until well on towards Christmas.\n\nThe Bella Coola school will open in September, as usual, in their old village, but there is no doubt in my mind that the Indians will be in their new village before the end of the present fiscal year. Will funds be available, therefore, for the erection of a new school. Once the people have moved over, it would be impossible to transport the children back and forth across the river in order to continue to use the present school.\n\nIf the Department will send me a plan, I could then ascertain the approximate cost of materials etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nAugust 26, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 12th of August regarding the new day school required for the Bella Coola Indians, I am enclosing herewith two blue print copies of a plan which has been prepared for this school.\n\nYou might return one copy of this plan to the department with any suggested changes or alterations indicated thereon.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. Gillett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes.\nSecretary.\nDear Sir,-\n\nIn reply to your letter No. 162-7-1 of August 26th, I may say that I am returning herewith one copy of the plan for the proposed school for Bella Coola.\n\nI think it will not be necessary to include the teacher's residence at the end of the building, as the new townsite adjoins the white settlement where board and room or housekeeping rooms can be arranged for the teacher.\n\nOtherwise, the plan seems very suitable, except that I would suggest a porch roof over the entrance of the school, to keep off rain and snow.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The lot in the townsite on which it is proposed to erect this school is 150 ft. x 300 ft. and will have to be cleared to some extent of the standing timber and stumps before construction can be undertaken. Mr. Gillett estimates that approximately $200.00 will be required for labour and stumping powder to do the necessary clearing. This work should be undertaken as soon as possible and could be done by Indian labour.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nYour file 2018.\n\nOttawa, December 29, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI would appreciate your advising me as soon as possible the progress you are making in transferring the Bella Coola Indians to the new townsite.\n\nIn your letter of February 25, 1937, you wrote as follows:-\n\n\"The approximate cost of partly clearing a lot on the new site, dismantling the old buildings, transferring the lumber and the erection of a new school, including mails, etc., will be about $750.00\".\n\nThe portion of your letter just quoted referred to the Bella Coola Day School. Please let me know at once if you have taken any action in this regard and, if not, you should advise if you can still have the work done for the amount mentioned above. If authority was granted you to proceed, could you have the transfer of the building completed before the end of the current fiscal year, viz: March 31st?\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. Gillett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\nDear Sir,\n\nYour file 163-7-5, Dec. 23rd, 1937\n\nRe: Day School on new Bella Coola townsite\n\nAt present there are six houses occupied on the new townsite, and ten more under construction. The whole matter of moving the people was delayed on account of not receiving word from the Department giving approval of the move, early enough to clear the townsite of timber etc., last spring before the Indians were moved. On Feb. 25th, 1937, when the surveyor had completed the laying out of the townsite, the streets and a number of the lots were cleared last fall. The majority of the Indians have postponed moving until the spring, on account of bad weather conditions. There are only five children on the new townsite. School is being kept open in the school in the old village.\n\nWhen I wrote on Feb. 25th, 1937, I thought word would be received from the Department sanctioning the move, soon enough to get the people moved before school opened in September. I had hoped therefore to get the school moved during the summer holidays. I recommended at that time that the old school be taken down. However, since school had to be opened in the old village and after going further into the matter, I thought it better to build a new school, taking into consideration the breakage of lumber in moving and the cost of transportation. Also a larger school is required. In my letter of August 13th, 1937, No. 8429, I advised the selling of the old school and teacher's residence.\n\nThe Department wrote me on August 26th and sent plans of a new school. I returned those plans with my recommendations on Sept. 13th.\n\nI would still suggest that a new school be built. The cost of material would be approximately $1500, if I am allowed to get competitive prices, as I already have some quotations. Cost of labour would be approximately $2000.\n\nIt is not possible that a new school could be built before March 31st next. I would recommend however, if money is available, that the lot be cleared and the basement excavated before the end of the present fiscal year. The approximate cost would be $500 including lumber for cement forms, which can later be used in the construction of the school building. If this meets with the Department's approval, I would suggest that an advance accountable cheque for $300 for labour, be sent immediately Local labour can be secured.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

BAILEY\n\nWith reference to my memorandum of February 17 and your reply of February 21 regarding the material in the school and teacher's residence on the present townsite of the Bella Coola Indians the following information has been received from our Agent:\n\n1. Day School on Bella Coola Reserve\n\nThis was erected in 1910 at an approximate cost of $1000.00. It is 36'6\" by 20'4\" by 11'. The approximate amount of lumber in the building is 6,500 feet. Some of the sills are rotten. I have been offered $125 for the building as it stands, by one of the Indians. I consider this a good offer. It would not pay the Department to take down the school and use the lumber in the new school, because of the cost of labour, transportation and breakage. Better value would be obtained by purchasing $125.00 worth of new lumber. I would recommend that the offer of $125.00 be accepted.\n\n2. School Teacher's Residence Bella Coola Reserve\n\nThis building was erected in 1924 at an approximate cost of $900.00. It is 24' by 24' by 9', and contains approximately 6000 feet of lumber, but of a poorer grade than that used in the school. I have been offered $100.00 for it. The same conditions apply to the salvage of lumber as in the case of the school. In both cases, however, an Indian using his own time in dismantling etc., could get good value for the money paid for the buildings. I recommend that the offer of $100.00 be accepted.\nYou will note from the above that the Agent recommends that these buildings be demolished after June 30, 1938.\n\nHe has not given the name of the Indians who have offered to purchase the material in both buildings but if this information is necessary it can be obtained.\n\nDirector.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDr. H.W. McGill,\n\nReference is made to your memorandum of the 17th instant, your file 162-7-5, regarding the material in the school and teacher's residence on the present townsite of the Bella Coola Indians. It is noted that you have received offers for these buildings, which are in use until June 30th next.\n\nAs you are aware, we are unable to dispose of Government property except through the Salvage Officer and then usually by tender. It would, therefore, seem desirable to refer any tenders to that Officer.\n\nHowever, I should be glad if you would let me have as soon as possible a full description of the buildings, size, material, and, if possible, the original cost. I should also be glad if you would advise me if these are to be removed to another location or demolished after June 30th, 1935, and if the successful tenderer would be required to remove any debris to the satisfaction of the Indian Agent.\n\nI would also ask that you let me have the name and address of the parties who have already submitted offers for the buildings.\n\nW.M. Bailey,\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMR. BAILEY\n\nThe Bella Coola Indians are being moved to a new townsite. This will involve the erection of a day school on the new site.\n\nIndian Agent Gillett states that the material in the school and teacher's residence on the present townsite could not be economically used in the erection of the new school.\n\nWe have received an offer from an Indian of $125.00 for the old school and an offer from another Indian of $100.00 for the old teacher's residence.\n\nBoth these buildings would be in use until the end of the academic year; namely, June 30, 1938.\n\nIn view of the recommendation of the Indian Agent I would appreciate your securing from the Salvage Officer authority for Indian Agent Gillett to sell these buildings for the amounts mentioned above.\n\nDirector.\nJ GILLET ESQ,\nINDIAN AGENT\nBELLA COOLA B C\n\nREFERENCE YOUR LETTER JANUARY ELEVENTH PLEASE FORWARD AT ONCE COMPLETE DETAILS OF MATERIAL THAT YOU CONSIDER NECESSARY TO ERECT NEW BELLA COOLA SCHOOL STOP ALSO FORWARD FOR OUR CONSIDERATION THE QUOTATIONS THAT YOU HAVE RECEIVED\n\nR A HOEY\nSUPT OF WELFARE & TRAINING\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept.

(RG 10, Volume 6385, File 803-5, part 2)\nDear Sir,\n\nAs requested by telegram of February 17th I am forwarding herewith a list of material required for the proposed Indian Day school for the new Bella Coola Townsite. Attached also is the Rexwell Lumber Company's price on the lumber.\n\nI may say that I have made no provision for toilets. I believe it will be possible to have inside toilets as the Indians intend putting a sewage system in the village. I will take this matter up later.\n\nThe enclosed estimates are based on the blue-print sent by the Department, No. 710, but without the teacher's quarters. The cement for the basement is figured on an 8-inch wall, instead of 10-inch. An 8-inch wall is quite sufficient in this locality.\n\nI have estimated on a building 24 feet wide, instead of 25 feet as shown in plan, as 25 is an odd size and would require each piece of lumber to be cut.\n\nThe nearest sawmill to Bella Coola is the Telegraph Cove Mill, and I have sent them a list of the material and asked them to furnish their quotations to the Department direct. The freight rates from Telegraph Cove would be less than from Vancouver.\n\nCement can be landed at Bella Coola dock by Sam King, local Indian merchant, for $1.15 per sack. This is the best local price.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6385, File 803-5, part 2)\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Bella Coola Indians are being moved to a new townsite, so that after June 30th, 1938, we will have for disposal the old day school and school teachers' residence on the Bella Coola Indian Reserve, Bella Coola, B.C.\n\nIn connection with the disposal of these buildings I would enclose a copy of a memorandum from the Director of the Branch, giving certain details. We are anxious to dispose of these buildings at the earliest possible date, but one of the conditions of the sale is that they will not become available until June 30th next. I should, therefore, be glad if you would take steps to dispose of these buildings for us as soon as possible.\n\nInterested parties might see the buildings upon application to Indian Agent, Gillette, Bella Coola Indian Reserve, Bella Coola, B.C.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nThe Salvage Officer,\nSalvage Division,\nTreasury Office,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. WARDLE\n\nRe: Bella Coola Indian Day School\nBella Coola Indian Agency, B.C.\n\nProvision has been made in our estimates for the fiscal year 1938-39 for a new one-roomed day school on the Bella Coola Indian Reserve. This school is officially known by the name mentioned at the top of this memorandum. The enclosed blue print was sent to the Indian Agent for his consideration last September and in replying he states that it will be satisfactory with the exception that he does not consider teacher's living quarters necessary.\n\nThe Indian Agent considers that this building should be erected by day labour and as funds for the purchase of material are available in our appropriation for the present fiscal year he has obtained prices from two different firms. I enclose, for your consideration, the following quotations:\n\nRexwell Lumber Company, Vancouver, B.C., $920.00\n\nTelegraph Cove Mills Ltd., Telegraph Cove, B.C., $720.00\n\nI would appreciate if you would review these quotations at once and let me know if you consider that the quotations include the lumber that would be required. As soon as your reply is received the matter will be placed before the Provincial Agent. As pointed out above, it is hoped to make payment for this lumber from the current year's appropriation and it is, therefore, necessary that the matter receive immediate attention. I also enclose a list of the hardware which the Agent considers is required for the new school and I would appreciate if you would review this and advise me if it is complete.\nIn forwarding the quotations mentioned above the Indian Agent writes:\n\n\"The enclosed estimates are based on the blue-print sent by the Department, No. 710, but without the teacher's quarters. The cement for the basement is figured on an 8-inch wall, instead of 10-inch. An 8-inch wall is quite sufficient in this locality.\n\n\"I have estimated on a building 24 feet wide, instead of 25 feet as shown in plan, as 25 is an odd size and would require each piece of lumber to be cut.\"\n\nDirector.\nList of material, lumber, for the New School at Bella Coola.\n\n1 Pcs. 6x8 - 40' 1/2 Com.

(RG 10, Volume 6385, File 803-5, part 2)\nRe: Bill of Materials required for new Day School, Bella Coola, B.C.\n\nRecommendations.\n\n1. Cement. Based on the use of 8\" foundation walls, 1'6\" x 9\" footings, and a 4\" floor slab, it is estimated that using a 1:6 mix, 300 sacks cement will be required.\n\n2. Brick. Based on a 4\" brick chimney with 8\u00bd\" x 13\" flue, erected on concrete base below 1st floor line, 800 brick will be satisfactory. If, however, chimney is erected in brick from basement floor slab, 1000 brick will be required.\n\n3. Flue lining. It is noted that flue lining is not provided in the bill of material, and if a 4\" brick chimney is used, it will be necessary to provide a clay tile flue lining. 12 pcs. 8\u00bd\" x 13\" x 2'0\" flue lining will be required.\n\n4. Building Paper. Based on lining roof under shingles, both sides exterior walls, ceiling sheathing and subflooring. 6,000 sq.ft. of building paper would be required.\n\n5. Furnace. No provision is made for pipe connection from furnace pipe to chimney. This would require only 8\" black iron flue thimble for 8\" wall (maximum).\n\nNo provision is made for chimney cleanout. This would require:\n1 only 8\" x 10\" C.I. Cleanout Door & Frame for 8\" wall.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Wardle.\n\nRe: Bella Coola Indian Day School, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of March 11th forwarding a bill of materials for the above school and two tenders on the lumber requirements, which were received from the Director of the Indian Affairs Branch, the quotations and bill have been checked as requested.\n\nIn connection with the bill of materials, it should be noted that without working drawings the bill of materials cannot be accurately checked, however, with the exceptions as noted on the attached recommendations, the bill of materials as submitted appears satisfactory for the construction of the proposed school.\n\nRegarding the two tenders submitted, the price of $720.00 would be a fair and just charge for the lumber materials as listed in the tenders received.\n\nThe two tenders and the bill of materials received with your memorandum are returned herewith.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nEncls.\n\nT.

Funds are available for the purchase of the material for this school from our appropriation for the fiscal year 1937-38. I enclose two quotations which the Indian Agent obtained from firms near the proposed school. These quotations were submitted to the Surveys & Engineering Branch and they state that if either tender is accepted there would be practically all the lumber etc. that will be required.\n\nI also enclose list showing hardware, paint and cement that would be necessary. If a list of these articles were forwarded to Indian Commissioner Mackay of Vancouver he could arrange for purchase before the end of March. Vancouver would be the best point to purchase the hardware etc. as there is direct boat connection from Vancouver to Bella Coola.\n\nI enclose two requisitions, one for the lumber and the other for the hardware.\nI would appreciate if the Honourable the Minister would authorize the Purchasing Agent to proceed at once with the purchase of the materials required for the erection of this building. As stated above, funds for the purpose are available in our appropriation for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1938.\n\nDirector.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDr. H.W. McGill,\nDir. of Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nApproval was given today for the purchase of the lumber and hardware for the new Day School at the Bella Coola Agency. In view of these purchases, the Minister's Office is interested in knowing whether it is the intention to have the School built by day labour or have it done by contract.\n\nC.W. Jackson,\nChief Executive Assistant.\nOttawa,\nMarch 22, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of February 22 I desire to advise you that an order is being placed with Telegraph Cove Mills Limited for the lumber and mill work required for the Bella Coola Indian Day School at the amount mentioned in their quotation to you; namely, $720.00. The Department is also arranging to purchase the hardware, paint, cement and furnace that will be required for this school.\n\nIt is hoped to have these supplies delivered in the near future in order that the accounts may be dated previous to March 31 and this will permit our paying them from the current year's appropriation.\n\nPlease let me know at once if you consider that this building should be erected by day labour or by contract. If you recommend day labour\u2014presumably employing Indians\u2014will it be necessary to secure a white foreman or any other skilled labour. If so you should let me know exactly what tradesmen will be necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. Gillett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.

The cost of clearing lot and excavating the basement has cost up to date, $500. This was authorized by letter No. 162-7-5 of January 22nd, 1938.\n\nThis was a harder proposition than was anticipated. After we had the timber off we found just below the surface large boulders, covering the whole lot, 150 ft by 300 ft. Fortunately we were able to hire a bulldozer, otherwise the work could never have been satisfactorily by hand labour, and the cost would have been tremendous. There are still a number of boulders to be removed, and the stumps to be burned after they have dried out. The lot is now fairly level, but still very stoney and gravel should be hauled to make it suitable for a playground. Another hundred dollars should complete the work. The basement is ready for the cement forms.\n\nI am enclosing some pictures taken as the work progressed. I will secure one of the lot as it now is, and send later.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n| Description                                      | Quantity | Unit | Price |\n|-------------------------------------------------|----------|------|-------|\n| 80' Lin. 1 x 8 #1&2 B.N.Base                    |          |      |       |\n| 80' Lin. #1120 Carpet Strip                     |          |      |       |\n| 2 Doors 2/8 x 6/8 - 1-3/8 #122                 |          |      |       |\n| 2 0/3 Door Frames for above                     |          |      |       |\n| 2 Doors 2/8 x 6/8 - 1-3/8 #101                 |          |      |       |\n| 2 1/8 Door Frames for above                     |          |      |       |\n| 2 Windows 36 x 54 OSM Btm. 2 lt.

C.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Bella Bella and Klemtu Bands were visited during the month, although most of my time was spent on the Bella Coola Reserve.\n\nThree schools were visited during March. There was a good attendance at Bella Bella and at Klemtu. At Bella Coola the attendance averaged nine pupils, due to the fact that the majority of the people have moved to their new townsite. After giving due consideration to the transportation of the pupils across the river, I decided that the risks were too great. It therefore means that until the new school is built the majority of the Bella Coola children are without schooling. If I have word early in April to begin construction, there is no reason why the school could not be ready by the middle of May. By that time it is likely that all the children will be living on their side of the river. I may say that most of the building material for the new school is already on the ground and the basement excavation ready for the cement forms.\n\nJ.

As soon as we have received this information authority will be requested for the employment and the work can then be proceeded with.\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nWith reference to Mr. Jackson's memorandum of March 19th and in reply of March 24th connection with the Bella Coola Indian Day School the following telegram has just been received from Indian Agent Gillott:\n\nRE DEPARTMENTAL LETTER ABOUT SKILLED LABOUR REQUIRED SCHOOL ERECTED BY INDIAN DAY LABOR ONE FIFTH LOCAL FOREMAN STOP ON NO SKILLED LABOR AVAILABLE STOP ALL NECESSARY MATERIAL NOW ON THE GROUND STOP SHOULD IMMEDIATE START ON CONSTRUCTION AND THAT ADVANCE SUM OF THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS BE SENT\n\nIn view of the fact that with the exception of a white foreman skilled Indian labour is available I feel that the necessary material is now on the ground. I respectfully suggest with the recommendation of Mr. Gillott to erect this building by day labour.\n\nIn Vote 163, for the fiscal year 1938-39, the amount of $50,000.00 was provided for Indian schools. This included an item of $1,000.00 for the Bella Coola Day School. Application has recently been made to the Treasury Board for the transfer of the amount of $50,000.00 to the Surveys and Engineering Branch. If this transfer is approved the advance requested by Indian Agent Gillott would have to be forwarded by the Surveys and Engineering Branch.\n\nMr. Mills Langner\nBella Coola\nmay be appointed\nas foreman.\n\nApril 28/38.\n\nDirector.\n\nPlease note,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6385, File 803-5, part 2)\nOttawa,\nApril 29, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Bella Coola Indian Day School,\n\nBella Coola Indian Agency, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of April 23 I am advised by the Deputy Minister's office that Mr. Miles Faugher, Bella Coola, B.C., should be employed as foreman.\n\nFrom our appropriation for the fiscal year 1937-38 the following was purchased and paid for:\n\n1.

In my memorandum to you of April 4 I requested that an advance of $800.00 be forwarded to Mr. J. Gillett, Indian Agent, Bella Coola, B.C.\n\nDirector.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have today moved all the school furnishings, desks etc., from the old school on Bella Coola Reserve to the Church on the new townsite, where school will be held until the end of this term. I found this action necessary, as there are now no school children left in the old village, and it does not appear that the new school will be built in time to be of use this spring.\n\nI secured permission from the Clergyman in charge, to use the Church on the understanding that I would recommend to the Department XXX a rental of $10.00 per month for the next two months. The Church was recently moved over intact, and the rental will help towards defraying the cost of this.\n\nI trust that the Department will approve of the above and that permission will be given to send in vouchers for the moving of the desks etc. and for the rental of the Church.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nMay 12, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 30th ultimo the Department will allow a rental of $10.00 a month for the Church on the Bella Coola Reserve in order that the Bella Coola Indian Day School may continue in operation.\n\nIt is felt that the Indians should have been sufficiently interested in the education of their children to move the desks etc. free of charge. However, if you found it necessary to incur any expenditure in this regard you may forward a voucher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ.

It appears that as the school is on fairly high ground, the pressure will not ensure an adequate supply unless certain tank storage is available. The Indian Agent has suggested that a small tank be installed and connected to the standard equipment planned for the school. The total cost of the tank installation, plus some 500 feet of piping to connect the school system with the village system, is estimated at approximately $300.\n\nIt would not be proposed to undertake this installation or make any expenditure until one of our Engineers has checked the matter up on the ground, but in the meantime, you might kindly advise me if you would be willing to make the above expenditure.\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Water supply for Bella Bella School, Bella Coola Indian Reserve, British Columbia.\n\nI am in receipt of your memorandum of July 20 in connection with the above.\n\nProvided that one of your engineers visits the school site and considers the suggestion made by the Indian Agent is practicable, this Branch approves an expenditure not exceeding $300.00 in installing a water supply in this building.\n\nActing Director.\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. H.W.

BAILEY\n\nI desire to refer you to your memorandum of August 17 regarding the sale of the old buildings at the Bella Coola Indian Reserve. In the above connection the following letter has been received from the Indian Agent:\n\n\"Replying to your letter No. 162-7-5 of July 14th, with reference to the guaranty cheques of George Nelson and Samson Schooner, I may say that neither of these men have yet complied with the conditions of the tender.

BAILEY\n\nI have your memorandum of September 3 regarding the old buildings sold under Tender C.S. 2745.\n\nIn view of the information received from our Indian Agent and forwarded to you in my memorandum of August 30 I consider that it will be satisfactory to allow the removal of the buildings to stand until early winter and hold the guaranty cheques in the meantime.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nReference is made to your memorandum of the 30th ultimo, file 162-7-5, regarding the old buildings sold under Tender G.S.2745. It is noted that the purchasers are Indians of Bella Coola, who have not had time to remove the buildings, but intend doing so this Fall, or early winter.\n\nOne of the conditions of the Tender was the removal of the old buildings within twenty-one days of June 30th last. The Salvage Officer is holding guaranty cheques of $25.00 each until the conditions of the contract are complied with. In view of your memorandum of the 30th ultimo, will it be satisfactory to allow the removal to stand until early winter and hold the guaranty cheques in the meantime?\n\nW.M. Bailey,\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No. 162-7-S of August 2nd, I may say that as Messrs. Nelson and Schooner are Indians of the Bella Coola Band living on Bella Coola Reserve, I think it would be in order for the Department to return their guaranty cheques. They intend to remove the buildings at their convenience after the end of the present fishing season.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honour to report as follows for the month of August.\n\nThe new Indian day school at Bella Coola was completed during the month. The appropriation this year was $2000, but this will not all be used. Most of the material was purchased out of last year's funds, making a total cost of $3095.00. The unexpended balance of this year's appropriation will be about $290.00.\n\nJ.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nThe School Returns for the Quarter ending December 31, 1941 indicate a slight increase in average attendance over the same period last year. It is noted that the average attendance for Bella Coola was 46.32 out of a total of 57 pupils on the register, and that of the Kitimat Indian Day School was 44.71 out of a total of 69 pupils on the register. This is all the more a matter of concern in view of the fact that most of the pupils at Kitimat are enrolled at the Residential School. An extra room should be provided at Bella Coola in the near future.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nWm.

The school is too small to accommodate all the children of school age in the village and the teacher finds difficulty in dealing with a large class, with the result that interest in the school is falling off. Matters could be improved considerably by enlarging the school to two rooms. There is an excellent school building in the old village but unfortunately the Department sold this to the Band for $100 for use as a Band Practice Hall; at present it is standing idle. It may be found possible to purchase it back at a slightly higher price and move it over next to the present school and connect the two buildings together, as the old school appears to be quite sound. If this could be done for about $500 and another teacher secured the attendance would probably double and the quality of the teaching be improved by division of the junior grades from the senior. The matter is being taken up by the Agent and if the proposal appears possibly by the Band agreeing to the sale of the old building, he will make application to the Department, furnishing a survey of all the children of the village up to the age of fifteen years.\n\nThe appearance of the school grounds could be considerably improved by the planting of a few trees along the edge of the lot and some shrubs around the base of the building.

It is proposed to commence fencing the grounds and make other improvements and continue the work in another fiscal year when funds may be available to complete the scheme in mind. Mr. Anfield does not state what the total cost of the project will be.\n\nIn this connection, I would advise that unless the Department particularly wishes to commence the work this year, I would suggest that the matter of these improvements be left until the new addition to the school to provide for a teacher's quarters and another classroom has been approved. Provision was made for this construction in the program of worthwhile works to be undertaken immediately following the close of the war and I should think that the improvements Mr. Anfield has in mind could best be made at that time.\n\nThere is no regular teacher at Bella Coola at present. It will be recalled that the Department approved the temporary employment of the local United Church missionary as teacher for this school until such time as the services of a properly qualified teacher could be secured.\n\nD.M.

Mines & Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nAttached please find requisition for the Bella Coola Day School for the year 1946-47. It is noted that the Department has approved the opening of a second room and the teacher has already been appointed. The requisition is based on the needs of two rooms.\n\nOne sheet is made up for requirements at the teacherage rented by the Department. Enough furniture was purchased early this year to provide for the needs of one teacher. The additional items are for the second teacher and to complete the furnishings of this cottage which should then make very comfortable quarters for the two teachers at this School.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 22, 1946.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, British Columbia.\n\nWith reference to the opening of a second classroom at the Bella Coola Indian Day School, Indian Agent Anfield states that additional furniture will be required for the teacher's residence. You may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the following articles:\n\n1 Bed, single,\n1 Mattress,\n2 Pillows,\n4 Window blinds (green) $37\\frac{1}{2} \\times 60$\n1 \" \" $27\\frac{1}{2} \\times 60$\n2 Coleman lamps (kerosene)\n2 Bedroom chairs,\n2 Bedside tables.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nEnclosed herewith is a letter from Mr. Acting Agent Findlay requesting authority for an expenditure of $50.22 for repairs to the second classroom of the Bella Coola Indian Day School. I would recommend that this expenditure be approved and that an accountable advance for $24.00 be forwarded to Mr. Findlay.\n\nD. W. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C.,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nWhen arrangements were made for the opening of a second classroom at Bella Coola, the matter of toilet facilities was seemingly entirely overlooked.\n\nThe building is some considerable distance from the school (the new one) and some sanitary arrangements will have to be made for the convenience of the pupils. I would suggest that separate outside toilets be erected a short distance behind the school.\n\nSince no provisions had been made to protect the wood supply which is piled up near the school in inclement weather, I would also suggest that a lean-to wood shed be erected at the rear of the building.\n\nShelves have been erected inside the school for storing supplies and doors should be provided to turn these into a cupboard.\n\nLumber and labour costs for the above are estimated as follows:\n\n**Wood Shed**\n\n| Item                  | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|-----------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| 200 feet shiplap      |          | $35.00 per M | $7.00 |\n| Labour 8 hours        |          | 75\u00a2         | $6.00 |\n\n**Toilets**\n\n| Item                  | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|-----------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| 200 feet 2\" x 4\"      |          |            |       |\n| 16 \" 2\" x 12\"         |          |            |       |\n| Shiplap               |          |            |       |\n| 672 f.b.m.            |          |            |       |\n| 672 f.b.m. at $35.00 per M |    |            | 23.52 |\n| 5 lbs. 2c\" nails      |          | .12        | .60   |\n\n(over)\n3 lbs. 4\" nails @ .12 $ .36\n2 lbs. 6\" nails @ .12 $.24\nCartage 3.50\nLabour 24 hours at .75 16.00\n\n$46.22\n\nThere is sufficient scrap lumber on hand at the Agency to provide for doors for the cupboard as well as some extra shingles for the roof of the toilets if there should not be sufficient shiplap.\n\nSince this is a matter of extreme urgency, I would recommend that approval be granted for the material to be obtained and the work done.\n\nVouchers, supported by paylists could be submitted upon completion of the work.\n\nJ.

As an amount of $365.00 has been provided in the current year's estimates for this work and also as Major Davey confirms the information contained in Mr. Pruden's letter, I would recommend that authority be granted to Mr. Pruden to purchase the necessary supplies.\n\nThe paint can be purchased from Marshall Wells, Vancouver, B.C. at a cost of $27.90.\n\nIt is also recommended that an accountable advance be forwarded to Mr. Pruden to cover labour charges.\n\nD.

C.\n\nRe: Bella Coola Indian Day School - Senior Room\n\nIn this mail is going forward my proposal for certain additions to the above building in cooperation with the Indian owners who have donated the use of the building to the school for the past year and are willing to continue the arrangement meantime.\n\nIt is many years since the interior of this building has been decorated and it presents a most drab and dirty appearance. The floor is particularly in need of attention. I have been trying for some time to secure a tender for the work of painting the floor, wainscoting, walls, and ceilings, also removing desks from floor and screwing them onto strips in accordance with more recent accepted practice. Floors, wainscoting will require two coats of paint, walls and ceiling will require washing to remove old calcimine and two coats of paint to finish. There is no one here either white or Indian, capable and willing to do the work just now. However had I the materials on hand I might find someone with the time to spare within the next month or so. I estimate that this work should be finished in about seven men days and if I had authority to spend $60.00 should be able to pay the labor and buy the stripping for the desks and any other small items of material that may be required, in addition to the following list of paint which I would appreciate your assistance in purchasing providing the work is approved:\n\n2 gal. Medium Gray Floor enamel\n2\u00bd \" Cream Inside paint\n1\u00bd \" Pearl house paint (for ceiling).\n\nAttached are duplicate quotations that Mr. Levelton has secured from three firms. Marshall-Wells price is slightly the more favorable. Paint should be shipped via Union S.S. marked \"For Day School\" and addressed c/o Indian Agent, Bella Coola, B. C.\n\nMay I have your early authority to proceed with this work.\n\nW. P.

The requirements listed by Mr. Pruden will cost approximately $140.00 and it will be appreciated if you would advise if this amount can be made available.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nBella Coola, B.C.,\nAugust 6th, 1947.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nRe: Bella Coola Indian Day School\nSenior Room (Gordon Band Hall)\n\nDuring the past year a Bella Coola Indian musical organization known as the Gordon Band have kindly donated their band practice hall to the use of the senior room of the Day School, rent free. During the coming year they are willing to continue the arrangement and it would appear in view of the amount of school construction urgently required in this Agency that I may have to ask them to forego the use of their practice hall in the interests of the school children for several years to come.\n\nThe building is not suitable for a school room as it stands. It is the same building that was used as a school in the old village across the river. On being reconstructed on this side there was not sufficient lumber to construct an entry or vestibule and the present doorway opens directly from the classroom to the open air. Last winter rain beating against the door caused pools of water on the floor.\n\nThe wood was piled in the open and as a result was covered with wet snow and considerable difficulty was experienced in keeping the fires going.\n\nSince the building is occupied rent free, the owners can hardly be asked to make good these deficiencies. However several Indians have expressed their willingness to donate labor to remedying the situation. I propose that in recognition of the obligation of the Department to house the school that materials be donated for the construction of an entry of sufficient size to accommodate the children's wraps and a small quantity of fuel for day to day use and where washing facilities may be placed. Further, that materials also be donated for a wood shed to accommodate the annual fuel supply. All of the above on the understanding that the Bella Coola Indians supply the labor in recognition of the permanent improvement to the building.\n\n(over)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nYour file 162-7-5 (WT)\nRe: Bella Coola Indian Day School\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of August 21st approving an expenditure of $87.90 for material and labour required to redecorate the interior of the senior room at the above mentioned school, it should be noted that an accountable advance of $60.00 only is required for labour costs.\n\nThe paint is being purchased in Vancouver at a cost of $27.90, plus freight.\n\nD.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No. dated.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 506\n\nReg. 3524\n\nVoucher No. 37\n\nDate Jan. 20th, 1948\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nUnder date of September 5th the Department approved an expenditure of $140 for improvements required to the building used as a senior classroom at the Bella Coola Indian Day School. This amount was intended to cover the cost of materials only, it being understood at that time that the owner of the building, which the Department has the use of rent free, would provide the necessary labour. Mr. Indian Agent Pruden has advised, however, that in spite of many promises that the work would be done immediately the repairs and improvements have not yet been attended to.\n\nThe cost of labour is estimated at $120.00 and I would recommend that the Department approve an expenditure of this amount as it would appear that we will have to use the building in question for classroom purposes for at least another year. I would recommend that an accountable advance of $120 be forwarded to Mr. Pruden after April 1st and that in the meantime he be authorized to have the work proceeded with.\n\nW.T.

It is understood that we will be able to continue the use of the building free of rent.\n\nAs you request, an accountable advance will be sent to Mr. Pruden after April 1st.\n\nBernard F.

In order to complete it at this time an additional amount of $43.30 will be required to meet labour costs.\n\nWhile his reference to a balance of $41.70 of an accountable advance on hand is not entirely clear it would appear that he has had some of the work done and has communicated for the advance direct to the Department. I would recommend that a further advance of $43.30 be forwarded to him when funds are available.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMr. W. S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Bella Coola Day School (Senior Room)\n\nThank you for your 2-11-3 of March 17th giving authority to proceed with the construction of wood-shed and entry to the above named school building.\n\nWork is now in hand and should be completed within a week. With reference to the last paragraph of your letter, since this work is being completed by contract and not by day labor I believe I am correct in assuming that paylists and hour rates will not be applicable, since these are entirely the concern of the contractor.\n\nThe same native contractor has undertaken to paint the interior and as the school is now on holiday and this is the first offer of painting I have had since the painting materials arrived last September, I have ordered the work to proceed. This work will also be on a contract basis and the price will be higher than I estimated originally. The contractor has agreed to do the work for $85.00 and considering the very exacting work needed to remove the old calcimine I agree that this is not excessive.\n\nThere remains on hand from accountable advance of August 21st ($22 cheque 61940) the sum of $41.70. This is being paid on account to the contractor. Accounting voucher with receipts is going forward to Ottawa. Additional authority for $43.30 to complete payment for the paint work is therefore required. I trust an accountable advance may be allowed in that amount.\n\nAttached is copy of signed contract to complete the paint work.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This amount can be paid providing the accommodation is rented from an Indian family. If not, you should advise the Department further concerning the party from whom the house is rented.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Bella Coola School\n\nFollowing Miss Wright's resignation from the above school, Mrs. Bishop was employed as teacher of the second classroom at this school. I am now in receipt of a request from Supt. Pruden that consideration be given to the payment of rental for the house occupied by Mrs. Bishop and her family.\n\nThe teacherage rented presently by the Department for Miss Bray, the other teacher at this school, consists of two small rooms and there is no space for a second teacher. As previously advised it is thought that possibly next year we may reach an agreement with the local School Board whereby a number of the Indian pupils will be enrolled in the Bella Coola white school, which will obviate the necessity for a second Indian school classroom at this point. We also hope it may be possible to construct our own teacherage at this point during the next fiscal year. In any event this particular problem should not face us during the next academic year.\n\nIn the meantime, for the balance of the present academic year I would recommend that the Department pay $15.00 a month toward the $22.00 being paid by Mr. and Mrs. Bishop, as the usual housing accommodation is not provided for this teacher.\n\nFor W.E.

With reference to the funds covered by voucher #51 my letter states \"with reference to the last paragraph of your letter (2-11-3 of March 17) since this work is being completed by contract and not by day labor, I believe I am correct in assuming that paylists and hour rates will not be applicable, since these are entirely the concern of the contractor\".\n\nNo reply was received to that paragraph and copy of contract is attached to the voucher.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nMr. W.S. Ameil, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Bella Coola Day School\n\nThe building occupied by the above school is the property of the \"Gorion Band\" a musical organization made up of members of the Bella Coola Band of Indians. This organization have given the building without charge to the Department for the past three school terms.\n\nIn the meantime, the musical group having no place to practice, neglected what had been a very fine silver band. During the past year I have been told by individuals of the Bella Coola Band that they considered the neglect of music an important factor in the increase of drunkenness in the village. Acting on this theory last autumn, some of the head men of the village reorganized the band and began practicing in the homes. By Christmas they were doing very well. It was then decided to start a Junior Band to train the young men. The group has now grown so large that it is impossible to accommodate them in a dwelling. It is desired to hold classes often with so many beginners.\n\nIn view of this, the Council reluctantly approached me to enquire about the senior school building. They had originally been told that the loan was for only one year. Now I have had to tell them that it would appear that a school room could not be constructed here for several years and that if their band hall is returned, then the senior room must be closed. This of course they do not wish. A very poor second choice for the band classes is to try to squeeze in practice sessions between other events in the large village hall. This building is normally busy every week night with basketball, ring hockey, moving pictures, banquets, concerts and the occasional dance. In order to improve the finances of this building an increased scale of rentals has been imposed. Since most of the activity in this hall is of a community nature, it is not possible to modify the rates schedule without upsetting the hall's finances. The band must therefore pay rental for use of this hall and they have not enough funds to do so.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6385, File 803-5, part 4)\nIt seems to me that the time has come to allow the \"Gordon Band\" some rental for the use of their building. This rental could be applied toward the rental they must pay for the larger hall. The minimum they will require will be about $2.50 per practice, ten times per month, covering the Junior and Senior groups.\n\nI recommend that a rental of $15.00 per month be authorized to be paid to the Gordon Band for the use of their building as Senior Day School room, this rental to be retroactive to September 1943.\n\nT. P. Fadden,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa\n\nRe: Senior Room Bella Coola Day School\n\nThe Senior class of the Bella Coola School has, for the past three school terms, been conducted in a hall, property of the Indians, and you will note from Mr. Pruden's letter of February 21st, 1949, attached, that the musical organization who own the hall have had to rent other accommodation for their community activities.\n\nIn view of this and until such time as we arrange for the enrolment of Indian pupils in the local white school, or provide our own accommodation, I would recommend that the Department pay rental for the hall at the rate of $15.00 per month and that this payment be retroactive to September, 1948.\n\nW.S.

It is quite evident that some very necessary repairs will have to be made in connection with the flooring in the toilets as I noticed on my last visit that the floor boards appeared to be rotten.\n\nApparently the board floor is laid over a part of the basement floor which was not cemented at time of construction and evidently dry rot has set in owing to lack of ventilation and also to a leak in one of the pipes. It is very hard to estimate closely on the actual cost of these repairs because it may be necessary to tear out the two board walls and partition to enable the workman to get the old floor out and to renew same. If the cement floor does not extend through under the board floor, I think it would be good economy to cement in the whole floor and just sit the toilet bowls on the cement and eliminate the board floor entirely. I would estimate the total cost at approximately $150.00 including labour and material, in addition to material ordered in your letter file 2-11-3, of 26th November, addressed to Andrew Sheret Ltd.\n\nT.

The total expenditure should not exceed $200.00.\n\nI would recommend that the Department endeavour to make funds to this amount available.\n\nBella Coola Agency voucher No. 389 in the amount of $6.00 covering temporary repairs is enclosed and recommended for payment.\n\nW.S.

I am now informed by Mr. Superintendent Pruden that Ocean Falls School District, under whose jurisdiction the Bella Coola School comes, is prepared to consider a proposal for a joint building programme. Before making any survey or proceeding with the preparation of any plans the School District would like to have assurance that our Department is interested in their proposal and would assume its share of the capital cost, if a survey indicates that the proposal is feasible.\n\nThe Bella Coola Indian Day School is at present housed in two buildings, one of which is a fairly satisfactory school constructed about ten years ago. The second building is rented from the Bella Coola Band and is quite inadequate in every respect. These two buildings house at present approximately 70 children in grades 1 to 5. The existing Provincial School is not in excess of one-half mile from the farthest Indian pupil.\n\nIt is Inspector Davey's suggestion that we retain the satisfactory building for pre-primary purposes and that all of the school age population be admitted to the Provincial School. Mr. Davey has not made a survey of the Bella Coola situation but has made this suggestion so that he may have the Department's reaction before proceeding with a comprehensive survey.\n\nI feel that the proposal for the admission of all the school age\nChildren to the Provincial School is of sufficient importance to warrant the transfer of funds from some project in our proposed building programme, since no provision has been made for a contribution to the capital cost of a combined school.\n\nI might add that the Indians at Bella Coola all have protestant affiliation.\n\nI shall appreciate receiving the Department's decision as to whether or not they are prepared to agree in principle to the admission of the Indian children to the Provincial school and the making of a contribution towards the capital cost of this building.\n\nW.S.

(RG 10, Volume 6385, File 803-5, part 4)\nMemorandum:\n\nACTING DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nBella Bella, B.C. - Proposed Joint School\n\nThe Indian Commissioner for British Columbia has previously advised against any new Indian school building program at Bella Bella because of the possibility of increasing the number of native children admitted to the provincial school.\n\nInspector Davey has been carrying on negotiations with the Ocean Falls School District, under whose jurisdiction the Bella Coola Provincial School comes.\n\nThe Bella Coola Indian Day School is at present housed in two buildings, one of which is a fairly satisfactory school, constructed about ten years ago. A second building is rented from the Bella Coola Band and is quite inadequate in every respect. These two buildings house at present approximately 70 children in grades one to five. The existing provincial school is about a half mile away from the farthest Indian pupil.\n\nIt is Inspector Davey's recommendation that we retain the satisfactory building for kindergarten and primary purposes and that all of the school age population be admitted to the provincial school. This means that all the kindergarten and primary children will receive an education in basic English at our own school and then be sent to the provincial school.\n\nI now attach a memorandum from Inspector Davey with regard to this proposed joint school. You will note it is\nimpossible at the present time to secure an accurate estimate of the cost to the Department of this new school.\n\nIt is recommended that this information be placed before Colonel Fortier upon his return so that he can give the matter consideration and advise whether we should proceed with the negotiations.\n\nActing Director.\n\nEndl.\nAIRMAIL\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Bella Coola Indian Day Schools\n\nSuperintendent Pruden has requested authority for an expenditure of $60 for labor for painting the two classroom floors in the above-mentioned school buildings. He has secured a labor tender from an Indian, George Nelson, and states that an accountable advance will not be required.\n\nHe has not forwarded a copy of Mr. Nelson's tender, but I would recommend that he be authorized to have the work proceeded with on the understanding that the written tender will be forwarded so that a purchase order may be issued.\n\nW.S.

Bray,\nSenior Teacher,\nBella Coola Indian Day School,\nBella Coola, B.C.\n\nDear Miss Bray:\n\nYour letter of the 20th ultimo addressed to the Department of National Health and Welfare has been forwarded for my attention.\n\nThe matter of teaching boys boxing is very controversial and the modern trend in physical education, in school at least, is against such sports in so far as training for actual bouts and competitions. There are those teachers of physical education who hold that a scientific course in the noble art of self-defence is beneficial to the child. For your information I have written to the eminent authority on physiology, Dr. Arthur Steinhouse, whose paper on boxing I shall be glad to forward to you as soon as I receive it. However, your problem, as I understand it, is one with regard to your children boxing outside school hours, a matter which you can hardly control unless of course the children are hurt so much that it affects their academic standing or impairs their health.\n\nIn regard to the competency of the boxing instructor, there are of course several opinions on that question. If he is teaching physical education, the training would certainly be of benefit to the child, but if he is merely a boxing coach, he may be a successful one but there is no guarantee that the child will benefit.\nThe whole question of health teaching and physical education for the Indian population is under revision right now and I would suggest that before any action is taken on this matter you might discuss it more fully with me when I arrive in British Columbia some time this spring.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nIan Eisenhardt,\nSupervisor of Physical Education & Recreation.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nOTTAWA, March 11, 1950.\n\nMiss A.M.

The Indians, you state, are willing to put up a building if the Department will pay the salary of a teacher. Should they do so the Department will favourably consider their request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nWhen visiting Rossland and Boston Bar Reserves the Indian asked if it were not possible to get a School established at Boothroyds, this school to be kept up by Children from Boston Bar to Kanaka Bar.\n\nThere are no less than 35 small children that they are anxious to send to a day school.\n\nThe Indians say that they will build the school if the Department will pay the teacher.\n\nAgain yesterday I was waited upon by no less than 22 Indians from Boston Bar to Kanaka Bar, urging me to press the matter of establishing a school at Boothroyds, I told them that I was placing the matter before the Department, but I was very emphatic in explaining to them that at the present time there were two day schools in this Agency, which were far from full, and that I had the greatest difficulty in getting the parents to send their children to school, and I felt sure that if we established another school at Boothroyds that the same conditions would prevail there.\n\nI may state here that I have found it impossible to make the parents send their children, so am going to take action under Sect 9 of the Indian Act.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6386, File 804-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nFile No 431268 dated Oct 9th, 1912\n\nHaving reference to my letter of the last inst. and your reply of the above date, I would suggest that the matter of building a school at Boothroyd, or at least the supplying a teacher for a School there, be allowed to stand over until I can more strongly recommend it.\n\nI am perfectly well satisfied that the Indians will build the School, but as for a regular attendance, I will not guarantee.\n\nThere are no doubt plenty of children of all ages, and I impressed upon them the necessity of filling up the Schools that we have at present, and then apply to the Department for an extra School.\n\nThe Indians fully realized this and there and then they promised to send 20 of the older boys to St Georges School Lytton which is more than they can take, they promised to all meet together and decide upon the day on which they would take them up, and out of all of those only two came.\n\nAs soon as I can arrange time I will take another trip down there and see if I cant get some of these boys.\n\nBut I regret to state that there is a very bad feeling amongst the Indians towards Boarding Schools, and I wont send a child to them if they can get out of it.\n\nWill report further on this matter later.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nYour obedient servant.\n\nH.Graham.\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nSir,\n\nWhen the Royal Indian Commission visited this Agency they took up the School matter on each of the Reserves and when they were holding their meeting with the Boothroyd Indians they were asked by the Indians if they could have a day School on the Reserve, and were promised that this matter would receive favorable attention from the Department.\n\nSince that time the Indians have been very busy preparing for this and have now built a School complete to accommodate about 30 children, with two living rooms attached for the Teacher.\n\nThey then wrote to me saying that the School was complete to send down a Teacher.\n\nI visited the Reserve yesterday, and examined the School, which will answer the purpose very well, I then held a meeting with the Indians, who are most anxious to get the School started, they have at least thirty children that should be at School, which they promised they would send.\n\nI explained to them that we always had great difficulty in keeping the attendance of these day Schools up, but they promised me that they would take a petition round to all the parents and get them to sign that they would keep the children at School regularly.\n\nAs the Indians are so anxious to get their children taught, and have gone to the expense and trouble in building the School, I would strongly recommend that the Department sanctions their wish and supplies them with a Teacher.\n\nAs the services of Miss Blachford who so\nsuccessfully started the Lytton Indian Day School, and carried it on for six years, are available, I would recommend that she be appointed teacher.\n\nAs this School will be at a very out of the way place and the Teacher will have to live there, and cook for herself, I think that the salary should be set at $60.00 per month the same as the Shulus School.\n\nTrusting that the Department will give this their earliest and favorable consideration.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 12, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant stating that the Boothroyd Indians have put up a school-house which will accommodate thirty children and have asked for the appointment of a teacher.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may engage the services of Miss Blackford, whom you recommend, to take charge of this school, at a salary of $600.00 a year, which will be $60.00 a month for the ten school months.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have received a letter from Mr. Graham, Indian Agent, Lytton, enclosing copy of letter which he wrote the Department with reference to establishing an Indian day school on the Boothroyd reserve of that Agency.\n\nIt seems to me that in view of the large number of children (30) on that reserve that might attend and that the Indians seem so thoroughly interested in the matter, there is every encouragement to give them what they ask.\n\nI know there is a prejudice in certain quarters against Indian day schools, and I note that my predecessor was not in favour of them (Report 1913, page 508). That there are some good reasons for the disapproval I can readily see, but nevertheless I can also see a very wide field for usefulness in them when the spirit exists to give them a fair trial, and in this case it does seem to exist.\n\nAs for the teacher recommended by the Agent, I have every confidence in the capabilities of Miss Blackford whose work in the day school at Lytton interested\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\nme very much. If any teacher can secure regular attendance and retain the interest of the pupils it is she. She has excellent control and marked ability to impart instruction. Besides, she has the advantage of speaking the Thompson language fluently and is most useful as interpreter. In fact it always seemed to me unfortunate that her services should have been lost to the Department in its work of Indian education.\n\nI have no hesitation in adding my recommendation that the Indians of the Boothroyd reserve be given the school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nOttawa, April 20, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant in reference to the establishment of a school on the Boothroyd Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Agent Graham was informed on the 12th instant that he might engage the services of Miss Blanchford to take charge of this school at a salary of $600.00 a year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. McGraw, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nVernon, B.C.\nWhen the Royal Indian Commission visited this Agency they took up the School matter on each of the Reserves and when they were holding their meeting with the Boothroyd Indians they were asked by the Indians if they could have a day School on the Reserve, and were promised that this matter would receive favorable attention from the Department.\n\nSince that time the Indians have been very busy preparing for this and have now built a School complete to accommodate about 30 children, with two living rooms attached for the Teacher.\n\nThey then wrote to me saying that the School was complete to send down a Teacher.\n\nI visited the Reserve yesterday, and examined the School, which will answer the purpose very well, I then held a meeting with the Indians, who are most anxious to get the School started, they have at least thirty children that should be at School, which they promised they would send.\n\nI explained to them that we always had great difficulty in keeping the attendance of these day Schools up, but they promised me that they would take a petition round to all the parents and get them to sign that they would keep the children at School regularly.\n\nAs the Indians are so anxious to get their children taught, and have gone to the expense and trouble in building the School, I would strongly recommend that the Department sanctions their wish and supplies them with a Teacher.\n\nAs the services of Miss Blanchford who so\nsuccessfully started the Lytton Indian Day School, and carried it on for six years, are available, I would recommend that she be appointed teacher.\n\nAs this School will be at a very out of the way place and the Teacher will have to live there, and cook for herself, I think that the salary should be set at $60.00 per month the same as the Shulus School.\n\nTrusting that the Department will give this their earliest and favorable consideration.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

Ont.\nApril 17th, 1915.\n\nDear Dr. McKenna -\n\nI have the copy of Mr. Graham's letter with your recommendation regarding the appointment of a teacher for the Boothroyd Indians, and in reply would state that on the 12th instant, the Department wrote to Mr. Graham authorizing the appointment of Miss Blanchford, at a salary of $600.00 per annum.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nDr. J. A. J. McKenna,\nP.O. Box 755,\nVictoria, B.C.\nOttawa, August 2, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant enclosing a communication from Miss Blackford, teacher of the Boothroyd Indian Day School, suggesting that the summer holidays for her school be curtailed by two weeks and these added to the winter holidays.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the reasons given, the Department approves of this suggestion being carried out and Miss Blackford may re-open the school two weeks earlier than usual and allow the pupils two weeks extra holidays in the winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nI beg to report that Miss Blackford the Teacher of the Boothroyd Indian Day School has just been in asking for permission to start school two weeks earlier and add those two weeks to the winter holidays.\n\nI asked her to put her request in writing and I would forward to the Department, which she did, and I am now enclosing a copy of her letter.\n\nI would strongly recommend that her suggestion be carried out, as I know what a difficulty some of the children had getting to School last winter, and by having these two weeks extra holidays, will help to get over some of the bad winter weather.\n\nTrusting that I may have an early reply so that if it meets with the Department's approval, Miss Blackford may make arrangements to open the School.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

Graham,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI would like to suggest that the summer holidays of the Boothroyd Indian Day School be curtailed by two weeks, and these be added to the winter holidays.\n\nMy reason for suggesting this is that the Indians are inclined to forget what they learnt, and then it is much easier for them to come to school during the summer weather.\n\nThe parents will have finished their hay-making and the children will be doing nothing, and will be therefore better employed at School.\n\nIf the two weeks taken off the summer holidays were added to the winter holidays it will extend them a little over the bad weather when the snow is so deep and making it difficult for the children to walk the long distances some of them have to come.\n\nI will be obliged if you will place this matter before the Department.\n\nI remain\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sign) Lilly Blanchford.\nOttawa, December 13, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo in regard to the case of Willie Smith, a pupil of the Boothroyd Day School, who was taken to the St. Mary's Mission Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Principal of the St. Mary's Mission Boarding School has been instructed to return this boy to the reserve and you will be good enough to advise the Department as to whether these instructions are carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

The Department cannot sanction his admission to your school and you will be good enough to have him returned to his father as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Secretary\n\nRev. Victor Rohr,\nPrincipal,\nSt. Mary's Mission Boarding School,\nMission City, B.C.\nOttawa, November 3, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, enclosing a copy of a communication which you received from Miss Blanchford, teacher of the Boothroyd Day School, in reference to Willie Smith, one of the pupils who had been taken without the consent of his father and placed in the St. Mary's Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the principal of this school is being instructed to have this boy returned to his home as the Department cannot sanction his admission to the St. Mary's Boarding School.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Secretary\n\nH.

Graham,\nIndian Agent,\nIyton, B.C.,\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nI beg to report that Willie Smith one of my pupils, who was doing very well has been taken away and sent to St. Mary's School at Mission.\n\nI have seen the boy's father (Jimmy Smith) and he says he was never consulted nor has he been asked to sign any admission papers.\n\nHe also said that the boy had been christened by the Roman Catholic Priest without his consent as he is a Protestant and has had his younger children christened in the Anglican Church.\n\nHe would be pleased to have the boy brought back to attend the school here as he was well satisfied with the progress the boy had done during the short time since the school was opened and besides the boy was a help at home after school hours.\n\nHoping you will attend to this matter soon and trusting an early reply.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) Lilly Blackford.\nSir,\n\nMiss Blanchford, teacher of the Boothroyd Day School, has applied to me for permission to take the summer holidays during the month of July only, the remainder of the holidays to be put into the winter holidays and in that way take the whole of January.\n\nOwing to the location of the school and the distance some of the children have to come, it is very difficult for them to attend during the winter and by lengthening the winter holidays it will help to get over the very bad weather during the month of January, besides it is found that the long holidays in the summer time unsettles the children very much for their work. I would therefore recommend that this request be granted.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nHS/MB\n\nIndian Affairs.

She is, therefore, to re-open this school on the first of August, next, and teach till the end of the year, when she can close the school for the month of January and open it again on the first of February, next.

Lytton, B.C., wishes to obtain insurance under the Civil Service Insurance Act. As his name does not appear to be upon the list of contributors to the Retirement Fund or to either of the Superannuation Funds, his eligibility for insurance under the said Act is doubtful. I therefore desire to ascertain, if possible, the nature and tenure of his employment, and I would ask you to be good enough to say under what authority he received his appointment to your department and whether his services will be retained so long as they prove satisfactory, in order that I may know whether he is eligible for the insurance desired.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent of Insurance\n\nIndian Affairs.

This will make her salary from that date at the rate of $95 per teaching month. We are informing Mr. Agent Graham, Lytton, accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. R. L.

(RG 10, Volume 6386, File 804-1, part 1)\nExtract from Report of Inspector Cairns on the\nBoothroyd Indian Day School - dated July 6th, 1926.\n\nMiss Lilly Blachford\n$900.00 per annum.\nHas taught 17 years in an Indian school.\nDoing efficient work; pupils making progress.\n\nHaving in view the long and faithful service of\nthe teacher also due to the fact that the homes are\nvisited especially when there is sickness, I would\nrecommend that the teacher's salary be increased by the\nsum of $50.00.\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to that portion of your report on the Boothroyd Indian Day School, dated July 17th, last, in which you recommend that the salary of Miss Lilly Blachford be increased.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the Department cannot favourably consider this recommendation at the present time. The incumbent at this school has a high school entrance standing only, and the Department considers her salary is quite adequate for a teacher with her qualifications. I wish to assure you, however, that the faithful and efficient service of Miss Blachford is not overlooked. You will remember that in the last three and a half years her salary has been increased from $600 to $750, plus the bonus allowed by law. If this teacher continues in our employ, consideration will be given to an increase at a later date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. H. Cairns, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nRoom 402, Holden Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the BOOTHROYD DAY SCHOOL, dated July 17, 1923.\n\nMiss Lilly Blackford has given long and faithful service as a teacher in our Indian schools. The location of this school is isolated. There are not many teachers who would stay here more than a year. She plods on year after year doing faithful work. I would, therefore respectfully recommend that her salary be increased to $800.00 per annum, the increase to become effective October 1, 1923.\n\nR. H. Cairns,\nInsp.\nOTTAWA, September 11th, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that, in view of the excellent report that has been received from Mr. Inspector Cairns regarding the work being performed by Miss Lilly Blanchford, teacher of the Boothroyd Indian Day School, and upon his recommendation, it has been decided to increase her salary from October 1, 1922, by $50.00 per annum. She will also be entitled to any bonus provided by law. This will allow Miss Blanchford a salary at the rate of $750 per annum from that date.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will inform her of the increase in salary granted her.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH.

This will make her salary from that date at the rate of $750 per annum. She will also be entitled to any bonus provided by law.\n\nWe are informing Mr. Agent Graham, Lytton, accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. H.

The usual subjects are taken up. All manual work is good.\n\nMiss Blanchford is persistent and progressive in her work.\n\nThe teacher does good work. She visits the homes and aids in case of sickness. She speaks the native language fluently. She consults with Doctor Fort, the Medical Health Officer who resides at Hytton.\n\nI would respectfully recommend that the teacher's salary be increased $50.00 per annum, to begin October 1, 1922. This will bring her in line with many other teachers. We put a new teacher on at $750 at Katzle recently.\nOttawa, June 23, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that, in view of the favourable reports regarding the work that Miss Blachford, teacher of the Boothroyd Indian Day School, is performing in the class-room and in the Indians' homes, it has been decided to increase her salary by $100.00 per annum from the first of April last. She is at present receiving a salary of $600.00 and this increase will make her salary at the rate of $700.00 per annum from the above date.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform Miss Blachford accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. MacKenzie,\n\nReplying to your inquiry as to the salaries paid in British Columbia to teachers in schools of the same class as the Boothroyd Indian Day School I beg to say that they run from $600.00 to $900.00 per annum.\n\nMiss Blachford has no teacher's certificate, but her twelve years experience in Indian schools and the success with which she has met in her work would entitle her to an increase, as recommended by the Accountant. The Inspector speaks in high terms of her work.\n\nThe following will give an idea of the salaries paid at some of the schools in British Columbia:\n\n| School       | Enrolment | Salary |\n|--------------|-----------|--------|\n| Cape Mudge   | 14        | $700.00|\n| Chehalis     | 35        | $750.00|\n| Homalco      | 33        | $700.00|\n| Katzie       | 19        | $800.00|\n| Ucluelet     | 19        | $750.00|\n| Kitkatla     | 34        | $900.00|\n| Lakalsap     | 45        | $900.00|\n| Metlakatla   | 39        | $900.00|\n| Roche Deboile| 24        | $900.00|\n| Skidegate    | 30        | $900.00|\n| Skwah        | 23        | $900.00|\n\nThe majority of the teachers receive $600.00 per annum, but I think that, in the case of Miss Blachford, the Department would be justified in granting her an increase of $100.00, which would make her salary at the rate of $700.00 per annum.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nMEMO:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nI wish to bring to your attention the case of Miss Lilly Blanchford, Teacher, Boothroyd Indian Day School, Lytton Agency. Mr. Graham, the Indian Agent, has forwarded Miss Blanchford's isolation as head of a household, in which she states she is the sole support of her father, 64 years of age, and two nephews aged 12 and 14 years respectively. She has been teaching Indian schools for 12 years and her salary is only $600.00.\n\nMr. Cairns, School Inspector, reports that Miss Blanchford is doing good and faithful work in the classroom; the pupils are making progress; they read remarkably well, spelling is accurate, knowledge of history of British Columbia is quite extensive, geography, composition, arithmetic and hygiene are receiving attention and the pupils write neatly and legibly. Order, cleanliness and discipline are satisfactory.\n\nMiss Blanchford speaks the Indian language fluently and visits the homes of the people being especially faithful in time of illness, using simple remedies and administering some medicines. She also teaches the women and girls cooking and sewing.\n\nIn view of the foregoing I would suggest that Miss Blanchford's salary be increased instead of increasing her bonus. All school teachers receive a bonus of $150.00 each with the exception of Miss Moffitt, Cape Croker, who is paid $252.00.\n\nOttawa, June 17, 1920.\n\nChief Accountant.\nOttawa, July 8, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, and in reply I beg to inform you that the teacher of the Boothroyd Indian Day School may keep this school open during the month of July while the Indians are on the reserve, and the school can be closed for summer holidays during the months of August and September.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform the teacher and the Indian parents accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nSir,\n\nMiss L. Blachford, the Teacher at the Boothroyd Indian Day School, has written me asking if the Department would consider an advance of $500.00 on her salary, which she would pay back in three years, at 6% interest.\n\nShe needs this money to help in building another home, and purchasing enough furniture to live in it. Miss Blachford lost practically everything she possessed in the fire last September. She took years planning and saving to build her house and to furnish it, and when she was away on her vacation last fall it was burned at the same time so much of Lytton was destroyed. If she had been at home she could have saved a good portion of her furniture, but with such a close burning and everybody trying to save their own property, hers was absolutely cleaned up. She had some insurance but not sufficient to build again, as the rate of insurance is high in Lytton, too high for her to be able to afford more insurance.\n\nShe thinks if she could get this loan she could pay it back at the rate of $200.00 a year, one hundred on her June cheque and one hundred from her December quarter cheque, each year for the three years, together with interest at 6%.\n\nI advised her that I would place the matter before you although I could not give her any encouragement that she would get it.\n\nLumber is a way down in price at present and it would take much less to build right now than it may later on, which is why she would like to have a loan. If possible, I would like to see her get this help, or there might be some other way you could assist her.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A. strang)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nAS/MD\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, regarding the request of Miss L. Blachford, teacher of the Boothroyd Indian Day School, for an advance of $500 on her salary, which she would pay back in three years' time at 6% interest.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the regulations do not permit the making of a loan by an advance on salary, and I regret, therefore, that it will not be possible to comply with Miss Blachford's request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. Strang, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nOttawa,\nMarch 11, 1940.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 9th instant in which you advise the Department of the death of Miss Lily Blachford, teacher of the Boothroyd Indian Day School.\n\nIf the Church authorities recommend the transfer of Miss Aylwin from Shulus to Boothroyd salary will be allowed her at the Boothroyd School at the same rate as was allowed the late Miss Blachford; namely, $950.00 a year.\n\nIn the case of the new teacher, however, whether appointed to the Boothroyd or Shulus School, salary will only be allowed at the rate of $850.00 a year.\n\nWith regard to the janitor services I find that we have been allowing $50.00 a year at Boothroyd and $30.00 a year at Shulus. This is an old arrangement made some years ago and I cannot see any reason for there being any difference in the amount allowed at the two schools. Possibly it would be fairer to allow in future $40.00 at each of them. This would not increase the total expenditure. Please let me have your opinion regarding this suggestion.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMarch 9, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. Indian Agent Strang will no doubt have informed the Department of the death of Miss Lily Blachford, teacher at Boothroyd Indian Day School. Miss Blachford became ill in January and went to Kamloops for treatment. She was subsequently moved to St. Paul's Hospital, Vancouver, where she died on March 1st.\n\nMiss Blachford did good work for the Department; she was intensely interested in the Indian people and greatly devoted as teacher to the pupils under her charge. She will be greatly missed by the children of the Boothroyd School and by the Indian people of the central sections of the Agency who knew her well and regarded her work highly.\n\nI have been informed that Miss Edith Aylwin, teacher at Shulus Indian Day School, might possibly consider a transfer to Boothroyd. The Church authorities have the matter of a nomination for Boothroyd in hand and should Miss Aylwin decide on a transfer to Boothroyd, the new nominee would be available for Shulus.\n\nIn the event of Miss Aylwin going to Boothroyd, what would her salary be there and what would be the rate of pay for a new teacher at Shulus? It is understood that an amount is provided for janitor service at these schools and I should appreciate being informed what this amount is in each case.\n\nAn early reply would be appreciated.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nMarch 4, 1940.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo in which you advise that Miss Lily Blachford will be unable to return to duties as teacher of the Boothroyd School for several months.\n\nIt is noted that you are in communication with the Church authorities in order to have them nominate a qualified teacher to take charge of the school during Miss Blachford's absence. Please let me know the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated by them.\n\nThe salary schedule of teachers of Indian day schools has recently been reviewed by the Minister's office and the opinion has been expressed that our salaries are higher than those paid in rural white schools. Miss Blachford has been in our employ for several years and her salary was increased until it reached the amount of $950.00 a year. However, for the substitute teacher we will only be able to allow payment at the rate of $650.00. It is hoped that you will be able to obtain the nomination of a teacher for this school at an early date so as to have the school re-opened as soon as possible.\n\nI enclose staff questionnaire which you should have the new teacher complete and return.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nMarch 4, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Boothroyd Indian Day School No. 804\n\nI understand that salary has been paid to Miss Lily Blanford, teacher of the above-mentioned school, to February 29, 1940.\n\nNo further payment should be made to this teacher until you are further advised.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of February 12th, I beg to advise that Miss Lily Blachford, teacher at the Boothroyd Indian Day School, will be unable to resume her duties for some considerable period. Recent reports would indicate that Miss Blachford is quite ill and her return to Boothroyd as teacher in less than six months is highly improbable.\n\nIn view of the good work done by Miss Blachford at Boothroyd it has been suggested that she be granted leave of absence without pay for the balance of the current school year, and I should like to recommend that such action be taken.\n\nThis school is kept open during the months of July and August, the usual vacation being taken in September and January. Ordinarily, therefore, this school would have six months to go before the first vacation period in September and it is important that a suitable teacher be secured to replace Miss Blachford at the earliest possible date. Inspector Barry is due here tomorrow when the question of a teacher for Boothroyd will be discussed and referred to the Church authorities concerned for a nomination.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 12, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn view of the information contained in Inspector Barry's letter of the 30th ultimo which you forwarded to the Department under cover of your letter of the 5th instant it is agreed that it is unnecessary to engage a substitute teacher for Miss L. Blanchford. If, however, Miss Blanchford is unable to resume duties before the end of February this office should be immediately advised.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:-\n\nI am enclosing herewith letter dated 30th January from Mr. Indian Agent Strang, of the Lytton Agency, advising that Miss L. Blanchford, is absent from her teaching position at Boothroyd Indian Day School, together with a report dated the 5th instant from Mr. Inspector Barry.\n\nCapt. Barry recommends that the School be closed during her absence as it is impossible to fill the temporary vacancy, with which recommendation I concur.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nLytton, B.C.,\nJanuary 30, 1940.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nIn reference to your letter of January 27th I beg to advise that Miss Blachford entered the hospital in Kamloops on about the 21st or 22nd of this month I believe. The Burris Clinic of Kamloops wrote me on the 22nd advising that Miss Blachford had asked them to tell me she would be off work for a month.\n\nThe month of January is taken as vacation period instead of during the summer months at Boothroyd school and it will mean that Miss Blachford will only be absent from the school for three weeks of February and I am sure that she will not be absent more than the month,- probably not as long because she is very interested in her work and is anxious to move into the new building as soon as possible.\n\nI would not recommend a substitute be employed during Miss Blachford's absence because there are no facilities for living accommodation at Boothroyd and Miss Blachford's personal belongings are all in her living quarters in the old school. As mentioned in my previous letter, Miss Blachford will, in all probability, make up for the time lost by working a day or so here and there during the remainder of the term.\n\nI trust this recommendation will meet with your approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"A. Strang.\"\nIndian Agent.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nP.O.Box 444,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nFebruary 5th 1940.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI have read a letter 14-1-1936 dated January 30th 1940 from Mr. Indian Agent Strang in which he explains the necessary absence of Miss Blackford, teacher of the Boothroyd Indian Day School, Lytton Agency, from her school.\n\nDuring July and August this school is kept open and the usual vacation period taken in September and January. In September the Indians are away from the local Indian Reserves and in January the snow is as a rule so deep that the little children are unable to attend school.\n\nI agree with the Indian Agent that it would be almost impossible to arrange for the accommodation of a substitute teacher.\n\nI may add that in any case it would be impossible to obtain an Anglican substitute at the present time. I have no such teachers on my list and am quite unable to locate any to fill the vacancies existing in the northern part of the Province. I would therefore recommend that the Boothroyd Indian Day School be closed as suggested by Mr. Indian Agent Strang.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nSir:-\n\nI have a request from Miss Blachford, teacher at Boothroyd Indian day school, that her salary cheques for the months of July and August be forwarded to her not later than August 28th as she wishes to leave soon after that date for her annual vacation. As this teacher has rather limited means it would be appreciated if her request could be acceded to.\n\nOwing to climatic conditions the Boothroyd school is operated during the summer months and closes instead, September and January.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Watson, Registrar of the Dept. of Education, Victoria. The former says, \"you would not have cause, I am sure, to regret appointing him as teacher.\"\n\nThe latter says, \"Mr. F.R. Shenstone of Duncan is a University graduate, and has had some experience as a teacher in schools under the provision of this department. The greater part of his experience has been in High Schools where his work was entirely satisfactory. His last appointment was in the Little Qualicum Elementary School, a position which he was obliged to give up because of ill-health. I am of the opinion that Mr. Shenstone will give satisfactory service.\"\n\nI am writing to Mr. Shenstone, telling him that I am nominating him for the position of teacher at Boothroyd School. In a letter to Captain Barry, a copy of which he forwarded to me, he says, \"If you consider my application favourably, I would be glad to have some details as to accommodation at Boothroyd, the salary paid, and any essential facts.

Canon Bushe has now submitted the names of two teachers for the position and these will be placed before Inspector Barry when he returns to this office on the 10th instant for his recommendation, which I consider desirable in view of the fact that one of the nominees was adversely reported on by him a few months ago.\n\nThe Department is aware that the residence section of the new school at Boothroyd is unfurnished. The late Miss Blachford owned the furniture in the old school and this was removed by her heirs, following her death. It is most likely that some assistance will have to be given by the Department to furnish the teacher's quarters at Boothroyd, and I should appreciate authority to purchase plain furniture and kitchenware up to an amount of $200 for this purpose. This was the amount authorized in the case of Bella Bella and Pemberton and was found to be sufficient. I should like to have the Department's decision in this respect at an early date.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M.

Apart from his high school activities he assisted the cub master of the cathedral pack, and whilst in Victoria attending Normal he has been cub master of a pack there.

Lidstone, 2708 Thompson Avenue, Victoria, B.C.\nMiss Phyllis Arrowsmith, Kingcome Inlet, B.C.\n\nI discussed these nominations with Inspector Barry who informed me that Miss Arrowsmith, at present our teacher at Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School, is being recommended by Bishop Rix for one of the northern schools, and that he considers this would be a much more suitable and satisfactory arrangement than her transfer to Boothroyd. Under these circumstances I would recommend that the Department favorably consider the appointment of Mr. Lidstone to the position. If Mr. Lidstone is appointed, he will arrange for his mother, who is a widow, to live with him at the school.\n\nCopies of letters from Canon Bushe nominating the aforementioned are attached.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

It is understood that this appointment will be for the coming academic year as it does not appear necessary to re-open this school for the balance of the current month.\n\nUnless I hear from you to the contrary the Department will consider that Mr. Lidstone's appointment dates from October 1, 1940.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D.

However, it is difficult to understand why Mr. Barry considers it preferable to send a female teacher to a place which is too isolated for a male teacher. It would appear that the better course to take would be to appoint someone in Mr. Lidstone's place. It is unlikely that he will be a very successful teacher when Mr. Barry's report shows that he has not sufficient energy to purchase in advance the food which he will himself require.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Lidstone, teacher of the Boothroyd Indian Day School, is $85.00 a teaching month. From this is deducted 2% National Defence tax as it is presumed Mr. Lidstone is unmarried. In addition 5% is deducted from the salary of every teacher appointed since September 1, 1939. This amount is funded, interest allowed, and when Mr. Lidstone leaves our service it will be refunded to him. You will note that the above means a deduction of 7% from $85.00 which leaves the net amount $79.05.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. A.

Lidstone, teacher at the Boothroyd Indian Day School, which is self explanatory.\n\nMr. Lidstone, being on the strength of the Canadian Militia need only attend the two weeks training period this year from May 17th to 31st whereas if he should allow himself to be taken off the strength of the Militia, he would be subject to a call for the four months compulsory training at any time, which would seriously interfere with his teaching at Boothroyd School. In view of this and the time being so short, I am taking the liberty of notifying Mr. Lidstone that he should attend the training period with his Company during May 17th to 31st and that he can keep school open the first two weeks in July to make up for the time so lost.\n\nI trust the Department will approve of my action in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

In which situation I should have to miss one month of school at the least.\n\nIt would, I think, be more convenient both for myself and for the school if I could attend the May camp. If you think I should take the time off in May, would you be kind enough to ask the Department for a leave of absence for that period. If, however, you would rather I waited and took the compulsory training, I would be glad to.\n\nI have to make my decision known to the Major by Tuesday, however, so that if leave is impossible or if you would rather I did not take the time off in May, would you please telephone Kamloops 738 (collect) and I will ask him to strike my name off the camp role.\n\nVery sorry to have taken up so much of your time with such an irregular request.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nJohn F.

As my decision had to be made by return wire I had to decide without consulting you.\n\nI must say I enjoyed teaching at Boothroyd and would recommend the school to any other teacher who may be considering the position.\n\nWould you mind if I spent a night at the school in the near future in order to ship my belongings home? I would also like to pay the girls who are caring for the garden at that time. If Mr. Garland has forwarded you the other school key would you mind if I kept mine until after I have visited the school?\n\nIf you have any difficulty in finding a teacher, I would be only too glad to help you locate one.

She desires to continue teaching at the School, and, when married, would live at the School house during the week and spend the week ends at the airport house, where her husband would be compelled to live.\n\nWe have been given to understand that it is the rule of the Indian Department that married teachers should not be employed to teach in the Indian Schools. If this is indeed so, we would like to suggest that in the case of Mrs. Raison, who is indeed an excellent teacher, and under the present war conditions of a scarcity of teachers, that an exception to this rule should be made and that Mrs. Raison should be allowed to continue teaching in the Boothroyd School.\n\nTrusting that you will be able to give this suggestion your favourable consideration.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n\"Frederick Cariboo\".\n\nC O P Y\nLYTTON, B.C. January 27, 1944.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nP.O. Box 70,\n\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nVANCOUVER, B.C\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a communication addressed to your with respect to Mrs. W. Raison, teacher of the Boothroyd Indian Day School.\n\nFrom personal observation I find that Mrs. Raison is a very good teacher and well thought of by the children and their parents. She has excellent reports from the School Inspector on her capabilities as a teacher. The fact of Mrs. Raison's intended marriage should in no way interfere with her duties as a teacher, but should prove a benefit as her intended husband who is in charge of the emergency air port some two and a half miles distant is very friendly with the Indians and has often proved of great assistance when her forced isolation has been a source of inconvenience.\n\nA. Strang,\nIndian Agent.\n\nMM.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMrs. W. Raison, teacher of the Boothroyd Indian Day School, has advised Mr. Indian Agent Strang that she intends to get married at an early date and has asked that she be continued as teacher at the Boothroyd School following her marriage. A copy of a letter from Mr. Indian Agent Strang and also a copy of a letter from the Right Reverend Frederick Stanford, Bishop of Cariboo, relating to this matter are enclosed.\n\nIn view of the shortage of teachers and that Mrs. Raison's work at the Boothroyd School has been very satisfactory, I would recommend that her services be retained until the close of the war or until such time as circumstances require that a change be made.\n\nD.M.

Strang, Indian Agent, Lytton, B.C.\n\nWe have just received Mr. McArthur's report regarding his inspection of the Boothroyd School on March 17. On that date there were only six children present. In view of the shortage of teachers the Department considers that it is not advisable to operate a school for such a small number of children. Are all the children of school age enrolled and, if not, what steps have been taken to have them enrolled and at the same time have them attend the school regularly? What are the prospects of additional attendance at this school in the very near future? An immediate, complete report would be appreciated, in order that the Department can decide what action should be taken for the academic year 1944-45.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nBoothroyd Indian Day School,\nLYTTON, B.C.,\nMarch 28, 1944.\n\nThe Indian Agent,\nLyttton, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Strang:\n\nI have just received my Inspector's report on his visit to the above School last Friday March 17th.\n\nThere is one sentence to which I would like to draw your attention: \"No cooking in being taught\". \"I consider this regrettable\". I feel that this remark deserves some explanation.\n\nThe girls of this School have always been taught cooking until this year. At present, only two have not done any actual cooking because I feel they are too young, being only ten years old and in the junior grades, they have time yet to do what cooking is expected of them.\n\nI have taken up fully, every health and nutrition and various projects with the boys and girls in an indirect way every day. They enjoy these talks and when filling in their daily health books for the Junior Red Cross I find that they are living very well. When visiting their homes I find that they are drinking milk from cows instead of from cans, eating lots of vegetables and fruit, both canned and raw apples, and fresh laid eggs as they all keep hens, fish and plenty of bread, bacon and stews etc.\n\nI can assure you a day in our School is a busy one - not a moment is lost from the time the Union Jack is hoisted in the morning at 8:45 A.M. until taken down at 4 P.M. As closely as possible I follow the B.C. Course of Study. The children love their School, keep it clean, and together we all keep everything in repair.\n\nI hope I have explained to you as I am afraid the above sentence might cause a little misunderstanding which I would not like to happen as my work in the School is conscientiously carried out.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"Winnifred E. Raison\"\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, CANADA.\n\nDepartment File No.: 165-26-1\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Departmental letter of the 29th ultimo with reference to the small number of children attending to the Boothroyd Indian Day School. In this connection I wish to report that there are seven children registered and attending school regularly, exceptions being only in the case of sickness as was the situation when the Inspector visited the school on March 17th, one child being home, sick. At the present time, all available children of school age are enrolled. However, there will be an addition of four beginning at the opening of the next academic year, making a total of eleven. It is expected that the enrollment will increase when the families return to the Reserve, many of them now being engaged in essential war industries away from the Reserve.\n\nA.

We did not expect to get any more than the one month's cheque for September quarter.\n\nThe letter to Mr. Graham mentioned above was destroyed when the Office was burnt, so I cannot give either the number or the date, as it was several years ago.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A. Strang)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to my letter of the September 29th, in reply to yours of the 23rd, I beg to say that I saw Miss Blachford, who has now returned from her vacation. She says that she only received two months pay or $190.00 for the March quarter, and thought she would get two months for the September quarter. She says that this was done in 1930, and she thought she was being paid the same way this year. She says the Department owes her for one month's pay or $95.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A. Strang)\nIndian Agent.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nAS/HD\nOttawa, October 14th, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your 10289-01-2 of the 5th instant, with reference to the payments of salary made to Miss Blachford, teacher of the Boothroyd Indian Day School. For your information, the following statement is given regarding payments during the school years 1929-30 and 1930-31:\n\nDecember quarter, 1929 - $285.\nMarch quarter, 1930 - 190.\nJune quarter, 1930 - 285.\nSeptember quarter, 1930 - 190.\n\nTotal for school year 1929-30 (10 months @ $95 per month) - $950.\n\nDecember quarter, 1930 - $285.\nMarch quarter, 1931 - 285.\nJune quarter, 1931 - 285.\nSeptember quarter, 1931 - 95.\n\nTotal for school year 1930-31 (10 months @ $95 per month) - $950.\n\nThe Department regrets that an error was made in March and that the teacher was overpaid one month's salary at that time. Our records distinctly show this and Miss Blachford must have forgotten the amount of the cheque which she received at that time. You will, also, see from the above statement that, during the school year 1929-30, two months' salary was paid for the March quarter and two months for September. There is, therefore, no further balance due Miss Blachford for the last school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Strang, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of October 14th, in reference to Miss L. Blachford's salary, which she thought had not all been paid to her.\n\nI showed Miss Blachford your letter and she said of course she must have been mistaken, but as she lost her home and about everything she had in the Lytton fire, probably owing to excitement and worry she got mixed up.\n\nShe says she would be very much obliged if you could arrange to pay her the same as you did in 1930, namely, two months salary in March quarter, and two months in September, which would make it much easier for her. It makes it bad to only get one month's salary in the September quarter as she needs the money for two months during her vacation.\n\nShe also made the suggestion that it would make it much easier for teachers if they were paid the same as other employees, that is once a month, instead of every three months. In her case she has groceries to pay for, and the storekeepers don't like waiting the three months for their pay. The other teachers are of the same opinion.\n\nI would like to suggest that her idea be given consideration.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

(Cont'd)\n\n7. SCHOOLS:\n\nI visited the Day School at Boston Bar, under the teacher, Miss Blatchford, on the 20th June. There were 19 children in the school at the time of my visit, out of a roll of 21. I found the children in this school speaking up well, and seemed alert and intelligent. Both the higher and lower grades read very well and seemed to understand what they were reading. The children also gave me a demonstration in arithmetic which was quite good. I think this little school is a credit to Miss Blatchford. A new school house is very badly wanted. I should take it to be a very old place. The foundations have gone, and so has the floor. I do not think, therefore, that it is worth patching up. I might also add that Miss Blatchford informs me that there are three additional pupils who will be ready for her in the fall.\nOttawa, October 16, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 6th instant, I have to say that you may incur an expenditure of approximately $1.95 in the purchase of one roll of rubberoid roofing to repair the roof of the Bootthroyd Indian Day School.

The teacher's chair is just as useless.\n\nTo aid various officials of the Department I am listing the actual desks required:\n\nCrown School Single made in Vancouver:\nNo. 4 1 only Front 2 Desk Sections 1 only Rear\nNo. 2 2 only Fronts 2 Desk Sections 2 only Rears\nNo. 2 1 only Front 2 Desk Sections 1 only Rear\n\nIn addition one only teacher's chair.\n\nA new school, to include a schoolroom to take up to thirty children, a teacher's kitchen, bed room, and living room, and a small room to be used as a store for Departmental Drugs and Dispensary, is so urgently necessary that it is quite impossible for me to urge its construction in the proper manner without the use of words which the Department may consider exaggerated. May I suggest reference to previous reports.\n\nWhether a new school is built this next summer or not may I ask that the desks recommended above be provided. These desks should then be fixed in four short rows on the usual strips of wood. Accommodation will then be provided for the sixteen children likely to attend here in the near future, provided the school itself does not fall down. It will be remembered that the present school was never intended for such a use when erected. The views of the Indians expressed to me last year after my inspection of the school were given on Page 4 of my report forwarded on March 22nd 1937.\n\nLytton, B.C.\nFebruary 18, 1938.\n\n(Sgd.)

(RG 10, Volume 6386, File 804-5, part 2)\nIn my last report I urged the erection of a new school here. Such a school should contain a shoolroom to take up to thirty children, a vocational room which need not be large, a small room to be used as a store for Departmental drugs and a dispensary, and sufficient accommodation for a teacher and friend. This latter might well consist of a combined kitchen and living room, a bath room, and two small bed rooms.\n\nIt is impossible to exaggerate the importance of such a school at this point. The Indians are not anxious to send their children to St. George's Indian Residential School, and with a well equipped school here there would be no need to send any but the exceptional child to Lytton.\n\nMany hundreds of American visitors to B.C. pass the present school yearly as it is located in the Fraser canyon and only a few yards from the main highway.\n\nThere are at the moment several buildings of a temporary nature on the Boothroyd emergency aerodrome or landing field. I am informed that these buildings will not be required. They were erected to house those who cleared the field. Some of the buildings are so constructed that they can easily be taken apart and moved. This aerodrome is within three miles of our Indian school.\n\nMay I suggest that the Department of National Defence be approached with a view to our being given the material from the unwanted buildings.\n\nWith such material and sufficient funds to pay for removal to the school site and reerection, it would not be difficult for the Indian Agent to arrange for local Indian labour to be paid for at a fair rate. Some large windows would be required. The Indians could do the work in connection with the erection of a school if supervised by one good carpenter, \"white\". I do not believe that such a school would cost in excess of say three thousand dollars.\n\nThe material which I understand is available at the neighbouring aerodrome might under certain conditions be used in the erection of an Indian school. I have seen the aerodrome only from the road. There appear to be a number of hutments. I know that it will be difficult to obtain funds to dismantle any huts which we may be given, transport the material to the Boothroyd school site, and re-erect as a school. Some large windows would also be required. I believe however that it is my duty to bring to the attention of the Department the possibility of having a new school at Boothroyd at little more than the cost of the Indian labour and the wages of possibly one \"white\" carpenter to oversee the work.\nThere is no need for an expensive school such as that lately erected at Port Simpson, just a simple school building with accommodation for a resident teacher and possibly a small vocational room and a dispensary is all that is required.\n\nShould such a school as I have described be approved, the present small water tank located on the hill at the back of the school and fed by a small stream might well be greatly enlarged. No doubt one of the engineers could make the necessary survey report when again in that neighbourhood.\n\nAny new tank should be sufficiently large to provide for the irrigation of the school garden by means of a garden hose, and to make sufficient water available in case of a small bush fire to protect the school buildings.\n\nIn forwarding the Inspector's Report, the Indian Commissioner MacKay writes as follows:\n\nThe buildings referred to by the Inspector in the paragraph \"General Remarks\" on page 3, are located at the Boothroyd emergency landing field, a few miles west of the Boothroyd Indian Day School. The buildings were used to house the men working in connection with the preparation and clearing of the emergency landing field, and are in good condition.\n\nThe Department might make enquiries regarding these buildings and, if they are no longer required in connection with the aeroplane field, they should, if possible, be secured for the Indians so they can be dismantled and the material used for improving Indian dwellings and also in the construction of a new school at Boothroyd should same be approved.\nI found the pupils here, too, under Miss Blatchford, very busy preparing work for exhibit. Some very creditable work had been prepared. As they were so busy in this way, I had no opportunity to hear or see them at school work proper.\n\nThis school building badly wants repair; unless a new building is contemplated immediately. Some $600.00 could probably cover the cost of this. One thing that should be forwarded immediately is a chair for the teacher, Miss Blatchford. The awful old one she has got now, is impossible to use further.\n\nI found, too that the children under her direction had planted a very creditable garden. They were all clean, neat, well dressed and appeared happy. There always seems to be a very happy atmosphere at this small day school.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Geo. S. Pragnell)\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. W. M. BAILEY:\n\nThe Boothroyd Indian Day School is located on the Boothroyd Indian Reserve, which borders the highway through the Fraser canyon. It is approximately 20 miles west of Lytton, B. C. Indian Commissioner MacKay, Vancouver, B. C., has advised us that there are a number of empty buildings at the Boothroyd emergency landing field, a few miles west of the Boothroyd Indian Day School. These buildings were erected by the Department of National Defence to house the foreman working in connection with the preparing and clearing of the emergency landing field and are in good condition. At the present time they are not in use.\n\nCommissioner MacKay believes that, if we could secure these buildings, they could easily be moved to the Boothroyd reserve and used for the erection of a new school, which is badly needed, and also for repairing the houses of the Indians on the Boothroyd reserve.\n\nI should appreciate it if you would take up the matter with the Salvage Officer and advise me if there is any likelihood of our being able to secure the buildings mentioned.\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Director.\nOttawa, July 21, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of Inspector Barry's report regarding his visit to the Boothroyd Indian Day School on the 14th ultimo. The reference to the buildings on the Boothroyd emergency landing field has been noted and we are communicating with the Salvage Officer with a view to ascertaining if these buildings can be obtained.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division\n\nMajor D.

In this connection I beg to advise that Mr. Indian Agent Strang has been instructed to arrange for the dismantling of the buildings allotted to us and the removal of the materials to the Boothroyd Indian Day School, for use when authorization is obtained for the construction of a new school there, and to other points in the Lytton Agency where the materials can be used for repairs and improvements to Indian homes and farm buildings.\n\nIn connection with the work of dismantling the buildings and removal of materials, I have authorized an expenditure of $50.00 for food supplies for Indians engaged on the work and $40.00 for transportation of materials by truck to various points in the Lytton Agency.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

(RG 10, Volume 6386, File 804-5, part 3)\nLYTTON, B.C., January 18, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRelative to your letter of January 11th, file #15/7/7517 with copy of Departmental letter enclosed, regarding the proposed new school at Boothroyd, I here-with enclose a rough plan together with a list of material required in excess of lumber from the Landing Field, and approximate prices thereof, with cost of supervision and Indian labour, amounting to $1,878.80. These figures were quoted by Mr. Dawson Claperton, carpenter of Lytton, who drew up the plans. Mr. Claperton states that he would undertake to construct the building for the sum of $920.00 for labour providing the Indians would take down the old school building and excavate the basement for the new school. This, of course, would cut out the $800.00 shown on the list for supervision and Indian labour.\n\nI had a talk with the Indians and endeavoured to have them give their labour gratis but they refused and said they wouldn't work for less than $1.50 per day. The school could be built by Indian labour but I believe it would be cheaper in the end to have it constructed by a qualified white carpenter.\n\nA full-size basement would be an advantage as apart from space for the heating system it would be an ideal place for the children to play during inclement weather. A dirt floor would be quite alright. I am probably get the Indians to dismantle the old school building and excavate for the new school, for the use of lumber from the old school. The basement would not be hard to excavate as the ground is chiefly sand and gravel.\n\nInstallation of a furnace would be extra but need not cost more than $75.00 as I would suggest installing an old time \"drum heater\" incased in concrete and brick with a steel top carrying the hot air pipes, with the cold air pipes let in near the base. I have seen such a heater installed and it has proved very effective. I am sure one would answer the purpose in this case.\n\nThe erection of the school could start immediately providing the present weather conditions continue.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Strang,\nIndian Agent.\n\nD.M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nAS/S\nEncl.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6386, File 804-5, part 3)\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant with reference to the expenditure that will be necessary to replace the Boothroyd Indian day school.\n\nInspector Barry's report of his inspection of the Boothroyd Indian day school on June 14, 1938, read, in part, as follows:\n\n\"I believe, however, that it is my duty to bring to the attention of the Department the possibility of having a new school at Boothroyd at little more than the cost of Indian labour and the wages of possibly one white carpenter to oversee the work.\"\n\nWith the above in mind, and the further fact that we had secured the lumber from the aerodrome, I wrote to you on the 3rd ultimo. However, it is noted from your recent letter that the lumber secured from the aerodrome was only of minor value and that materials amounting to approximately $1000.00 would be required. It is further noted that you estimate the total cost of the building at approximately $3000.00.\n\nAt the present time I am not in a position to state whether or not this amount of money will be available in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1939-40. However, the matter will be kept in mind and if funds can be secured you will be later advised.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Your File 165-26-5.\n\nI wish to refer to Mr. Hoey's letter of January 23rd regarding the proposed new Day School at Boothroyd. In this connection I have now before me a report from Mr. Indian Agent Strang giving an estimate of $1878.80 for materials and labor required to build a school along the lines of a sketch submitted by him and using the salvaged materials from the Boothroyd Landing Field. Should a white carpenter be employed to build the school, the cost, from the information supplied by Mr. Strang, would be $2058. I am forwarding herewith a copy of Mr. Strang's letter together with the sketch referred to.\n\nThe sketch and information supplied by the Agent were discussed with Inspector Barry who considers that a school, but with full basement, along the lines of the Provincial Day School built at Sechelt, a plan of which was forwarded to you with my letter of December 25th, file 15/3/7339, would be more suitable than the building proposed by Mr. Strang.\n\nThe materials salvaged from the landing field are mostly rough, undressed pieces of fir lumber, six light sash, usually used in small cabins, barns and casements, and plain V-joint fir doors. The total value of what is available for the school would not exceed $200 and could be used for the framework of the building. Cement, nails, window and door frames, flooring, outside dressed lumber, shingles and a limited quantity of undressed lumber are required to build a new school. Such a school should be large enough for 30 pupils and might be laid out along the lines suggested by Capt. Barry on page 3 of his report on his inspection of the Boothroyd School, dated November 3, 1938.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy . . . .\nMy opinion is that the plan of the Provincial School at Sechelt would, with some slight changes, meet our requirements at Boothroyd. A full basement with cement floor and the usual wood burning furnace should be provided. I do not agree with Mr. Strang that a dirt floor in the basement would be suitable, especially in view of the character of the ground on which the building would be erected. As a large part of the basement would be above the ground level, provision could be made therein for a vocational training room and a small dispensary, or using the Sechelt School plan, the space provided for wood and store could be used for vocational training and a dispensary, and a section of the basement set aside for wood and store-room purposes.\n\nI should imagine that the costs of a building along the lines of the Sechelt School with cement basement and furnace would be around \u00a33000 and in view of this I feel that the safest and probably the most economical course to pursue would be to have plans prepared along the lines of the Sechelt Day School, with the suggested changes, and call for tenders for the building in the usual way. The value of the materials available from the landing field is small in comparison with the estimated cost of the proposed school. These materials could be used in the structure and allowance made for the value of same in the tenders submitted, or they could be given to the Indians of the Agency for improvements to their homes.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nSome time ago, I was driving past the Bothroyd Day School and noted a pile of lumber which evidently was gleaned through wrecking some of the relief camps, which I believe have been handed over to the best to be used at the discretion of the Agents. This lumber, I believe, is to be used in the erection of a new school there.\n\nI have made my opinion of Day Schools known to the Department and may I suggest that before action is taken, a survey should be made with a view to placing the school on a reserve where it could reach a greater number of children. I am sure a better location could be found, and if money and time is to be spent, it should be used to the greatest advantage.\n\nI have so often driven through the Shulus reserve near Merritt and so often thought what a good location for an experimental day school this reserve presented. Children could readily be had for a two or three-room day school providing the children from the Shulus district now in the Residential Schools were returned to be placed in a day school. There are other reserves within bus reach of Shulus (Canford, Nicola, Coldwater) which, if consolidated, would in this district make a very nice experiment. May I offer my humble opinion that, in the near future, steps should be taken to build a Day School at Shulus and bring into it all the available children under the age of 12 years.\n\nIt may interest you to know that my Log Cabin is ready for the plaster and the cost to date, with freight, has not exceeded $225.00. I have yet to purchase a stub and toilet and two basins. I shall get well behind $300.00. With the interest shown in this building by boys and girls and Indians, I feel that we have here made a distinct forward step and which is not confined to this district but can be applied to the whole of B.C. and with careful administration...\non the reserves has far reaching potentialities. I sincerely hope that my efforts, which are inclined to be made light of locally, will not be dropped at the door of the school but will be followed up in other institutions and districts.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFebruary 27, 1939.\nOttawa, March 8, 1939.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nVoucher #654x January 30/39 - $ 6.07\nT.Eaton Co., Ltd., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nThe above-noted voucher was paid on February 18, 1939, by cheque #90415. The Company has returned the cheque as they are unable to trace corresponding debit.\n\nIt is thought that Miss L.Blachford, teacher of the Boothreyd Indian Day School, remitted the necessary funds when she placed the order with the T.Eaton Company.\n\nI should be pleased to know how this matter stands. If Miss Blachford paid for these goods you should secure and forward any evidence of payment that she may have so that she may be reimbursed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nL.W.McCutcheon\nChief Treasury Officer.\n\nA.Strang, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nHMJ/S\nOttawa, March 6, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith, for your information, copy of a letter received by the Department from Reverend A. R. Lett, Principal of the St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, B. C.\n\nI am anxious to have from you, at your convenience, any comments you may care to offer with respect to Mr. Lett's suggestion. We receive from time to time vigorous protests from interested parties against the selection of sites for Indian day schools. These protests, you can readily appreciate, are somewhat disconcerting. We are wholly dependent upon the recommendations of our Indian agents and, in this case, our school inspector, for the selection of suitable sites. It is just possible that in this particular case a thorough survey should be made by Inspector Barry before we proceed with the construction of the school. I should add that no provision has been made in the estimates of this year for the erection of this building. It was our hope that there would be sufficient lumber salvaged from the camps to erect a building. It would appear, however, from correspondence received recently, that such is not the case. In any event, it might be well to have the site question settled at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEncl.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nLYTTON, B.C., March 13, 1939\n\nSir:\n\nIn reference to your letter of March 8th, file No. 165-26-5 relative to my voucher #854x of January 30th, 1939, I beg to enclose herewith, copy of my letter to the T. Eaton Company, dated March 1st in this connection. Apparently the T. Eaton Company had returned the cheque prior to receiving my letter.\n\nMiss Blachford brought the shipping slips covering the purchase of Christmas treats, to the office merely stating that it was the account for the toys bought at Christmas for her pupils; she did not mention having already paid for them, therefore the account was vouchered and forwarded for payment in the usual manner. On speaking of this matter to Miss Blachford recently she requested that I ask the T. Eaton Company to credit her with the amount of $6.07.\n\nThe only evidence of payment of the account by Miss Blachford would be the shipping slips attached to my voucher #854x.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Strang,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Chief Treasury Officer,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nLYTTON, B.C., March 1, 1939\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nA few weeks before Christmas last year, Miss L. Blachford, teacher at the Boothroyd Indian Day School, forwarded an order to your firm for Christmas toys, etc., totalling $6.07 and enclosed payment in full for the goods.\n\nOn January 27th this same account was forwarded to the Department for payment from this office through a misunderstanding on the part of the teacher and the office. This account will have probably been paid by the Department by now and if that is the case will you kindly credit the account of Miss L. Blachford with the amount of $6.07 and send her a credit slip. This will save the trouble of returning the cheque to the Department.\n\nWill you kindly let me know as soon as possible, the outcome of this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

In view of this fact, the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia, Major D. M. MacKay, was requested to investigate the educational facilities at Boothroyd and report to the Department.\n\nThe records indicate that Reverend A. R. Lett, Principal of the St. George's Indian Residential School, wrote to the Department on February 27, 1939, intimating that in his judgment a thorough survey of local conditions at Boothroyd should be made before the school was rebuilt on the old site. Mr. Lett's letter read in part as follows:\n\n\"Before action is taken, a survey should be made with a view to placing the new school on a reserve where it could reach the greatest number of children. I am sure a better location could be found, and if money and time is to be spent it should be used to the greatest advantage.\"\n\nImmediately -\n\nRight Reverend G. A. Wells, C.M.G., M.A., D.D.,\nBishop of Cariboo,\nKamloops, British Columbia.\nImmediately following the receipt of this communication from Mr. Lett, the Indian Commissioner was asked to have Captain Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools, make a survey of the Boothroyd district. I regret to state, however, that Mr. Barry's report has not yet reached the Department. No provision was made in the 1939-40 estimates for the amount of money necessary to rebuild the school. It is our intention, however, just as soon as the report of the survey reaches us, to make provision for the rebuilding of this school in the estimates of next year.\n\nIt is in my judgment somewhat regrettable that this delay has occurred in the construction of the building. In view of Mr. Lett's letter, however, the officials felt that a survey was necessary before a final decision could be made.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Your File 162-26-5.\n\nI beg to refer to Mr. Hoey's letter of March 6th with which was enclosed a letter from the Rev. A. R. Lett suggesting that before action is taken with respect to the erection of a new school at Boothroyd, a survey should be made with a view to placing the school on a Reserve where it would serve a greater number of children. The Boothroyd Indian Day School draws its pupilage from Boothroyd I.R. No.1 (Tsawamuck), Boothroyd I.R. No.2 (Tsintanku), I.R. No.13 and I.R. No.4 (Buctum), all situated in close proximity to the school. Mr. Lett is sure that a better location could be found but fails to mention or suggest such a location. If Day School accommodation is not continued for the Boothroyd children now attending the Boothroyd School, they either have to be accommodated in a Residential School, or, like a number of other Indian children in the Fraser Valley, have no school to attend.\n\nBefore Day Schools are recommended, Reserves from which the pupils are to be drawn are examined and a careful survey made of the children available for such a school. Only one Day School has been erected in a new field since I have been in the service, viz., the one at Pemberton. The attendance at present here is 37. New schools have been erected at Port Simpson, Bella Coola, Kitselas and Bella Bella, but these were to replace old buildings with too little accommodation, or otherwise unsuitable.\n\nI may say that I am satisfied we need a new school at Boothroyd and also the present site, although not ideal, is best from the point of view of centrality, water and access that we can get. Before proceeding with construction, however, I consider it best to have Inspector Barry make a survey of the Reserves from which the pupils are drawn, and submit a report. This survey could\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nbe made by the Inspector when he inspects St. George's School, Lytton, some time this month.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of Mr. Lett's letter of February 27th, I need only remark that the Department has had an Indian Day School in operation at Shulus for a number of years. The enrolment of this school, as reported by Inspector Barry on November 18th, 1938, was 17.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOffice of the Lytten Indian Agency,\n\nMarch 20, 1939\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 994x, amounting to $2.00 in favour of J.H. Anthony for school supplies.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 165-26-5 dated February 14, 1939.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 518\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nActing on your instructions I carried out a school survey of the Boothroyd Band, Lytton Agency, in the intervals of other work during the period April 18th to 21st inclusive.\n\nThe result of my investigations has been to prove that the statements of the Reverend A.R. Lett, Principal of the St George's Residential School, Lytton, made to the Department and quoted to you by Mr Hoey have no possible foundation in fact. Mr Lett discussed his letter to the Department with me and even showed me a copy though he could not explain why he had not sent a copy to you at the time he sent the original to the Department.\n\nIn general Mr Lett based his suggestions on a change in policy by which the St George's School should be reserved for a limited number of Junior and Senior High School pupils and the rest of the present pupils sent back to such places as Shulus in the Nicola Agency.\n\nI explained to Mr Lett that he was now very short of pupils and that to send the Lytton, Shulus, Boothroyd and other children home would empty his school. He remarked that that would not matter, but pointed out that we had plenty of room in the present Shulus Indian Day School, but he talked quite foolishly of taking out the Roman Catholic Children from the Kamloops Residential School and sending those belonging to Shulus back to that school. It wasof little use to speak to Mr Lett about such matters as he appears to me to be rapidly becoming irresponsible and at certain times during my inspection of the St George's School spoke about educational matters in a most foolish manner.\n\nMr Lett would appear to wish to do everything to prevent the erection of a new school at or near Boothroyd. He and the teacher there Miss Blackford did not agree about many things, and my own opinion is that Mr Lett is very much upset that she, an untrained Indian woman, should be obtaining obviously better results along several lines than he can obtain at St George's. I do not consider that any great importance should be placed on Mr Lett's opinions on a subject of which he knows very little. In any case the attached survey report will give you and the officials at Ottawa a fair picture of the actual condition of things at Boothroyd.\n\nMay I suggest that you ask Mr Indian Agent Strang for a short report on the Johnnie Andrew property mentioned in my report as highly suitable for the proposed new Boothroyd Indian Day School. The local Indians have promised Mr Strang to work on the school at $1.00 per day, and I hope that the school may be erected soon.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6386, File 804-5, part 3)\nPurpose of Survey:\n\nThis survey with respect to the educational needs of the Indian children living on the various Boothroyd Indian Reserves in the Lytton Agency, or belonging to this Band and at the moment living away from these Reserves was undertaken in conjunction with my ordinary inspection duties in the Agency and thus involved the Department in no extra expense of any kind.\n\nThe general purpose of this investigation was to determine the necessity for an Indian Day School on the Boothroyd Reserves, and should it be found that such a school was in fact necessary to determine the very best location for such a school.\n\nThe more particular aim of the survey was to locate all Indian children belonging to the Boothroyd Band by an examination of the Agency records and through a visit to the St George's Indian Residential School, the Boothroyd Indian Day School, and the Indian homes where necessary.\n\nProcedure Adopted:\n\nThe office work in regard to the examination of the census book of the Boothroyd Band and the making of the necessary extracts was undertaken in Lytton on April 18th, 19th and 20th in intervals of other work, while much of the information required for the Department was tabulated by Mr Sampson, the Agency Clerk.\n\nMaps of the various Indian Reserves were also consulted, and it was found that information with regard to the actual Indian Reserves from which the majority of the children attending the Boothroyd Day School came previously supplied in Vancouver to the Indian Commissioner was in fact incorrect. I very much regret that through my carelessness in misfiling the Map Crown was this week at Inkahtasph the Indian Commissioner was informed that the majority of the children at the Boothroyd Indian Day School came from Boothroyd Indian Reserve No. 1 (Tsawwassen) to Boothroyd Indian Reserve No.5 (Sho-oak) from which Reserves as a matter of fact no children are drawn. The information given on subsequent pages is correct and shows that the pupils of the Boothroyd School come from Boothroyd Indian Reserves No.6 and No.6A a few miles north of the first mentioned Reserves.\n\nMr Indian Agent Strang accompanied me on a visit to the various Indian Reserves mentioned in my survey report, and gave me very valuable assistance throughout my investigation.\n\nWhere children are shown by the Agency records to be attending St. George's Indian Residential School the Residential School records were also consulted with the Reverend A.R.Lett, Principal of St. George's, and the fact of the children's actual residence at St George's School verified.\n\nMiss L. Blachford, teacher at the Boothroyd Indian Day School gave me much assistance and verified the fact that the Reverend Mr Lett had visited his school for several years and was in no position to comment on the average attendance which is about 13 though Mr Lett stated that only about 7 children were ever at the school when he visited there.\n| Name of parent | Name of child | Sex | Age | Religion | Reserve | Distance from school | Remarks |\n|---------------|--------------|-----|-----|----------|---------|----------------------|---------|\n| Peter James   | Charlie      | M   | 13  |          |         | 100 yds.             | At St. George's Sch.

(RG 10, Volume 6386, File 804-5, part 3)\nProbable Attendance:\n\nShould a new Indian day school be erected as is recommended below either on a site immediately adjoining the present Boothroyd Indian Day School as previously suggested, or on the site discovered during my present survey visit, the average attendance would in all probability continue to be around 85% of the total number of pupils available.\n\nIf my suggestions, made on Page 4, be followed there would be 22 children on the school roll and an average attendance of between 17 and 18.\n\nThere appear to be some 19 children now under school age. This would mean that some three little pupils would on the average be available yearly for the Primary Class and there would be no falling off in attendance for a number of years at least, but possibly an increase.\n\nA school to accommodate thirty pupils would be required.\n\nProvincial Schools:\n\nThere are no Provincial schools in this neighbourhood.\n\nReligious Teaching:\n\nThe whole of the children mentioned in this survey report are members of the Anglican Church. It would probably be under the auspices of this Church that the proposed school to replace the present Boothroyd School would be administered.\n\nPossible Site for School:\n\nA satisfactory site would be that immediately to the WEST of the present school house. There is a hill on which the building might be placed. The present very small school garden could be used. Water is available by extension of about 100 feet of pipe line from the end of the present pipe. Source of water is a spring in hill near school. The present dam would need to be enlarged as previously recommended.\n\nThe location of the present school and the above site is on Indian Reserve No. 6 (Inkatsaph).\n\nWhile this site which was by far the best available so far would do very well for a small school and residence I wish now for the first time to bring to your notice what I consider to be a far superior site, and one that would provide a safe playing field and good garden for the pupils.\n\nI refer to a small parcel of land of perhaps two acres located on the same Inkatsaph or Inkitsaph Indian Reserve Boothroyd No. 6 but between one half and three quarters of a mile SOUTH of the present school. This land belongs to an Indian, Johnie Andrew, who has plenty of other land and does not appear to take much interest in this piece.\n\nThe land lies along the side of the main road but is approached by an overgrown piece of the old road parallel with the new road and thus protected for children from traffic.\n\nThere are the remains of an old garden, fruit trees and bushes, and the children could make a fine school garden here. The old log house has no roof and only a part of the floor. It would be no good as a school but could be used in the manner suggested below.\nWater is available from the Inkitsaph Creek from which domestic water would have to be piped by a pipe of about one inch, while water for the garden could be led from the same creek in the old dug out irrigation ditch. The Indian Agent informs me that we have rights on the Inkitsaph or Inkahtsaph Creek flowing through this No.8 Reserve.\n\nMr Indian Agent Strang tells me that he has no doubt that the Department could secure this fine site for around the sum of $50.00. I may say that I consider that it would be well worth paying up to $100.00 for two acres here to include old buildings and fruit trees etc.\n\nI requested Mr Strang to find out exactly how much the Indian owner, Johnnie Andrew, would be prepared to accept for any rights he may have in this parcel of ground.\n\n**Type of School Needed:**\n\nThis question has been reported on previously. In brief the school should be for thirty pupils. There should be a kitchen living room adjoining the schoolroom so that the teacher can supervise the work of the Vocational Class and the academic work at the same time. Two small bed rooms, one for the teacher and one for the boy who helps with the garden and usual chores, a vocational room if possible and a small room for the Department's drugs, with accommodation in the basement for Manual Training, should meet the needs of this Band. Several of the above small rooms might be located in the basement. The whole house should probably be on one level with the exception of the cement or dirt court basement.\n\nWith regard to the provision of cement for either basement of foundations, or probably best a part cement and frame basement, I may say that there is a good cement mixer available in the Indian Agent's yard.\n\n**Old Building on Proposed Site:**\n\nThere is a substantial one room log building, the logs being sized and shaped, on this site and located very near the main road. This building has no roof and would require a roof, floor, windows, and doors.\n\nThere is however plenty of rough material available from the old abandoned buildings to complete this house AFTER the school has been erected.\n\nI believe that such a house as this finished in an attractive manner with a shake roof and some paint might be used as a sale room for Indian Arts and Crafts. It could be under the supervision of the teacher Miss Blanchford and articles made by the Indians either in school or by ex school children could be sold to the hundreds of tourists passing along this famous Fraser Valley Scenic Highway. Even baskets and other articles made at Lytton might be sold here, during the summer months. It will be remembered that this Boothroyd School does not take vacation in July and August as other schools do but in September and the winter to include the hop season and to allow for the bad snow of January.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nRegardless of any foolish remarks of the Principal of St George's Indian Residential School, I would very strongly recommend the erection of the new Boothroyd Indian Day School as previously suggested and on the new site proposed here.\n\nP.O.Box 444,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nGerald H. Berry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nApril 25/39.\n\nYears ago when the 5 Commissioners were here to investigate the question of Reserves and living conditions of the Indians.\n\nThis school was talked over with them. The Commissioners asked us. Why? Didn't we send our children to St. Georges at Lytton? Our late Chief Benedict told them that we didn't want to send them away from home and that we didn't like the way that some of the children acted towards their parents when they came home from school. But, if the Dept. would put up a school for us here on our Reserve, we'd gladly send our children to school.\n\nAfter much talk it was agreed that the Indians put up a building and the Dept. would pay the teacher's salary. Both parties promised that this school would be kept going as long as there were pupils to attend.\n\nThen Chief Benedict told the Commissioners that he'd like to have Miss L. Blachford appointed for our teacher. The Commissioners were pleased with this suggestion, they asked Miss Blachford if she'd accept the position, which she did, when they'd agreed on the salary and that we provide living quarters for her.\n\nWe put up the building at our own expense and labour. School was opened May 3rd 1915. Its been in use ever since. We've sent our children regularly though its been hard for some of us to furnish clothes - (especially shoes) and food for lunches.\n\nThe 2 rooms provided for the teacher are very small and we know its been hard work for her to carry on, teaching our girls to can salmon, fruit and cooking in such a small kitchen and living room.\n\nWe were very happy when we thought the Dept. had decided to give us a suitable building and we were very eager to begin the work. But, now we are disappointed to hear that the Dept. might not build as a report had been sent in that the attendance here wasn't up to standard nor were there sufficient children on the Reserve to warrant the expense of a new school.\n\nWe are sorry to hear about this report as it is not a true fact.\nWe have done our part in sending our children regularly. The only time a child is kept at home is on account of sickness or bad weather. There could be more children attending here if the children that have been taken to St. Georges, were allowed to return and if the Dept. would give some assistance to Day Scholars for as I have stated before, some of the parents couldn't afford the expense of clothes so they sent their children to St. Georges where they have everything supplied for them. We would be very grateful if you can persuade the Dept. to give us a new school. As its over 8 years now that we've had to repair and prop up the old foundation every spring.\n\nThe work done here is very good, this school won a 1st & a 3rd prize last year at the B.C. Indians Art & Handicraft Display in Vancouver, B. C. It also divided 1st prize money at the Kamloops Fair the year before.\n\nOur children come home, help us and take an interest in our work, they respect their parents and are not so dissatisfied as some of the children that come home from a school where they've been living in what are called \"luxuries\" which our poor homes cannot give them.\n\nWe are sorry that our circumstances will not allow us to assist in building without pay as we did 24 years ago, as you know that we've not been able to obtain work either on the Highway nor the Railroads besides its getting harder each year to sell our farm products locally.\n\nIf we get the new school we'll see that our children attend regularly and I'm sure that if the Dept. can help the scholars we'll have no trouble in keeping up the attendance as we'll get more scholars from other reserves as I've often been told by Indians that they'd like to send their children here but couldn't afford the extra expense - though we have pupils attending now because their parents prefer our school.\n\nI do hope Mr. Strang that you will do your best to get the school for us.\n\n\"Chief Wallace Bradley\"\nin behalf of The Boothroyd Band\nActing Chief \"Paul Michell\" witness\nOttawa, June 28, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 7th instant, in connection with the proposed erection of a new school on the Boothroyd reserve.\n\nIn the special supplementary estimates, provision was made for the erection of a school in Saskatchewan, but owing to recent circumstances it is not possible to proceed with its construction. As a result, sufficient funds are now available for the erection of the school on the Boothroyd reserve.\n\nAs the season is advancing, it is considered that the best method of building this school would be to engage a white foreman and employ Indians to assist him.\n\nYour letter of February 2, 1939, mentioned that you considered a suitable building with cement basement and furnace could be erected at a cost not exceeding $2,000. Please let me know at once if you are prepared to proceed along the lines suggested in your letter of February 2, and if so, you will be advised of the name of the white foreman to be employed. You could arrange for the purchase of the materials and, in addition, the lumber salvaged from the landing field could be used.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Barry's report on the school survey conducted by him of the Boothroyd Band, Lytton Agency.\n\nOn receipt of this report I communicated with Mr. Strang regarding the alternative site for the new school suggested by Inspector Barry. A reply has been received to the effect that the Boothroyd Indians are in favor of using the existing school property for the new school. Inspector Barry returned from inspection duties in the north on Saturday, last, and I took occasion to further discuss with him the question of a site for this school. The Inspector agrees that the site immediately west of the existing Day School is quite suitable and more central but that the area available for use as a garden is very small. He is of the opinion that the Johnny Anderson acreage referred to is a better all-round site for a school but considers that the location of the present school is also satisfactory.\n\nA copy of a letter received by Mr. Strang from the Boothroyd Indians regarding a new school is forwarded for your information.\n\nI should appreciate being advised if it is expected that funds will be available to proceed with the construction of a new school at Boothroyd this year.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

This would involve considerable time.\n\nI consider that it is better to proceed at the earliest possible date by day labour. You should employ a white foreman to supervise the work and you may also engage other white workmen, if necessary, but as far as possible competent Indians should be employed.\n\nYou may arrange to purchase the material from firms on the approved list and the encumbrance requisition number will be sent to you under separate cover. I am also arranging to forward to you an accountable cheque for $1500.00 for labour.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.

Provincial Department Public Works Plan No. 552, but some modification of the plan is required to meet the conditions imposed by the site available, chief of which is that the plan is to be reversed. As an extra bedroom is necessary, it is suggested that the lean-to should become an extension of the school proper and include small bedroom (7'6\" x 10'0\" would be large enough). Mr. Agent Strang thinks that a kitchen-living room would be satisfactory with a porch. As the school is to be built on a fairly steep side hill, the front entrance steps would have to be on the side opposite to the large classroom windows. The main classroom lights should face the river on the west. It is proposed to have a basement running the full length of the school and about 15' or 16' wide to accommodate small room for drugs and supplies. Owing to the slope of the site, very little excavation would be required, and this would be on the side with the main classroom.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nwindows. If it is decided to call for tenders, they could call for alternative constructions of concrete basement, floor and foundation as shown, or the building on concrete blocks with cedar posts and frame construction. There should also be provision for two outside latrines.\n\nI am forwarding the plan with pencil notes thereon, also a wage plan and plan of Reserve showing location of school according to the Indian Agent. Possibly it may be found more desirable to prepare another plan based on that submitted in view of the number of changes made that might be very confusing to a builder, particularly if an attempt is made to construct this building employing a white carpenter assisted by Indians of whose skill in this respect I have no knowledge. It is observed that the Commissioner's letter of 2nd February, 1939 to the Department in the last paragraph expresses the opinion that it would probably be safer and more economical to call for tenders, which could stipulate employment of Indian labour for work within their skill, such as excavation and common labour. The call for tenders should stipulate use of the material on hand as far as possible.\n\nSubject to the foregoing, I would recommend that work proceed as soon as possible and your further instructions will be appreciated. Kindly return the plans as soon as they have served your purpose.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nFor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.

(RG 10, Volume 6386, File 804-5, part 3)\nOttawa, July 13, 1929.\n\nMy dear Bishop Wells:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 8th instant and to thank you very heartily for the information contained therein. Your interest in the education of the Indian population and your interest particularly in the Boothroyd school is very deeply appreciated.\n\nYou will be glad to learn that there is a possibility that we may be able to proceed with the construction of the Boothroyd school this summer. Provision was made in the estimates for the construction of a school in Saskatchewan and we find that it may be impossible to proceed with the construction of this particular school at this time. If such is the case, we shall make arrangements immediately for the construction of the school at Boothroyd. I am at present in communication with the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia with respect to the matter.\n\nWith kindest personal regards,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRight Rev. G. A. Wells, C.M.G., M.A., D.D.,\nBishop of Cariboo,\nKamloops, B. C.\nKAMLOOPS, B.C., July 8, 1939\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey,\n\nI thank you for your letter of June the 13th regarding the Boothroyd Indian School at Lytton, B.C. in the Diocese of Cariboo.\n\nI have just returned from a visit and special service at the school where I discussed the question of a new school and the right site for it with Mr. Strang, the Indian Agent; Miss Blackford, the teacher; and the Indian Chiefs of the Boothroyd Band. I venture to give you my convictions on two points in connection with the matter.\n\n1. Excellent work is being done by the Teacher from the moral, social, and educational standpoint for the Indians in spite of most inadequate facilities and delapidated building. There should be a new building there at the earliest possible convenience.\n\n2. There is general agreement, and not the least doubt in my mind, that the present site is the most convenient for the Indians and is likely because of settlement possibilities for all time. With very little expenditure on levelling the land, and some care in placing the building, it will be found adequate and suitable. The Indian Chief's volunteered to help in preparing the site at once.\n\nI feel that there is no need of saying to you that what I have done and am prepared to do in this matter is in no way interfering with your department or with the Agent at Lytton. My object is to help in every way I possibly can to support any movement that is made in the real interest of the Indian in this diocese.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours most sincerely,\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey, B.A.,\nSupt. Welfare & Training,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa.\n\nGeorge Cariboo\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 8th instant in which you seek information with respect to the construction of an Indian day school near Lytton, B.C.\n\nI may state that we are at this time communicating with the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia with respect to the construction of this school. While no definite decision has yet been reached it is altogether likely that this school will be constructed by day labour under the direction and supervision of the Indian Agent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Some cement work, construction of cupboards and interior and exterior painting, remain to be done but as these are being attended to, the end of the month should see the work fully completed.\n\nIt will be recalled that E.R.1054 dated August 11th, 1939, in the amount of $4700 was set up for this project. This authorization included $1500 cash advance for labour.\n\nAn examination of the expenditures in connection with this construction indicates clearly that the school will be completed for $3100, leaving a balance of $1600 available for other purposes.\n\nI may say that the school has been well built and should meet the requirements of the Indians in the Boothroyd section for many years. It is a 30' by 60' frame structure on cement foundation with one classroom and teacher's residence. The building is heated by a well installed wood burning hot air furnace. The basement has a full cement floor and is subdivided so as to provide for store room, fuel room and a large bright section which can be used for manual training. The existing water system has been extended into the building with a tap in the kitchen and one in the basement.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMr. McLean was employed as carpenter foreman and with the exception of the installation of the furnace, which was carried out by a firm in Vancouver, Indian labour was provided.\n\nIt will in all probability be necessary for the Department to furnish the residence as the furniture used by the late Miss Blachford belonged to her.\n\nI will arrange to have some camera snapshots of the new school taken for the Department when a good opportunity offers.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian commissioner for B.C.\n| Name          | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday | Sunday |\n|---------------|--------|---------|-----------|----------|--------|----------|--------|\n| John Andrews  |        |         |           |          |        |          |        |\n| Cecil Semon    |        |         |           |          |        |          |        |\n| Moses Charlie  |        |         |           |          |        |          |        |\n| Phillip Mollen |        |         |           |          |        |          |        |\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Indians are very pleased with the building and I am sure it will encourage regular attendance at the school.\n\nA.

We have been approached by Mr. Grant Starr, Dominion Government Engineer, who is working in the vicinity of Foothroyd, for permission to occupy the building as a residence for himself and his family.\n\nMr. Starr has offered to pay rental but after discussing the matter with him, I am of the opinion it would be preferable for us to permit him to occupy the building without charge, on the understanding that he will look after ordinary maintenance. I have in mind that the building has been unoccupied for some time, that some maintenance is no doubt necessary by now and that if the building is heated and occupied, it will not deteriorate as quickly as otherwise.\n\nMay I please have the Department's views in this matter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.J.

The terms are as follows:\n\n(1) The classroom must be locked so that no damage will be done to the desks, etc.\n\n(2) If Mr. Starr wishes to use the teacherage furniture, then the rental will be $30.00 per month.\n\n(3) If he wishes to use his own furniture, the rental will be $20.00 per month. If the furniture is not used, then it must be stored in the classroom and locked.\n\n(4) An inventory of the furniture in the school is to be made and forwarded here with a statement opposite each item concerning its condition.\n\nWhile it is agreed that Mr. Starr will look after ordinary maintenance of the building, it is our practice to charge rental for these buildings so that there will be no complaints from the Indians.\n\nBernard F.

It would be appreciated if you would bring me up to date on the question.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Boothroyd School\n\nWith reference to Mr. Phelan's letter of Feb. 11th, Mr. Mett has resurveyed the pupilage available for the above mentioned school and has determined that there are not enough pupils to reopen the school. It seems doubtful if this school will ever be reopened as the very limited opportunities for employment in the district makes it necessary for Indians of the Band to seek employment elsewhere.\n\nThe building has been unoccupied since the school was closed, Mr. Starr, reference your letter of September 29th, 1950 (file 804-5) having found accommodation elsewhere.\n\nW.

A grant of say $10.00 would be a great help. Some glass jars might be bought to hold preserved vegetables and fruit, and the children should be encouraged to preserve part of the produce of their own gardens.\nOttawa, April 8th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn his report regarding the Boothroyd Indian Day School, which he visited on the 22nd ultimo, Inspector Barry recommends that an allowance of $10.00 be made for the purchase of simple dress material for the children to make up for themselves. Please consult the teacher and purchase what is necessary, at a cost not exceeding that stated above.\n\nThe Inspector also suggests the purchase of some glass jars to hold preserved vegetables and fruit.

In preceding years the Indian Agent obliged the people to make Cape Mudge their chief's headquarters, thereby giving them bands the advantage of Church, School, etc.\"\n\nThis return was certified to by Mr. Agent Halliday, but apparently he has taken no steps to bring the Indians back to Cape Mudge. The Department would like a report from you as to what should be done with this school, as it is useless to keep it on, if there are no children to attend.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nSecretary\n\nA. W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nVictoria, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 28th Ultimo, No 666 C-5, referring to remarks of the teacher at Cape Mudge School in the quarterly report for December quarter, and asking for a report on the school as to whether it was advisable to keep it open or not.\n\nIf you will kindly refer to my letter of 29th January No 312/5, you will find it stated that I went immediately to Cape Mudge on receipt of Mr Rendle's letter referring to the non attendance of the children and also complaining of the liquor at Campbell River. You will notice there that I mentioned the fact that I had given the visitors to Campbell River 24 hours notice to go home which they did.\n\nAt the public meetings held at Cape Mudge on 20 and 21 days of March last past the school question was brought up and I informed the Indians of my intention to put the Education act in force and they expressed their willingness to send their children to school and a glance at the report for March quarter which I sent today will show that the attendance has been fair for this quarter. I hope that the next quarter will show a decided gain in the attendance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.W.

Not only is the attendance unsatisfactory in so far as regularity is concerned, but only a small proportion of the total number of available children are enrolled. The Department quite understands that, owing to the nomadic habits of the Indians, there are seasons when a high attendance cannot reasonably be expected, but, even during the portions of the year when they are at home, the enrolment and average are very low. It is thought that if the teacher would make a determined effort at least some improvement might be recorded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

As you were advised on July 28th the attendance is very unsatisfactory in so far as regularity is concerned. This is to a certain extent attributable to the nomadic habits of the Indians, but it is noted that only a small proportion of the available children is enrolled. You will be good enough to communicate with Mr. Rendle and advise him that the Department would like to see a distinct improvement effected in the attendance and progress of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.

On the first occasion Mr Rendle was away in Victoria, and no school was in session. On the second occasion I was present with Mr Inspector Green. I informed Mr Rendle of the desire of the Department to have the school attendance more regular and a general improvement that was needed which he promised to attend to. I have been waiting to receive his quarterly report to see what improvement has taken place.\n\nBy this mail I am writing him again on the matter and in a short time again I will visit the school and see personally whether any improvement has been effected.\n\nI may state that Mr Rendle has always been only half hearted on school matters so much so that he only has one session of school per day. I instructed him to mention this fact in one of his monthly reports which was done and as no mention was made of the matter from the Department I concluded that this arrangement was satisfactory to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D.

Sir,\n\nReports received on the Cape Mudge day school for sometime past show that Mr. Rendle, the teacher, takes very little interest in the school work, in fact the attendance has been so poor that the Department considered at one time the withdrawal of the grant. Mr. Rendle holds only one session each day and in other respects is reported from several sources to be very half-hearted in regard to school matters. Of course the Department is aware that at certain seasons of the year a large attendance cannot be expected at this school, but when the Indians are at home a determined effort should be made to effect some improvement.\n\nI have to ask you, therefore, to be good enough to take this matter up with Mr. Rendle and advise him that unless a decided improvement is shown in the attendance and in the character of the work done in the school-room the Department will have to call upon you to nominate a new teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nSupt. Methodist Indian schools,\nBrandon, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6386, File 805-1, part 1)\nDear Sir:\n\nYour communication in regard to my labours in connection with the day school at this place received in the mail yesterday, and hasten to reply to the same, especially when the non-success of the school of late is laid to my \"neglect and indifference\" as you state.\n\nThere is no doubt that for the last three years the school has been a failure as far as an educational factor among our Indians is concerned. I have been among these people nearly seven years; when I arrived here I found all work at a low ebb, church and day-school poorly attended, the yearly average of the school being 24 according to Blue Books.\nAfter two years this average was increased to 1246 and our school continued to flourish until the winter of 1907-8, when our people received a visit from that well known Indian agitator Capatino Joe, who first started the controversy in B.C. re. Indian lands; he put him out of our mission village, and he took up his abode in another village near by taking the majority of our people with him. After Joe's advent conditions changed in our villages; our people are not allowed to work at the timber on their own reserves owing to the dispute between the B.C. and Ottawa governments over \"land titles\"; so they have to find work somewhere so the majority of them find it miles from home taking their families with them.\n\nStarting in June our people find employment at the salmon-fishing working for a cannery some three miles distant from our school, the fishing lasts well into October; after this they are home for about 10 days, then away to different places to dry fish.\nfor their winters use, returning from Nov. 20th to Dec. 25th remaining in their villages till after Xmas; then there able-bodied people go trapping and logging taking their families with them.\n\n| JUNE TO OCTOBER | NOVEMBER-DEC | JAN-MARCH | APRIL-MAY |\n|-----------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|\n| SALMON FISHING  | DRYING FISH | TRAPPING LOGGING | AT HOME |\n\nLast September our people asked permission of the Department to exchange the timber on a portion of the reserve for a building suitable for their children to sleep and eat in during their parents' absence; this request was refused by the Department on account of the dispute between the B.C. government over \"land titles.\" Our people earnestly desire their children to go to school, but cannot better their condition in that respect on account of existing conditions.\n\nPersonally I have done everything in my power to make our school a success, the chief cause of failure is the irregular attendance; this state of affairs is common all over this agency; on the 11th of this month I attended a meeting.\ncalled by the Rev Hall of Alert Bay, to consider the prevailing conditions among the Indians in these parts; this meeting was attended by all Indian workers in this district and many native delegates. Mr. Hall stated that his church (English) had been losing ground for the last six years; only one of his day-schools having an regular attendance the home one at Alert Bay; our native delegate presented a petition to the Indian agent who presided at the meeting from all our people and myself asking that they might be allowed to remove the timber from 40 acres of the reserve near our village this season so that their people could find work at home and their children attend school; this was promised the support of our Indian agent; and together with several petitions of a similar nature from other villages received the endorsement of the meeting.\n\nI have three villages under my charge, one 40 miles north\u2014\nand another on Vancouver Island some four miles away. Our mission-house is situated on Valdez Island, built on the Cape Mudge reserve property. When we have no school here I am constantly on the move; the society gave me a launch a few years ago so I could reach my people. The only other church working among these Indians is the Church of England who are doing a aggressive work in these parts. Our people are fully awake to the necessity of a school in this village and are determined to rally around their missionary and look after their children this coming year.\n\nCauses of non-success of schools in past:\n- nomadic conditions of the Indians,\n- indifference of some parents,\n- want of sympathy Government & Church,\n- no support from Church Indian Missions in B.C.\n\nOur hope for the future:\n- In God,\n- In the Indians,\n- In the Good Lord Church,\n- In ourselves\n\nExcuse hurry in putting this together as our mail returns at once. Hoping to hear from you again.\n\nI am sincerely yours,\n\nQuathaski Cove\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6386, File 805-1, part 1)\nRev. T.

He appears to be reasonable.\n\nI find any reference to the Report of 1910 that the average attendance of the day schools in B.C. is a little below 90% and that the average of the week is 75% and that there are 4 with an average of 8% and one with a smaller average. And it is just possible that Mr. Rundle has received more items on average criticism. However I have written him again calling his attention to the necessity of greater diligence if this is possible, and since he spoke hopeful of the future, it may be that a change of weather might not improve the situation.\n\nI will keep in touch with his work and see how his reports are in the future.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT. Ferrier\nEX.\n\nOttawa, December 10, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo enclosing a communication from Rev.

Ditchburn for July, 1911.\n\nSouthwestern Inspectorate, B.C.\n\n(Received under cover letter 8th August from Mr. Ditchburn).\n\nOn Friday I went to Cape Mudge Reserve.\n\nThe school had been closed for a month in order to allow of the children taking part in the fishing. The attendance at the school is reported to have been very good. Mr. Rendle reports the attendance during March quarter to have been 16.85 out of 25, and for June quarter 11.65 out of 16 pupils. The health of the pupils has been good, and they have been making fair progress. There are no water closets in connection with the school, but are very much needed, and I would recommend that two should be built.\n\nW.E. Ditchburn.\n\nInspector.\nOttawa, February 19, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant in reference to the need of a janitor at the Cape Mudge School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your remarks with regard to one session of school each day are noted. I may say that the Department has just formulated a set of regulations for the management of Indian schools and among other things teachers are required to have two sessions each day of three hours each. I have to ask you to state whether there is any reason why the teacher of the Cape Mudge School should not be required to adhere to these regulations.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nSir:-\n\nReferring to your letter of 18th Feb'y regarding the regulations as to the number of hours that Indian Schools should be in session and asking if there is any reason why the Cape Mudge School should be exempt from the regulations I would inform you that with the exception of the difficulty in getting the children to attend there is no reason why any school in this agency should not follow the regulations. It is difficult enough to get the children to attend at 10 o'clock as they are lazy in the mornings.\n\nI may state that in all the schools in the agency excepting the Industrial school there have only been two sessions of two hours each. In the Provincial Schools for white children the regulations call for the following hours of attendance:- In the mornings from 9 to 12 with 15 minutes intermission. In the Afternoons from 1 to 3.30 with ten minutes intermission. From November 1st to the last day of February inclusive the regulations call for a morning session from 9.30 to 12 with ten minutes intermission and in the afternoons from 1 to 3 without any intermission.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nSecretary Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 13, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 2nd instant in reference to the length of the sessions at the Cape Mudge school I beg to say that the Department is preparing a set of regulations bearing on this point, copies of which will be sent you in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW.

Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nREPORT OF INSPECTOR CAIRNS ON THE CAPE MUDGE DAY SCHOOL.\n\nDate of Inspection\u2014September 27th, 1916.\n\nSchool was closed at the time of my visit. Mr. Rebholz informed me that the people would not be home till about Nov. 1st. It will be seen that the school year is exceedingly short. So short that very little is accomplished.\n\nThe missionary does not like to send any pupils to an industrial school. Those who would go are the pupils who are somewhat interested in education. If six or eight of these were sent away to school, the problem of carrying on school becomes almost hopeless.\n\nThe attendance at many of the day schools is so irregular that little is accomplished. In my opinion the great majority of the day school pupils will be classed as illiterate when they reach manhood.\n\nWalter Parker\nOttawa, January 11th, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nInspector Cairns visited the Cape Mudge day school on September 27th, last, and reports as follows:\n\n- School closed at time of visit, Indians all away. If six or eight of these pupils were sent to an industrial school, the school could be closed to advantage. The Missionary, who is the teacher, does not wish to part with the pupils. He is drawing $600.00 a year salary as teacher.\n\nBefore taking the action recommended by the Inspector, the Department considered it would be well to place the matter before you and I would be pleased to receive your views at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nBrandon Industrial School,\nBrandon, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs.

C.:\n\nI may say that Mr. Rendle, the missionary and teacher, has been asking that a separate teacher be appointed for this work and the Mission Board had about concluded to grant him his request when the war broke out and he was notified that no additional worker could be sent while the war lasted.\n\nThe last Annual Report gives a total roll of 17 and an average attendance of 7. There are some schools that are not as good as this and a few that are equal, so it has company. I would request that the Department continue the present arrangement until the end of June and in the meantime I will make full enquiries and send the Department a report. Personally, I think if we could carry out the suggestion of Mr. Cairns, that it is the proper solution of a large number of schools, providing the Department would see that the children were sent to a boarding or an Industrial school.\n\nTrusting that this will be satisfactory for the present, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndustrial School, Brandon.\nOttawa, May 31, 1917.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reference to official letter of the 23rd of January, last, in regard to the Osage Mudge School I beg to say that, in view of the recommendations made by you in connection with this matter when you were in Ottawa last week, this school may be continued for the present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa, January 23, 1917.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant in reference to the day school at Cape Mudge, B.C.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will continue the present arrangement existing at this school until the end of the school year, viz.- June 30th, next. In the meantime the Department will await the report of the inquiries which are being made by you regarding the conditions at this point.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose the quarterly report from Rev J.E. Rendle for Cape Mudge Indian Day School for the June quarter.\n\nIt will be noticed that the attendance has been very small and it would seem that the Indians do not appreciate the privilege of having a school at their door.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 12, 1917\n\n632-11\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the last returns received from the Cape Mudge Indian Day School show that the attendance of pupils has been very small.\n\nMr. Agent Halliday, in a recent letter to the Department states that it would seem that the Indians do not appreciate the privilege of having a school at their door.\n\nIf the returns do not show an increased attendance, the Department will be under the necessity of closing this school. It is considered that the greater number of children at this point could be sent to an Industrial School.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nRev. T.

Rev. Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, is being informed accordingly and asked to notify the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nOttawa, April 19, 1918.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI beg to inform you that, in view of the poor attendance at the Dape Mudge Indian school, the Department does not consider that it is justified in keeping it open any longer. It has, therefore, been decided to close this school at the end of the current quarter and I have asked you to be good enough to inform the teacher accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nDept. of Methodist Indian schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have received a letter from Miss M.B. Wright who is at present teaching at Skeena Crossing B.C., stating that she has been appointed teacher for the Cape Mudge Indian Day School, and she has sent me a requisition for school material which I am forwarding. Up to the present I have received no notification that this school is to be reopened and I should like to be advised on the matter and also as to what salary will be paid, if the appointment has been officially made.\n\nI have considerably reduced the requisition and have marked in Red Ink the amounts I consider necessary for the school as Miss Wright is apparently of the opinion that there will be thirty pupils while I will be well pleased if she has an average of ten.\n\nIf it is the intention of the Department to have this school reopened, I would recommend that the supplies as amended be forwarded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept., Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nIndian Affairs.

Wright as teacher of the Cape Mudge Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has been informed by Rev. T. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, under whose auspices this school is conducted, that he has transferred Miss Wright from Kitsegukla to the Cape Mudge school.\n\nThe Department has approved of the re-opening of this school and the transfer of Miss Wright as teacher with salary at the rate of $650.00 per annum.\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough to state the date on which Miss Wright began duties at Cape Mudge. You should give her every assistance you can in her work and use every endeavour to have the Indian parents send their children regularly to school.\n\nA requisition for school material has been received and will be dealt with in a separate communication.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Howard, teacher of the Cape Mudge Indian Day School. There is no question of an increase in salary, but her general usefulness at the school and in the community is the subject under discussion. I should be grateful for an immediate and detailed reply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay\nB. C.\nOTTAWA, September 29, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, regarding an increase in salary for Mrs. Florence Howard, teacher of the Cape Mudge Indian Day School, and also furnishing a report as to the work she is performing.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the excellent services being performed by Mrs. Howard at Cape Mudge, both as teacher of the day school and in social service work, the Department will allow her an increase of $100 per annum from the beginning of the present school year. This will make her salary from that date at the rate of $900 per annum. She will also be entitled to any bonus provided by law. I would be pleased if you would inform Mrs. Howard of the increase in salary granted her.\n\nIt is hoped that arrangements can be continued for the use of the house at present occupied by the teacher, but, if not, I trust that some other suitable residence can be rented. We have no funds available at the present time to erect a teacher's residence, but it is hoped that we will be able to provide the same in our estimates for the next fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nOTTAWA, September 29, 1922.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI beg to inform you that the Department, in view of the excellent services which Mrs. Florence Howard is performing as teacher at the Cape Mudge Indian Day School, is allowing her an increase in salary of $100 per annum, from the first of the present school year. This will make her salary from that date at the rate of $900 per annum. She will also be entitled to any bonus provided by law.\n\nOur Agent states that he cannot speak too highly of the work being performed by Mrs. Howard, both in school and out of it. He states she has a good attendance at the school, and is holding night classes for the young men, domestic science classes for the young women, and is also acting the part of district nurse and assisting the Indian women when they require it.\n\nWe are informing our Agent of the above increase being granted to Mrs. Howard.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of Sept. 9th regarding an increase of salary for Mrs. Florence Howard, teacher of the Cape Mudge Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I may say that I cannot speak too highly of the work Mrs. Howard is doing both in school and out of it. She has a good attendance at the school and is holding night classes in conjunction with Rev. R. C. Scott for the young men, domestic science classes for the young women, and is also acting the part of a district nurse and assisting the Indian women when they require it.\n\nI understand from Rev. Mr. Scott that the Methodist Missionary Society has made application to the Department for a house for Mrs. Howard. With regard to this I may say that it is a matter of difficulty to secure proper accommodation. We have at present under rental a small house for which we are paying $5.00 a month. Recently while I was at Cape Mudge I was informed that the owner, Charles Wilson, wants the house for himself and the teacher may be deprived of it. This point is one that is liable to occur and recur any time and I would be glad to recommend that a comfortable four roomed cottage be built providing the Indians will give a surrender of say half an acre of land on the reserve to be used for the purpose of housing Mrs. Howard or any other teacher that may succeed her.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 9, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have to inform you that the Department is favourably considering Mrs. Howard's application for an increase in salary while engaged in teaching the Cape Mudge Indian Day School. Mr. Agent Halliday, of Alert Bay, has been communicated with in this connection.\n\nThe Department feels that, in view of the splendid social service work that Mrs. Howard is doing, the Government grant might well be supplemented by a small payment by the Methodist church. If it is your practice to pay lady teachers a small stipend as missionaries, I am of the opinion that Mrs. Howard is a deserving case.\n\nNext year, I trust that the funds will be provided for the erection of a teacher's residence at Cape Mudge. In the interim, we are doing what we can to make it possible for Mrs. Howard to carry on with her splendid services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent,\nMethodist Indian schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa, September 9, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to inform you that Mrs. Florence Howard, teacher of the Cape Mudge Indian Day School, has applied to the Department for an increase in salary. This application was made through the church authorities. In view of the splendid report Mr. Inspector Cairns gave to the Superintendent of Indian Education, the Department is disposed to favourably consider Mrs. Howard's request. At present, she is receiving a salary of $800.00 per annum, plus any bonus provided by law. The Department has learned that the teacher is doing splendid work among the Indian children, is holding night classes, and is giving instruction in domestic science. The Department would be pleased to have your recommendation before increasing the salary of this teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nApril 9th,\n1930.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Cape Mudge Indian Day School.\n\nWe have received correspondence from our missionary at Cape Mudge, B.C., which suggests that there is some agitation for a change in the Indian School. We shall be much obliged if the Department will inform us regarding the progress of the work there and your wishes concerning the future of that school.\n\nYours most faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6386, File 805-1, part 1)\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nApril 12, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter dated April 3rd, asking for a special report regarding the services of Mrs. F. Howard, teacher at the Cape Mudge Indian Day School.\n\nMrs. Howard is not a certified teacher, but has given very faithful work at the school. The great criticism that I have to her school methods is that it is too much kindergarten for pupils of the age that she has there. Apart from the school work, her services have been extremely valuable to the Indians occupying the Cape Mudge village and those who visit there. Her influence has always been for good amongst them, and she has gone round helping the women to keep their houses tidy and clean, and has been of very great assistance to them in that way.\n\nUnfortunately, for some considerable time past there has been considerable friction between Mrs. Howard and the Rev. George Knox, the clergyman there, and this has interfered considerably with the results of her work. She has two daughters, one of whom is married and who lives with her husband in the house provided for the teacher. This has been the cause of a certain amount of friction, as some of the Indians object to son-in-law being there, while many of them are quite agreeable. As no complaints have ever been made to me on this matter, I do not take any part in it, as I realize that an Indian village is a very lonesome place for a white person, unless they have some of their own kind with whom they can associate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.M. Halliday)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nJanuary 22, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Rev. George Knox, of the United Church Marine Mission, dated January 16, enclosing a copy of a resolution which was passed by the Indians of Cape Mudge, a copy of which I am forwarding to you for your consideration.\n\nAs you are aware, in a former letter I stated that there had been a certain amount of friction at Cape Mudge, but Mrs. Howard is not a certified teacher, and does not seem to be able to advance the pupils beyond that of Grade 2, and I would consider that in the interests of the education of the children, there should be a change made, and a teacher with a Provincial certificate should be employed to take over the school. There are a number of pupils attending the school, and they are capable of having a great deal more work done with them than what has been done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.M.

For today our children want to go to school, and are there.\n\nBut we are sorry to have to say our children are almost at a stand still. Mrs. Howard the teacher, when she started here about ten years ago worked hard for a while, but now for some years, we notice she takes very little interest in our children and none of them are getting on as they should. There has been no school Inspector here for about two and a half years to see how things have been run. We also note the school is not being held proper hours.\n\nSo we are asking you to please see that we get a change of teacher, by the beginning of next fall term, but sooner if at all possible. A Certificate teacher, who is up to date, who can lead our children along in the modern way with the up to date system. We trust you will please take the necessary action in order to comply with our reasonable request, for the sake and progress of our Village.\n\nHoping to hear from you at your earliest convenience, we remain\n\nYours sincerely\n\nChief \"Billy Assu\"\nChief \"Johnnie Chickite\"\nOttawa, April 25th, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, with reference to the management at the Cape Mudge Indian Day School. I wish to quote extracts from the reports of the Department's Inspector:\n\n\"Marked success by the pupils since my last visit. They read well, spell correctly and are making progress in number work. Mrs. Howard is a faithful and efficient teacher. She is very resourceful. Manual work and, in fact, all work is highly satisfactory. Mrs. Howard is a hard worker. Her example should stimulate the Indians of the village. She keeps everything clean and tidy. Mrs. Florence Howard is a very versatile woman. She teaches the pupils much manual work, giving particular attention to writing, spelling and needle work. She presents her subjects in such a way that she enlists the attention of her pupils.\"\n\nRecently, the Department asked Mr. Indian Agent Halliday for a special report on Mrs. Howard's work. His reply reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"Mrs. Howard is not a certified teacher, but has given very faithful work at the school.

Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nReference 15/6/20018 dated January 20th, 1931.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith a report on the Cape Mudge Indian Day School. I understand that this report will be forwarded to Ottawa when you have added your remarks.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H. Barry\nCapt.\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools.\nMrs. Howard has had no training. She has been 9\u00bd years at Cape Mudge. She had some previous experience in Indian work outside British Columbia. Mrs. Howard has never attended Summer School. Mrs. Howard states that her health is good.\n\nThis school is not a success under Mrs. Howard at the present time whatever it may have been years ago. Please see special recommendation attached to this report.\n\nI have suggested to this teacher that she attend the next Provincial Summer School for Teachers in Victoria and that she take up a Primary course. Mrs. Howard, however, states that she is resigning at the end of the present school year and is then giving up teaching.\n\nI do not consider the general management of the school by the teacher to be satisfactory. This is no doubt due to the fact that the teacher has never had any training. If Mrs. Howard is to obtain results of a worth while nature, she should attend a Provincial Summer School for Teachers in Victoria this year. It is absolutely necessary for her to have a Primary Course there. I have done my best for her in the way of suggestion and have shown her a number of modern books which might help her to get better results. Mrs. Howard has no time table of lessons drawn up. Please see attached recommendation.\n\nMrs. Howard states that the school hours kept at Cape Mudge are from 9.30 to 11.30 and from 1 to 3 under an old arrangement made with the Indian Agent, Mr. Halliday.\nSpecial Recommendation Attached to\nReport on Cape Mudge Indian Day School\n\nIn accordance with the instructions issued to me by the Superintendent of Indian Education I am attaching this special recommendation to my Report on Cape Mudge Indian Day School.\n\nI do not believe that the services of Mrs Florence Howard are satisfactory. I consider that for the sake of the children at Cape Mudge a change should be made at the end of the present school year, especially if Mrs Howard is unwilling to take a Primary Course at the Provincial School for Teachers this summer. I have gone into the matter of her social service and missionary activity with the Missionary in charge of Cape Mudge.\n\nFrom what I could gather from the Rev Mr Knox this teacher is not of any considerable help in either of the above ways. I think it quite likely that should her services as teacher be retained a large number of children will be withdrawn from the school by their parents. Two children have been withdrawn now and are being educated by a private teacher.\n\nGerald H Barry\nInspector of Indian Schools\nJan. 16th, 1931.\n\nW. M. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed please find a letter which a Committee of our Indian men wished me to dictate for them.\n\nI might say the school situation here has been very unsatisfactory for some years, the children are not getting either the time or attention or proper training they should.\n\nI reported the matter last spring at our Conference, and our B.C. Committee saw the necessity of a change, and have asked for it, and no doubt this would have taken place, but relatives were involved.\n\nMrs. Howard never having had any training, never has properly taught the different grades. We know this by having sent our own girl for a time, she both neglected her studies and health.\n\nI also find that she sent some pupils up to Sardis School supposed to be in the fifth grade, but when they got into a standard school had to drop back some of them to the second grade. I am enclosing a photo, the two girls on the outsides have been going to this school for nearly seven years; they are in the fourth grade, but in many things they would have to drop back to the second.\n\nI enjoy the Indians very much and with their advancement in civilization they need more than an old form of Kindergarten school. They would go ahead if they had a chance.\n\nI appreciate very much Mr. Ditchburn what you have done to help these people since I came here about two and a half years ago; and I trust you will help to improve the present situation at an early date.\n\nWill be glad to hear from you with any suggestions you may have to offer for the betterment of things here.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"Geo.

Ditchburn, Commissioner,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Ditchburn:\n\nRe your letter #15/6/20015, dated January 20th, 1931.\n\nIn conversation with Missionaries, Teachers and Officials of the Department, I have referred to situations of a similar nature, to which you specially refer in connection with Cape Mudge, and have remarked, casually and in general terms, that sometimes children coming from an ungraded day school have to be demoted.\n\nIn this connection you refer to Cape Mudge \"pupils in Grade V at Coqualeetza when sent to Coqualeetza had to drop back to Grade II.\" When pupils have come from Cape Mudge School to Coqualeetza we have had to take the work of the pupil or the parent as to standing until they were tried out and properly standardized according to grade. In looking up the records I find the case of one boy who was put in Grade V and a girl who was placed in Grade IV. These on the office copy of the register, were crossed out and they were reduced and put in their proper rank which was Grade II. When questioned, new pupils sometimes state they are in a higher grade than they are entitled to, but that is not a reflection on nor a fault of the school teacher from whom they come. I have had no correspondence with the teach in question in regard to the grades but can frankly say that pupils coming from her school have not exaggerated their grade standing more than from other schools. I have had, at different times, pupils from the North who were supposedly ready to take the Eighth Grade for the Entrance examinations -- three within the last four years, who were good Sixth Grade pupils instead of Eighth Grade.\n\nUngraded day schools on Indian Reserves work at great disability. The children are often away with their parents for long periods, and upon returning to the school go into the Grade which they left. This spasmodic system discourages them as they have to remain for too long a period in the same grade, being outdistanced by those of the same age who commenced school at the same time but who have been able to attend regularly. I would not be surprised under such conditions a teacher might be tempted to stint his effort by promise of advancement. The pupilage from Cape Mudge is on the whole not different from the pupilage of any other Reserve.\n\nTrusting this explanation is satisfactory, and that it will not be necessary to bring my name into the affair as I am on friendly terms with both Missionary and Teacher.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) G.

As you know, I have been in the work for some 20 years, ten of which have been spent at Cape Mudge. Some time ago I was advised to take a rest from classroom work as my throat continues to give out.\n\nI have worked very...\nhard since coming to Cape Mudge, but I felt fully repaid during the Cairns visit when he told me what a pleasure it had always been to him to visit my school & he thanked me for the work I was doing both in the classroom & village. He asked me to carry on & not be discouraged. I regret that it is necessary for me to resign from the work & hope if I find it necessary to teach again that the Dept will open the way for me.\n\nI wish to express the pleasure I have had in working for the Dept, also to thank you for all your kindness & help during all the years I have been in your employ.\n\nWith best wishes\n\nYours sincerely\n\nMrs. Florence Howard\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Cape Mudge Indian Day School.\n\nI beg to inform you that on the 16th ultimo I received a letter from Rev. George Knox, Missionary at Cape Mudge Indian Reserve, Kwawkewlth Agency, pointing out that the conditions at the Indian Day School there were not what they should be, due to the fact that Mrs. Florence Howard, the teacher, had had no training in that profession, with the consequence that the pupils were making very little progress in their studies. A copy of Mr. Knox's letter and one from the Indians are attached hereto for your information. In order that I might know whether the facts stated by Mr. Knox were correct or not it was considered advisable to write to Rev. C. H. Raley, Principal of the Coqualeetza Residential School, on the subject, and the reply I received from him bears out Mr. Knox's contentions. A copy of Mr. Raley's letter is also attached hereto.\n\nIn view of the information obtained I took the opportunity of communicating with Capt. Gerald Barry, the newly appointed Inspector of Indian Schools, on the 20th ultimo, as he was then at Campbell River waiting to be released from the principalship of the Public School at that place, and I asked that before he came to Victoria he take the trip across to Cape Mudge and make an inspection of the Day School at that place and let me have a report. This he did and his report accompanies this communication.\n\nAs Mrs. Howard is resigning in June from the position.....\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nposition she has held for about nine years, I am of the opinion that a qualified certificated teacher be appointed to succeed her. Dr. Willis, Provincial Superintendent of Education, has informed me that we ought to be able to get a capable person for this school at $1080.00 per annum. While Mrs. Howard was nominated by the Methodist Church of Canada for appointment, I may say that yesterday I had a visit from the Rev. Arthur Barner, Superintendent of Missions of the United Church of Canada, and he authorized me to say that he would be quite agreeable that the Department should make its own appointment in this particular instance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Ditchburn.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nWED/AC\nMr. J. D. Sutherland,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMarch 10th,\n1936\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nRe: Cape Mudge Indian Day School\n\nI am not surprised at Captain Barry's attitude in regard to the Cape Mudge School and the discussion which is going on in the Vancouver Presbytery about putting a missionary-teacher at that point. Miss Hill, as a matter of fact, is the one teacher in our schools in British Columbia who was selected by Captain Barry himself, without any consultation with us. She is a good teacher and has done a very fine piece of work, but she is not the best teacher that we have in our schools in British Columbia, and she herself is not as enthusiastic about staying at Cape Mudge as Captain Barry's letter would seem to indicate.\n\nIn any re-arrangement involving the Cape Mudge School, the United Church will certainly do its utmost to place Miss Hill somewhere else. I have discussed the situation with her end she understands it perfectly. Meanwhile, I think you ought to know that no decision whatever has been reached in regard to the whole work of the Cape Mudge field for the Conference year beginning July 1st. The matter will be discussed at the annual meeting of our Board next week, and it may be that even then we cannot settle the problem. There is a possibility that Cape Mudge may again become the centre of one of our marine missions, and, in that event, the present school-teacher would not be disturbed.\n\nThanking you for bringing the matter to our attention,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6386, File 805-1, part 1)\nOur present arrangement at Cape Mudge seems very satisfactory, through the fact that our teacher, Miss Jean Hill, has her aged parents living with her in the teacherage which is located on the reserve. Their presence in the village undoubtedly has a good influence and so long as Miss Hill's services are satisfactory I would like to see this arrangement continue. I understand indirectly the United Church would be in favour of the appointment of a missionary-teacher at Cape Mudge, who would be responsible for Church services as well as teaching this school, but I would definitely state in my opinion this school has reached the point where it is a full-time position for a qualified teacher, and I do not think the teacher should be burdened with the responsibility of missionary work.\nEXTRACT from Inspector Barry's Report on his visit to the CAPE MUDGE INDIAN DAY SCHOOL on June 13, 1934.\n\nOriginal on File 156-6-6.\n\nThe work of this school continues to be very successful. Miss Hill's parents are living with her in the teacher's residence, a cottage near the school. They also take a great interest in the Indians. I am very well pleased with the present state of things at Cape Mudge. It would be very foolish indeed for the United Church to think of nominating a man for this school with the idea that he could also look after the missionary work. There is more than enough for both teacher and missionary to do. In some places, it may be best to have a missionary teacher; but this is certainly not the case here. I believe that the present local missionary is so reporting to the United Church authorities. This matter is mentioned here as there has been a move in the past to have a missionary take over this school, and the matter is quite likely to come up again this year.\nCoqualutza School,\nSardis, B.C.\nJuly 8, 1931\n\nMr. A.

(RG 10, Volume 6386, File 805-1 part 1)\nIt has been reported to me that the United Church are planning on making a change of teachers at Cape Mudge for the Day School there, in which a Minister-Teacher is to be appointed for this position. I am strongly opposed to this as Miss Hill's services have always been very satisfactory and in view of so much opposition to the contemplated change coming from the Indians and everyone in general, I am making a special report to the Department expressing my views opposing any change being made, and I would kindly ask the Department to not agree to any change until all the particulars are before them.\n\nM. S. Todd\nIndian Agent\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nJune 11, 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nIn my Monthly Report for May I mentioned the United Church was contemplating requesting the Department for a change of teachers at Cape Mudge School, and I suggested to the Department that no action be taken until the matter could be properly placed before them by this office.\n\nSince then I have received a communication from the Cape Mudge Indians in which they are strenuously objecting to Miss Hill's services being discontinued, more particularly because the Church have suggested to them that a Minister-Teacher take her place, so that the minister would be available to hold Church services at Cape Mudge, Campbell River and Quathiaski Cove.\n\nI am also informed by ministers who attended the United Church Conference recently held in Vancouver that the Church had in mind even extending the duties of the minister by placing a boat at his disposal at Quathiaski Cove so that he could serve a wider field than the places mentioned above.\n\nFirst, I am not unmindful that the services of a Minister would be most valuable at Cape Mudge, but I do not think the plan which the Church have in mind is workable at Cape Mudge, and furthermore I do not feel a Minister who would have other duties than teaching could possibly do justice to the education of the children. This contemplated change has caused considerable worry to this office, and I wish to be quite frank with the Department in expressing my views and therefore will go into detail in order that the Department will have the situation fully before them.\n\nThe Cape Mudge School is considered one of our best Day Schools; the attendance as shown by the Quarterly Returns is exceptionally good, and the Indians appreciate the value of an education and have given the Department fullest co-operation and support in having their children attend school regularly as well as assisting the teacher in every way possible. The size of the school has proven to us the necessity of a full-time teacher who has no other duties to perform, and if the teacher was required to hold three services as well as teach school, I am quite positive the school would suffer to a great extent.\n\nWe have a very splendid teacher in Miss Hill, who has given splendid service; she lives with her parents in the teacherage provided by the Department, and to lose her services at this time when she is liked by the Indians and receiving their support would undoubtedly be not in the best interests of the children.\n\nI have been advised the Indians held an indignation meeting some ten days ago and have protested to the Church against the proposed change, giving as their reasons their appreciation of what the Department is doing for them by providing a qualified teacher who is giving her whole time to their education and stating their views along the same lines as indicated and expressed by myself.\nI am also informed the Church upon receiving this objection from the Indians, arranged for Dr. Wilson, head of the Church Board, to meet them last night at Cape Mudge to see if he could not persuade them to accept the Church's views but at the time of writing I have not learned the outcome of this meeting.\n\nI understand there is a possibility of the Church suggesting to the Department that they pay a portion of the Minister-Teacher's salary in an effort to persuade the Department to accept their views so that the minister might be located at Cape Mudge to serve Campbell River, Quathiaski Cove and possibly other points in the district. While I am very much interested in economy where it is practical, yet this view does not change my opinion, and I am strongly opposed to any arrangement whereby the teacher employed at Cape Mudge will have other duties than attending to the education of the children.\n\nI would like to refer the Department to Inspector Barry's recent report in connection with this school in which he points out the undesirability of a change being made as suggested by the Church. I know from what knowledge I have from the views of the Indians expressed to me, that a change of this kind will be unacceptable to them and possibly lead to a lot of unpleasantness at Cape Mudge. Both Capt. Barry and myself have strived to raise the standard of our schools by our consistent efforts and personally I feel if this change is made it will be a step backward from what has been accomplished.\n\nWhile I do not wish to offer any suggestions to the Church in finding a solution to their problem, nevertheless there have been views expressed by a great many ministers that a more satisfactory arrangement could be made which would serve their interests equally as well if not better. If the Church should approach the Department to make the change that is suggested, I trust the Department will be able to convince them it would be a mistake to have an arrangement such as this at this time.\n\nWould the Department kindly take this letter into consideration and advise me their views as we do not wish any trouble arising at Cape Mudge when things are as satisfactory as they are at the present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nJune 12, 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nFurther to my letter of yesterday's date regarding the situation at Cape Mudge, I have had an opportunity of discussing this matter confidentially with Rev. L. Gillard, United Church minister at Alert Bay, who has just returned from Cape Mudge where he attended the meeting held by Dr. Wilson and the Indians in an effort to persuade the Indians to accept the proposed change of Rev. T. Colwell succeeding Miss Hill as teacher of the Cape Mudge Day School.\n\nAs the information imparted to me was more or less confidential, it being purely Church matters, I would appreciate if the Department would treat the Church views as such.\n\nMr. Gillard told me the Church's intention was purely to get the Department to assist in paying the Minister's salary. They have two plans in mind; the first is to get the Indians to agree to accept Rev. Colwell as teacher and for him to hold service at Cape Mudge only. The second plan is to have Mrs. Colwell appointed as teacher, leaving Mr. Colwell free to attend to the Church matters by holding services at Quathiaski Cove, Campbell River and Cape Mudge, as well as providing him with a boat to serve other outlying districts. They have a boat on the Arrow Lakes which is of no use to them there, and are planning to ship this to Vancouver and send it to Cape Mudge for this purpose.\n\nMr. Gillard told me confidentially that if Mr. Colwell was appointed as teacher in his opinion it would be a step backward as his teaching qualifications are not as high as those of Miss Hill. He also stated at the present time Mrs. Colwell is teaching in a private school in Vancouver and that her qualifications were satisfactory. He further stated the Indians asked Dr. Wilson at the meeting how she could hope to teach school when she has four or five young children of her own to care for, which to me seems quite logical when Mr. Colwell under these arrangements would be away from home on the boat most of the time.\n\nAt this meeting called by Dr. Wilson to interview the Indians only a few of them would turn out, and those who did go stated if the Church insisted on this change being made they would receive very little co-operation from the Indians.\n\nFor the Department's information, Mr. Gillard is familiar with local conditions and he told me he knew the plan was not workable nor in the best interests of the Indians, and stated he told the Conference this when he expressed his own views to them recently in Vancouver. He also stated Dr. Wilson told him as well as the Indians that he personally did not approve of it, but that his hands were tied by Rev. Kenneth Beaton in Toronto who is insisting that this arrangement be made.\nMr. Gillard also informed me he and Dr. Wilson visited Mr. Walker, late missionary-teacher of Cape Mudge to get his views, as well as many others in the district who are interested in the welfare of the Indians, and every-one in expressing his opinion said the Church would be making a grave mistake in letting Miss Hill go and making a change as in their opinion it would be a step backward and they would not receive the co-operation of the Indians. They felt this would undo the progress that has been made through the splendid co-operation of the Indians with the Department and the Church in the past.\n\nI understand Dr. Wilson returned to Victoria last evening where a further meeting was to be held by the Board in respect to the suggested change.\n\nMr. Gillard informed me that unless they could find a position for Miss Hill they would not appoint Mr. Colwell to this position, but they had in mind a position for her at the Coqualeetza Residential School.\n\nThis office is very much concerned because we can see through the attitude of the Indians; should a change be made along the lines indicated the work at this school would be retarded and much unpleasantness prevail, and personally I would not care to take the responsibility of anything that would happen through the outcome of such a change.\n\nThe Indians in their objection pointed out to Dr. Wilson that a Minister be appointed a school teacher, he would be called upon to hold funeral services when any deaths occurred in the vicinity and that would mean the closing of the school under these circumstances.\n\nAs far as I can gather, everyone whom Dr. Wilson consulted who knows local conditions, informed him the suggested change the Church is contemplating is unworkable and would not be in the best interests of the Indians or the district. I am told most of the members of the local Board wished to see a minister located at Cape Mudge, where they have a good manse to serve the entire district; this arrangement would be quite separate from the school. They feel there is a large field to cover which I know is correct, and would require the full-time services of a Minister to carry out this work, but that the Rev. K. Beaton is not in favour of it on the grounds of economy; he is trying to combine the two positions into one with that view in mind.\n\nI would strongly recommend to the Department that they try and convince the Church of the necessity of retaining Miss Hill's services, and would appreciate if they would kindly advise me as quickly as possible their views so that I may notify the Indians and so relieve the tension which has been created at Cape Mudge. When I received this full information from Mr. Gillard I felt it was so serious I communicated with the Department by night letter which doubtless they have received by now.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, June 20, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI would refer you to official letter of the 12th instant, regarding a contemplated change in the teaching services at the Cape Mudge Indian Day School. The Department has received a protest, on the part of the Indians, objecting to Miss Hill's services being discontinued, more particularly because it has been suggested to them that a minister-teacher take her place, so that the minister would be available to hold church services at Cape Mudge, Campbell River and Quathiaski Cove, and that a boat be placed at his disposal, so that he could serve a wider field than the places mentioned above. The Indians feel that a minister who would have other duties than teaching could not do justice to the work in the school.\n\nThe contemplated change in teaching services appears to have caused considerable worry to the local Agent. The Indians desire that Miss Hill be continued as teacher, as she is liked by the parents and is receiving their support. I understand that the Indians have protested to the officials of the United Church in British Columbia.\n\nI should be pleased to be advised, at an early date, the arrangements it is proposed by the United Church authorities to recommend, in regard to the teaching service at Cape Mudge for the coming school year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

We are therefore not aware of any proposed arrangement by the United Church authorities regarding the appointment of a missionary teacher.

Sutherland,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nI have your letters of June 12th and 20th concerning Cape Mudge, and I have delayed replying until some of the difficulties in the situation could be adjusted.\n\nIt is true that the Settlement Committee of the British Columbia Conference have appointed an Ordained Missionary Teacher to the Cape Mudge field, and that they propose to provide him with a boat enabling him to give more efficient service to Campbell River and other nearby points. Most of the objections raised by the Indians are groundless. Rev. T. C. Colwell, B.A., is not only a University graduate, but he holds a Teacher's certificate and has taught in both Ontario and Alberta. His wife is also an experienced Teacher. Her original certificate was obtained in Scotland, and is the highest grade of Teacher's certificate obtainable in Scotland. Having examined it carefully, I think it would be the equivalent of two years in the University of Toronto with one year additional at Normal School; or in other words, it would be what we in Ontario call a First Class Permanent certificate. My hope is that Mrs. Colwell will be nominated as the Teacher, although that was not the intention of the Settlement Committee in B.C. That would ensure not only efficient teaching in the School, but remove the fear which the Indians apparently have rising out of experiences with Missionary Teachers in the past, that the School would be closed when the Missionary receives week-day calls to other points for funerals, etc.\n\nThe one unsolved problem up to date is the finding of a place for Miss Jean Hill. I have explained to our representatives in B.C. that Miss Hill was an appointee of Captain Barry, and that it is very important that a School should be secured for her. We have no Indian Day School open in B.C. this year to which she could be appointed, and I am wondering if there is any School where the Department makes the appointment that is likely to be open.\nMiss Hill is, as you know, a Saskatchewan trained Teacher, but she has done excellent work at Cape Mudge and is worthy of every consideration.\n\nI expect to be in Ottawa early next week, and to discuss this situation, along with a number of others, with you.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nKJB:BJ\nOttawa, July 10, 1936.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd ultimo, the Department is approving the appointment of Rev. T. C. Colwell as teacher of the Cape Mudge Indian Day School, to succeed Miss Jean Hill. Salary will be allowed him at the rate of $90 a teaching month.\n\nI enclose Staff Questionnaire, which I would appreciate your forwarding to Mr. Colwell and requesting him to complete same and send to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B.A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nThe United Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. W.,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, July 10, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department understands that arrangements have been made for the employment of Miss Jean Hill at one of the Indian residential schools conducted under the auspices of the United Church of Canada.\n\nOn the nomination of the Church authorities, the Department is approving the appointment of Rev. T. G. Colwell as teacher of the Cape Mudge Indian Day School, to begin duties on September first, next. He will be allowed salary at the rate of $90 a teaching month.\n\nMr. Colwell is not only a University graduate, but he holds a Teacher's certificate and has taught in both Ontario and Alberta. His wife is also an experienced teacher.\n\nPlease give him every possible assistance.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. S.

Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nJuly 21, 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nThis is to acknowledge your letter dated Ottawa, July 10th, No. 156-6-1 advising that the Department has approved of the appointment of Rev. T.C. Colwell as teacher of the Cape Mudge Day School to succeed Miss Jean Hill.\n\nIt is noted his duties are to begin on September 1st next, and a salary allowed at the rate of $90.00 per teaching month.\n\nMr. Colwell will be given every assistance possible in connection with his new duties at the Cape Mudge Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nSeptember 18, 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nIn an excerpt from a letter received today from Mr. T.C. Colwell, the teacher at the Cape Mudge Day School, he is requesting to know if it is agreeable to the Department for his children to attend the Indian Day School at Cape Mudge. It is noted from Mr. Colwell's letter there is a white school at the top of the hill which is a short distance away.\n\nWould the Department please advise me their wishes in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, Sept. 25, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, regarding the request of Reverend T. C. Colwell, that permission be granted for his children to attend the Cape Mudge Indian Day School.\n\nAs you state there is a white school a short distance away, the Department is not aware of any reason why this man's children could not attend that school. The Cape Mudge Indian School is for Indian children only, and, unless there is some very special reason, the Department would not be prepared to grant this request. You might take up this matter with Mr. Colwell, ascertain his reasons and report to the Department, when the matter will receive further consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nM. S. Todd, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay,\nB. C.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of September 25th last, No. 156-6-1 in reference to the request of Reverend T.C. Colwell that permission be granted for his children to attend the Cape Mudge Indian Day School, I have enquired from Mr. Colwell his reasons for this request, and he states as follows:\n\n\"I would like our two youngest daughters, aged 7 and 6 respectively, under my own influence and instruction.\n\n\"The hill our children would have to climb is more like a miniature mountain and would be bad in the rainy and snowy winter, especially for the older child who is not too strong. It would mean tutoring them for a portion of the school year; the full distance would be possibly 1\u00bd miles.\"\n\nIn commenting upon Mr. Colwell's request, I feel I should point out to the Department that the Cape Mudge Day School is only a small building and that the number of Indian children attending this school already overcrowds the available space, and personally I cannot see how there is room for any more seating capacity.\n\nWould the Department kindly advise me their wishes in respect to Mr. Colwell's request for his children to attend the Cape Mudge Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, November 4th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 24th ultimo, it is difficult for the Department to decide whether or not Mr. Colwell's children should attend the Cape Mudge Indian Day School.\n\nIt should be kept in mind that this school is intended primarily for the Indian children and, if there is not accommodation for the Colwell children, they should attend a White school. If, however, you wish to make an exception in the case of the older child, who is stated to be not too strong, the Department will have no objection to your doing so.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nM. S. Tedd, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nREPORT ON KWAKWEWLTH AGENCY FOR MONTH OF MARCH 1937.\n\nThe Cape Mudge Day School is located at the village of Cape Mudge; it is about 25 or more years old, built by the Department and was redecorated in 1936 both interior and exterior. It is modern in every respect and has always been one of our most progressive day schools. I regret however, owing to a change of teachers, the progress of the pupils has been retarded and I would recommend to the Department a change of teachers be contemplated. The Department is paying the maximum salary and I feel the present arrangement is not satisfactory. There are 32 pupils now on the school register. The school is under the auspices of the United Church of Canada.\n\nM.S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON KEAWKELTH AGENCY FOR MONTH OF MARCH 1937.\n\nThe Day schools at Campbell River, Cape Mudge, and Alert Bay are in splendid shape and a real credit to the Department. While the Missionary schools at Village Island, Kingcome Inlet, Quatsino and Smiths Inlet which were built by various Missions with assistance from the Department are in fair state of repair, they are difficult to administrate. I feel the Department should own these schools and have full administrative powers as the buildings are on reserves. I would recommend if and when funds are available the Department should purchase any equity the Missions may have in these buildings to avoid any future complications which may arise between the Indians and interested parties.\n\nM. S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 10, 1937.\n\nDear Dr. Dorey:\n\nOn December 8, 1936, the Department wrote Reverend Mr. Beaton with regard to the Cape Mudge Indian Day School. At that time we enclosed a copy of Mr. Barry's report regarding his inspection of the Cape Mudge School on November 23rd, 1936. In order that you may have complete information, I enclose another copy of this report.\n\nIn his monthly report for March, 1937, Indian Agent Todd writes as follows:\n\n\"The Cape Mudge Day School is located at the village of Cape Mudge; it is about 25 or more years old, built by the Department and was redecorated in 1936, both interior and exterior.

On visits to reserves, I inspected the Day Schools at Kingcome Inlet, Village Island, Cape Mudge and Campbell River as well as Quatsino. The Village Island and Quatsino Schools have closed on May 31st. Two resignations have been received from teachers in the agency and have been forwarded to the Department.

I feel the last year has been very satisfactory from an educational point of view, and that good progress has been made in all the schools.

Todd, Indian Agent\nfor the month of\nOCTOBER 1941.\n\nSir: I beg to submit herewith the following report on this Agency for the month of October, 1941.\n\nPERSONNEL\n\nAll employees have been on duty during the month of October. Mrs. C.L. Goodrich was appointed teacher of the Cape Mudge Indian Day School, and took up her duties at the beginning of the month. No other new appointments were made.\n\nM.S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nEDUCATION:\n\nOn the 24th of September, Captain Barry arrived at Alert Bay and inspected the Indian Summer School as well as St. Michael's Residential School. A report by myself to the Department on the Summer School will be made shortly as requested by Major B.M. D.M. MacKay Indian Commissioner.\n\nAs the Cape Mudge and Campbell River Day Schools are supposed to open on October 1st, I regret I cannot make any comment on these schools to date I have not been notified that teachers have been appointed. It is hoped the Department will do everything possible to get these particular schools opened as the children are in the villages and ready to attend. In respect to the Quatsino Indian Day School the same situation exists there as I have not been notified of any teacher being appointed; however in this particular school it is not quite so important as the pupils have not all returned to the village as yet.\n\nI am feeling rather upset in respect to Miss Uphill, teacher of the Campbell River School. In her case she was quite willing to remain there provided the Department gave her an increase in salary to cover her increased cost of accommodation, and personally I think she was entitled to it, but instead of giving her the increase, she was permitted to be transferred to the Nanaimo Day School at an increased salary, which resulted in the Campbell River School being left without a teacher and the necessity of breaking in a new one.\n\nM.S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\n29th November 1941.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nDuring the latter part of October, I visited the Cape Mudge Indian Day School and met the new teacher, Mrs. Goodrich. After discussing the work with her and giving her what help I could, I had grave doubts in my mind as to whether she would make a success, and feeling this way I particularly tried to assist her with some of her supposed problems which she presented to me.\n\nOn November 24th last I again visited this school, and was immediately told by Mrs. Goodrich that she was leaving the end of this week and asking me if I had received her letter, which had evidently arrived after I had left the office. She seemed very much upset, and in a very nervous condition, so much so that I immediately became worried about her. She has been living alone in the teacherage, and whether this has anything to do with it or not I cannot say, but I am afraid it has. After talking with her I told her that both she and the Department were required to give thirty days notice, and asked her if she could carry on until Christmas. She informed me she would think it over and if I did not hear from her on Wednesday the 26th I would know she was staying until Christmas time. However on Thursday morning I received the following wire: \"Leaving Cape Mudge November 29th; letter follows\".\n\nHad there been sufficient time to send a wire to stop payment of her last month's salary cheque, I would have done so, but I felt the cheque had already been issued and no doubt mailed from Ottawa.\n\nIt might be as well for me to give the Department my views as to what has transpired in Cape Mudge and caused the resignation of this teacher. First, I do not think Mrs. Goodrich felt that she had the ability to teach the higher grades in the classroom, and it became a great worry to her. Secondly, she did not appear to get on with the Indians, and in my opinion she is to blame for this as she refused to have anything to do with the parents; I do not think she likes Indians and always seemed to be looking for trouble. She was not happy in the teacherage, and complained about the building.\n\nThe Cape Mudge village, as the Department knows, is one of our best, and to have a problem with the school is working not only to the disadvantage of the village itself but to everything connected with the Cape Mudge people, as they have always been very proud of their Church and the education of their children. That is why I feel more attention should be given to this school possibly than to some others. When Miss Hill was teaching there and living with her parents in the teacherage, it was an ideal arrangement but from the time the Church moved this family out there has been nothing but grief, and I would like to see them come back if at all possible. Miss Hill is a good teacher, is well liked.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6386, File 805-1, part 1)\nwell liked by the Indians, and her people have a very good influence in the community life of that place. When I received Mrs. Goodrich's wire stating she was leaving the following night, I wired to Miss Hill at Port Simpson asking her if she would consider a transfer back to Cape Mudge, and am this morning in receipt of a message from her stating if this was approved by the Department she would consider a transfer if full transportation costs were paid, as she could not afford to move otherwise.\n\nIf this was arranged, and Miss Hill transferred back to Cape Mudge, possibly Miss Marguerite Stevens of Aostak, Manitoba, about whom I wrote you recently, who is United Church, might be given the position at Port Simpson now held by Miss Hill.\n\nI think I should tell the Department also that a great deal of our trouble in Cape Mudge village is on account of the missionaries who have been there during the past few years. The United Church have now there a Reverend and Mrs. McConnell, who have been successively for years; these elderly people mean well, but it is hopeless to have them trying to minister to young people, and the result has been that it is not only making it difficult for the teacher but it is disorganizing and disrupting the whole village life. Mr. and Mrs. Hill have in the past done as much practical missionary work at Cape Mudge as any missionary, and in my opinion if this family would return to the village the resident missionary could be removed and services held intermittently by a transient clergyman, if the Church has no younger men available for these positions.\n\nNo doubt the school will now have to be closed until after the Christmas holidays, but I would kindly ask you to take up the matter with Mr. Bunt, Superintendent of Missions for the United Church, and see if some arrangement cannot be made to revivify the Cape Mudge situation and have Miss Hill and her people moved back to this village.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.S.

Bunt, Superintendent of Missions, United Church of Canada, and Inspector Barry were present. During this conference the Reverend Mr. Bunt intimated to me that he had in mind the nomination of a well-qualified teacher for the Cape Mudge School for the academic year commencing in October, 1943, and he further stated that he would forward to the Department through the United Church officials the name of a suitable teacher to fill the vacancy at Cape Mudge for the second half of the present academic year from January to June, 1943, inclusive.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

Moyer as temporary teacher at the Cape Mudge Indian Day School. As his services will terminate on June 30, 1942, I thought it would be advisable to bring the matter to your attention now in order to give you plenty of time to secure a qualified teacher, if possible, for the year 1942-43. As you are aware, due to unavoidable circumstances this school was only open for part of the current academic year and consequently I am anxious to have it in operation for the whole of the next academic year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

You will remember that I did all I could for him when he called on me in Vancouver in December. It would not appear that he has put into effect the suggestions then made for his assistance, and I very much doubt that he will ever make a teacher. He lacks professional training and is in fact the second teacher here this academic year.\n\nMr. Moyer has not gained any marked degree of control of his pupils. The failure in discipline is due to the teacher and not to the children, who are very easy to handle. I would ask you to refer to my last report on this school dated March 11th, 1941, following my visit to the school the preceding day.\n\nThe school was found to be in a most untidy condition, papers and orange peel all around the building and bits of paper all over the schoolroom floor.\n\nMr. Moyer's appointment was I believe of a temporary nature, and I would recommend that his services be not continued after the close of the present academic year in June, 1942. He is I believe a well meaning young man but he is not suited to be a teacher and should seek other work in my opinion.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) Gerald H.

Todd, Indian Agent, Alert Bay, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, enclosing copies of letters received from the teachers of the Cape Mudge and Campbell River Schools with reference to the school term.\n\nThe Department feels that we allow reasonable holidays and that the total length of the school term is not too long. We do not consider it necessary to strictly adhere to the provincial basis. Under these circumstances we are not prepared, at the present time, to make any change in the length of the term.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI am in receipt of copy of a letter of Mr. Indian Agent Todd's of the 10th instant addressed to you enclosing the protest of Mrs. Wilson of Cape Mudge Indian Day School and Miss Hill of the Campbell River Indian Day School against the school calendar for Indian Day Schools.\n\nNo doubt the Department is aware that these two teachers are teaching at adjoining schools which accounts for their identical letters of the same date.\n\nNo objection has been received from any other Agency or teachers in the Province regarding the period of the opening of Indian Day or Residential Schools, and I would recommend that no action be taken in the matter in this case as to operate the schools on a strictly Provincial basis would probably create some difficulty in respect to those on Catholic Reserves where certain Holydays of obligation are observed.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nJuly 10th, 1944.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Canada.\n\nThe enclosed copies of letters have been received from Mrs. Margaret Wilson of Cape Mudge Indian Day School, and Miss Jenn Hill of the Campbell River School, and will be self-explanatory.\n\nThe same question has been in my mind for sometime as I, personally, have seen the difficulties the teachers have experienced over this same matter. I feel myself if the school calendar for the Indian Day School could be established the same as the Provincial in each Province, it would clarify and, no doubt, help attendance, and remove any thought of discrimination.\n\nPossibly the department would give this their consideration and advise me accordingly.\n\nEnc. 1,\nc.c. - Commissioner's Office, Vancouver, B.C.\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent.\nCape Mudge Teacherage,\nQuathiaski Cove, B.C.,\nJune 30th, 1944.\n\nMr. M.G. Todd,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Todd:\n\nThe closing of Indian Day Schools one week later than the Provincial Schools, has brought to the fore a question that has been in my mind for sometime. Since we follow the same course of studies as the Provincial Schools, would it not be better for us to follow the same dates of opening and closing school?\n\nI have found that whenever we re-open a few days earlier or close a few days later than the other schools, there is a very strong feeling of resentment among the pupils and in some cases among their parents too. I fully appreciate the fact that the department wishes the children to attend school as many days as possible during the year; but the children, and some of their parents, seem to feel that it is a matter of discrimination against them simply because they are Indian children. This is particularly the case, when, as at Cape Mudge, there are a number of Provincial School in the same district.\n\nWould it be possible for you to take this matter up with the department, because, in my opinion, opening and closing school on different dates from the Provincial Schools has a detrimental effect upon our work.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(signed) Margaret Wilson.\nCampbell River, B. C.,\nJune 30th, 1944.\n\nMr. M. S. Todd,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Todd:\n\nWill you please explain why the school calendar for the Indian Day School is not the same as the Provincial? As we have the same Inspector, Course of Study and the pupils are expected to have the same standards as the grades in the Provincial schools, it would seem only reasonable that we have the same teaching days.\n\nI would appreciate an explanation not only for myself but also for several of my pupils and their parents who have asked me about this matter.\n\nThanking you for your help.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(signed) Jean Hill.\nREPORT ON KASKELITH INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE, 1944.\n\nEducation:\n\nAll schools in this Agency have now been closed for the summer holidays with the exception of St. Michael's Indian Residential School where a few pupils remain under the supervision of a few members of the staff. For the department's information I wish to advise you the following teachers have written me stating it is their intention to return to their respective schools at the beginning of the new term, September 1st, 1944; Mrs. Jane Massey, Principal Alert Bay Indian Day School; Miss Madeline McGill, teacher senior room Alert Bay Indian Day School; Mrs. Margaret Wilson, teacher Cape Mudge Indian Day School. In connection with the Campbell River Indian Day School I hope to have a communication from Miss Jean Hill shortly to the effect that she will also return as our teacher there for the next academic year. In connection with St. Michael's Indian Residential School it has been reported to me there are many changes this term as well as at the Preventorium where our matron has resigned, as she is being married.\n\nM.S.

Yeatman as teacher of the Campbell River Indian Day School and as Mrs. Yeatman is a very splendid teacher we are very fortunate in again obtaining her services. On December 30th, 1944, this office was advised by Mrs. M. Wilson, teacher of the Cape Mudge Indian Day School, that she had resigned, and it is presumed her resignation was sent to Rev. W.P. Bunt, Superintendent of Home Missions, United Church of Canada, Vancouver. Previous to receiving this notice from Mrs. Wilson I had been informed by her that Rev. T.F. Moore, United Church minister located at Cape Mudge, was interfering with her school work to such an extent that unless this ceased she would have no alternative but to resign. As Mrs. Wilson is one of our best teachers and I being personally familiar with the circumstances referred to by Mrs. Wilson, I reported the matter fully to Major D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, Vancouver, enclosing a statement made by Mrs. Wilson, and requested that the matter be taken up with Rev. Bunt, as I was sure Mrs. Wilson was not to blame in any way. I might state I have written to Mrs. Wilson requesting her to stay on until June 30th next, and informed her that Rev. Moore informed me he had resigned from the Church and was leaving Cape Mudge at the end of December, 1944, to study medicine in the United States. To date I have not had any further reply. As the department is aware, Miss M. McGill, teacher of the senior room in the Alert Bay Indian Day School, ceased her duties on December 31st, 1944. I am again drawing it to their attention with the hope that every effort will be made to re-open this classroom as soon as possible. I have forwarded one application to the Commissioner's Office, with a hope that we may be successful in obtaining the services of a teacher.\n\nM.S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nAlert Bay, B.

To me, he is just plain queer - he has a chip on his shoulder all the time. From the time I arrived, he painted this whole situation black and he hasn't a good word for anyone. I avoided words with him until Sunday, then he went just a bit too far and I told him straight that I was not working under him. I told him that I was nominated by Mr. Bunt and that I came here to run the school and I was working directly under you. He bothered me so much that I went down to Vancouver last Wednesday to see Mr. Bunt. I just missed him as he had left for Montreal.

T.T. Moore, United Church Minister, located at Cape Mudge Reserve.\n\nDuring the few years Mr. Moore has been Minister at Cape Mudge Village he has made himself very disagreeable towards our teachers; so much so that we have been unable to keep good teachers for any length of time. He has quarrelled and made their lives so unhappy that some of them have resigned without completing their term.\n\nThis year the Rev. W.P. Bunt, Superintendent of Home Missions, United Church of Canada, recommended that Mrs. B.M. Kitchenmaster be transferred from Kitsegukla to Cape Mudge School. Upon her arrival Mr. Moore evidently started to quarrel with her. This was before school opened. On August 29th Mrs. Kitchenmaster wired me her resignation. I immediately put in a long distance phone call, which incidently cost the Department $7.85, to try and persuade her to remain there and open the school, pointing out that we could not obtain another teacher. This she finally agreed to do with the understanding that the Department take the matter of his interference up with the Church Authorities.\n\nI enclose you, herewith, copy of a letter I have just received from Mrs. Kitchenmaster, which will be self-explanatory, and which was written prior to her wire of resignation. A serious quarrel evidently took place after this letter was written which forced her to resign.\n\np.t.o.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6386, File 805-1, part 1)\nFor years I have been trying to deal with this problem believing it might be of a local petty nature, but am now convinced that it is a deliberate attempt on the part of Rev. Moore to interfere with the duties of the teacher. Mr. Moore has the idea that the teachers have to take orders from him and that the Department have no say in the administration of Day Schools. I have pointed out to Mr. Moore on many occasions that the administration of the Schools comes entirely within the jurisdiction of the Department, and have tried to get him to see that his duties there are purely ministerial and that the administration of the school is the responsibility of the Department; but he evidently thinks otherwise and insists on ordering the teacher around as he sees fit.\n\nI think the kindest thing to say is that the situation has become hopeless and through his activities the efficiency of this school is deteriorating. This is one of the best attended schools we have and I should like to see it running smoothly and the children able to have the benefit of a good education, but this cannot be done when the administration of the school is being interfered with unnecessarily by the local minister continually quarrelling with the teachers.\n\nI am asking that the Department take this whole matter up with the Rev. Bunt with a view to cleaning up this situation for once and all. There is no object in allowing it to go on, and so far as I can see there is no hope of it improving so long as Mr. Moore remains at Cape Mudge.\n\nEnc. 1,\n\nRev. W. P.

Kitchenmaster, minister and teacher respectively, both living at Cape Mudge Village, I now wish to enclose you, herewith, copies of further correspondence received from both which will be self-explanatory.\n\nIn view of the clash which seems to be between personalities I do not consider the Department can take any action other than report the matter to the Rev. W. P. Bunt, Superintendent of Home Missions, United Church of Canada; as I consider it is his responsibility to clear up this situation and not allow it to continue.\n\nThis Indian village is one of the finest in B. C., and it does seem too bad that the interests of the school and the Indian people themselves should be subjected to such conduct and unpleasantness which, no doubt, will have unbeneficial effect on their lives.\n\nI have now come to the conclusion that as there has been so much harm done in this village that it would be better in the interests of all concerned that both Rev. Moore and Mrs. Kitchenmaster be transferred elsewhere and more suitable successors appointed to succeed them.\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent.\n\nEncs.\nQuathiaski Cove, B. C.,\nSept. 6, 1946.\n\nM. S.

Dr. Reddan has advised me that this man's case has been pending for sometime and will be dealt with as soon as Rev. Bunt returns from Montreal.\n\nHe has acquired a very peculiar attitude toward everything and everybody. If I speak well of anyone, it is just too bad for me. If I take an optimistic view of anything, he sees no good.\n\nWe have had an open clash. I told him a few things very plain. He certainly is living very wrong in his thought world. Certainly we cannot both remain in this small village and if it is for me to go, I will do so at the end of the month. One could not possibly cooperate with a man like him. I sometimes wonder if he is just responsible for what he says.\n\nThe stoves here are not up to much. The range in the kitchen is hopeless. I have been wondering if the chimney has something to do with it. I bought new pipes for the stove in the front room as the pipes were badly rusted and I was afraid of fire. I was fortunate in being able to purchase a two burner Coleman gas stove at the B. C. Packers to cook on. I bought a cord of wood but I would be so pleased if you bought me an oil burner.\n\nThis is a lovely little spot. The yard can be made very pretty and the cottage has possibilities.

However I am not at all responsible for opinions and notions that she may have from time to time. Up to the date of your letter to me I have had little time to see her at all let alone bother her in any way. Peter Kelly was here for her first four days and then I was away in Vancouver and only returned for Dr. Le-Violette's visit. During the time of his visit we were very occupied. After that I went away until two days ago for Scout Camp.\n\nI think that if you look into the matter you will find that there are some other causes at the root of her disturbances. Probably the main external cause is the fact that she has not got the authority over the people here that she had up north and also that they cannot be bullied in the same way. Her statement that she had an Agent removed up north failed to impress them at all here, for example.\n\nOne point that may have been the source of irritation which ---- expression against me by her was the fact that Jean Hill payed us a short visit during the vacation and was joyfully received in the village. Naturally her visit was purely social and if she read anything into it you yourself should know how little there would be to that.\n\nSpeaking from a personal angle though I sincerely hope that there is not going to be any trouble here and for my part I shall do all that is possible to keep the peace, and should the need be will offer you my fullest support. However she has arrived with the beligerent idea that she is here to reform the village and the Agency and lastly the school.\n\nAgain I should like to put your mind at rest by reaffirming my desire to mind my own business and smooth over a troubled village.\n\nIndian Affairs.

C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour file 151-15-1& 156-6-1\n\nYour letter of the 18th inst. with reference to alleged interference with the teacher, Mrs. Kitchenmaster at Cape Mudge Indian Day School, by the United Church Minister, Mr. T.T. Moore, is acknowledged. I enclose a further letter dated the 18th inst. received from Mr. Todd.\n\nIt was fully expected that Mrs. Kitchenmaster's arrival at Cape Mudge as teacher would be followed by complaints, although it was thought that it would more likely involve the Indian Agent than the Missionary.\n\nAs you are aware, Mrs. Kitchenmaster was appointed as teacher at Kitsegukla Indian Day School in the Babine Agency by your letter of July 12, 1945 (file 151-15-1) on the recommendation of the United Church Board of Home Missions. She was stated to have a Saskatchewan 1st class permanent certificate, several years teaching experience and interested in dramatics and outdoor sports.\n\nHer arrival at this school was followed by a series of complaints by her and she was finally interviewed by Inspector Coleman on January 24th, past, and he reported that he found her most vindictive and unreasonable with very little grounds for complaint, and further that she insisted that she would order supplies when she wished, without authorization, and we would pay the bill, and she would also proceed to Prince Rupert, closing the school, without reference to the Indian Agent or anyone else, and much more along the same lines. The\nInspector found later on this inspection that she had endeavoured to stir up, without success, a revolt against the Department by Miss Brierly, teacher at Glen Vowell, with a view to her making heavy demands on us. There was no evidence of dramatics or playground activities at her school at this time. She is a very stout woman and there is little indication of any physical activity. Apparently she has done very little teaching since her marriage.\n\nThe Inspector discussed this teacher with the Reverend Bunt, Superintendent of Home Missions in Vancouver, on his return, expressing the opinion that she was quite unsuitable for our work. However, the Department advised on June 26, 1946 (file 156-8-1) that the Board of Home Missions had recommended her transfer to Cape Mudge School and this had been approved.\n\nWe have no details of the dispute between the teacher and the missionary but are aware that relations between the Agent and the missionary were somewhat strained some time ago, although nothing has been heard on the subject lately. Knowing Mrs. Kitchenmaster it is understandable that conflict would arise between her and the Missionary and in referring the Agent's letter of the 5th inst. to Mr. Bunt it was suggested that her statements be accepted with considerable caution.\n\nIn view of the Church's nomination of this woman and that her quarrel is with their own Missionary I am of the opinion it is a matter that should be dealt with by them. Mrs. Kitchenmaster will continue to be troublesome and I do not think we should go out of our way to retain her services. It is probably only a matter of time before Mr. Tod will be insisting on her removal.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nenc.\nSept. 26, 1946\n\nDear Reverend Bunt;\n\nI enclose a further letter dated the 18th inst. with enclosures, received from Mr. Indian Agent Todd regarding the difficulties that have arisen between Mrs. B.M.

M. Kitchenmaster with the reverend W.P. Hunt, Supt. of United Church Missions in B.C., and he agrees that while their missionary, the Reverend T.T. Moore, may have contributed to the difficulties that have arisen with this teacher, she is no doubt a difficult individual. It is very questionable whether we should make any effort to retain her except on a very temporary basis.\n\nI have asked Agent Todd if she has reconsidered her resignation.\n\nfor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nmh\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nI have just returned from an inspection trip to the southern part of my Agency and while there inspected the Cape Mudge Indian Day School.\n\nI interviewed Mrs. Kitchenmaster, teacher, whose resignation had previously been forwarded Ottawa, and wish to report that she discontinued teaching on October 18th. Mrs. Kitchenmaster informed me she would be leaving Cape Mudge the following day proceeding to Vancouver, but would let me have her forwarding address later. Please arrange for her to be paid up until October 18th, 1946, and no longer.\n\nAs Mrs. Kitchenmaster is no longer in the employ of the Department it would seem best the least said the better. However, in view of her conduct and treatment of the children in the school, I am advising the Department that it would not be in our best interests to ever consider employing her at any future date. We are very fortunate that she has resigned. It is regretted the school is now closed, but in my opinion it is better for the school to be closed than carried on under her supervision.\n\nAs this is one of our best villages I hope every effort will be made to find a suitable teacher at an early date.\n\n(M.

At the time the Indian school, due to its size, could not accommodate all of the 43 pupils seeking admission. In the hope that the senior pupils would be admitted to the Provincial school the Indian school continued to operate on a regular basis by excluding the senior group. Towards the end of October we were still corresponding with the Provincial authorities. At this time the Indian school teacher made an arrangement with Mr. D.K. Gilchrist, who was visiting the United Church Missionary at that point, to take the grade 7 and 8 pupils in the school for two hours in the afternoon after the regular classes were dismissed so that they would not drop too far behind in their studies. Unfortunately she did not inform this office of her action until December because she hoped that the pupils concerned would soon be admitted to the Provincial school. After carrying on for some time on a voluntary basis Mr. Gilchrist felt that he should receive some remuneration for his services but continued to teach until December 23rd.\n\nIt is realized that the Department has no legal responsibility with regard to granting any remuneration to Mr. Gilchrist. It is felt however that the circumstances warrant the payment of one month's salary at the classification of teacher, Grade 1 for his two months half-time service at the above mentioned school.\n\nW.S.

In this connection, I have to say that no return has been received for the quarter ended September 30th, last. If this school was open during any part of that quarter, the teacher should prepare a return showing the days taught, enrolment, etc., and forward same as soon as possible in order that payment of the salary due for that period can be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

All the children who were in the village at the time were sick and the other families stayed away until danger or contagion was over. I was here as usual ready to open school, but could not do so, but, of course, was busy in other ways. I notified the Agent of this.\"\n\nPerhaps the Indian Agent did not notify the Department of the reason for the absence of school returns for September. I would respectfully ask that, under the peculiar circumstances of the case, and on confirmation of the above statement by the Indian Agent, the usual cheque be forwarded for the teacher's salary for September last.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJNS.MLT\n\nIndian Affairs.

I requested payment of her salary under the exceptional circumstances, but up to the present have had no reply.

G. Moyer as temporary teacher at the Cape Mudge Indian Day School. As his services will terminate on June 30, 1942, I thought it would be advisable to bring the matter to your attention now in order to give you plenty of time to secure a qualified teacher, if possible, for the year 1942-43. As you are aware, due to unavoidable circumstances this school was only open for part of the current academic year and consequently I am anxious to have it in operation for the whole of the next academic year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

C. but take it for granted that Mr. Tate who has had long experience has made the request in proper form. The information conveyed in the enclosed letter is correct. A teacher has been sent by the Methodist Missionary Society to Cape Mudge and will be maintained there permanently. I am informed that the Department make a grant for school supplies and also some medicine to be used among the Indians. If these grants could be made immediately we should be greatly obliged.\n\nShould you desire further information I shall be glad to call upon you at any time you may name except during the coming\ncoming week when I shall be away from home.\n\nTrusting that the whole case will receive the favorable consideration of the Department.\n\nI am,\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\n(Signed) James H.

C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAt the last Methodist Conference a Missionary was appointed to the Cape Mudge Indians. Mr. Calloway is now in the field, and would like to open a day school at once, as there are over forty children in the tribe. The Methodist Missionary Society has been asked to make an appropriation for the Missionary's residence, and we would like if at the same time the Department could erect a suitable Schoolhouse, to cost not more than $600.\n\nWe met the Indians at their village last week, and they expressed a great desire to become better people, especially the young men of the tribe; and, when we consider their past history, we think this a very opportune time, to make an effort to free them from their thraldom.\n\nWe trust this matter will\nwill receive the favorable consideration of the Department, and that the building will be erected before the winter commences.\n\n(Signed) James H.

Superintendent.\n\nTo the Hon. D. Murray, O.C.,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nTowell was requested to report on the circumstances attending that application and the number of children of school age in the District. This Mr. Towell has done, and his report, dated the 15th instant, will be found herewith, as well as a report from the teacher in the district, letter from the Indian Agent for the locality. It will be observed from the report that the number of school age children has been less than anticipated; there are about 30 children of school age who are generally resident upon or in the village or its vicinity; and that their ages exceed the period that a grant of land is required for the erection of the school house under the Act. The Indian Superintendent for British Columbia recommends...\nthe application for the credit at the building for the school committee.\n\nThe Superintendent Principal will be here on Tuesday to see the building and will be pleased to meet with any of the members of the Board of Education or any other interested parties to discuss the matter further.\n\nUpon receipt of the report from the committee, the undersigned will forward the same to the Board of Education for consideration.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6386, File 805-5, part 1)\nreports that there were no exceptional circumstances in 1875-76 that would have prevented the Smith River Indians from moving into the United States. Written Columbus, Ohio, to the Northern Division of Vancouver Island, among the most important and the least altered of any of the nations in the Dominion, it would appear advisable to encourage the settlement of Indians for the construction of the railway line; as there is no doubt that education cannot lead more rapidly to their civilization and advancement than by other methods that could be adopted & accomplished at once.\n\nThe undersigned council, therefore, respectfully submit that authority might be given for the execution\nof the Boarded school-house near Cape Flattery, on the old line between that point at a distance of about 100 yards, and that the salary of the teacher when the school is brought into operation be so far as the contribution from this department is concerned, at the rate of $800 per annum.

It is noted that\nthe cost is not likely to exceed $50.00. Again\nI must express regret that this work was not\nundertaken during the actual vacation period.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Todd's letter of the 5th instant together with tender of Mr. Robert Wilson covering the request to expend $50.00 for the redecoration of the interior of the Cape Mudge Indian Day School.\n\nIf funds can be provided, I would recommend approval of the application.\n\nFor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nAugust 3, 1943.\n\nIndian Commissioner for B.C., Department of Mines & Resources,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nOn my last inspection of the Cape Mudge Indian Day School I felt the interior should be redecorated, and I enclose you, herewith, two copies of tender received from Robert Wilson, husband of Mrs. Wilson, our present teacher there, who has agreed to supply the material and do the work for the sum of $50.00.\n\nIn my 1943-44 estimates a request was made for the interior decorating of the school, and the amount of $50.00 was set, which was to cover material and labor.\n\nAs it is almost impossible to get help these days, I would recommend that Mr. Wilson be asked to do this work, and would appreciate it if you would kindly advise me at your earliest possible date if the department approves, as I am anxious to get the work done before the school opens in the fall.\n\n(M.S. Todd)\nIndian Agent.\nAlert Bay, B. C.,\nSept. 8, 1943.\n\nIndian Commissioner for B. C., Department of Mines\nand Resources, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nThis is to acknowledge receipt of your circular\nletter 215-6571 dated, September 3rd, 1943.\n\nIt would appear the department is not aware of\nthe difficulties experienced in obtaining help on the\ncoast, and in order that you will understand what we\nare up against in this respect, I wish to give you the\nfollowing information.\n\nDuring the past summer holidays it was my intention\nto redecorate the following schools: Cape Mudge, Campbell\nRiver and Alert Bay, and money was requested in our estimates\nfor this purpose. Realizing how difficult it was going\nto be to obtain labor for this purpose and also supplies\nand materials, I started early in April to try and find\nlabor that would do this decorating with the result that\nup until the end of July I had been unsuccessful. I\nfinally appealed to the Cape Mudge school teacher's\nhusband and as a last resort he agreed to do it.\n\nIt is not a question, insofar as this office is\nconcerned, of leaving matters over, but, rather, our\ninability to get help. There is no use in ordering material\nuntil such times as we know the labor can be obtained.\n\nIt is my intention to try and have the Campbell\nRiver and Alert Bay schools decorated during the Christmas\nholidays, as both schools require it, and at that time I\nmay be able to obtain the services of an Indian who is\ntemporarily home from the fishing grounds.\n\n(Ms. S.
