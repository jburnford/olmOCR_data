The authorized textbooks are indicated under each subject.\n\nThis Department does not publish a list of supplementary reading books.\n\nI am referring your letter to the Roman Catholic side of this Department for its attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. C. Sutherland\nAssistant-Director of Protestant Education\nMr. Sutherland,\nSupt. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nOur representative, Mr. Milne, called on Mr. Snell and Mr. Hill and spoke to them of the following magazines:\n\n- Nature Magazine $3.00\n- Pictorial Education $3.50 or \"with extra numbers 4.50\n- Canadian Geographical Journal 3.00\n\nMr. Snell would like to have these magazines in the Indian Schools in his inspectorate, which I understand number about eighty.\n\nThe above publications are among the best of their kind and we shall be pleased to have your Department order these magazines. Please advise us immediately if you wish us to order for schools, beginning September issues and if you order them tell us whether you want them for twelve months or only the school months (September to June inclusive). A substantial discount will be allowed the Department, if you order all your magazine requirements at the one time.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nR.S. Macdonald\nPresident.\nOttawa, August 28, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 27th instant, I beg to say that the magazines mentioned are not supplied by this Department to Indian schools.

In fact, I shall see to it that I spend most of the day on seeing to this matter for the time service is such that I couldn't get out anyway.\n\nNow re the Manual & Suggestions in Catechetics; I have 60 bound volumes in cloth left and plenty of those in paper cover. The paper cover would be alright for ordinary teachers who use a textbook to be replaced regularly but the cloth cover is best for your purposes. How many do you think you could use? The best price I could give you is $1.50 each. It is only a 20\u00a2 book. They are using them at a topbook now in 3 Canadian Seminaries and an 2 Canadian Summer schools for Teachers.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. M.

These books can only be secured from the Toronto branch of this firm.\n\nAs you know, we use a considerable number of these books but I believe that you have never kept them in stock. In view of the reasonable offer that has been received, I consider that it would be advisable to place 300 of these in stock at the present time.

Hackett, M.P., regarding a system of the teaching of phonetic French and the mechanism of the organs of speech - prepared by Mrs. Marie Macdonald, Montreal.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that, in the Indian schools in the province of Quebec where the French language is taught in the classroom, the Department is using the system of the Canadian Linguaphone Institute, Montreal. This consists of lessons on phonograph records, and the teachers report that gratifying results have been obtained. This system introduces simultaneously the picture and spelling of the word, pronounced in French, and is in use in all the Indian schools in Quebec, where French forms part of the language taught.\n\nI have no information regarding the system prepared by Mrs. Macdonald. It is extremely doubtful if the Department would require or be able to utilise the works referred to. If supplied, they would only be duplicating the system at present in use. As requested, I am returning herewith the correspondence which accompanied your memo.\n\nHAROLD W.

MCGILL:\n\nWill you kindly consider the request contained in the attached letter from Mr. James Macdonald, M.A., B.C.L., Montreal, and advise me, for the information of the Minister, as to the possibility of the department using the works referred to in the teaching of French in Indian Schools, and the probable cost.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLorette Pointe (Povesh)\n\n[Signature]\nOctober 11, 1935.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BUSKARD,\n\nI have your memorandum of the 8th instant, with attached letter from Mr. James Macdonald, M.A., B.C.L., Montreal, regarding the placing of an order with him to supply wall charts - each series containing 16 charts, a teacher's manual and a pupils' edition - to be used in the teaching of the French language in Indian schools.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that, in the Indian schools in the province of Quebec where the French language is taught in the classroom, the Department is using the system of the Canadian Linguaphone Institute, Montreal. This consists of lessons on phonograph records, and the teachers report that gratifying results have been obtained. This system introduces simultaneously the picture and spelling of each word, pronounced in French, and is in use in all the Indian schools in Quebec where French forms part of the language taught. In none of the other provinces in Canada is French the language of instruction in the classroom.\n\nThe Canadian Linguaphone system has been strongly endorsed by our teachers, and I would not be prepared to recommend any change in the system. The Department would therefore not require the works for the teaching of French from Mr. Macdonald. I return herewith Mr. Macdonald's communication to the Honourable the Minister.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, October 19, 1935.\n\nMadam:\n\nReferring to conversation with you during your recent visit, regarding the installing of a set of charts, \"Mecanismes des organes de la Parole\", I have now to inform you that, upon discussing this matter with the Deputy Minister, I regret it has been decided, as our classroom equipment for the present academic year has been obtained as far as our funds will permit, that we will be unable to place an order with you to supply your charts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nMadame Marie Macdonald,\n1272, Rue Saint-Denis,\nMontreal, Qus.\nMontreal Oct. 22, 1835.\n\nJ. R. Matherland Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nThe Bath Bldg.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour communication of the 19th has been received. We had hoped for a more encouraging reply. For we believe that the opportunity you accorded us, by as it was, and so frequently interrupted, was sufficient to convince you of the great value of the system embodied in our chart, and still further demonstrated and explained in the volume which forms its complement. In that favorable opinion we believe that the Deputy Minister shared.\n\nIt could not well have been otherwise. The principles of the system are thoroughly modern and up to date, and the work has secured the approbation of the most eminent authors Canadian and foreign. It has been described as unique and entirely pedagogical. It has been employed with most satisfactory success and its results have been most remarkable.\nAnd finally the real I approve has been placed upon it & the United Nations' story, the highest of all authorities in such matters.\n\nIt is named a thorough Canadian work. Yet I think that the author, despite his sound basis and training may be fairly claimed to be a Canadian story but of work hard material to Canadians something to be considered at all times from a patriotic standpoint, and at present from an economic one. Further it has been delayed by competent and distinguished persons as experts to all other systems in composition and execution. It demands some of labour, study and imagination, and a large monetary outlay. It was originally rejected to receive formal consideration and a Supreme Court less excellent systems furnished abroad and offers no certainty of Canadian money.\n\nI take him a direct copy, but I appreciate your position; but I am forced to reject our attention to the names and content of certain employees whose repeated insinuations of our intention and feeling of disapproval and concern are manifestly, and were fairly likely in ordinary civility and courtesy. I cannot think that their conduct within was rendered necessary by the importance of their business or\nprompted by any lingering desire to designate themselves with our affluence, why Mr. Helen and the others should have so many important things to say at that particular moment has always been puzzling in my mind \u2014 and yet invariably.\n\nIn conclusion, I express the hope that you will reconsider your decision. If you were able to make a favorable purchase of a non-Canadian work of less merit, less than three years ago, and to supplement that purchase this year, will you not find it possible to give the same encouragement for a very remarkable work produced by Canadians?\n\nFaithfully Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\n1272 St Denis St\nMontreal\n1-1-4\n\n172 Saint Denis Street\nMontreal, Oct. 28, 1935\n\nRe: Mr. McGill,\nDeputy Minister of Indian Affairs,\nBroth Rd., Ottawa,\n\nDear Mr. McGill:\n\nHad we not been obliged to leave Ottawa on the afternoon of our interview, it was my intention to see you again, and to discuss still further in detail the proposal which we have made. We are moreover deeply anxious to see your plans coming into effect, and the proper interpretation towards us, in answering, as you did without delay, and without further engagement.\n\nI believe that both you and Mr. Macdonald were convinced of the suitability, simplicity and effectiveness of the system which I'm so kindly gave you the opportunity of presenting.\n\nIt could hardly have been otherwise, for the method we have employed is an entirely pedagogical one, it is highly original and accurate. It appeals to the most minute of our faculties and the most natural tendency of youth, the sense of sight and the habit of observation and imitation. It has moreover been approved by the most eminent authorities, and the seal of\napproval has been placed upon it by the highest court of appeal in such matters, the famed Academy itself. It has moreover been used with marked success in many of our educational institutions who have submitted their quota to the long list of attestations received.\n\nIt is moreover a Canadian work, composed and written by a Canadian, with a distinguished record for despite her French origin and French training and experience, Madame Macdonald can be fairly claimed to be a Canadian. It was edited with Canadian money, and printed upon Canadian material by Canadian workers. It represents years of labour, study and experiment, and an outlay of many thousands of dollars. Do you not think that we deserve some recognition and consideration from a Canadian government and a Canadian department of Education? \u2014 and a Canadian one another work formed outside Canada, less pedagogical and less brilliant, and offered in exchange for Canadian money?\n\nI am writing Mr. Richardson by this same mail, and am directing his attention to the lack of courtesy and apparent ignorance on the part of certain employees, who interfered with our interview with him.\n\nIn conclusion may I ask you to consider your\ndecision, and to extend to Canadians with a Canadian work, which is also superior in value.\n\nSome of the patronage which you extended less than three years ago to an inferior work produced outside Canada, and which you even supplemented this present year.\n\nHoping for another and more favorable reply, I remain\n\nfaithfully yours,\n\nJames Macdonald M.A.C.S.\n\n1272 St. Denis St.\nMontreal.\nNovember 1st, 1935.\n\nDear Mr. Macdonald:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, regarding your interview with myself and Mr. Sutherland, of the Schools Branch, relative to acquiring by the Department of your charts, \"Mecanisme des Organes de la Parole\", for a number of our Indian schools.\n\nAs definite instructions have recently been issued by the Minister of Finance to curtail all expenditure and also as our classroom equipment for the present academic year has been obtained, I regret being unable to place an order for the supplying of a few sets of your charts.\n\nMr. Sutherland informs me that he gave your wife and yourself an interview of approximately an hour and a half and that he gave you every attention and courtesy. Might I point out that his office duties are heavy, and it was, no doubt, necessary for certain members of the staff to interrupt him during the interview, with matters requiring immediate attention. I regret that you felt that my discourtesy was shown Mrs. Macdonald and yourself.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nJames Macdonald, Esq., M.A., B.C.L.,\n1272 St. Denis Street,\nMontreal, Que.\nBLACKIE BEAR'S HOMES WHEN HE TRAVELS\n\nWritten from Richmond, Va.\nNov. 2-35\n\nMr. J.T.

All bills are not yet in but it is estimated the cost will be in the neighborhood of sixteen cents a copy.\n\nIf this is satisfactory to you we shall be glad to supply the Atlases now and to bill you when we know the exact cost.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

In the majority of cases, those complaining did not mention the name of the manufacturer of the chalk with which they had been supplied. However, a letter was recently received from the teacher of the Morson Indian Day School, in which she writes as follows:\n\n\"I have been using 'Sanigene' Dustless Crayons made by Canada Crayon Co., Lindsay, Ont. I find that they are dusty. I find that the chalk made by the Company in Peterborough is not as dusty.\"\n\nI thought you would like to have this information before you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D.

I find that the chalk made by the Company in Peterborough is not as dusty.\nDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\nQUEBEC.\n\nJune 19th, 1936.\n\nAdvance notice regarding changes in the course of study and textbooks, of which fuller information will be given in the Supplement to the Memoranda. These changes, unless otherwise stated, will come into effect at the beginning of the session 1935-37.\n\n1. The Permissive Course of Study is abolished in its entirety.\n\n2. English:\n\na. The Imperial Readers and the Royal Crown Phonic Primers are removed from the course of study, leaving only, as authorized reading texts, the Elson Basic Readers of Pre-Primer and Primer in Grade I and the Elson Reader Book I and \"Reading and Thinking\" (Grade II) in Grade II.\n\nb. The \"Children's Fairy Book\" is transferred from Grade III (Class II, Senior) to Grade II (Class II, Junior).\n\nc. Grimm and Andersen: \"Fairy Tales\" is removed from the course in Grade III and is replaced by Barrie: \"Peter Pan and Wendy\" (Oxford).\n\nd. Yonge: \"A Book of Golden Deeds\" is removed from the course in Grade VII and is replaced by Conan Doyle: \"The White Company\". (The publisher's name will be announced)\n\ne. Kipling: \"Puck of Pook's Hill\" is removed from the course in Grade IX and is replaced by Kipling: \"Kim\", (Macmillan, St. Martin Classics Series).\n\nf. Shakespeare: \"Julius Caesar\" is transferred from the course in Grade IX, to the course in Grade X, replacing Shakespeare: \"Twelfth Night\" which has been transferred from Grade X to Grade IX. As Julius Caesar will probably have been read by many students in Grade IX, the authorization of this book in Grade X begins in 1937-38.\n\ng. Hillcoat: \"Shorter Poems\" is removed from the course in Grade X, and, in future, Powley: \"One Hundred Years of English Poetry\" will be apportioned between Grades X and XI, in a division made according to poets, which will be indicated in the Supplement to the Memoranda. The examination in Grade XI will be based only on the work assigned to that Grade.\n\nh. In future only one examination paper will be set in English Language and Composition in Grades VI to IX instead of papers in each of these subjects as heretofore.\n\nk. In consequence of the change mentioned under h, only 300 marks will be allotted to the subject of English instead of 400, in Grades VIII and IX. As a consequence, two extra subjects will be demanded from the optional list in Grade VIII and fewer optional subjects in Grade IX to make the total necessary for a certificate of 1000 marks in the grades specified.\n\n3. Geography:\n\nCertain changes have been made in the limits of this subject in Grades VI and VII, of which details will be given in the Supplement to the Memoranda.\n\nThe present edition of Dent's Canadian School Atlas is replaced by the new edition of this Atlas, at a list price of 60 cents.\n4. History:\n\nJones: \"The English People\" is removed from the course in Grade VII, and is replaced by the Kingsway History of England, Book I. Book II of this text will be the authorized textbook in Grade VIII in place of the present syllabus.\n\n5. Language:\n\n\"Easy Exercises in English\", Third to Seventh Year, have been removed from the course of study in Grades III to VII, being replaced by the King's English Series, Books I to V.\n\nMason: \"English Grammar\" is removed from the course of study in Grades VIII and IX, and \"Ontario High School Composition\" from Grades IX to XI. The authorized textbooks in language in these grades VIII, IX and X are the King's English Series, Senior Books I, II and III. It is provided, however, that arrangements should be made for working out Mason: \"English Grammar\" and the \"Ontario High School Composition\", a grade a year as usual.\n\nHowever, if any School Board on the Island of Montreal, by resolution of its Board, address to the Director of Protestant Education a request for permission to use the \"Open Door Language\" Series in Grades III to VIII in an edition that is satisfactorily revised, he is authorized to grant such request.\n\n6. General Science:\n\nPieper and Beauchamp: \"Everyday Problems in Science\", (Canadian edition) replaces Snyder: \"General Science\". It is provided, however, that in those schools in which Snyder: \"General Science\" has been used in Grade VIII in 1935-36, it may be worked out in Grade IX in 1936-37.\n\n6. Biology:\n\nA revised assignment of limits in Peabody and Hunt: \"Biology and Human Welfare\" has been made, in view of a necessary change in editions of this book. Details will be given in the Supplement to the Memoranda.\nMr. J. D. Sutherland,\nActing Superintendent of\nIndian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI have received your letter of June 16th.\n\nCopies of the Course of Study for 1936-37 in\nthe Protestant schools, which include the authorized\ntextbooks, are not yet available.

Additional requisitions will be forwarded to you shortly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nFor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nThe King's Printer,\nOttawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE\nP.O. BOX 666\nVICTORIA, B.C., August 31, 1936.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring the past few weeks the British Columbia Department of Education has issued a new Programme of Studies for Elementary Schools.\n\nThe above Programme is a much more detailed one than any issued in the past. Another change made now is that the various subjects are divided up among three Bulletins, making it necessary for those schools with Grades 1 to 6 inclusive to have all three Bulletins. Bulletin I covers such subjects as Health and Physical Education, and Language Arts including Language, Reading, Spelling, etc., Bulletin II deals mainly with History and Geography, Character Education, and the new Elementary Science course which takes the place of Nature, and Bulletin III deals with Arithmetic, Music, and Art in general.\n\nWhile the above Bulletins are issued free to Provincial schools and Inspectors, and to Private schools, a charge of 15\u00a2 for each Bulletin is made to teachers in Indian schools and to the Indian schools alone as far as I can learn as these come under the administration of the Dominion Government. Teachers of Indian schools calling on me during the past week or so have been advised to purchase copies of any Bulletins required on their own responsibility and from their own private funds.\n\nIt appears that some Indian schools have requested the Text Book Branch to supply copies of the required Bulletins and have not sent the necessary 15\u00a2 for each Bulletin wanted. The Manager of the Text Book Branch, Department of Education has spoken to me this morning on the telephone with regard to this, as he does not wish to supply copies of the new Bulletins to the Indian schools individually. I told him that I should inform the Officials of the Schools' Branch of the matter and leave it to the Department in Ottawa to make any arrangements they thought best. The Manager of the Text Book Branch would like the Department of Indian Affairs to purchase the number of Bulletins required for our schools and to later distribute them and thus relieve the Text Book Branch of all further trouble in the matter.\nFor the information of the Department, I may say that each Day School or Division of a Residential School, will require at least Bulletins I, II, and III, and the Residential Schools, as well as a few Day Schools will in addition require a copy of the new Programme for Junior High Schools (Grades 7, 8, and 9.) About 100 copies each of the first three Bulletins would be required as well as about 25 copies of the Programme for Junior High Schools to be issued later.\n\nIf the Department of Indian Affairs decided to purchase the required Bulletins from the Text Book Branch, Department of Education, Victoria, and keep these in stock in Ottawa, I should be glad to recommend that teachers requisition for such Bulletins as they might require; and as I am leaving for Hazelton in a few days, I should be glad to receive any necessary instructions in care of the Indian Agent, Prince Rupert, B.C.\n\nThough the new Programme will go into effect in the Provincial schools tomorrow September 1st, I do not believe that a little delay will make any difference to our schools. I should however be glad to receive the instructions of the Department with regard to instructing the various teachers to include the new Bulletins on their next requisitions, should the Department consider this the best way to arrange for their distribution. If the Department could see its way to distributing the three Bulletins (I, II, & III) to each Day School and Residential School Division direct and as soon as they were received from Victoria it might be better.\n\nAs I understand from the Manager of the Text Book Branch that the Department of Indian Affairs has not been supplied with copies of the Bulletins so far issued, I am taking the liberty of forwarding one copy of each under separate cover. These have of course been purchased by me out of private funds, and no reimbursement is looked for.\n\nIn conclusion I would ask the Officials of the Schools' Branch to note that I have had no part in the preparation of the new Programme of Study, which has been mainly arranged by numerous committees in B.C., and that I am not in sympathy with much that is included in this course. In fact I have asked any of the teachers in Indian schools whom I have met lately, not to make any great change till we have had an opportunity to discuss the matter during one of the inspections. During the past few years we in the Indian schools of British Columbia have been using Texts supplied from Ottawa which are not used in Provincial schools, but have made distinct progress through the free use of Work Books, which I hope the Department will continue to supply to the schools on requisition, and I do not wish to see any retrograde step taken in the close following of the new Programme of Study, now published in Victoria. Teachers should of course study the new Programme with care and use any part which appears suitable for Indian classes, but I feel certain that the Department will agree with me that much that is now suggested could not be worked out in Indian schools even if professional men agreed that it was likely to be of advantage to Indian children.\nwith the specimen Bulletins of the Programme of Studies, I am also forwarding a copy of a suggested course in Reading which I have given to some of our teachers to help them in their work.\n\nThe new Highroads Readers are not arranged so that they can be read straight through, and teachers require help in selecting passages to be taken up at different times of the year. Mr. F.E. Anfield supplied the mimeographed copies from an original in my possession, and I am giving one to each teacher making use of the Highroads series. I have explained to these teachers that there is nothing official about the suggestions made in the Monthly Outline of Reading, and I am giving them a copy of a suggestion of a good way to divide up the year's work in Reading in each of the various Grades. Should the Department care to make use of the suggested outline in Indian schools in other Provinces, I may say that they are not copyrighted in any way.\n\nThe whole of the above is submitted with respect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nOttawa, September 18, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo and we have, also, received the Bulletins which you forwarded.\n\nThe Department agrees with the statements made in the ninth paragraph of your letter. At the present time, we do not intend to change any of the texts now being supplied to the Indian schools and we will continue to furnish work books when requested. As you state in your letter, the teacher should study the new programme with care and use any parts which appear suitable for Indian classes.\n\nAs you are in the best position to decide the names of the teachers who should receive the bulletins, you may arrange with the Department of Education to forward the bulletins that you consider necessary to the teachers of schools in British Columbia. It is expected that only necessary bulletins will be secured. Payment for them will be made on receipt of an account, in triplicate, from the Department of Education, Victoria. This account should be certified by you.\n\nWe were interested in receiving the mimeograph copy of your monthly outline of reading. It is possible that the Department will use this in other Indian schools to which the Highroads to Reading series is supplied.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nGerald H.

BOX 666\nVICTORIA, B.C., 6th October, 1936.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 18th September, No. 1-1-4, I may say that I have had a long interview this morning with the Officer-in-Charge of the Text Book Branch, Department of Education, Victoria.\n\nI am informed that the charge for each of the three Bulletins making up the Provincial Programme of Studies has been raised from the 15\u00a2 mentioned in the third paragraph of my letter of August 31st, No. 15/45942, to 35\u00a2 for each Bulletin, with the exception of that for Junior High Schools or Grades 7, 8 and 9, which will cost $1.00 per copy.\n\nI informed the Officer-in-Charge of the Text Book Branch that, owing to this increase in the charge made for each Bulletin, it would be necessary for me to refer the matter back to the Department for further consideration.\n\nThe issue of the needed Bulletins to our teachers is complicated by the fact that a number of Indian Schools and teachers have already purchased or were given gratis by mistake the copies of the Bulletins they require, and neither the Department of Education nor I have any record of the names of Schools and teachers so supplied. We, therefore, came to the following tentative agreement.\n\nThe teachers requiring copies of either Bulletins 1, 2 and 3, or that for Junior High Schools will request the same from the Text Book Branch, Department of Education, Victoria, B. C., as they are doing at present. The Officer-in-Charge of the Text Book Branch has arranged to put such applications on one side until they can be referred to me at the end of each month. The issue of such Bulletins as are absolutely necessary will then be authorized by me, and the actual material packed and forwarded, free of charge, to the teachers by the Text Book Branch. If the Department of Indian Affairs approves of the tentative arrangements thus made, the Department of Education, Victoria, is\nwilling to submit an account, in triplicate, for the total charge some time before the end of the present fiscal year.\n\nIt will be understood in Ottawa that it would be very difficult for me to arrange for the packing and forwarding of copies of the new Programme of Studies to the various teachers needing the same, and I would recommend that the Department accept the proposals of the Officer-in-Charge of the Text Book Branch as outlined above. The cost of postage will be added to the actual cost of the Bulletins when the account is submitted by the Provincial Department of Education.\n\nShould the Department agree with the action I have taken in this matter, I would request that an Encumbrance Requisition for a total sum of $50.00 be issued to cover the cost of the Programmes of Studies and mailing charges. As the revised cost of the Bulletins is rather high, I shall do everything possible to reduce the number sent to Schools and teachers to an absolute minimum, but I am of the opinion that some 50 sets of these Bulletins will be required to supply the needs of the Indian Residential and Day Schools in British Columbia.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B. C.\nOttawa, October 17, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant, you may arrange for sending the bulletins to the schools where you consider they are absolutely required. The total cost of these bulletins must not exceed $50.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nG. H. Barry, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.

Webster, Manager.\nNovember 18, 1936\n\nMr. Phillip Phelan,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nReferring to our conversation a few days ago regarding the number of sets of THE BOOK OF KNOWLEDGE sold to you in 1923, I have secured from our Toronto offices the details of that transaction. The order was for 35 sets at $67.50 per set less 10%. It was the current edition and not as you thought an old edition at the time. It was not until 1925 that we brought out the first Canadian, or as it was called the Maple Leaf edition.\n\nThis year we have brought out a Silver Jubilee edition which is not a mere revision of the older issue but altogether a new one. It has approximately 1,000 more pages in it than the set purchased by you in 1923 and contains also an alphabetical index with 51,000 references.\n\nThis new Silver Jubilee set deals with Canada and things Canadian to an extent never before attempted in a Canadian reference book.\n\nI shall be very glad to give you such further information as you desire and trust that the department may see fit to purchase new sets for all the Indian schools. The writer has personally visited many of the schools and the sets there now are in a deplorable condition, scarcely two leaves attached.\n\nI enclose a list of the schools to which the 1923 sets were shipped.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSVEN A.

All phases of the country's economic organization are dealt with; the statistics are brought up to the latest possible moment. The text is accompanied by a wealth of maps and statistical matter, which add to the interest of the subject treated.\n\nThe text and page illustrations are printed in tone and there are two photogravure inserts one of which, the frontispiece, is a reproduction of the Coronation Portrait of King George VI together with the texts of the Proclamation of his accession to the Throne and the Prime Minister's Message on behalf of the Government. The other insert is illustrative of Canada's export trade, a branch of our economy which has shown such splendid progress during the past year.\n\nThe price of the publication is 25 cents per copy, which charge covers merely the cost of paper and actual printing work. A special price concession will be authorized to teachers, bona fide students, and ministers of religion, since past experience has shown that considerable use has been made of this publication for educational purposes, and it is the policy of the Minister to encourage such use. To such individuals, therefore, the price is set at 15 cents for one copy. Postage stamps are not acceptable, and applications must be accompanied by a stamp or by an equivalent coin enclosed between two squares of thin cardboard gummed together at the edges. Applications should be sent to the Printing Division, Department of Printing Bureau, Ottawa, Canada, and since the supply is strictly limited for both the 25-cent and 15-cent issues, early application is suggested.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND COMMERCE\nDOMINION BUREAU OF STATISTICS\nOTTAWA, CANADA\nRequisition for School Material\n\nDate: February 11th, 1937.\n\nFor WELFARE & TRAINING BRANCH School Agency\n\nNOTE: Teachers should secure from the Department of Education of the Province in which the Indian School is located, a list of the text books authorized for use in the white schools.

Murray Gibbon\nThe Coureur de Bois and His Birthright\n\nBy J. Murray Gibbon, F.R.S.C.\n\n(Read May Meeting, 1936)\n\nMany have formed their idea of the coureurs de bois from Frontenac's classic memorandum to Colbert: \"If one doesn't take care, they will become like the bandits of Naples and the buccaneers of St. Domingo.\" Francis Parkman's description in *The Old R\u00e9gime in Canada* is also remembered:\n\n\"Out of the beaver trade rose a huge evil harmful to the growth and the morals of Canada. All that was most active and vigorous in the Colony took to the woods and escaped from the control of intendants, councils and priests, to the savage freedom of the wilderness. Not only were the possible profits great; but, in the pursuit of them, there was a fascinating element of adventure and danger. The intendant Duchesnay reported that eight hundred men out of a population of less than ten thousand souls had vanished from sight in the immensity of a boundless wilderness.\n\n\"It was a curious scene when a party of coureurs de bois returned from their rovings. Montreal was their harboring place, and the coureurs themselves much like the crew of a mutinous ship off after a long voyage. As long as their boats were landed, they set no bounds to their riot. Every house in the place, we are told, was turned into a drinking shop. The newcomers were be-dizened with a strange mixture of French and Indian finery, while still tame, with instincts more thoroughly savage, stalked about the streets as makes of a Pottawattamie or a Sioux. The number of taverns was prodigious, and gambling and drunkards filled the day and the night. When at last they were sober again, they sought absolution for their sins; nor could the priests venture to bear too hard on their unruly penitents, lest they should break wholly with the church and dispense thenceforth with her sacraments.\"\n\nParkman wove his highly coloured fabric from threads spun by priestly and secular writers of the seventeenth century. Baron de Lahontan, the brightest of the secular yarn-spinners, wrote:\n\n\"You would be amazed if you saw how lewd these Pedlers are when they return; how they Feast and Game, and how prodigal they are, not only in their Cloaths, but upon Women. Such of them as have not been so happy as to have wisdom to retire to their own Country, lose their Bachelors act just as our East India Men and Pirates do; want to do; for they lavish, eat, drink, and play all away as long as the Goods hold out; and when these are gone, they e'en sell their Embroidery, their Lace, and their Cloaths. This done, they are forc'd to go upon a new Voyage for Subsistence.\"\n\nIn his table of terms, Lahontan gives this definition:\n\n\"Coureurs de Bois, i.e., Forest Rangers, are French of Canadese, so called from employing their whole Life in the rough Exercise of transporting Merchan-\ndise Goods to the Lakes of Canada, and to all the other Countries of that Continent, in order to Trade with the Savages: And in regard that they run in Canowa a thousand Leagues up the Country, notwithstanding the danger of the Sea and Enemies, I take it, they should rather be called Coureurs de Risques, than Coureurs de Bois.\"\n\nLess vivid in language, but just as telling is the account written by Nicolas Perrot, himself a coureur de bois, who describes his profession as consisting of:\n\n\"Young men in their prime\u2014some of good family, others simple habitants or the children of others who are not so well off\u2014call themselves 'volunteers'\u2014this term for profit is common to them all\u2014Some carry their own merchandise to the savage\u2014others rent it from merchants. Some carry on the business for individuals, others take a share of the risk with merchants. All their victuals consist of some biscuit, peas, corn and some small barrels of brandy. They are soon reduced to living off the hunting and fishing they find along their route... When that give out they are reduced to eating a kind of moss which they call 'tripe de roche'.\"\n\nIt was therefore the lure of adventure rather than the prospect of rich living that enticed them from the settlements.\n\nThe native finery affected by the French who adopted the forest or bush rangers' life was natural to those who were frequently adopted as members of the Indian tribes in whose country they hunted. Their paint, feathers, and buckskins were, in any case, as practical and just as colourful as the costume of French court or regiment which the new-comers may have brought with them from France. We read of French interpreters and hunters in the woods armed with swords, but well-aimed tomahawks would have been just as effective weapons. When Jean Nicolet, Champlain's interpreter, arrived among the Winnebagoes in Wisconsin \"arrayed in a robe of Chinese damask, decorated with flowers and birds of many colours\", his costume was in keeping with Indian taste, so that he was identified by the natives as a medicine man.\n\nThe other day, while reading the story of Esau and Jacob in the 27th Chapter of the Book of Genesis, I thought of certain parallels in the relation between the coureurs de bois and habitants of Canada. For the coureur de bois and habitant, like Esau and Jacob, were also twin brothers, the one coming on the heels of the other, the hunter first; the coureurs de bois created friction in the family by mating with Indian girls, just as Esau brought grief to Isaac and Rebekah by marrying a Hittite; the coureur de bois pleased the menfolk who, like Isaac, were fond of venison, while the habitant curried favour with the womenfolk by staying at home instead of going off on long hunting trips.\n\nSeveral hundred Canadians who had neglected to clear the land allotted to them so that they could lead the life of a coureur de bois forfeited their concessions.\n\nYet the hunter was left not unhappy. I quote Isaac's blessing on Esau as translated by Dr. James Moffat:\n\n\"Far from rich soil on earth shall you live,\nfar from the dew of heaven on high;\nYou shall live by the sword, and serve your brother\nBut when you grow restive,\nhis yoke you shall break.\"\n\nThe coureur de bois first came into definite disfavour when Talon became intendant in 1665, and this fall from grace is claimed by certain historians as due to the free and easy morals of the officers and soldiers of the Carignan Regiment, a thousand of whom were sent that same year to New France by Louis XIV to preserve the colony, its settlements, and its fur-trade from the marauding Iroquois.\n\nBut the real father of the coureur de bois was Samuel de Champlain.\n\nThe record goes back to the winter of 1606 at Port Royal in Acadia, when Champlain established the Order of Great Chief so as to keep up the health and spirits of the garrison. It was the duty of each of the fifteen members of that Order to provide in turn, from his hunting and trading, food for the whole company, and that genial historian Marc Lescarbot, a member of the Order, certifies to its success. When Champlain turned from Acadia to Quebec, fur-trading was his first intent, and he himself spent much of his time in the woods. He planted a number of his followers among the Indians to qualify as interpreters, and of eight of these we know something, namely\u2014Etienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9, Jean Richer, Jean Nicolet, Jacques Hertel, Thomas Godefroy, Fran\u00e7ois Marguerie, Nicholas Marsolet, and Grenolle.\n\nThe life of an interpreter had its lure, for the savage had his own civilization. Jean Richer had this impressed upon him after living two years among the Nipissings. \"Good!\" said a Chief to him one day. \"Now that you are beginning to speak our language, if only you did not grow a beard, you would have almost as much intelligence as our second best Indians.\"\n\nEtienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9 was the first white man to reach Lake Superior, and pioneered for France as far south as the Susquehanna, but seems to have been too devil-may-care for Champlain. The mental picture I have of him is that of the Jack or Knave of Hearts. His had been a hard schooling among the Iroquois, including torture by fire\u2014hence his soubriquet of Br\u00fbl\u00e9 or \"the burnt one.\" His final tragedy was\nto be killed and eaten by hitherto friendly Hurons. The Indian philosophy of cannibalism was that the consumer absorbed the heroic virtues of the consumed, and the fact that these Hurons went the length of eating Etienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9 indicates that they at least found in him qualities which they admired.\n\nAs coureur de bois for Guillaume and Emery de Ca\u00ebn, of the Montmorency Company, Etienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9 received a salary of 100 pistoles ($200) a year for inducing the Indians to come down from the Upper Country with furs. This was probably the standard rate of pay at that time. In 1621 this Company had about a dozen coureurs de bois in its employ.\n\nShortly after Champlain died, a census of Quebec made in 1636 shows that of the 86 colonists, 11 were interpreters, 7 were traders, and 20 were trappers, as compared to 23 settlers, of whom the best known was Louis H\u00e9bert.\n\nThe French did not have a monopoly of the idea that money could be made out of the fur-trade in North America. It was through beaver-skins that the Pilgrim Fathers cleared off their indebtedness to the London merchants who financed their venture. At first their trade was a coastal trade, but as the local supply of beavers diminished, they explored new sources up the rivers Kennebec and Penobscot. Like the French, the English were soon faced by the liquor problem in this Indian traffic. Captain Miles Standish had to run out of the country a certain Thomas Morton for selling fire-water as well as firearms to the natives, in addition to operating a gambling hall in Massachusetts Bay, appropriately named Merrymount.\n\nAlthough there were some large clearings made along the shores of the St. Lawrence by small groups of settlers, the fur-trade offered more prospect of dividends for the Company of a Hundred Associates, which now held a monopoly over Canada.\n\nCharles Huault de Montmagny, who succeeded Champlain as governor of Quebec, has been described as a famous Nimrod. In 1646, the Queen Mother as Regent granted him exclusive privilege of hunting on two islands of the St. Lawrence, \u00cele-aux-Oies, a natural bird sanctuary, and \u00cele-aux-Coudres, on which he tried to domesticate the moose. Every seigneur under the feudal system had or acquired by purchase the birthright of le droit de chasse, and as sixty seigneuries were granted during the r\u00e9gime of the Hundred Associates, that meant there were sixty possible purveyors of peltries from that source. One could not expect that the skins obtained in hunting would be used only for clothing or for wall decoration.\n\nIn 1645 the habitants themselves took over the whole fur-trading business of New France as a co-operative concern known as the Compagnie des Habitants. They undertook to deliver 1,000 lbs. weight of beaver-skins a year, with the result that virtually all the able-bodied men in Canada spent the winter in the woods. In order to regulate things, the Council, in 1648, enacted that \"such settlers as were accustomed to the country might, if they chose, go to the districts inhabited by the Hurons under the leadership of a Captain appointed by the Council. They should serve as escorts for the Missionaries going to the Indian countries, as also for the Indians themselves who wished to come down to the French posts to trade their furs.\"\n\nThe missionaries were thus themselves responsible for the growth of bushranging. Their escorts in the Indian country were permitted to gain their living by hunting and trading in furs, as they received no remuneration from the missions.\n\nA flying squadron of forty men was organized to guard the rivers, lakes and portages.\n\nWhen one considers that along the lower St. Lawrence dense forest grew to the river's edge and that it took at least four years to clear enough land to make a farm on which a family could live, one cannot blame the settler for taking to the woods in search of venison as well as furs.\n\nIn 1646 M\u00e9dard Chouart des Groseillers left the service of the Jesuits to go fur-trading in the Huron country, and twelve years later took into partnership his brother-in-law, Pierre-Esprit Radisson, who had spent two years in captivity among the Iroquois. This warrior race drove the Hurons from their hunting grounds, and commanded the routes to the West so effectively that in 1653 the French-Canadian fur-trade on the St. Lawrence came virtually to a standstill. The Iroquois traded with the Dutch at Orange (Albany) and with the English on the Atlantic seaboard, so that if these two coureurs de bois had not re-opened the route to the Great Lakes, the French settlements along the St. Lawrence would have starved to death.\n\nNo wonder that when they returned from the Upper Country in 1660 with 300 Algonquins and 200,000 francs worth of furs, Groseillers and Radisson were received at Quebec with salvoes of artillery. They plied their trade together from 1654 to 1663, when Governor Baron d'Avaugour mulcted them of more than half their cargo of furs. Thereafter came the strange sequence of intrigues which resulted in their helping the English to launch the great Company of Adventurers trading into Hudson's Bay.\n\nThe royal favour at last begun to shine from France on Canada\nwith some effect when Mazarin died and Louis XIV took the reins into his own hands. The interest of Le Roi Soleil was spurred by the English absorption of the Dutch colonies in 1664 which made Orange, the present Albany, a still more dangerous rival to Quebec in the fur-trade. In trading with the Indians, the English and Dutch had the advantage of being able to supply not only cheaper, but also a greater variety of merchandise. Supplies from France came to Canada only once a year, and did not include the wampum and the scarlet cloth which the Indians particularly favoured. Hence the temptation among even the French traders to send beaver-skins to Orange.\n\nConditions in France made it possible for Louis to spare soldiers, find peasants and mechanics willing to emigrate, and induce unmarried girls to brave the Atlantic in sailing ships for husbands. Ground down by taxes, corv\u00e9es, and the impositions of a feudal system, peasants were already migrating to the cities or slipping across the frontiers. It was not hard to persuade the impoverished country gentleman to become a soldier of fortune in the El Dorado of furs. Families were large and surplus girls were plentiful. Some at least of the Indians were friendly, even though the Iroquois were allies of the English.\n\nColbert, who was Louis's adviser in these matters, was a typical bureaucrat with a bureaucrat's love of doing things by rule and regulation. He had already adopted in France the policy of inducing young men to marry by remission of taxes, with bounties to families of ten or more, provided none of the ten became celibate priests or nuns. Richelieu's charter to the Hundred Associates specifically had in view \"the establishment of a powerful military Colony\" and the development of the fur-trade. Colbert aimed to make Canada a colony breeding its own soldiers, concentrated in easily defended communities, with a system of parishes and villages imported from Old France. So far as the fur-trade was concerned, he desired to regulate this by concentrating markets in Montreal, Three Rivers, and Quebec to which the Indians could bring their peltries. The coureurs de bois were more modern in their method of getting business, going into the Indian country themselves as pedlars. They might be described as the go-getters of the fur-trade.\n\nMaisonneuve's organization of a militia with flying squadrons for the island of Montreal had not proved sufficient to hold back the Iroquois, so in 1665 the Carignan Regiment, a thousand strong, with probably two hundred more from other regiments, was sent under the Marquis de Tracy to strengthen the royal domain in North America. By this time Maisonneuve had at his command in Montreal over a hundred blue-coated frontier fighters who had acquired skill in Indian warfare as coureurs de bois.\n\nThe use of brandy in buying furs from Indians has been blamed on the Carignan Regiment, but antedated their arrival in Canada. As early as 1644 Governor Montmagny issued an edict threatening severe penalties for such traffic, but the sailors on vessels arriving from France smuggled in the liquor which provided such profit. In 1657, Jean Aubuchon was fined, and in 1661 two men were shot and another lashed for this offence. It was to protest in person to the King against this liquor traffic that Bishop Laval, forbidden to excommunicate the offenders, sailed for France in 1662, when he procured the recall of Governor d'Avaugour. The Sovereign Council, posting its decrees against this traffic throughout the settlements, complained in 1664 that almost all the colonists had contravened its prohibitions, hence great disorder among the Indians. In using brandy as merchandise, the French were, however, only meeting the competition of Dutch and English rum, which was not only cheaper but was also more lasting as a stimulant.\n\nWhereas the English and Dutch colonists in North America came out chiefly as families, the French after 1634 made the mistake of sending out single men first. Louis XIV, with Colbert to prompt the afterthought, endeavoured to remedy this with shiploads of brides, some at least of whom might well have driven the settlers to the woods, if not to drink. M\u00e8re Marie de l'Incarnation, who on the whole sympathized with the idea of sending out brides for the bachelors, said of one shipload of new arrivals in 1667 that they included \"beaucoup de canaille de l'un et l'autre sexe.\"\n\nAn instance of forced marriage is the case of Fran\u00e7ois le Noir dit Rolland, who had a trading-post near Lachine. Under the rule that bachelors would be debarred from hunting, fishing, trading with the Indians or entering the woods, Rolland was threatened with confiscation unless he undertook to marry within three weeks of the arrival of the next shipload of brides. The wedding duly took place in the presence of Governor Perrot of Montreal and his conf\u00e8res in the fur-trade, and Rolland proceeded to do such business in liquor with the Indians that Frontenac had to intervene.\n\nSupplementing the brides shipped from France, M\u00e8re Marie de l'Incarnation endeavoured to provide the colonists with an alternative though limited supply from the Indian girls who were taught the amenities of French civilization at the Ursuline convent in Quebec. M\u00e8re Marie had no race prejudice, but even her model pupils had a\ntendency to disappoint her by reverting to type. Those who slipped back to the wigwams she not inaptly termed \"les petites coureuses de bois.\"\n\nThe military strengthening of the colony made the route to the West less perilous, and a period of exploration and development followed. Louis Jolliet, organist at Quebec, accompanied by Jean Per\u00e9, classified as a coureur de bois, was commissioned by Governor de Coureille to go on a fur-trading and copper-finding expedition to Lake Superior in 1688. In this year it was affirmed by the Sovereign Council that there was hardly a band of Indians that did not have some French coureurs de bois with them.\n\nThe most notable coureur de bois who now appeared upon the scene was Nicholas Perrot, originally an interpreter, whose influence on the Indians contributed greatly to the Western expansion of the French. He was the leading figure as well as the historian of the ceremony at Sault Ste. Marie on June 14, 1671, when M. de Saint-Lusson took possession of Lakes Huron and Superior in the name of Louis XIV, most Christian King of France and of Navarre.\n\nTwelve other coureurs de bois are named by Nicholas Perrot as present at Sault Ste. Marie, but none of these twelve appear on the register of the Carignan Regiment. Of the 400 members of this regiment who remained in Canada following their disbanding in 1668 only about a hundred became coureurs de bois. It was, however, probably a hundred too many. In this year the trade in liquor with the Indians was formally thrown open to all French inhabitants of Canada.\n\nSeventeen of the Carignan officers are definitely known to have become interested in the fur-trade. The one most censured was Major Balthazar de Flotte de la Fr\u00e9d\u00e8re, who commanded the garrison of Montreal, 1666-7, and was outlawed from the colony three years later. Three others were in the service of Fran\u00e7ois Perrot, Governor of Montreal, who established one fort under Lafrenaye de Brucy, and another under Gabriel de Berth\u00e9, Sieur de Chailly, on opposite shores of rapids of the Ottawa River, at the western end of the island of Montreal, where the Indian canoes coming down to the settlements were waylaid and the cream of their cargoes skimmed in exchange for a more potent liquid. Associated with Brucy was another ex-Carignan officer, Philippe de Carrion, Sieur de Fresnoy, while a brother officer, Michel Sidrac Duguay, built a trading-post close to that of Gabriel Berth\u00e9.\n\nIn 1671, Intendent Talon wrote to Colbert that the number of coureurs de bois must be reduced. Fur-bearing animals were too much hunted, the market for beaver was glutted, and the price of fur in consequence was decreasing. On that account, when Frontenac came to Quebec as governor in 1672, he had instructions from King Louis to suppress the coureurs de bois and transform the colony into a farming community, protected by a few strategic forts. His first injunction forbade the Canadians to leave their settlement with merchandise under any pretext whatever unless protected by formal authority. Limits were set within which those absent might return. All goods held in contravention of these orders would be held as contraband, and severe penalties inflicted.\n\nA lover of pageantry and display, Frontenac found conveyance by canoe hardly worthy of the King's representative in Canada and conceived the idea, among other things, of condemning offending coureurs de bois to the galleys, the galleys in mind being a ship of state in which the governor could travel with dignity through his domain.\n\nShortly after his arrival, Frontenac was persuaded by Robert Cavelier de la Salle that the best way to prevent the Iroquois from cutting into the trade with the Algonquin Indians of the Upper Country was to build a fort at Cataraquai, the site of the present Kingston, on Lake Ontario. An imposing flotilla of gaily decorated bateaux, mounted with cannon, and four squadrons of canoes convoyed the Governor to Cataraquai, where he made it clear to the delegates of the five Iroquois Nations that he was there to do business, announcing: \"You will find all sorts of refreshments and commodities, which I shall cause to be furnished to you at the cheapest rate possible.\"\n\nIn the following year, La Salle himself was placed in charge of the fort and used it as a base for trading, exploring, and hunting along the neighbouring lakeshore. Six of La Salle's coureurs de bois are recorded in a French history of the brandy party, who had indulged in a barbarous dance called Galopinay, in which the performers ran in a state of nature with a keg of brandy under the arm. This was at the Mississauga Indian Village of Teiaiagon, on the site of the present capital city of Ontario, and is described by Percy J. Robinson as \"a rather modestly beginning for Toronto the Good.\"\n\nFran\u00e7ois Perrot, governor of the island of Montreal, had accompanied Frontenac on this expedition, possibly to divert attention from his own surreptitious activities on the Ottawa. If so, the attempt failed, for Frontenac sent Jacques Bizard, lieutenant of his guard, to suppress Perrot's business at Brucy's fort on Ile Perrot. As his authority was outrageously flouted, Frontenac arrested Perrot when\nhe came to Quebec, and hanged Thomas, one of his coureurs de bois, in front of his window. The governor of Montreal left in indignation for Paris, only to kick his heels for three weeks in the Bastille. A number of coureurs de bois were rounded up, and Frontenac boasted that he had suppressed the traffic; but if his clerical critics can be believed, the Indians continued to be debauched with liquor.\n\nWhile fulminating against the coureurs de bois, Frontenac helped to add to their number through the establishment of a Canadian militia. King Louis had too many wars in Europe to ship more soldiers to Canada. Colbert wrote in June, 1673: \"His Majesty cannot give any assistance to Canada this year on account of the great and prodigious expense that he has been obliged to incur for the maintenance of more than 200,000 men and 100 ships and 25 galleys.\"\n\nFrontenac, therefore, created soldiers on the spot out of the habitants, whom he organized as a militia under local captains. These were armed at their own expense with muskets, which they paid for in monthly instalments, with permission to use them for hunting till they were required for military service. All the habitant now required to do to become a regular coureur de bois was to make contact with a fur-trader who could supply him with brandy and goods to trade with the Indians.\n\nEmigration from France to Canada ceased in this year, and in 1674 Colbert advised the intendant not to count any more on assistance from the King. The distress throughout France became so great that Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 wrote from Brittany in 1680, \"I see only people without means, who sleep upon straw and who weep.\" Colbert, echoing King Louis's own opinions, was inclined to approve of the liquor traffic, writing rather sarcastically to Intendant Duchesneau not to abolish the sale of brandy to the Indians. Otherwise, he wrote, \"we should run the risk not only of losing this commerce, but of forcing the Savages to do business with the English and the Dutch, who are heretics; and it would thus become impossible for us to keep them favourably disposed towards the one pure and true religion.\"\n\nBy this time Frontenac had come to realize that the coureurs de bois could provide him with welcome information as to the friendliness or otherwise of the various Indian tribes towards each other and towards the French.\n\nWhen Pierre Moreau la Taupine, on returning from trading with the Ottawas, in 1679, was arrested by Intendant Duchesneau, he produced a licence from the governor permitting him to travel to the Ottawas with two comrades to carry out secret orders.\n\nThe Intendant Duchesneau, primed by the clergy, claimed that Frontenac was issuing licences to trade and hunt to his personal friends, and on his representations the governor was required by Colbert to summon all coureurs de bois, licensed or unlicensed, to return to the settlements. A conference of the leading colonists was summoned by royal edict to meet at Quebec in October, 1678, to consider the problem of liquor traffic with the Indians. La Salle was one of the delegates, and defended this traffic as necessary, claiming that the Indians were less given to drink than the French, and even less than the English of New York. The royal edicts issued in 1679 limited the hunting permits from January 15 to April 15 each winter, and holders of permits were prohibited from carrying liquor to the Indians, though the French of the settlements could continue to sell liquor to Indians on the spot. An amnesty to those in the woods who returned at once to the settlements was proclaimed, and permits issued by the governor were limited to 25.\n\nLa Salle, no doubt with the cognizance of Frontenac, evaded the regulations by sending out from Fort Frontenac coureurs with his own permits to trade with the Indians.\n\nNicholas Perrot claimed that the prohibitions only made matters worse: \"The Canadians,\" he wrote, \"seeing themselves deprived of these franchises, became disorderly, thinking they had been deceived. That was the reason why most of the youth of the country went off and came back only in secret, looking for merchandise while bringing skins that were sold by stealth. This trade opened the eyes of the merchants who found it very much to their advantage, and who advanced to them what was necessary for their journey. Some opposed the orders from above. So much so that these Canadians became like savages, whose license they copied so well that they forgot what they owed to the duty and discipline of France; and if I dare say it, of Christianity itself.\"\n\nLawless and half-savage, the coureur de bois might have become, yet not wholly \"fit for treason, strategems and spoils\", for he had the saving grace of genius in himself, and more than any other kept alive the folk-song of the seventeenth century. As he paddled his canoe through the forested waterways, he sang the chansons of his time, songs which were passed on to his successors, the voyageur and the raftman. These songs had little apparent relation to his own life. They were songs of princes and princesses, of well-saddled cavaliers, of prisoners in far-off Nantes, of roses which he never saw in the depth of the woods, of gardens with orange trees, of shepherdesses guarding sheep\u2014not of beaver, or moose, or deer. But\nthe melodies were rhythmic and helped to keep oars and paddles in time. In only two of Gagnon's *Chansons populaires* are there suggestions of the life of the coureur himself\u2014one ballad, the *Lament of Cadioux*, which narrates an incident of conflict with the Iroquois, and one *Tenouche*! *Ouihika* introducing an ancient Huron. The seventeenth-century drinking songs, of which several hundred have survived, were not inappropriate to one who bought so many beaver-skins with liquor. *Mallouk s'en va \u00e0 l'en guerre*, a favourite song with the voyagers of the eighteenth century, was probably brought to Canada after the battle of Malplaquet by La V\u00e9rendrye.\n\nDuchesneau, the Intendant, became virulent in his antagonism and accused Frontenac of conniving with the coureurs de bois, and having notorious offenders such as La Taupine in his service. Ren\u00e9 Robineau de B\u00e9cancour, Baron de Portneuf, who was grand voyer or minister of roads, and Louis Bolduc, the public prosecutor, were also accused by Duchesneau of surreptitious traffic.\n\nFrontenac's attitude towards the coureurs de bois was evidently tempered by the necessity of exploiting new fur yielding territories in the West. Daniel Greysolon Du Lhut may have had something to do with this. Duchesneau accused Du Lhut of being one of the chiefs of the gangs \"indifferent to all the royal ordinances whom the complicity of Frontenac had encouraged to practise with impunity their trade of coureurs de bois.\"\n\nYet Du Lhut was no gangster. Formerly an officer in the King's Body Guard, he came to Canada with private means, built one of the most substantial houses in Montreal, and then after four years started out with his brother La Tourette on an exploring expedition to Lake Superior. There he won the confidence of the Indians as a brave, fair-dealing man, and, in spite of the handicap of gout, the West became his stamping-ground. Duchesneau wished Frontenac to organize a military expedition against this leader of coureurs de bois, but Frontenac excused himself, explaining to Colbert the political danger of an expedition which would throw the bushrangers into the arms of the English. When Du Lhut returned from the West, after exploring the headwaters of the Mississippi, organizing a re-union of friendly Indians at Fond du Lac, on Lake Superior, and establishing western headquarters at Kaministiquia (site of the present Fort William), Frontenac technically imprisoned him in the Ch\u00e2teau St. Louis at Quebec to save him from the claws of the intendant.\n\nFrontenac by this time realized that these western coureurs de bois could be organized as a legion of frontiersmen, skilled in Indian ways and Indian warfare, able to live off the land without draining the public treasury, adventurous spirits willing to fight so long as they were not forced to farm or fettered by bureaucrats and priests. The coureur de bois was Esau the hunter, not Jacob the stay-at-home goatherd. As a matter of fact, by the year 1681, according to Henri Lorin, the sanest of the French historians, \"the country had as many farm workers as it needed, and the over-production of grain explains the number of coureurs de bois as much as the supposed dislike of the colonists for sedentary life.\"\n\nIrritated by the quarrels of Governor Frontenac and Intendant Duchesneau, King Louis recalled them both, sending out Joseph Antoine Lefebvre de La Barre as governor and Chevalier Jacques de Meulles as intendant. If Frontenac had dipped his fingers in the fur-trade, La Barre was in it up to the armpits. In the words of Henri Lorin:\n\n\"The Governor, the Intendant, the Magistrates, the Officials, in a word, every one traded. Meulles admitted that, to pay the salaries of his secretaries, he had sold two cong\u00e9s which brought him each 700 livres. The Intendant of Three Rivers (de Varennes) traded at least once a fort, nearby his seat of command; the Intendant of Montreal far from blaming him, knowing that de Varennes had supported a family, and that he would not be able to live without a little contraband. The Governor alone could have prevented these abuses, but he himself was friendly to the coureurs de bois, and shared in their gains. He increased the cong\u00e9s to such an extent that the trade became ruined, and later declared that in this way he had neutralized the French War.\"\n\nLa Salle was out of favour. Fort Frontenac and its contents were taken over in the interests of his creditors; while Chevalier de Baugis and Olivier Morel, Sieur de la Durantaye, were sent to occupy his forts in the Illinois country. Nicholas Perrot was dispatched to Green Bay; Du Lhut received a cong\u00e9 to trade in the Sioux country, and had 30 coureurs de bois with him when he left Michilimakinac. Ren\u00e9 Le Gardeur, Sieur de Beauvais, with thirteen associates, received a permit to trade with the Illinois at the lower end of Lake Michigan. By the year 1684 the number of canoes in trade with regular cong\u00e9s amounted to 120 instead of the 25 stipulated in the ordinance of 1681.\n\nThe Court continued to hurl ordinances against contraband traffic, and La Barre, to cover his delinquencies, started a campaign against the Iroquois. Du Lhut, Perrot and Durantaye were summoned to bring reinforcements of coureurs de bois to join La Barre's expeditionary force at Niagara. Du Lhut brought 200 of these frontiersmen, only to be turned back by the news that a truce had been made with the Iroquois at La Famine.\n\nThe Marquis de Denonville, who succeeded La Barre as governor, is said by Vicar-General de Saint-Vallier to have \"spent nearly all\nhis time in prayer and the reading of good books.\" According to the vivacious chronicle of Baron de La Hontan, Canada was no place for a gay life. \"You have in Europe,\" he writes \"at least the diversions of the Carnival, but here it is a perpetual Lent.\" Denonville's first reaction to the bushrangers was not favourable:\n\n\"You are aware, Monseigneur, that the coureurs de bois are a great evil, but you are not aware how great this evil is. It deprives the colony of its effective men; makes them useless, lawless, and incapable of discipline, and turns them into thieves and robbers, wearing the sword and decked out with lace, both they and their relations, who all affect to be gentlemen and ladies. As for cultivating the soil, they will not bear of it.\"\n\nIncursions of English traders into French territory, however, compelled Denonville to modify his views. Du Lhut was sent in 1686 to restore the fort at Detroit and to establish a port which he named Fort Joseph, between Lake Erie and Lake Huron, to bar the English invaders, and this latter post was garrisoned at Du Lhut's own charges by coureurs de bois. La Durantaye was put in general command of western posts, and when in the following year Denonville decided to lead a campaign against the Iroquois, he called on La Durantaye to bring contingents of bushrangers organized by Du Lhut and Nicholas Perrot to join him at Niagara. These led the van of an expedition which proved fruitless, although La Durantaye and Du Lhut between them captured sixty English traders on the way. These English traders had been guided by a French coureur de bois, La Fontaine Marion, who was shot by Denonville for his pains.\n\nFollowing this expedition, La Hontan went south with a detachment of soldiers to explore the country westward of Green Bay, and incidentally indicates the numbers and activities of the bushrangers in the Great Lakes territory. Michilimackinac and Sault Ste. Marie were busy centres of trade with the Indians, and he found thirty coureurs de bois working for Tonti, who maintained La Salle's old post at Cr\u00e8vecoeur, in the Illinois country. Michilimackinac was headquarters for La Durantaye, whom Denonville had named \"Commander of the Coureurs de bois that trade upon the Lakes and in the Southern Counties of Canada.\"\n\nIn 1688 Nicholas Perrot was sent with forty men to trade with the Sieux and take possession of the Upper Mississippi in the name of King Louis. Denonville evidently realized that such expansion was necessary for the maintenance of the fur-trade, but losing heart through the incursions of the Iroquois, nearer home, evacuated Fort Niagara and Fort Frontenac in the following year. Fortunately for the French dominion, he was recalled, and Frontenac once more was sent out as governor.\n\nFrontenac came back to Canada none too soon, for the massacre of Lachine had placed the Island of Montreal at the mercy of the Iroquois, and vigorous action was required to restore communication with the western posts.\n\nPhilippe de Rigaud, Marquis of Vaudreuil, named lieutenant-governor of Montreal in the absence of Governor de Courcelles, had organized, in 1688, a hundred coureurs de bois on the island into a company which he called Musketeers. He himself had been a Colonel of the Musketeers in France. These men may have been the hundred coureurs de bois whom Frontenac on his arrival in Canada, sent under the command of Nicholas d'Aillebout, Sieur de Manthet, to re-establish Fort Frontenac on Lake Ontario. Thereafter Manthet, together with Jacques Le Moyne, Sieur de Sainte-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, led over a hundred coureurs de bois on the western division of an expedition against the English colony of Corbier, six leagues from Orange. Following this expedition, these bushrangers were sent on another expedition to Lake Champlain. Their worth as frontier fighters was now thoroughly realized.\n\nDu Lhut was sent to disperse a band of Iroquois who controlled the Ottawa fur-trade route at Lake of Two Mountains, and Louis de la Porte Louvigny was dispatched with Nicholas Perrot and 143 Canadians to relieve La Durantaye at Michilimackinac.\n\nThree more years of border warfare with the English and Iroquois had to be waged before the trade-routes were safe for the fur brigades. In 1693 a huge flotilla of Indians with two hundred coureurs de bois who had been accumulating furs in the territory of the Great Lakes came down with rich cargoes to Montreal. There was great rejoicing at first, but the result was that the market for furs soon became glutted. In 1695 there were two million livres worth of beaver-skins unsold in stores. The number of coureurs was once more reduced. In 1696 control of the export was placed in the hands of a local company of 150 merchants, but even so there came to be such a surplus of beaver-skins that three-fourths of it was deliberately burned. In 1697 Frontenac had to issue orders that all the French in the woods must return to the Lower St. Lawrence before September of the following year, but Tonti arrived from Michilimackinac to report that the coureurs refused to come in.\n\nBy the year 1700, Michilimackinac had become the centre of the western fur-trade. Antoine de la Mothe-Cadillac was commandant, and the liquor traffic was countenanced to the extent that even the soldiers of the garrison were permitted to sell brandy to the Indians. The coureurs de bois occupied a street of log cabins roofed with cedar.\nhark built along the shore of the bay, while the Hurons and Ottawas lived in adjoining villages surrounded by a triple palisade. In spite of the opposition of the Montreal merchants, La Mothe-Cadillac obtained authority from France to establish a new fort on the site of the present Detroit (1701). When he was transferred, in 1710, to Louisiana, his successor, Alfonse de Tonti, received instructions to return the French and Canadians at Michilimackinac to Montreal. Only twenty of these obeyed, while 84 descended the Mississippi with their furs and delivered them to Louisiana.\n\nAnother blow to the ascendancy of Montreal as a fur-market was struck when in 1717 Illinois was detached from New France and incorporated with Louisiana. Moreover, the English were seriously encroaching on French preserves. Albany offered a more lucrative market not only to the Great Lakes around Lake Ontario and Lake Erie, but also to those who came down from Lake Huron and beyond over the Toronto Carrying-Place, the short cut to and from the Western Lakes, which was rapidly replacing the old Ottawa-Lake-Nipissing-Rainy River route. Unlicensed coureurs de bois, knowing themselves outlawed, saw no reason why they should not trade with the English. A hundred years before, Etienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9 had made this clear. When Champlain reproached him for taking services with Sir David Kirke, he replied that \"since a comfortable future was not before him in France, the die was cast and he would live with the English.\"\n\nIn the North and Far West, the Hudson's Bay Company posts diverted a large share of the furs which might otherwise have come to Montreal.\n\nCharles Marquis de Beauharnois, appointed governor of New France in 1728, realized the need of combating this menace and under his regime the posts along the St. Lawrence route were strengthened, while Pierre Gaultier de la Verendrye was supported in a series of expeditions which carried the fleur de lys by way of Rainy River and Lake of the Woods to Lake Winnipeg, the Assiniboine River, the Western Prairies and the fur country immediately tributary to Hudson Bay.\n\nBy this time the coureur de bois, or independent peddler, was giving place to the regularly engaged voyageur working for merchants who had secured cong\u00e9s. According to the records catalogued by E. Z. Massicotte for the Quebec Archives, the number of voyageurs employed in the western trade from 1731 to 1745 averaged nearly 300 a year, the peak being reached in 1741 with 380.\n\nWith the transfer of New France to Great Britain, Albany once more threatened the supremacy of Montreal, but the Scottish merchants who took over and developed the fur-trade along the St. Lawrence waterways made Montreal once more the centre of operations. These at first were hard times for Canadians of French extraction; yet those who accepted the British dominion remained loyal to the throne when the American colonies declared for Independence.\n\nAn interesting case is that of Charles-Michel de Langlade (1729-1800), a grandson of Pierre Mouet, Sieur de Moras, who had been an ensign in the Carignan Regiment. Augustin, the father of Charles Michel, assumed the name of l'Anglade, and became a fur-trader of Three Rivers. Charles-Michel was born at Michilimackinac, and in 1755 headed a band of coureurs de bois and Indians in an attack on Fort Duquesne, site of the present Pittsburgh. In 1759 he fought under Montcalm at the battle of the Plains of Abraham, but after the capture of Montreal returned to Michilimackinac, where he witnessed the massacre of the English garrison by Pontiac's Indians in 1763. In 1777 we find him serving with an Indian contingent under General Burgoyne against the colonials, and, when the revolutionary war ended he returned to Michilimackinac as a British subject.\n\nAnother interesting case is that of Jean-Baptiste Cadotte, originally a coureur de bois, who married an Indian of the Sauteur tribe, named Anastasia. While he was in charge of the fort at Sault Ste. Marie under the French r\u00e9gime, Cadotte is found in partnership with Alexander Henry at that point in 1765.\n\nIn reviewing the history of Canada during the eighteenth century, one realizes that the French-speaking fur-traders were now Canadians rather than French, and in this growth of a new nationality the coureur de bois played a notable part. Inter-marriage with Indians made the bushranger indifferent to European tradition, particularly as his ancestral France had been so stepfatherly. As merchants and as employers the British provided him with a better living, and under British rule he was not subject to unpaid corv\u00e9es of the feudal system, while he was allowed the liberty of religion, if religion still controlled his conscience.\n\nIn the expansion of the white man's dominion towards the West, the half-breed progeny of the coureurs de bois served as a liaison with the Indian tribes. To that liaison is due the more peaceful penetration of the West in British North America than was the experience of the United States. To so many Americans, the only good Indian was a dead Indian, and this brutal attitude had its repercussion in the Indian wars and massacres which stain with blood the pages of American history in the nineteenth century.\nThe mentality of the coureur de bois was inherited by the voyageur working for the Hudson's Bay Company, and what that mentality was can best be illustrated from the account of his life given to Alexander Ross by one whom he calls a \"superannuated son of the wilderness.\" This was a voyageur over seventy years of age who worked his passage by convoying Ross from Norway House to the Red River Settlement. \"I have now,\" said he, \"been forty-two years in this country. For twenty-four I was a hard canoe-boat; I required but little sleep, but sometimes got less than I required. No voyage was too long for me; all places were alike. My end of the canoe never touched the ground till I saw the end of it. Fifty songs a day were nothing to me. I could carry, paddle, walk and sing with any man I ever saw. During that period, I saved the lives of ten Bourgeois, and was always the favourite, because when others stopped to carry at a bad step and lost time, I pushed on\u2014over rapids, over cascades, over chutes; all were the same to me. No water, no weather, ever stopped the paddle or the song. I have had twelve wives in the country; and was once possessed of fifty horses, and six running dogs, trimmed in the first style. I was then like a Bourgeois, rich and happy; no Bourgeois had better-dressed wives than I; no Indian Chief finer horses; no white man better-harnessed or swifter dogs. I beat all the Indians at the race, and no white man ever passed me in the chase. I wanted for nothing; and I spent all my earnings in the enjoyment of pleasure. Five hundred pounds, twice told, have passed through my hands; although now I have not a spare shirt to my back, nor a penny to buy one. Yet, were I young again, I should glory in commencing the same career again. I would willingly spend another half century in the same fields of enjoyment. There is no life so happy as a voyageur's life; none more independent\u2014a place where a man enjoys so much variety and freedom as in the Indian country. Huzza! huzza! pour le pays sauvage!\"1\n\n1Alexander Ross, The fur-hunters of the far west (London, 1855), vol. 2, p. 235.\nDr. H. W.

I am also enclosing a list of the new textbooks which will come into use in September 1937 as far as these have yet been decided.\n\nThe courses of study for 1937-1938 are not yet available.\n\nI am referring your letter to the Roman Catholic side of this Department to reply for its schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDirector of Protestant Education\n\nY/C\nDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION,\nFEDERAL AND MUNICIPAL RELATIONS\nFREDERICTON, N.B.\n\nJune 23, 1937.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReceived your letter of June 17th., and have pleasure in sending a list of the text books used in our Province.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Fletcher Peacock]\nDirector, Educational Services\n\nFP/MHB\nEnc.\nDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\nVictoria, B. C.\n\nTo Principals of High, Junior High, and Superior Schools, and Secretaries of School Boards, and Official Trustees.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nIt was expected that the Bulletins for the new Senior High School Programme of Studies would be ready for distribution by the middle of June. Unusual demands upon the Government Printing Office have made this impossible and the Bulletins will not be ready until the last week in July. To enable Principals and Teachers to obtain them as promptly as possible, they will be sent to the Secretaries of School Boards. Principals should make arrangements with the Secretaries for the distribution of the Bulletins in whatever way will best suit local conditions. In cities where there are a number of Secondary Schools the Bulletins will be sent to the Secretary bundled separately for the different schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nS. J. WILLIS\nSuperintendent of Education.\nJune 28th 1937.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nWe have your favor of the 16th instant and regret to advise our Programme of Studies for the year 1937-38 is not yet printed. We are, however, forwarding you herewith proof copy of same for your immediate use, and will see you are supplied with a copy when same is off the press.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy Minister.\n\nEncl. /P.\nDepartment of Public Printing and Stationery\n\nOTTAWA May 4, 1937.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am returning herewith letter from J.M.Dent & Sons re Two Little Indians, and wish to advise you that I have today shipped by express, collect, 500 copies. I am requesting our Controller of Purchases to have the Company send us a credit note for the return of these books. Probably it would be well for you to write the Company yourself to forward credit note under our order No. 18855.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.W. DRISCOLL\nSUPERINTENDENT OF STATIONERY\n\nJD/E.\nDear Sirs,\n\nWould it be possible to do so? I would like to oblige him if at all possible.\n\nPhil\nMr. Philip Phalan,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Phil:\n\nAn unexpected demand has arisen for TWO LITTLE INDIANS and we have gone completely out of print. You will recall you took practically the entire stock a year or so ago.\n\nWould you, or could you re-sell us say 250? It takes time to reprint things that have colour work. This number may not be sufficient to carry us until the reprint is available. If, therefore, we should need more, would it be possible for you to oblige us to the extent at that time?\n\nIf you could re-sell these to us at the price at which we sold them to you, plus carriage charges, we would be grateful, of course. If not, I know you will let us have them at the lowest possible price.\n\nIf you would prefer to loan us a supply, then we would be grateful for 500, upon the understanding that they would be supplied to you long before you needed them, assuming you would not be needing them before next April, say.\n\nI wouldn't trouble you but for the urgency of the matter. Ontario, apparently, is now backing the little book, officially, and they threaten to remove the book from the list unless we can supply them with their immediate needs at once.\n\nWith kindest regards, I am\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nApril 30th., 1937.\nJuly 27, 1937.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n503 Booth Building,\nOttawa.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nFurther to our conversation of this morning, in regard to soccer balls.

M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nIn a letter 1-1-4 dated November 22nd 1938 from the Indian Affairs Branch authority was given to me to expend up to $20.00 during the fiscal year 1938-39 on the purchase, from the Text Book Branch, B.C. Department of Education, Victoria, of British Columbia Programmes of Study for such Indian schools as were in urgent need of such Programmes. I would request that in line with the procedure adopted during the past three or four years, I be given authority to arrange for the distribution of any urgently necessary Programmes during the present fiscal year 1939-40 at a cost of not more than $20.00.\n\nWith reference to Departmental letter 154-0-6 dated January 15, 1938 and previous authorizations, I would also request authority to purchase from the Text Book Branch Provincial Department of Education necessary testing material including B.C. Achievement Tests, All Canada Arithmetic Tests, and Otis Tests of Mental Ability for use in inspection work at Indian schools during the fiscal year 1939-40. The Department has on file copies of the testing material used and I may say that such material is of the greatest use to me. All material previously purchased has been used and authority is now requested to purchase tests up to a total cost of $20.00 during the present fiscal year.\n\nAt a number of Indian day schools teachers desire to supply their pupils with Report Forms, now called in B.C. Progress Cards, and in several districts Indian parents are very anxious that their children should have the same reports as pupils of Provincial Schools.\n\nSpecimen copies of the new Progress Cards for Grades 1, 2, & 3 and for Grades 4, 5, & 6 with copies of notices to teachers and to parents are attached for information. The Text Books Branch, B.C. Department of Education can supply me with these cards at a nominal rate of $2.50 per hundred, and will for this sum mail them to schools where I certify that they may be sent, following exactly the same procedure that has worked so well in the case of Programmes of Study mentioned above.\n\nAuthority is requested to purchase during the present fiscal year Progress Cards as needed and more or less as an experiment to a total sum of $50.00.\n\nIn all I have requested permission to expend on the above material a sum not to exceed $90.00 during the present fiscal year. A voucher with the necessary invoices would be forwarded through you to the Department before the close of the fiscal year in March 1940, if my request is approved.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGHB.\nInspector of Indian Schools\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith an application by Mr. Inspector Barry for authority to expend up to $90.00 as follows:\n\nProgrammes of Study...........$20.00\nEducational Tests.............20.00\nProgress Report cards........50.00\n\nall of which would be secured from the Test Book Branch of the B.C. Department of Education.\n\nI would recommend approval of the application.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 21, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th instant you may authorize Inspector Barry to expend an amount of $20.00 in the purchase of copies of the British Columbia Programmes of Study, also a similar amount in purchasing testing material.\n\nIn view of conditions at present confronting us it is not possible to favourably consider increasing our expenditure. Under these circumstances we are not prepared to approve the expenditure of $50.00 to secure progress cards from the British Columbia Department of Education.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D.

This price was contained in your estimate No. 1237.\n\nUnder separate cover you are being forwarded requisition No. 21133 covering the mounting of 200 maps.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nThe King's Printer,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nA few days ago Mr. Button asked to see a letter received from you during May, 1938, regarding the Primer to follow \"Two Little Indians\" about which Mr. Eustace has been corresponding with you over a period of some time.\n\nMr. Eustace thinks that the letter in question is in answer to his letter to you of May the 25th, 1938, which I turn acknowledged your letter of May the 9th. We have these two letters, of course, but the letter to which we refer, and which we believe contained assurances of a character that would warrant us in proceeding with the manufacture, we cannot find.\n\nAs the office files are in my care, naturally I feel badly that this letter cannot be found. Could you have one of your staff search your files, and let us have a copy of this letter? It sometimes happens that the one letter which is wanted in the office is the one that cannot be found!\n\nAnything that you can do to help me in the matter will be much appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nLeila Bett\nOttawa,\nDecember 8, 1939.\n\nDear Mr. Bustace:\n\nWith reference to your recent letter regarding the primer to follow \"Two Little Indians\" I have reviewed our file and enclose copy of my letter of May 9, 1938.\n\nOn re-reading this I find that it does not give a great deal of definite information.\n\nYou wrote me a letter dated July 27, 1938, explaining the reason for quoting a price for the new primer which would be considerably higher than that charged for \"Two Little Indians\". From the contents of this letter I realize why the price for the primer will be higher than for \"Two Little Indians\".\n\nIn the event of your proceeding with the new primer we will use it in Indian schools and the number of copies will be approximately the same as the number of \"Two Little Indians\" that were ordered. In this event I feel certain that your firm will deal fairly with us in the matter of price and if you have the books prepared we would like to have them available by the middle of June, 1940, in order that we could include them on our requisitions for the academic year 1940-41.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. C.

We are proceeding with \"Joe and Ruth Go to School,\" the new primer and, of course, you may rely upon us to deal fairly with you in regard to the matter of prices. However, our Business Office is still asking for your letter in which you state that the Department will use the first edition of 20,000 copies of this book over a period of years.\n\nOf course, both Mr. Button and I know that if the book is liked it will no doubt be used in your schools for some years to come. However, the Business Office would prefer that there should be a clear understanding with regard to the first edition, and it is for this reason that I hope that you may be able to find the letter either preceding or following your letter of May 9th. If it cannot be found, perhaps you will be kind enough to assure us that the Primer will be listed for use in the Indian schools, and that the Department will use the first edition of approximately 20,000 copies for their schools over a period of years.\n\nExtending to you the Compliments of the Season, and with best wishes,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.

As a matter of fact, there is another letter which you wrote to us in May in which, I think, you intimated that the Department would be willing to sponsor the first edition of the Primer, if and when published.* However, your letter of December 8th is what we require, and thank you very much indeed for all your trouble in this connection.\n\nI have had a series of personal misfortunes the past week, and at the moment, my wife is in the hospital with pneumonia.

As I have verbally informed you I do not know how quickly we can use this number but they will be used at about the same rate as in the case of \"Two Little Indians\".\n\nI understand that this book will be published in the same manner as \"Two Little Indians\".

Flain\n10.9.70\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan\u2014\n\nA few days ago we received an order from the Department of Public Printing and Stationery for 500 copies of the Joe and Ruth Work Book. We could fill only 100, as this cleaned us out of stock.\n\nNow the question arises as to whether we are to reprint. We shall do so, of course, if it is your intention to keep this book on your list and to use it to the extent that your Department has been doing for so many years. We shall have to reprint 6,000 if we are to continue to supply at the net price that has obtained for some two or three years, and which represents a considerable discount from the original published price.\n\nWould you kindly advise us, at your convenience, in this matter, for the convenience of all concerned?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. M. DENT & SONS (CANADA) LIMITED\n\nHB/LB\nJ. M. DENT & SONS (CANADA) LIMITED\nPUBLISHERS\n224 Bloor Street West\nTORONTO, CANADA\n\nJune 15th, 1940.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI hope you will not think that we are unduly aggressive, but it would be a convenience all round if you could give us your decision in connection with our letter of June the 5th regarding the \"Joe and Ruth Work Book\".\n\nThe paper problem is rather serious - it takes anywhere from a month to six weeks for the mills to fill an order of the size that would be required for the reprinting of this book. If your schools are open during the summer, this unfilled portion of the order to which I referred in my letter of June the 5th might be very inconvenient for the teachers and pupils.\n\nAnyhow, we would be very grateful if you could advise us by return.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHB/LB\nP. O. Box 444,\nVancouver, B.C.,\nJune 20, 1940.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nIn Departmental letter l-l-4, dated September 21, 1939, authority was given to me to expend up to $20 during the fiscal year 1939-40 on the purchase from the Text-Book Branch, B.C., Department of Education, Victoria, of British Columbia Programs of Study for such Indian schools as were in urgent need of such programs. The total expended under this authorization was only $7.55.\n\nI would request that in line with the procedure adopted during the past four or five years I be given authority to arrange for the distribution of any necessary programs during the present fiscal year, 1940-41, at a cost of not more than $15.\n\nAlthough authorization was given in the above quoted Departmental letter for the expenditure of $20 in the purchase of testing material, this sum was not actually spent, as a matter of economy.\n\nThere is an increasing number of candidates for promotion to high school each year and I find it necessary to supply the Provincial Inspectors of Schools with the marks obtained by our Grade 8 Indian pupils in certain tests, particularly the Otis Group Test in mental ability and the Dominion Achievement Test. My testing material is now completely used up and I would request authority to purchase from the Text-Book Branch, Provincial Department of Education, testing material found to be absolutely necessary, not to exceed a total cost of $20, during the present fiscal year.\n\nIf authorization is given by the Department for expenditure within the limits mentioned above, and I trust it will be, vouchers, with the necessary invoices attached, would be forwarded through you to the Department for settlement before the close of the present fiscal year in March 1941.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools.\n\nCHB:GR\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nPre Primer and accompanying cards:\n\nYour Department has prepared a Joe and Ruth series, while the provincial authorized book is a \"JERRY\" series for primary reading.\n\nFor Indian children, I believe the Joe and Ruth stories are preferable; though there is an advantage in having both. To avoid confusion in transfers from school to school, I suggest that your next school circulars ask that the Ruth and Joe cards and readers be the beginner's basic text, and the other pre primers and primers used for supplementary purposes and additional exercises.\nDear Sir,\n\nI enclose herewith the application of Captain G.H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools, for authority to expend during the present fiscal year a sum not to exceed $35 as follows:\n\nPrograms of Study $15.00\nEducational Tests 20.00\n\nof which all would be secured from the Text-Book Branch, B.C. Department of Education.\n\nI would recommend that the authorization requested be granted.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nJune 27, 1940.\n\nDear Mr. Button:\n\nI desire to refer to your letters of the 5th and 15th instant in connection with the re-printing of the \"Joe and Ruth Work Book\".\n\nIt is our intention to continue using these books in connection with \"Two Little Indians\" and consequently I consider that you should re-print the books mentioned in your letter of the 5th instant as there is no question that we will use them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Henry Button,\nc/o J. M. Dent & Sons,\n224 Bloor Street West,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa,\nJune 27, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th instant you may authorize Inspector Barry to expend, if necessary, an amount not exceeding $35.00 in the purchase of programs of study and educational tests for use in the Indian schools in British Columbia.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nJ. M. DENT & SONS (CANADA) LIMITED\nPUBLISHERS\n224 Bloor Street West\nTORONTO, CANADA\n\nAugust the 28th, 1940.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nWe have pleasure in sending to you, under separate cover, a copy of the completed book Joe and Ruth So-To School which is just off the press.\n\nAs indicated, we had to print 20,000 to keep within the price quoted to you, so I hope that your first order will be as large as it is economically possible, compatible with the needs of your schools.\n\nWith kind regards, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHB/LB\nJ. M. DENT & SONS (CANADA) LIMITED\nPUBLISHERS\n224 Bloor Street West\nTORONTO, CANADA\n\nSeptember 25th., 1940.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Phil\u2014\n\nPlease do not think me a nuisance, but there is just the chance that my former letter re the arrival of \"Joe and Ruth Go to School\" either did not reach you, or, if you are like me, it is one of the things that got misplaced. Miss Brett constantly reminds me of things that I have not done that I should have done, and when I try to find the letters, nine times out of ten there is the wildest confusion in an endeavour to find the \"secret\" hiding place!\n\nSeriously, wouldn't you like your schools to begin work on the new book during the present term? Naturally, we would like to dispose of as many as possible in the current fiscal year, but your convenience will be ours.\n\nDo you know, I've changed my opinions about the people of the land of my birth? In spite of their irritating ways under normal conditions, when it comes to unprecedented testing times they are good, aren't they? And in spite of the horrors, we cannot persuade any of our intimate friends and relatives to come over here, at least for the duration. They appear to \"see it through with everyone else\". No one can \"liek\" that spirit. At such times they appear to be greater fighters than the Irish, under normal conditions. But you're not an Irishman; like myself, you're a Canadian!\n\nWith kindest regards, I am\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.B./LB\nOttawa,\nOctober 1, 1940.\n\nDear Mr. Button:\n\nI have your letter of August 28th and have also received the copy of \"Joe and Ruth Go to School\".\n\nI am requesting the Government Stationery Office to place 5,000 of these books in stock.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Henry Button,\nc/o J. M. Dent & Sons,\n224 Bloor St. W.,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa,\nOctober 1, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nJ. M. Dent & Sons Limited, 224 Bloor Street West, Toronto, Ont., have prepared a supplementary book to \"Two Little Indians\".\n\nThe name of this new book is \"Joe and Ruth Go to School\" and I consider that you should place 3,000 in stock as we will be using this new book steadily.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J. W. Driscoll,\nSupt. of Stationery,\nDept. of Public Printing & Stationery,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMr. Phelan -\n\nShould we advise Shingwauk\nSpanish\nMr. Flynn\n\nno shipment of supplies\nPens, pencils, etc.?\nOttawa,\nOctober 3, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWe recently had turned over to us a supply of school material which was surplus to requirements in another Department. I am sending a shipment of these to you as no doubt you can use them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hosy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nSent to Principal of Shingwauk Home\n\" \" \" \" Spanish\n\" \" \" \" Mount Elgin\nWe had order No. 144 from the department of public printing this morning for two hundred copies of Canadian Catholic Corona Readers, Primer One and Primer Two. I wonder if you will not decide to have your schools switch to Happy Days for grade one and Tales to Tell for grade four. These new books are such an advance on the old that I should like to see you introduce them. I am holding up this order until I hear from you or Mr. Gay.\n\nWe sent you copies of the new readers, and I expect you have had a chance to look them over by now. All good wishes,\n\nCordially yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. [Signature]\n[Date]\nOttawa,\nOctober 11, 1940.\n\nDear Jim:\n\nI was in Toronto this week and called at Ginn & Company and they showed me order No. 7144 which they had received from the Government Stationery Office ordering Corona Primers Part One and Corona Primers Part Two.\n\nThese books have now been amalgamated and there is only one book for the primer class known as \"Happy Days\". The price of this book is 20\u00a2. I should appreciate it if you would stock this in future as it is much cheaper than buying the two primers as we have done formerly. I suggested to Ginn & Company that they hold order No. 7144 until they heard further from your office.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J. W.

T144 and 8240 for the Corona primers. I wonder if you can hurry them along a bit. Perhaps if you spoke to Mr. Driscoll on the telephone, that would do.\n\nToday we have a further order No. 8868 for 200 Second Readers. This book covers grades three and four, but I hope you will able to make a start at introducing Tales to Tell for grade four.\n\nCordially yours,\n\nJ.\n\n* I am holding this up for your decision.\nOttawa,\nOctober 19, 1940.\n\nDear Norman:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th instant I am again taking up the matter of the Corona Readers with Mr. Driscoll. I am requesting him to change order No. 8868 to read 100 Second Book for Grade 3 and 100 Tales to Tell for Grade 4.\n\nThe books which you forwarded from your office were received and in addition I have a letter from Miss Haughan stating that they are securing the three books that are published in the United States.

I am now advised that they have a further order No. 8868 for 200 Second Readers.\n\nFor your information I attach the following statement regarding the Corona Readers for the year 1940-41:\n\nHAPPY DAYS (new Primer for Grade 1)\nFirst Book (Grade 2)\nSecond Book (Grade 3)\nTALES TO TELL (new Grade 4 Reader)\nThird Book (Grades 5 and 6)\nFourth Book (Grades 7 and 8)\n\nMight I suggest that order No. 8868 for 200 Second Readers be changed to read 100 Second Book for Grade 3 and 100 Tales to Tell for Grade 4.\n\nI have already advised you regarding the new Primer which is known as \"Happy Days\".

Dent & Sons,\n284 Bloor St. W.,\nToronto, Ont.\nOctober 30th., 1942.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief Training Division,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Phil:\n\nYour Reference No. 1-1-4.\n\nThanks for your enquiry of the 26th, which I would have acknowledged sooner but for some estimates that had to be secured.\n\nWe have approximately 1560 sets of the Charts to accompany TWO LITTLE INDIANS. We would be glad to make you a special price of $1.00 per set if you took the lot; on smaller quantities I am afraid we would have to charge the same price as for the last lot, viz. $2.00 per set.\n\nThe bulk of these Charts are unmounted, so we were able to get a good price on mounting such a large quantity, hence what I hope you will agree is a very attractive price of $1.00 per set.\n\nNaturally, we shall look forward with more than ordinary interest to hearing further from you in this connection, especially as we have been counting upon a nice stock order for the current school year for JOE AND RUTH GO TO SCHOOL.\n\nI hope you had a pleasurable and profitable time in England, and that your experiences there made you feel the people of the land of our birth are \"O.K.\" when it comes to \"taking it\".\n\nWith kindest regards, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHB/LE\nSeptember 25, 1942.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nPhotographs of the King and Queen are now available at the Department for distribution to our Indian day and residential schools. It would be appreciated if you notified the principals and teachers of these schools of this fact, when you have an opportunity to conveniently do so from time to time.\n\nThese pictures are not framed, and it is suggested that the task of framing them might be undertaken as a manual training project by the senior pupils.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nMr. M. Christianson,\nGeneral Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Building,\nSearth & Victoria Streets,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, November 3, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI would appreciate it if you would order 50 sets of \"Charts to accompany Two Little Indians\".\n\nThese can be secured from J. M. Dent & Sons, 224 Bloor Street West, Toronto, Ont., at a special price of $2.00 a set. Please let me know when you have them in stock, and requisitions will go forward.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J. W. Driscoll,\nSuperintendent of Stationery,\nDept. of Public Printing & Stationery,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 3, 1942.\n\nDear Henry:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to charts to accompany \"Two Little Indians\".\n\nI am sorry that we are not in the market for any large number. The majority of our schools still have charts and the reason for enquiring was that we thought we would like a few extra sets to supply new schools or schools where the charts were worn out. At the present time 50 sets would meet our requirements. With all the regulations at present in force, we do not want to overstock. I am writing the Government Stationery Office today, requesting them to order 50 sets of these charts from you. I note that they will be $2.00 a set.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Henry Button,\nc/o J. M. Dent & Sons,\n224 Bloor St. W.,\nToronto, Ont.\nNovember 4th, 1948.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Phil:\n\nThanks very much for yours of yesterday File 1-1-4 re the Charts to accompany TWO LITTLE INDIANS.\n\nThere was no desire on our part to \"high-pressure\" you into taking the lot. Your previous letter did not specify any quantity; we asked for information regarding stock, so we gave you the whole works.\n\nI think the regulations to which you allude, viz., not to over-stock, are sound, and we would be the last in the world to attempt to entice, induce or seduce you to evade them in the slightest on our account. Naturally, we would like to clear the \"blocking\" out right, but there is a limit to our desires in such matters, under existing conditions. But don't think that this is a permanent virtue; for when this present \"block\" is over, we shall resort to all the cunning and skill (if any!) at our command along the lines with which, I fear, you are all too familiar.\n\nWith kindest regards, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHB/LB\nOttawa, November 11th, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th instant; it is noted that \"Paths of Grace\" the new Cerena Reader for Grade 2 is now available.\n\nIt will be satisfactory to us for you to supply this new Reader on any outstanding requisitions for the Cerena Reader, Second Book.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J. W. Driscoll,\nSupt. of Stationery,\nDept. Public Printing & Stationery,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nNovember 20, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Requisitions #3420, #3165 & #3399\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to the impossibility of securing \"Bible Stories for Little Children\", except in a $1.00 edition. Under the circumstances you may cancel the orders contained on the above requisitions.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J.W. Driscoll,\nSupt. of Stationery,\nDept. Public Printing & Stationery,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nDecember 1, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. JACKSON\n\nOn Mr. Phelan's return to the office I discussed very carefully with him the question of books, etc., supplied to our Indian schools.\n\nFor your information I attach copy of circular letters issued on April 15, 1940, March 15, 1941, December 3, 1941 and March 25, 1942. You will note from these that since the outbreak of the war we have endeavoured to supply only those books and articles that are absolutely necessary to successfully conduct our schools.\n\nYou will no doubt be interested to know that for the fiscal year 1941-42 the total expenditure for all classroom supplies, with the exception of desks, was $36,764.00. This amount covered not only the original cost of books and other classroom supplies, but also included the cost of transporting them to each school. The amount also included not only the books, scribblers, drawing books, pencils and other like equipment supplied for the individual pupil, but the cost of such general classroom supplies as chairs, blackboard brushes and other requisites for classrooms. The total average attendance at all schools during the same fiscal year was 13,935. Consequently, the average pupil cost of supplying all texts, etc., to which I have just referred above was $2.75. I feel that this is an extremely reasonable figure and, from my experience, compares very favourably with expenditures made by provincial departments of education in those provinces where free school books are supplied by the provincial government. In a recent conversation with you you made some mention of supplying plasticine. As you are aware, this is a moulding unit. It develops a creative mind and gives the child an opportunity to render his ideas concrete. It is ideal to bring in the elements of mechanical drawing. As a result of what I have just stated, the use of plasticine is strongly recommended by educationalists.\n\nR.A. Hey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n1941-42\n\nRpt. 41\nCinda's Mar. 82\n\nDept.

Indian Agency,\n\nNovember 23rd, 1942\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 942, amounting to $25.00 in favour of Mr. Johnson, Kinistino, Sask., for expenses incurred on the James Smith's North Indian Day School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. dated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa\n\nForm No. I.A. 518\nNovember 24, 1942.\n\nMr. D. J. Allan,\nSuperintendent, Lands & Trusts Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Allan,\n\nI think you know that the manuscript for *The Beaver* and the *Muskrat* has been finally approved, and that we are now at work producing the book. We plan to incorporate *The Story of Mary Meeking*, which you were kind enough to hand to me. Do we have permission to use this material, or will it be necessary to write a formal letter to your friend asking for such permission? I hope it will not be necessary to write such a letter, because I suppose the mail service in the north country is slow, but we shall be guided by what you say. If we do have to write, would you please give me the name of your friend?\n\nAnother point which we should be clear on is the matter of the tables of the breeding of beaver. We are taking this information and the general idea of the little illustrations of beaver, kits, and yearlings from the little Hudson Bay booklet. I suppose this material is really the copyright of the Hudson Bay Company, and that we should ask their permission, even though it might be argued that the figures are simply statistical facts. We shall not copy their drawings, but follow the same general plan. I shall be grateful if you will tell me the proper man to write to in the Hudson Bay Company and his address.\n\nWe are anxious to make fast progress on our book, and so shall appreciate it if you are able to reply immediately.\n\nCordially yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPOOR COPY\nOttawa, December 10, 1942.\n\nDear Norman:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 24th ultimo and your phone call last night, I am returning the dummy of The Beaver and the Muskrat. I showed it to Mr. Hoey and he agreed with the various suggestions made in your letter. It is noted that the cost of the books will be approximately 50\u00a2 each, which is satisfactory.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEncl.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nNorman Ingram, Esq.,\nc/o Ginn & Company,\nToronto, Ont.\nNovember 24, 1942.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Phil,\n\nAs you will see from the dummy enclosed with this letter, we are making progress on The Beaver and the Muskrat. We have had an artist spend quite some time on the cover, because the cover of a book is an important thing. We have tried out your suggestion of having simply a drawing of a beaver and a muskrat on the cover and no lettering. However, this did not look well, particularly since it is not possible in a thin book of this nature to print anything on the shelf back. We, therefore, modified your idea, and I think you will be pleased with the sketch which we have finally had made. Incidentally, this is only a preliminary sketch and not a final drawing.\n\nWe think we shall probably have a large drawing made, and print it on the inside cover and first page of the book \u2014 on what we call the end leaves, which in the case of this dummy are India colour paper. This is an effective device to add attractiveness to a book. On the first two pages you will find a pencilled rectangle, which marks the limits of the type page. On several pages we plan to have marginal sketches as shown in the dummy. In addition, we shall of course have numerous photographs.\n\nThe cover on this book is a little too inflexible. We are thinking of using something which is a little springier and which will not crack as readily as this cover. You will note the cloth reinforcing strip down the back of the book. This adds greatly to the strength.\n\nI am disturbed about the way our costs are mounting up. The chief trouble is the smallness of the edition which we can print. It is my understanding that you would take about 2,500 of these books immediately, and that you would agree to take a total of 2,500 later on. This means that the cost of the art work and the engraving must be spread over this small number of books. Since we are making a deluxe book, this runs the cost up to approximately 50\u00a2 a copy. Will this be satisfactory to you?\n\nIn our original talks, I suggested a price of around 40\u00a2, but at that time I thought we could adapt the book for sale in non-Indian schools. You will recall that this plan did not seem feasible from your point of view, and so we look for only a nominal sale outside the Indian schools.\n\nIn normal times we could have probably made a small edition such as this much cheaper, for it used to be possible to get job lots of paper and to get an artist who could\nfit in a small job like this between other larger jobs, and give us a good price rather than be idle for a week or so. Then, too, the printers were always clamouring for work, and would frequently quote a low price for a special job of this nature. That is all a thing of the past, and everyone is so busy that to tell the truth they don't want to be bothered with small jobs. By leaving out the printed end papers, the marginal illustrations, and so on, we could get a much lower price, but when all is said and done the amount of money involved is not very large, and I feel, in view of the importance of the book to your conservation programme, we should make it just as good looking as possible.\n\nWhen you reply to this letter, will you please return this dummy? Incidentally, I should like to hear from you by return, if possible, so that we can order the paper and give the artist the final go-ahead signal.\n\nCordially yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.\nEnc.\nOttawa, January 18, 1943.\n\nReverend Sister St. Felix, Montague Lake School,\nSt. Victor, Sask.\n\nReverend Sister:\n\nThe attached letter has been received at this office.

However, we are confident that you would be interested in examining Saucier: THEORY AND PRACTICE IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL with a view to substituting it for A TEACHER'S GUIDE BOOK TO THE ACTIVITY PROGRAM. The Saucier title is, of course, a much more comprehensive and up-to-date book than the Lane. It not only presents, but applies to classroom procedure the progressive concept of education now widely recognized as outstandingly successful in the elementary school. The retail price of THEORY AND PRACTICE IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL is $5.25, which is, of course, subject to our usual educational discount of 20%, plus carriage charges.\n\nUnder separate cover we take pleasure in sending a copy of this text to you, with our compliments. We do hope you will give it your usual kindly consideration, and that its merits will warrant your recommendation.\n\nIf we can be of further service in any way, we trust\nyou will let us know.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE MACMILLAN COMPANY OF CANADA LIMITED\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Manager, School Book Department.\n\n325-65\n$2.60\nOttawa,\nMarch 1, 1945.\n\nDear Norman:\n\nPlease let me know the number of manuals which are available for the Corona Readers.

However, I think it will be only the new series in which you are interested, and so far we have only one manual, namely, that for Happy Days.\n\nWe have in preparation a workbook to accompany Happy Days, and this we hope to have ready quite soon, say, towards the end of April. I hope your schools will be able to make some use of it.\n\nAnother book which we shall publish this spring, which should be of interest to you, is a journey type geography which will be used around grade 4. The title is Friends in Far Away Lands, and the book is intended as an introduction to the study of formal geography.\n\nI am sending you a mimeographed copy of the manuscript with some sample pages showing the format, and I think you will agree that it is an attractive book. Owing to present day conditions, it seems wiser to us to omit the section on Japan, and that is being done.\n\nCordially yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ\nOttawa,\nMarch 11, 1943.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nWould you kindly inform us as to the quantity of \"A Teacher's Guide Book to Activity Programs\" by Lane you have in stock.

If you keep a supply of the water colours in the half pans we can use them in that manner and thus avoid the expense of the box. Of course, we will also require the brushes. If the refills are hard to obtain, it might be well to confine your stock to the primary colours, namely, red, yellow and blue, of which we will use the most.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa\nMarch 26, 1943.\n\nH.G.S.

I HAVE A SMALL PAPER ROUTE AND MAKE ABOUT $6-72 PER MONTH. ALSO I WAS ON A DEBATING TEAM ON THE SUBJECT OF THE ADVANTAGES OF CHILDREN READING MORE COMIC BOOKS AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT MY SIDE WON.

The number is approximately 6250. If, therefore, you are able to order 6,000 instead of 5,000 copies that will be good from our point of view. However, don't take from this letter that I want to oversell you.\n\nI sent a copy of this book to the son of one of Shirley's close friends in California. I enclose his reply, from which it would look as if the book does have that intangible quality of child appeal.\n\nCordially yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ\nEnc.l\nLANDY & CO., LIMITED\n\nFebruary 2, 1943\n\nDept. of Public Printing & Stationery\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nWe have now received the New Edition of the Bible History with a paper cover. The price of this edition is .50/10-- 45\u00a2 each.\n\nWe received a number of orders from you last year for this book which we were unable to fill on account of the previous cheap edition of this Bible History being exhausted, and the publishers informing us that they did not expect to reprint it. They have probably received so many requests for this book that they have decided to reprint it, and the price is as above quoted.\n\nWe received your instructions to cancel your previous orders and returned them to you. If you desire now to have us fill these back orders and will send them on to us again, we shall be very pleased to do so.\n\nTrusting to hear from you in this regard at your convenience, we remain.\n\nYours very truly\n\nLANDY & CO., LIMITED\n\nMML:MPK\nOttawa,\nMarch 30, 1943.\n\nTo Teachers of Indian Day Schools:\n\nWith reference to your requisition for classroom supplies for the academic year 1943-44, it has been decided to follow the same procedure as in the past two years.\n\nConsequently you should forward to the Department, not later than May 1st, 1943, a requisition for materials required in 1943-44. By so doing, it will enable the officials of this Branch and the officials of the Government Stationery Office to have requisitions completed and shipped before the date of the re-opening of Indian day schools.\n\nOwing to present conditions every endeavour must be made to keep expenditure as low as possible. It is not our intention to deprive any school of the necessary texts, etc., but for the duration of the war it is hoped that those preparing requisitions will do so with the thought in mind that only the necessary text-books, etc., are ordered. It will not be possible to consider supplying any large assortment of kindergarten materials, such as folding paper, number builders, etc. Therefore, if requests are received for large quantities of these articles, this Branch will only supply what is considered necessary. In addition, it will be impossible to secure, for the duration of the war, the following articles:\n\n- Erasers,\n- Rubber Bands,\n- Pencil Sharpeners,\n- Reeds,\n- Pen Nibs,\n- Hectograph Refill\n- Blotting Paper, 19 x 24.\n\nThe teachers should note that water colours in boxes are extremely difficult to secure and, consequently, it has been decided that, for the duration of the war, the Department will only supply water colour refills in Red, Blue and Yellow.\n\nI feel certain that you will cooperate with us in the above regard. ONLY ONE COPY OF THE REQUISITION IS NECESSARY.\n\nR.A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nOttawa, April 16th, 1943.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. H. G.

I hope we shall see something of you the next time you are in Toronto.\n\nCordially yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ Encl.\nJuly 9, 1943.\n\nSister Mary Sheila,\nPrincipal,\nSt. Catherine's Indian Day School,\nDuncan, British Columbia.\n\nDear Sister,\n\nMr. Phelan of the Indian Affairs Branch of the Department of Mines and Resources has written me today asking me to send you a copy of the Workbook for Happy Days, since you are thinking of introducing the New Canadian Catholic Corona Readers into your school.\n\nIt gives us great pleasure to comply with Mr. Phelan's request, and we are sending you this book today. However, it is not clear from his letter if you are familiar with the revised series of readers, and so we are sending you, with our compliments, a complete set of the books published so far, namely, Happy Days, Playscripts, Paths of Grace, Tales to Tell, Stories for Every Day, Treasure Trove, Fact and Fancy, and the Manual to accompany Happy Days.\n\nWide Horizons, the last book of the series (for grade eight) is presently in press, and will be published about the beginning of August. We shall be glad to send you a copy of this book also as soon as it is ready.\n\nProbably you are familiar with the old Canadian Catholic Corona Readers, and so we are sure you will be much interested in looking over the new books, which without any question are the finest and most scientifically prepared series of readers, Catholic or secular, which have been published in Canada so far.\n\nI would draw your attention to the extremely careful vocabulary control in the books for the first three grades. You will find some references to this in the descriptions of Happy Days, Playscripts, and Paths of Grace on the second and third pages of the enclosed memorandum, as well as on the last pages of each of the books mentioned and on pages 63, 64, and 65 of the Teachers' Manual.\n\nNo other Canadian series even approaches this vocabulary control, which is in accord with the most modern pedagogical thought and naturally makes for greater ease in reading and, consequently, more rapid progress in the primary grades.\nSister Sheila\n\nWe have been most careful in the preparation of this series to include no material which is unsuitable for Indian schools. You will find, for example, in the stories of Canadian history that we have no references to blood thirsty savages.\n\nEach book is bound in a different colour and has a distinctive title and cover design. The cloth used is waterproof, so that the books may readily be kept clean by the use of a sponge and a mild soap.\n\nIf there is any further information you would like to have, please be sure to write to us.\n\nPerhaps I should add that the New Canadian Catholic Corena Readers have been authorized for use in the separate schools of Saskatchewan, Ontario, and Quebec, the only Canadian provinces in which readers for separate schools are authorized by the departments of education. In addition, the readers are authorized for use in all the Catholic schools of Newfoundland. You will see, therefore, that practically every Catholic school in Canada uses these fine new books.\n\nCordially yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs - School Files (AC 10), Volume 60/20, File 1-1-74, part 1\nOttawa, August 4th, 1943.\n\nMr. J.

You will note that a number of the schools have been struck off with red ink. This means that we do not want any books sent to these schools just now as we have not yet succeeded in obtaining teachers for them. If teachers are obtained at a later date, you will be advised.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nJ. M. DENT & SONS (CANADA) LIMITED\nPUBLISHERS\n224 Bloor Street West\nTORONTO, CANADA\n\nSeptember 1945\n\nMr. Phillip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Phillip:\n\nWe are in a quandary. We are out of print of TWO LITTLE INDIANS and according to reliable information from England the cost of the reprint would make it necessary for us to charge you in the neighborhood of 30 cents instead of 20 cents as in the past, and at that we would have to print 10,000 copies.\n\nThe point is that we could not reprint without an assurance from you that we could safely do so, as the bulk of the orders in the past four years for this book have come from your department.\n\nI know that on the face of it you must think that a jump from twenty to thirty cents is out of all reason, but based on London's charges I can assure you it isn't.\n\nWhilst I am on the subject, is there any hope of you being able to reduce our stock of JOE AND RUTH GO TO SCHOOL? You will remember that we printed a large quantity after consultation with you, in order to keep the price down to a reasonable figure. We still have nearly 10,000 copies in stock. Incidentally, we sold only 176 in 1945, which means that you weren't able to use them during the last school year.\n\nIs there any chance of you being able to substitute JOE AND RUTH GO TO SCHOOL for TWO LITTLE INDIANS? By the way, even if we placed the order at once, London advises us that they could not ship TWO LITTLE INDIANS before January of next year.\n\nIt goes without saying that we shall reprint TWO LITTLE INDIANS if you wish us to do so and if, of course, you will undertake to absorb an edition of 10,000 within the period that it has taken us to dispose of the last 10,000 printing, viz., 2\u00bd years.\n\nI hope we will be able to realize that we are not trying to \"hold you up\" or to \"high-pressure\" you in any way. If you feel\n\nP.S.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 18, 1943.\n\nDear Henry:\n\nI regret that I have not replied sooner to your recent letter regarding \"Two Little Indians\". In view of all the circumstances I do not think it would be advisable to reprint this book at the present time. I have noted your reference to \"Joe and Ruth Go to School\". We will substitute this for \"Two Little Indians\" and in this way I hope that during the current academic year we will reduce your stock of the latter book considerably.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Henry Button,\nc/o J.M.

File 1-1-4. I am not a bit surprised, of course, that you do not think it would be advisable to reprint TWO LITTLE INDIANS at the present time. Frankly I agree with those who are unfamiliar with the facts, such an increase would suggest profiteering. Therefore, I for one would rather do without the business than take the risk of being suspected of such conduct at any time, let alone times like these.\n\nIt is very pleasing to know that in the meantime you will substitute JOE AND RUTH GO TO SCHOOL. There is no doubt but that this book will serve the purpose reasonably well until such time as it will be commercially possible for all of us to reprint TWO LITTLE INDIANS.\n\nAgain many thanks, and with kindest regards, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHD/LB\nOttawa,\nSeptember 29, 1943.\n\nMr. J.W.

Jones). The book we have is known as \"Progressive Lessons in Machine Shop Practice\" by Harry A. Jones, authorized by the Department of Education of British Columbia for use in the technical schools of the province. This book was apparently published in Toronto by your firm and is dated 1931.\n\nToday the Stationery Office phoned me to the effect that this book is issued in Part One and Part Two. Apparently they refer to a different book than the one which we thought we were ordering. Have you the book which I mention in the first part of this letter? If not, I would appreciate your forwarding the book (Part One and Part Two) about which you communicated with the Stationery Office. We would like to have these two books for review purposes if you have not the other book in stock.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nThos. Nelson & Son,\nBook Publishers,\nToronto, Ont.\nTHOMAS NELSON AND SONS LIMITED\nIncorporating T.C. and E.G.

No doubt the book you have been using is Book One, although it was not so designated in the earlier editions. We are, unfortunately, out of stock of this book at the present, and although it has been on order since last October, we do not expect to have further supplies until about May.\n\nThe manufacturing situation is really a headache and due to short supplies of paper and the labour situation, we remain out of stock for some time when a book goes out of print. In the meantime, we are holding your order and will send the Book One as soon as it comes off the press.\n\nBook Two is a little more advanced but it may be useful to some of your better students. With this thought in mind, I am mailing you a specimen copy of Book Two. We have stock of this on hand at the present time.\n\nHow is the Reader situation with you? You will recall that some time ago I sent you samples of the Crabtree-Canfield Readers. These have proven very popular and should be of great value in the Indian Schools. If you can use any, we would naturally be glad to supply them. I am hoping to be in Ottawa in the late Spring and am looking forward to seeing you at that time.\n\nKindest personal regards,\n\nW. R. McCulley,\nEducational Department,\nTHOMAS NELSON & SONS, LIMITED.\nOttawa, January 18, 1944.\n\nMr. J. W. Driscoll, Superintendent of Stationery,\nDept. of Public Printing & Stationery, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nIn our letter of the 11th ultimo we requested you to order 100 copies of \"Machine Shop Practice\" by Harry A. Jones, from Thomas Nelson & Sons. A subsequent phone message from your office advised us that this was issued in Book One and Book Two. I communicated with the publishers and I find that Book One is out of stock at the present time and Book Two is too far advanced for our purposes. I would request, therefore, that you cancel this order, and when Book One is available the company will advise me and a new order will be issued to you.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, January 18, 1944.\n\nDear Mr. McCulley:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, regarding Jones: \"Machine Shop Practice\". We have also received Book Two and have had a chance to review it. Its contents are too far advanced for our purpose and consequently we will have to wait until you receive a further stock. Please let me know as soon as you do so and we will give another order to the Printing Bureau.\n\nTo tell the truth, we have not reviewed the Crabtree-Canfield Readers very carefully. I will arrange to have this done at an early date and will write you again.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nW. R.

M. Dent:\n\n\"We regret very much that the book Two Little Indians is now out of print. We wrote Mr. Phelan advising him of the position in which we found ourselves in regard to this little book, which meant that we would have had to reprint it here owing to the great scarcity of paper in England.\n\nIt turned out that the cost of producing the book here was so much higher that we could not supply it at anything like the old price, and we suggested to Mr. Phelan that until the costs make reprinting the book possible, that he use \"Joe and Ruth Go to School\" of which we have a very good stock in Toronto.\"\n\nI would ask you to kindly let me know what action you wish taken.\n\nJ. W. Driscoll\nSuperintendent of Stationery\nOttawa,\nJanuary 20, 1946.\n\nDear Bill:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th instant and my reply of the 18th instant, we have searched all our books and I must admit that we do not seem to have the samples of the Crabtree-Canfield Readers which you state you sent to us. You possibly intended to send them and did not do so, because I feel that if they had arrived we would have them some place. I should appreciate your sending me some more samples of these books.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. W.R.

Apparently I slipped up and did not send you the samples of the Crabtree-Canfield Readers which I intended to. I remember showing them to you the last time I was in Ottawa and was under the impression that I had forwarded you samples. Please accept my most humble apologies.\n\nI am forwarding you a set today. These readers represent the latest development in the modern reading field and have a very high social study content. I think they would be particularly attractive for your schools because of the very simple life-like illustrations which add considerably to a well written text.\n\nThe books we are sending you are:\n\nRunaway Toys.....................pre-primer... $ .40\nTo School and Home Again........prince... 1.00\nIn the City and on the Farm......first book... 1.00\nUnder the Roof....................second book... 1.20\nUnder the Sun.....................third book... 1.20\n\nAll these prices are subject to your usual discount of 25%. I do hope the books appeal to you and that you are in a position to place an order for a quantity of them.\n\nI do not expect to be in Ottawa until about the end of May but I am looking forward with pleasure to seeing your good wife and yourself at that time.\n\nKindest regards,\n\nW.

Instead of getting out a new programme for the year 1943 - 44 they thought it advisable to add this supplementary list.\n\nIf you will refer to the various years, you will find the books which are recommended for supplementary reading.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLIBRARIAN.\n\nMTL/DP\nJanuary 12, 1944.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nWe have your letter of January 7 addressed to the Registrar, Department of Education, which has been transferred to the Library for reply.\n\nUnder separate cover we are forwarding the 1941 high school library catalogue list from which all the secondary schools select their secondary school books, together with a supplementary list of books which was issued this year. It had been hoped that a new catalogue would be issued but when this was impossible, they sent out the supplementary list so that the schools would have an opportunity of selecting some of the newer books. All the public schools in the province and all of the public school grades in the secondary schools throughout the province, with the exception of the schools in the city of Winnipeg, select their books from the requisitions for library books issued by the Department of Education. We have included in the shipment a requisition for library books for the year 1942, and also for 1943. A new list is in preparation, for the current year.\n\nYou understand that in order to obtain the grant provided for this purpose, the schools must order from this requisition list. Money which they are able to raise locally, without any reference to the Grant may be spent in ordering books from any sources desired, although it has been recommended that as far as possible, books be ordered from a properly recommended list.\n\nFor the last three or four years, we have selected books for the one and two-room schools. These books are included in larger requisitions for schools employing three teachers or over.\n\nIf there is any further information which you require, we shall be very pleased to supplement the information given in this letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLIBRARIAN.\n\nMTL/DP\nOttawa, November 23, 1943.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMR. HOEY\n\nRe: Readers and Supplementary Readers\n\nInspectors and teachers have occasionally criticized the books sent from this office to Indian Schools. Undoubtedly, the frequent changes of Inspectors has made it difficult to satisfy changing opinion. However, the choice and distribution of books for Indian Schools could be more systematic hence more efficient and less liable to criticism. May I submit the following as a starting point for discussion:\n\nReaders:\n\nThe following chart summarises the readers used in the Provinces:\n\n1. Maritimes: The Corona Readers. All the Indian Schools in these Provinces are under the direction of Roman Catholics.\n\n2. Quebec: Treasury Readers. Two sets are authorized in this province. The Elson Basic Readers and the Treasury Readers.\n\n3. Ontario: The Treasury Readers.\n\n4. All the Western Provinces: Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia authorize the Highroads to Reading.\n\n5. All the Catholic Schools use the Corona Reader.\n\nIt will be noticed from the above that the Highroads to Reading are used in the majority of the Provinces. It might be remarked that the Treasury Readers and the Highroads to Reading are very much alike if not identical.\n\nThe above mentioned Readers are used for Grades one to grades six inclusive. In grades seven and eight two texts are used:\n\n1. Canada Book of Prose and Verse authorized in Nova Scotia, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia.\n\n2. Life and Literature authorized in Quebec, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia.\nIt is not necessary to give the history of the \"Highroads to Reading\" as the background of this series is well known. Teacher's manual and workbooks, which are a decided advantage, are published with this series.\n\nIt would appear from the above that the following suggestions might be considered:\n\n1. The Department should choose the \"Highroads to Reading and the Corona Readers as the authorized Readers for Indian Schools.\n\n2. Due to examination requirements both texts for seventh and eighth grade should be authorized. The demand for these grades is very limited.\n\n3. Indian Schools located in the Provinces that authorized different Readers than the Highroads to Reading should be supplied with copies of the Readers authorized for those provinces, these readers to be used as supplementary readers.\n\nSupplementary Readers:\n\nThe purchase and distribution of Supplementary readers, at least in the primary grades, should be continuous as regards their vocabulary. By this is meant that the pre-primer vocabulary forms the basis for the primer. The enriched primer vocabulary is now used as the basis for the first book, and so on. It follows that these books should be supplied in complete series.\n\nA careful examination of the supplementary readers authorized for the different Provinces will reveal that the Provinces have chosen the same readers. The selection of these readers besides being a judicious choice would obviate a great deal of the criticism.\n\nPermit me to suggest that the representatives of the Publishing Companies be asked to submit a list of their books to this Office two weeks before they display them in the city. This procedure would permit us to make a more judicious choice.\n\nLibrary Books:\n\nLibrary books for Indian Schools should be very simple. A child will take pleasure in reading a book that is below its level. The reading of a book at the pupil's age level entails a great deal of application. A pupil will do this if he must do it, but as the reading of library books is usually left to the discretion of the pupil generally he is not ready to make this effort. This is probably more so for Indian children. This principle should be kept in mind when library books are selected for Indian Schools.\n\nI would like to make the same suggestion for the choice of Library Books as I have made for the selection of Supplementary Readers, that Publishing Companies be asked to also submit lists of their Library Books.\nThe Department aims to encourage the activity movement of education. Library books, therefore, should be selected with this aim in view.\n\nThese suggestions are made so that free discussions will discover means to eliminate all criticism that might have some justification.\n\nRespectfully submitted, November 23, 1943.\nFebruary 25, 1944\n\nMr. A. J. Doucet,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Doucet:\n\nWe have just received a letter from Rand McNally and Company stating that HANDLOOM WEAVING by Todd is out of print and that no copies are available.\n\nWe are very sorry that we can't serve you in this particular case, but hope that there may be further opportunities in the future.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nKatherine B.

I had the pleasure of meeting Sister when she was teaching in Montreal, and after she was moved to this new work, she wrote to me asking for help for the Primary Grades. I understand that you were very much interested in the New Basic Readers, and we are sending to you under separate cover a complimentary Set of these books from the PreReading Book BEFORE WE READ to the Fourth Grade book TIMES AND PLACES. The books that you will receive are in the Cathedral Edition which is prepared for Roman Catholic Schools. We also have these books available in a regular Public School Edition, and of course the prices are the same in every case. With the parcel that is going to you we are sending the textbooks only, but we would like to let you know that we have for use with these books a complete set of Teacher's Guidebooks as well as Think and Do Books for the pupil, and Teaching Equipment which may be used in some schools.\n\nDuring the course of my travels during this school term I hope to be able to spend a short time in Ottawa, and I certainly try to contact you at the Department of Indian Affairs.

We have no book of this precise title but expect you mean our Exercises in Arithmetic, Book Six, and these are the books we are sending you.\n\nOrders #76099 and #76100 call for Pathways in Science. We now have available new editions of these books, and the new series goes by the title New Pathways in Science. I list below the corresponding books of the new and old series:\n\n| New Pathways in Science | Pathways in Science |\n|-------------------------|---------------------|\n| We Want to Know (Primer)| We Look About Us     |\n| We Find Out             | Out-of-Doors        |\n| Changes All Around Us   | Our Wide, Wide World|\n| Our Earth and Sky       | The Earth and Living Things |\n| The Earth and Life Upon It | Learning About Our World |\n| From Sun to Earth       | Our Earth and Its Story |\n\nI am quite sure that the Indian schools will wish to be provided with the latest books and so we are filling your order with these.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Philip Phelan, Chief of the Welfare and Training Branch, Department of Mines and Resources.\nApril 28, 1944.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Welfare and Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nBooth Building,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Phil:\n\nThe enclosed copy of a letter to Mr. Gay is self-explanatory.\n\nHe orders 200 Canadian Arithmetic Workbook, Six. The Book Six might be a misprint for Book C. On the other hand, he may mean Exercises in Arithmetic, Grade Six. On the chance that the latter is the one you want, we shipped Exercises in Arithmetic, Grade Six.\n\nI do not know if you have seen this series, Exercises in Arithmetic, for some time so I am sending you a set of them. We have books for Grades Three, Four, Five, and Six, with an answer book for each grade. These arithmetic workbooks would seem to me to be the best ones for you to use because two of the authors, Smith and Morse, are two of the authors of the Canadian Problem and Practice Arithmetics which you use in quantity. As a result, there is a close correlation between the books.\n\nThese Exercises in Arithmetic are the biggest selling arithmetic workbooks in Canada today. The book for Grade Three is authorized in Quebec and Nova Scotia has just authorized and is distributing free of charge to every pupil in Nova Scotia next September the books for Grades Seven and Eight. We are making Canadian editions of these last two books and they will be ready early in the summer.\n\nIf you have been using some other arithmetic workbook and Mr. Gay intended to order another book from some other publisher, I hope you will consider whether or not it will be possible for you to switch to our book.\nMr. Philip Phelan\n\nI hope you had a good trip to New Haven.

The illustrations are also being brought up to date. You use these books to some extent in the Indian schools, and I am satisfied the revisions will meet with your approval. We shall have the new books ready some time this summer.\n\nYou also use fair quantities of My Fun Book, the workbook to accompany Friends. We are in process of revising the workbook so that it will fit in with the new primer. You are our main customer for this workbook, and before we actually put it in press, I should like to feel sure that you will continue to use it for a number of years in around the same quantities as you have used it in the past.

I hope you will find it possible to use Exercises in Arithmetic, Grades 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 in your schools. They are tremendously popular books. We sent you a set of them on April 28th.\n\nThe present books are made in the United States, but we are selling them in such tremendous quantities in Canada that we plan to manufacture the whole series in this country.\n\nThe Grade 7 and 8 books are already in press, and we are now working on the books for the lower grades. In the Canadian editions, the few American references are, of course, being suitably changed. We also find that by changing the format slightly we shall be able to sell the books for lower prices. For instance, the books for Grade 7 and 8, which are sold for 28\u00a2 in the American edition, will sell for 24\u00a2 in the Canadian edition.\n\nI have said that we have a very large sale all over Canada. Nova Scotia for example provides the Grade 7 and 8 books free to every pupil in the province. The Grade 3 book is authorized in Quebec.

It has many illustrations, which is all to the good; these are in brown and white, not red and blue and yellow and green which is a pity. But it has a place in Canadian libraries because it is the first book ever prepared for Indian children.\n\nReaders for the little folk who are just approaching the mystery of reading in our schools have now something quite exciting to affairs, perhaps still with the cat on the mat, but it is a fluffy bit of cat, and the mat is in colors. There are little girls and boys dandling about on mats and chairs and trees and little cats. Altogether it is quite fun finding out what it is all about.\n\nBut the funny little black-eyed, black-haired, dark-skinned, children didn't lose much of their stolidity when gazing on these pictures. They didn't mean much or anything to them, and perhaps they forget that Indians and white people might be surprised to learn, often find us boring or, dreadful thought, ridiculous. So Indian children might finally yield to the assaults upon their intelligence and learn to read about cats on mats, but they certainly were never enthusiastic about them.\n\nNow beavers and muskrats are different. Beavers and muskrats are something one knows about, and they are interesting animals, building dams, and cutting down trees, and spending time all for nothing about on mats. The new Indian School reader tells all about them.\n\nGetichi Ahnik narrates the story of the children round the camp fire, and they can and do argue whether Pak Face or Red Skin think that adults had anything to do with it, let it be hurriedly disclosed that Thunder Child is the\n\nThere is quite a bit too about taking care of animals and about the duty of trappers. There are even two groups showing how muskrats and beavers in northern Manitoba have multiplied under government protection. But the general is rounded up interestingly when Mr. M. Meekina and Wastasehoot helping.\n\nMr. A. J. Doucet of the Indian Affairs Branch prepared the booklet, and he has done an excellent job.\nDepartment of Public Printing and Stationery\n\nOTTAWA, October 7, 1944.\n\nRef: \"Stationery\"\n\nMr. F.

Kindly let me know what action you wish taken.\n\nJ. W. IRISCOLL\nSUPERINTENDENT OF STATIONERY\nDear Sir,\n\nI am sending you under separate cover the manuscript of a little primer I wrote and used for years in my work as teacher in Indian Residential Schools.\n\nI was employed from 1925-1943 by the Indian and Eskimo Commission in S.E.C. Winnipeg, and taught in the junior classrooms at Elk Horn, Onion Lake, Carcross, Y.T., and Alert Bay. I found our Indian children needed to build up an \"every day\" vocabulary so wrote a Primer for my own use and used it very successfully.\n\nSince my marriage this little book is of no more use to me but I thought perhaps it might be published and used in our Indian schools. A friend of mine illustrated a few pages to show its possibilities. Will you please give this matter your consideration?\n\nYours truly,\nMargaret Dunn\n\nMrs. W. J. Woods\nThe Vicarage, Redcliff, Alta.\nOttawa,\nNovember 10, 1944.\n\nDear Norman:\n\nUnder separate cover I am forwarding you the manuscript of a primer prepared by Mrs. W.J.J. Woods, Redcliff, Alberta. I am also enclosing a copy of the letter that we have received from her which explains the matter more fully. Mr. Doucet and I have reviewed this manuscript and we cannot see that it is any great improvement on many other primers that are at present available.

H. Macklem, School Inspector for South Hastings, which library would be available for use by Township and Reserve Schools on payment of a fee of $10.00 per school, and which library would make available twenty-five books monthly for each school.\n\nI, personally, do not believe this library would be of any great benefit to our Indian Schools all of which schools are equipped with reading material supplied through the Department. While some of the reading material at the Indian Schools is obsolete I would consider it the duty of the separate teachers to prepare requisitions for new library material that would conform with the wishes and recommendations of the School Inspector, and in this way bring their respective school libraries up to date and which at the same time would get rid of a lot of out dated reading material that is cluttering up their library space.\n\nA.

Will the members of each school board please come prepared to pay the fee of $1.00 per section, should the Association be formed, and should you wish to become a member of the library group.\n\nAn interesting programme is being planned. Among the speakers will be Reeve J. Forestell, Miss C. Delaney of the Belleville Public Library, Mr. Brooks Allen, B.Ed., President of the South Hastings Educational Association and Mr. R. H.

I am not clear as to which competing series you mentioned; if you could let me have the name of this competing series I shall be pleased to prepare the comparison as quickly as possible.\n\nMr. Ingram also tells me that you mentioned that a number of your schools in British Columbia are enthusiastic about a new series of Catholic readers. These readers are undoubtedly our Faith and Freedom series. These books are being used in a number of Catholic missions in British Columbia and the Sisters have been recommending them to one another.\n\nIn case you are not familiar with the Faith and Freedom readers I am sending you under separate cover a complete set of them. You will see on looking through them that they are beautiful books and quite suitable for use in Catholic schools. They were prepared under the auspices of the Catholic University of America, and the material is Catholic in origin, much of it having been written especially for the series. Specialists in Catholic education have supervised the preparation of these books, thus ensuring that the material is sound in all pedagogical and religious aspects. We feel sure, therefore, that there will be no objection to the use of these books in any of your schools.\n\nMay I take this opportunity of wishing you a very Happy New Year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGINN AND COMPANY\n\n[Signature]\n\nAnna M.

M. Dent & Sons, Toronto, we are shipping to you from our Montreal office a complimentary copy of this book.\n\nEnclosed with this letter is a circular featuring this title and the two companion titles by Professor Lynde, of Teachers College, Columbia University. Professor Lynde, by the way, was a Canadian, and formerly taught at McGill.\n\nWe understand that you are in touch with Mr. Button and we will depend upon him to carry on with you in connection with your interest to acquire this book and its companion titles.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRalph L. Newing\nDirector\nDIVISION OF GENERAL PUBLISHING.\nDr. Harold W. McGill, Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nEnclosed you will find a copy of our new enlarged edition of Nature Activities, a practical, usable handbook for teachers. As you read it through you will see that it contains leadership help, instructions for making exhibits and collections, nature handicrafts, and hundreds of seasonal activity suggestions.\n\nYears of study and research have gone into the production of this fine booklet. In it the advice of experts in nature education is presented in concentrated form so that each page is a fruitful source of help and ideas.\n\nMarie Gauillette, Girl Scout leader and author of \"Leader's NatureGuide\", and Betty Price, author of the National Recreation Association book \"Adventuring in Nature\", are both outstanding in nature leadership. J. A. Partridge, principal of North Bay Normal School and author of several textbooks on natural science, offers activity suggestions based on his many years of experience in Canadian education. D. H. Farwell, teacher of science and art, has based his drawings on the curricula of all nine provinces, and has kept them simple so that they may easily be transferred to the blackboard.\n\nSince Canadian Nature was first published in 1939 we have presented in it much splendid material on the teaching of natural science. After four years so many new subscribers had been added to our list that we decided to embody the best of these suggestions into a self-contained booklet of 32 pages. Thus Nature Activities was born. Since it was first published in 1943 four editions, totalling 15,000 copies, have been printed.\n\nIn this new edition of double the size, by careful selection and condensation of text and illustrations, we feel that we have perfected a book which is worthy of inclusion in every school library. Every teacher who is confronted with the task of teaching natural science should have access to Nature Activities. It is invaluable.\n\nNature Activities sells regularly for 50\u00a2. It is worth several times that price. When purchased in quantities of 50 or more copies, it costs only 30\u00a2.\n\nMay we suggest that you consider the possibility of supplying a copy of Nature Activities at this low price, to each school under your jurisdiction?\nDr. Harold W. McGill - 2\n\nOnly $105.00 would place Nature Activities as a permanent reference source in 350 schools.\n\nWhen you have examined this booklet carefully we are sure that you will agree with us that it has a real contribution to make to the educational welfare of your province. We trust that you will see your way clear to supply a copy to each school library.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA. R. Whitemore.\n\nARVL\nEnc.\nJanuary 27th, 1945\n\nMr. A.J.

All aspects of the reading skills are covered thoroughly \u2014 reading with understanding, oral reading, correlation of reading with other subjects, methods of presentation, word study, and etc. First grade reading is particularly well treated, there being three books, one for the reading readiness and Pre-primer period, one for the Primer period, and one for Book one.\n\nThese manuals each sell at $0.85 list, $0.68 net. To date manuals up to grade four have been published, and manuals for grades five and six are in preparation. Since these manuals may be of interest to you, particularly for schools in outlying districts, we are sending you under separate cover those which have been published.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGINN AND COMPANY\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S.

(Dept. of Mines & Fisheries - Manager of Indian Affairs). This manuscript was insured.\n\nI suggested in my letter that the Dept. of Indian Affairs might make use of this Primer and since my marriage to Rev. W.J. Woods I have no further use for it.

We have made a close examination of it, and think that, while Mrs. Woods has done a careful and painstaking job, yet the manuscript has no special merit over many similar manuscripts which have come to us, nor is it any better, probably not as good as many primers which we and other publishers already have on the market.\n\nBecause of the expensive illustrations and colour work which are absolutely essential in a primer, such books are costly to publish. I do not think that either you or we would want to publish a book which would simply be another run-of-the-mind primer.\n\nI am sorry we took so long to report to you on this book. I was sick for the greater part of January, and then I had to go out of town for a couple of weeks, and I am only now catching up on things.\n\nCordially yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH\nOttawa, March 9, 1945.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, with reference to the manuscript of a primer which you forwarded to this office last October.

W.

Subsequently the order for the books we require was placed with your firm by the Department of Public Printing and Stationery. Please note that we do not order books direct for our Indian schools, but the order is placed with the Department of Public Printing and Stationery.\n\nInstead of shipping the books to the Department of Public Printing & Stationery, who had placed the order with you, your shipper addressed them to us. This has caused a great deal of confusion and has necessitated extra work, which would have been avoided if your firm had followed the instructions given in the order and shipped the books to the Department from whom you received the order.\n\nI trust that you will carefully note the contents of this letter and, in future, when an order is placed with you by the Department of Public Printing & Stationery, you will send the articles to that Department and not to this Department even though you are aware that the shipment is ultimately intended for us.\n\nOn Saturday last I had a phone call from the Department of Public Printing & Stationery, in which they stated that they had received an invoice from you and that the number of certain books invoiced was much larger than the number received. I refer in this letter to the following:\n\n- Glass Book - Pryor\nGlass Book - Pryor 100 invoiced - 71 received\nStory of Clay 100 - 60 -\nSalmon 100 - 76 -\nStory of Copper 100 - 70 -\nBook of Stones 100 - 99 -\nTrip on Many Waters 100 - 25 -\nRomance of Rubber 100 - 99 -\nRepe Splicing 100 - 73 -\n\nI presume that your shipment was short, but the discrepancy mentioned above has caused us extra trouble, telephone calls, etc.\n\nI simply bring the above matter to your attention, and any correspondence regarding the books that are short should be addressed to the Department of Public Printing and Stationery and not to this Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMessrs.

We regret our delay in replying but the head of our Library Department returned yesterday from her holidays and it was necessary to discuss this matter with her before definite information could be sent.\n\nWe are writing today to the Department of Public Printing and Stationery in relation to the shortage on the order and believe that by this time the shortage has been adjusted. However, as you suggest correspondence regarding this matter will be conducted with the Department of Public Printing and Stationery.\n\nMay we, however, apologize to you for the difficulty that we have caused to your department and to yourself. This difficulty has indeed been inexcusable and has been caused by neglect on our part. This neglect has been brought to the attention of the head of our department and measures are being taken so that similar difficulties will not recur in the future.\n\nWe can only assure you of our concern over this shipment and our assurance more thorough attention in the future.

We will send you a few samples of this record card.\n\nA similar, but somewhat smaller card, has been prepared for Grades I-VI, but we have not as yet received these from the printer. As soon as the Grades I-VI card is received from the printers, we shall send you a number of copies.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nH.P. Moffatt,\nAsst.

It is being reprinted, of course, but we cannot state exactly when it will be available. We had hoped that it would be available for School opening in September, but this is now very doubtful.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n502 Booth Building,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Col. Neary:\n\nIt was pleasant calling on you last week together with the other officials in your department. This is the first visit I have made to Ottawa in several years and I would like to thank you for your very cordial reception.\n\nThere are three main topics which I should like to review briefly with you, namely, readers for the catholic schools, health texts, and arithmetic workbooks. I sent you yesterday sample copies of the books we discussed in each of these fields.\n\nYou will have received by now, I think, a complete set of the new Corona Readers, Grades 1 to 8, and the Faith and Freedom Readers for the first two grades. I am attaching to this letter a copy of our current order form which we distribute to the separate schools in Ontario, and this will enable you to compare the prices of the Corona Readers and the corresponding Faith and Freedom Readers. I think you will agree after looking these over and examining the books concerned that 'we get what we pay for'. In the first two grades the Corona Readers offer an adequate program in basal reading. However, if a more extensive approach is necessary at this level then the Faith and Freedom program is necessary. You will be interested, perhaps, in learning of the action taken by the Catholic School Trustees of the province of Saskatchewan at their recent convention. Evidently this body has spent a good deal of time thrashing out the question of Catholic texts, and just today they received a report of their official recommendations. They have chosen Faith and Freedom readers for Grades 1 and 2 and are then continuing with the Corona Readers from Grades 3 to 8. On the other hand, however, the Ontario Separate Schools, which is a much larger group, is well satisfied with the Corona Readers from Grades 1 through to 8, and are continuing with them. I am giving you this information with the hope that it will be of some help to you knowing what is being done in these two important provinces.\nOn the back of the enclosed form you will find listed the new Beacon Charts which I believe are available in most of your schools. Under Faith and Freedom you will find listed the David and Ann book (wall-size chart). This is an enlarged reproduction of the first twenty-eight pages of the pre-primer THIS IS OUR HOME.\n\nThe following books have been sent to you in the new health series:\n\n| Grade   | Title                          | Price |\n|---------|-------------------------------|-------|\n| Grade 1 | Spick and Span                | $0.80 |\n| Grade 2 | Health Parade, New Edition    | .30   |\n| Grade 3 | Growing Big and Strong, New Ed.| .95   |\n| Grade 4 | Safety Everyday, New Edition  | .85   |\n| Grade 7 & 8 | Youth Health and Safety     | .90   |\n\nThe volume in this series for Grades 5 and 6 I left on your desk last week. The title is Andreas and Others: HEALTH, SAFETY, AND SUCCESS, net price of which is $0.75. You will recall, I think, that this health series has recently been authorized by the Catholic Committee of the province of Quebec. I should tell you also, I think, that the above health series is recommended in the program of studies for each province, and two or more of the books are prescribed for pupil use as a textbook in New Brunswick, Quebec, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan.\n\nIn the field of elementary arithmetic I have sent you the following workbooks:\n\n**Buswell-Brownell-John: JOLLY NUMBERS**\n\n| Grade   | Title                          | Price |\n|---------|-------------------------------|-------|\n| Grade 1 | Primer                        | $0.24 |\n| Grade 1 | Book One                      | .24   |\n| Grade 2 | Book Two First Half           | .24   |\n| Grade 2 | Book Two Second Half          | .24   |\n\n**Smith-Reese-Morse: EXERCISES IN ARITHMETIC Enlgd. Edit.**\n\n| Grade   | Title                          | Price |\n|---------|-------------------------------|-------|\n| Grade 3 |                               | $0.24 |\n| Grade 4 |                               | .24   |\n| Grade 5 |                               | .24   |\n| Grade 6 |                               | .24   |\n| Grade 7 |                               | .24   |\n| Grade 8 |                               | .24   |\n\nThese pupils' workbooks are by far the best materials available both from the standpoint of the teaching of arithmetic and the cost of each unit. The very wide use these books have received in all provinces bears this out. The above workbooks are authorized for pupils' use, in the whole or in part, in Nova Scotia, Quebec, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia.\nThe Teachers' Manuals for JOLLY NUMBERS are an important part of the program containing as they do helpful suggestions to the teacher in the preparation of supplementary material for primary number. The net price of these manuals is $0.80. Also available for EXERCISES IN ARITHMETIC are Answer Books to accompany each workbook to assist the teacher in checking answers.\n\nThere will, no doubt, be certain points on which you would like further information regarding your textbooks for September. I shall be glad to help you in any way possible, and shall look forward to hearing from you at your convenience.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRML/sf\nDepartment of Public Printing and Stationery\n\nOTTAWA, July 29, 1946\n\nRef: \"Stationery\"\n\nJ.

The publishers of this series, Ginn and Company, have replaced it with another series, \"Jolly Numbers\".\n\nI have completed a survey of the textbooks authorized or recommended for primary number work in the nine provinces. I attach a copy of my findings.\n\nThis series I now recommend is authorized for pupils' use, in the whole or in part in Nova Scotia, Quebec, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and British Columbia. Newfoundland has the publishers preparing a modified series to be known as the \"Caribou Arithmetics\" for use there.\n\nThe most satisfactory part of the series for our schools are the Teacher's Manuals. I have studied these carefully with Mr. Doucet and we are agreed that they are excellent teaching texts. They take up the teaching materials of the pupils' books page by page and deal with the purpose, motivation and procedure of each lesson. They should prove a most useful guide to our teachers. Two of the provinces have adopted\nthe use of these books as manuals for teachers in training.\n\nI do not feel that we need to provide the accompanying Wall Charts and Flash Cards. Complete details as to how the teacher can make these are given in the Teacher's Manuals.\n\nCost:\n\nGrade I - Primer $0.24\nGrade II - Book One $0.24\nGrade II - Book Two (First Half) $0.24\nGrade II - Book Two (Second Half) $0.24\nTeacher's Manual, Book One $0.80\nTeacher's Manual, Book Two $0.80\n\nConclusions:\n\nThe \"Jolly Numbers\" series is one most widely used in the provinces and because of its \"direct teaching\" approach should prove most satisfactory for use in our schools.\n\nI would recommend its adoption in our schools as soon as our present stock of \"Individual Arithmetics\" is exhausted.\n\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nOttawa, August 2nd, 1946.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAn Arithmetic Text for use in Grades I and II of our Indian Schools.\n\nFurther to my letter of July 19th regarding a new series of arithmetic texts; after a careful study of all primary arithmetic texts it has been decided to adopt, for use in our schools, the \"Jolly Numbers\" series, published by Ginn and Company, Toronto. This series is now in use by practically all provincial departments of education. The series is for Grades I and II and the authors are Buswell-Brownell-John.\n\nThe entire series, and cost, is as follows:\n\nGrade I - Primer .24\u00a2\n        Book One .24\u00a2\n\nGrade II - Book Two (First Half) .24\u00a2\n          Book Two (Second Half) .24\u00a2\n\nTeachers' Manuals:\n        Book One (Beginners' Course) .80\u00a2\n        Book Two .80\u00a2\n\nIt is our intention to adopt this series in our schools as soon as the present stock of \"Individual Arithmetics\" which you now have is exhausted. Could we please have the numbers you have in stock of the various books in the \"Canadian Individual Arithmetic\" series?\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. J. W.

Neary\nSupt. of Welfare and Training\nIndian Affairs Branch\nWelfare and Training Service\nCanada Department of Mines and Resources\nOttawa, Canada\n\nFile: 1-1-1 WT\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis is in reply to your inquiry of July 16 relative to health texts. We have recognized the need of health material specifically prepared for Indian children, but have not to date been able to do anything about it.\n\nFrom the series available we have chosen and approved for use the following:\n\nAmerican Health Series, by Wilson Pryor and others, published by Bobbs-Merrill.\n\nThe New Health and Growth Series, by Charter, Smiley, Stranger, published by Macmillan.\n\nThe Safe and Healthy Living Series, by Andreas, Goldberger and others, published by Ginn and Co.\n\nInstructions have been given to field personnel indicating the desirability of using these texts with discretion, recognizing the incongruity of teaching which centers about modern appliances not available in the primitive home and community. We have asked teachers to make such adaptations as seem appropriate, and to omit material which has no application in the lives of their children. Much of our health teaching centers about the life activities within the school itself.\n\nOur problem is further complicated by the wide variation among Indian groups. Some tribes have lived close to white civilization for so long that they present the same problems found in any rural population. Others are living in extreme isolation in primitive surroundings. This explains why it has seemed wise to leave the matter of adaptation to local workers.\n\nThis we recognize is far from adequate. Teachers need much more assistance than is now available for health teaching.\nWe shall be holding a curriculum conference with workers in the Navaho area during the month of August. At that time we expect to consider the three series of books listed and to go over them together, making suggestions for modifications for the Navaho children. Director of Education W. W. Beatty anticipates suggesting to the publishers the preparation of a modified edition for use among Indians. Although publishers in general are hesitant to consider such special editions owing to their fear that the number of texts sold will not compensate them for the expense involved, we are hopeful that it may be possible to interest them in such a project. Your interest in the same problem is significant at this time.\n\nI am writing our printers, asking them to send you two copies of the Indian Service book list which you request. I shall be glad to hear from you further, and will keep you informed if we make any progress.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nEdna A. Gerken\nSupervisor of Health Education\n\ncc: Mr. W. W. Beatty\nOttawa, August 5, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Huby,\n\nThe Health Text for Use in Indian Schools.\n\nI have now completed my survey on health texts which are authorized or recommended by the various provincial Departments of Education. I have also written to the Education Branch of the United States Indian Service and I attach a copy of a letter which I received in answer.\n\nThroughout the selection of this series I have worked in close co-operation with Doctor Moore and Doctor Falconer who agree that the series which I have now recommended is the best available at present for use in our schools. I have also contacted the officials of the Department of National Health and Welfare who apparently have not at present any survey made of health text books.\n\nThe series which I have selected is SAFE AND HEALTHY LIVING. The chief editor is Doctor Andres, editor of the School and Health Department in \"Hygeia\". My survey shows that two or more of this series are authorized texts for New Brunswick, Quebec, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. It is also recommended for use in the provinces of Prince Edward Island, Ontario and British Columbia.\n\nThe following texts are enclosed for your consideration:\n\n| Grade   | Title                                      | Price |\n|---------|--------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Grade 1 | Spice and Span (for teacher's use only)    | .80   |\n| Grade 2 | Health Parade (for teacher's use only)     | .80   |\n| Grade 3 | Growing Big and Strong (for teacher's use only) | .83   |\n| Grade 4 | Safety Every Day (for teacher's use only)  | .83   |\n| Grade 5-6| Health, Safety and Success (for teacher's use) | .76   |\n| Grade 7-8| Your Health and Safety (for teacher's use) | .80   |\n\nFrom an educational point of view these books are well organized on cyclical units. This will be especially beneficial in our one-room day schools. It will mean that the teachers will be able to teach two grades together by staggering the material. The same units recur in each book throughout the series, but become progressively more difficult as the grades advance. The final feature, which will be a great help to our teachers, is the test which occurs at the end of each unit.\nConclusion:\n\n1. I would recommend the adoption of the SAFETY AND HEALTHY LIVING series for use in our Indian schools.\n\n2. For this year, I would only recommend that it be adopted on a limited scale for pupil's use. I would suggest its adoption, therefore, as a text book only for grades five to eight.\n\n3. I would like to further discuss with Doctor Moore and yourself a proposal that the Department give a series of cash prizes in tests based on these texts. I will discuss the details of my idea with you at a later date.\n\n4. It will be necessary to draw to the attention of our teachers that local adaptations of this text book material will be necessary.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

We are also including a copy of the companion pamphlet showing the financial report forms proposed.\n\nWe are also sending you a copy of our last annual bulletin on teachers' salaries, showing the distribution in all provinces except Quebec. There is no province yet, so far as we have heard, where province-wide salary scales are enforced, although such plans in Saskatchewan we understand have reached an advanced stage, and have been in effect in England for 20 years or more (Burnham Scales). The common practice here is rather a statutory minimum salary in each province, less than which the school boards may not pay without the specific consent of the Department of Education.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJohn E.

Can you please tell us if this series is now being published in Canada, and could be used in our Catholic Indian schools? If so, could I be sent a copy of each book and workbook recommended for use in Grades One and Two?\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard P. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nMessrs. W. J. Gage & Co., Ltd.,\n82-94 Spadina Ave.,\nToronto 2-B, Ont.\nSurvey of Readers authorized for use by provincial Departments of Education.\n\nAs you are probably aware, many of the inspectors' reports of the past year have made strong recommendations that we change the Readers we are now using, especially in the primary Grades.\n\nFor Catholic Schools:\n\nAs the Catholic Readers used in our Catholic Schools have been recently revised, they are now fairly satisfactory. However, they are still weak in Grade One and Grade Two. I intend to bring this to the attention of Father Plourde upon his return to Ottawa. At present, there is little we can do to improve this situation.\n\nFor Non-Catholic Schools:\n\nThe attached survey sheet shows that the most popular series used by the provinces is the Basic Reader Texts of the Curriculum Foundation Series. This is now authorized in four provinces and is shortly to be adopted in the fifth. It is also recommended in Ontario and in\n\n- Prince\nPrince Edward Island. I also attach a copy of the report of a Committee set up by the four western provinces to investigate the adoption of a uniform text for use in the schools of these provinces. You will note that they decided in favour of the Curriculum Foundation Series.\n\nI have studied this Series and find it well adapted for use in our Indian schools. Only Basic English words are used throughout. Dr. Gray, the Author, is the leading American authority on Methodology in Reading and he has prepared the books so that the Vocabulary List recurs so frequently as to make reading by slower children relatively easy. There are several other features that will appeal to our Indian teachers. One is the excellent Guide Books for use by the teachers. This should prove especially useful for our unqualified teachers. Another feature is the very careful arrangement of material for children first entering school. This should help to overcome the language difficulties which so many of our teachers encounter. The Indian schools in Alaska have already found this Series superior to all others in this regard.\n\nAs this Series is quite expensive, I would recommend that we adopt it in our schools in two stages (this is being done by some of the provinces) as follows:\n\n(a) Grades I and II - for adoption in the school year 1946-47,\n(b) Grades III to VIII - for adoption in the school year 1947-48.\n\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nREADERS AUTHORIZED FOR USE BY THE PROVINCES OF CANADA FOR YEAR 1946-47.\n\nPRINCE EDWARD ISLAND\n\"Pathways to Reading\" to Grade 3,\n\"Treasury Readers\" - Grades 4 to 6.\nRecommended for supplementary reading:\nCurriculum Foundation Series (Elson-Gray).\n\nNOVA SCOTIA\n\"Friends\" (primer),\n\"Canadian Children's Own Reader\" - Grades 1 and 2,\n\"Treasury Reader\" - Grades 3 to 6.\n\nNEW BRUNSWICK\nCourse of Study not ready yet.\n\nONTARIO\nStill using Ontario readers but majority of inspectors recommend Curriculum Foundation Readers for use in our schools and it is listed in supplementary texts.\n\nQUEBEC\nCurriculum Foundation Series.\n\nMANITOBA\nCurriculum Foundation Series:\nGrade 1 - 1946-47;\nGrade II - 1947-48.\n\nSASKATCHEWAN\nCurriculum Foundation Series - Grades 1 to 3.\n\nALBERTA\nCurriculum Foundation Series.\n\nBRITISH COLUMBIA\nHighroads to Reading.\nAPPENDIX B\n\nINTERPROVINCIAL COMMITTEE ON SCHOOL READERS\n\nIn March 1944, there was established a Committee of representatives of the four Western Departments of Education to discuss problems relating to the use of Basic and Supplementary Readers in elementary grades and the possibility of providing suitable readers at a reasonable cost.\n\nAt the first meeting this Committee stated that the Highroads Series was not suitable to their needs. It agreed to recommend for experimental use the following sets of Readers and to consider reports of them at the next meeting of the Committee:\n\n- Easy Growth in Reading,\n- Reading for Interest,\n- New Work-Play,\n- Curriculum Foundation Series.\n\nAt the second meeting the Committee expressed the following needs:\n\n1. For general purpose as the basic series for Grades 1, 2 and 3, preference was given to the Curriculum Foundation Series.\n\n2. For special use for quicker pupils, it recommends the New Work-Play Series.\n\n3. For slower pupils, it considers that the Easy Growth Series was best.\n\nAt the time, the Committee found that it was not able to make a definite recommendation on readers for Grades 3 to 6.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMR. HOEY,\n\nHerewith is the list of New Basic Readers, with prices, which we discussed recently. There will be, of course, 20% discount for our use.

While the Protestant edition of this series has been Canadianized up to the end of Grade III and is produced in our plant in Toronto, the Catholic edition is published by Scott, Foresman and Company of Chicago.

On July 10th, I wrote the Stationery Office requesting them to order two thousand copies and I advised you to this effect on the same date.\n\nWhile I was absent on holidays in August, two letters arrived at the office, one dated August 15th and the other August 22nd. These letters were signed by Dorothy Henry and in each case a copy of \"Joe and Ruth Go to School\" was requested in connection with the reprinting of this book.\n\nThese two letters have just been brought to my attention. I cannot understand why they were written in view of the statement contained in your letter of April 10th.\n\nThe order for two thousand was placed on the distinct understanding that these books were in stock.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nHenry Fulton, Esq.,\nJ.M.

Being past the $2 mark, she is no longer endowed with the essentials of caring for the routine sales.\n\nThis work, originally written in 1898, by a woman singularly endowed with the gift of fine and interesting writing, and strengthened by her long years of Acadia and Nova Scotia research studies (co-founder of the N.S. Historical Society) contains some twenty original manuscript historical essays and novels, especially adapted to teaching and juvenile study.\n\nMrs. Rogers has written some dozen other books, but this is her primary and greatest work. It is full book-length, some 360 pages, adopted in many foreign countries by school boards, proclaimed by Oliver Wendell Holmes \"as the finest work to come out of Nova Scotia, to his knowledge.\"\n\nWith the personal aid of the Right Honourable Mr. MacKenzie King, and the Honourable J. L.

We plan to issue the revised editions of these together with new texts for Grades V and VI, sometime next year.\n\nFor Social Studies:\nI am sending you copies of OUR PRAIRIE PROVINCES and THE STORY OF OUR CANADIAN NORTHLAND, the first two books in a Series of texts for Grades V to VII, dealing with history and geography of each province in the Dominion. The next book to appear in the Series will be the STORY OF ONTARIO.\n\nI think you know most of our workbooks, but possibly you are not acquainted with our READING DEVELOPMENT WORKBOOK, a copy of which I am sending to you also.\n\nAs soon as we get our stock of ARTS AND CRAFTS FOR CANADIAN SCHOOLS, I am sending Mr. A. J. Doucet a copy.\nIn connection with the Arithmetic texts and workbooks for grades III to VI, as I told you Macmillan's and ourselves hope to have a Series on the market in the next year or so, but we will have nothing to show you until next year. As these texts are being planned very carefully, we believe it will be well worthwhile waiting for them.\n\nTrusting that you will receive these books safely, and that they will be of some assistance to you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC. J. Eastace,\nJ. M. DENT & SONS (CANADA) LIMITED.\nOttawa, September 21, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Hey:\n\nNatural Science through the Seasons -\n\nThere has been a considerable demand on the part of our teachers for a reference book in Natural Science. I have recently studied several books of this nature and would like to recommend for your attention the textbook which I attach.\n\nThe author is the Principal of the Provincial Normal School at North Bay. The Ontario Department of Education officials are very enthusiastic about this book. It is especially designed for the teacher of the one-room day school in the country. The stress throughout is laid on the encouragement of active attitudes of observation and inquiry, an understanding of the natural phenomena in our environment, and the inspiring of a healthy enjoyable means of spending one's leisure time.\n\nEvery effort is made to encourage pupil activities. As you glance through the book you will note suggestions for terraria, vivaria, aquariums (page 28), the beautification of school grounds (page 67, page 76, page 103, page 413, page 418), the feeding of birds (page 182, page 191 and page 355), conservation of animal life and forest life (page 97, page 187, page 279, page 459, etc.)\n\nThe book is very practical and contains little that could not be put into actual use by an enterprising teacher in most of our Indian schools. To a child raised in the country, natural science as outlined in this book should do much to create an active interest in school. I have always found that a schoolroom which is attractive can do much to stimulate the child to want to attend such a school. By the use of items such as classroom\nhatcheries, the little Indian child can be brought to realize that in our schools they learn not only Reading and Writing but a practical knowledge of the world around them.\n\nThe cost of this book is $2.75 less the usual discount. I would recommend that we stock this book and inform our teachers so that they can requisition for it for use in our Indian schools.\n\nBernard F.

He will welcome an opportunity to discuss our publications with you, at that time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nfor THE MACMILLAN COMPANY OF CANADA LIMITED\nSeptember 18, 1946\n\nMr. T.R.L. MacInnes  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Mr. MacInnes:\n\nThank you very much for your letter of September 11th.\n\nI should be more than happy to give you permission to reproduce some of my Indian pictures for use in your Indian school books because I am always ready to contribute to the welfare of the Indians whom I consider my best friends. Also I am glad to do this because the Canadian Indian Service has been so helpful to me when I explored the Blood Indian country years ago. Mr. Pew, who was the agent at that time, gave me such splendid cooperation that I am delighted that an opportunity has arisen whereby I can show my appreciation.\n\nIt has always given me no end of pleasure to find your Indians in such good physical and spiritual condition and my days with them will always be one of my dearest memories. If I can be of further service to you, please let me know.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nWINOLD REISS\nTHOMAS NELSON AND SONS LIMITED\n\nPUBLISHERS\n\n91 Wellington St. West\nTORONTO, I\n\nSeptember 18, 1946.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n163 Booth Street,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nSome time ago, we sent you OPPORTUNITY WORK BOOKS IN ARITHMETIC in which you showed considerable interest for use in the Indian schools.\n\nThese have proven very popular and due to the insistent demands of teachers all over Canada, we have now produced the OPPORTUNITY WORK BOOKS IN ENGLISH. There is one book for each grade from 3 to 8.\n\nThese should be particularly interesting to you because of the fact that they are editorially and pedagogically sound and are also low in price. They are priced the same as the OPPORTUNITY WORK BOOKS IN ARITHMETIC, namely 25\u00a2 per copy retail. This price is, of course, subject to your usual discount of 20%, plus transportation from Toronto.\n\nFeeling that you would be interested in these books, we are sending you a sample set today. If there are any other officials who would be interested in examining these, kindly let us know and we shall forward them a set also.\n\nIt is quite some time now since I have the pleasure of being in Ottawa since there seems to be so much work to do in Toronto. However, I hope that some time in the not too distant future, I may get down.\n\nKindest regards to Mrs. Phelan and yourself.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW. R. McCulley,\nEducational Department.\nOttawa, September 19, 1946.\n\nDear Miss Godwin:\n\nI am enclosing herewith four pictures which may be suitable for the Book of Knowledge people.\n\nI would appreciate it if these pictures could be returned when they have served their purpose for reasons explained to you on the telephone.\n\nThank you very much for your interest in this matter and I regret that we have not a wider selection. However, two or three of these will, I think, serve the purpose very well. You will note that the subject is identified on the back of each print.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nExecutive Assistant.\n\nMiss M.W. Godwin,\nNational Museum of Canada,\nMetcalfe & McLeod Sts.,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 23, 1946.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI attach the booklet and pictures I discussed with you over the telephone.\n\nIt is our intention to provide for our Indian schools a series of social studies books and pictures to acquaint the young Indian with the history and culture of his race. Do you feel the attached would be suitable?\n\nI would also appreciate your suggestions as to other suitable material. We are already ordering certain of the United States Indian Services publications of similar nature.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

In the case of the Catholic readers, I believe you are not interested above Grade II in any case, and in both TONE AND RHYTHM and CRAFTSMEN'S you wanted enough material to evaluate the series in general for your purposes. This I think the samples should permit you to do satisfactorily.\n\nWe should be delighted to hear from you if there are any inquiries arising out of consideration of these. Ample stock is on hand of the CRAFTSMEN books, since these are manufactured in this country. In certain cases with the other two series there might be delay in supplying you with large quantities.

Neary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nSparks Street,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nWhen I was in Ottawa you intimated to me that the Department would probably be using a quantity of our book \"A Simplified Knitting Guide for Home and School\".\n\nUnfortunately, we find we have only twenty-seven copies of this book left in stock, and as you will recall the book is mimeographed in several colours so that to reprint it we would probably not be able to resell it at the same low price of fifty cents a copy, its originally published price.\n\nIf there is any prospect that the Department will be using a reasonable quantity of this book every year, we would be prepared to set the book up in type in a more attractive format to sell at perhaps $1.00 a copy, subject to discount.\n\nI am making this inquiry, as although we sell the book in other parts of the Dominion, it would help us considerably to know how many copies a year approximately the Department might be needing if the book was made available in a new format.\n\nIn the meanwhile, you might like to have the 27 copies of the balance of the edition put aside for your needs, which we shall be pleased to do if you will advise accordingly.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC. J. Bustace.\nOttawa, November 12th, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Bustace:\n\nWe are arranging to place an order for the 27 copies of \"A Simplified Knitting Guide for Home and School\" to which you refer in your letter of November 5th.\n\nThis book has already received a wide circulation in our schools and, as it is primarily a teacher's book and is used only by the older girls, there is not a heavy demand for it. I would say that, at the outside, we would be able to use only 100 copies a year. I hope this is the information which you seek.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

I have already written to Chicago for some information, but on checking a listing that I have here in some Scott Foresman material, I find a very fine comment on Father O'Brien, and I quote as follows:\n\nO'BRIEN, Rev. John A. (Cathedral Basic Readers)\n\nReceived training in Spalding Institute, Peoria, Illinois; graduated from St. Viator College, Bourbonnais, Illinois; was ordained - Holy Cross College, Worcester, Massachusetts; majored in work for Catholic Education in the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. Appointed Superintendent of Schools in Peoria Diocese and Chaplain to Catholic students at University of Illinois. Did research in silent reading at University of Illinois and University of Chicago. Was one of first to use slides and movies to show eye movement. Founded Newman Club and inspired awarding of Newman medal for outstanding citizenship work. Prominent in lecture field. Is now Professor of Philosophy of Religion at University of Notre Dame. Author of Evolution and Religion, Silent Reading, The Church and Birth Control, The White Way, The Faith of Millions, et al. Contributor to The Sunday Visitor.\n\nNo doubt you will wish to pass this information on to some of the Catholic authorities in Ottawa, and if we have anything further from Chicago that differs from the above, you will be kept fully advised.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nF.R.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nThank you for your letter of December 16th. We are surprised to learn that the CANADIAN CATHOLIC CORONA READERS for grades one and two are not satisfactory to the Catholic teachers since this is the first complaint we have had. This series is extremely popular throughout Canada.\n\nHowever, since the teachers are requesting more up-to-date readers for grades one and two, we suggest that you substitute the FAITH AND FREEDOM READERS. This excellent series of basal readers for Catholic schools was directly inspired by the Apostolic letter of Pope Pius XII to the American Bishops in which he urged a restatement of the traditional Christian teaching regarding the nature of man and society. In response, the American Bishops initiated a movement for the instruction in the fundamental nature of democracy and of Christian social living. They turned to The Catholic University of America to forward such a movement and as a result the FAITH AND FREEDOM series was published.\n\nThe method of the series has been painstakingly worked out to provide the maximum encouragement and growth for the child who is learning to read. Vocabulary is carefully controlled through the early grades and detailed suggestions to the teacher outline a steady increase in power to read.\n\nThe books themselves are unusually attractive, with beautiful illustrations and lively, original stories. They have provided the best answer yet to the problems of teaching reading expertly while conveying a purposeful message. For your information, I list below the readers, workbooks, and teachers' manuals for grades one and two -\nOur First Book - a reading-readiness book\nHere We Come - preparatory Pre-Primer\nThis is Our Home - basal Pre-Primer\nWorkbook for This is Our Home\nHere We Are Again - absorption Pre-Primer\nThis is Our Family - Primer\nWorkbook for This is Our Family\nThese Are Our Friends - Book One\nWorkbook for These Are Our Friends\nThese Are Our Neighbors - Book Two\nWorkbook for These Are Our Neighbors\nTeaching First-Grade Reading I - manual for readiness and Pre-Primer period\nTeaching First-Grade Reading II - manual for Primer\nTeaching First-Grade Reading III - manual for Book One\nTeaching Second-Grade Reading - manual for Book Two\n\nWe are sending you examination copies of the above books with our compliments. OUR FIRST BOOK and THIS IS OUR FAMILY are at present out of stock but copies of these two titles will go forward to you in a few weeks.\n\nWe also have the following learning aids -\n\nHere Come David and Ann - a Wall Chart to accompany Here We Come\nThe David and Ann Book - a Wall Chart to accompany This is Our Home\nWord, Phrase, and Picture Cards for the Pre-Primer and Primer\nWord and Phrase Cards for Book One\n\nWe are sure you will agree, after you have had an opportunity to examine the books we are sending you, that the Catholic teachers will enjoy using these attractive, up-to-date readers.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGINN AND COMPANY\n\nJean C. Jordan\n\nJ.\n\nP.S.

I have now received a letter from the publishers, Ginn & Co., in which they state as follows:\n\n\"Mr. Stevenson, our office manager, tells me that there are no back orders unfilled from the Department of Public Printing and Stationery with regard to the four books of the Jolly Number Series. If you require further quantities of the Jolly Numbers Primer in order to fill orders, we are in a position to supply these immediately. The stock of Jolly Numbers Book One and Jolly Numbers Book Two First Half is in somewhat scarce supply, and we doubt that we will be able to arrange reprinting of these two titles until some time in February.\n\nIt is suggested that you review your back order situation with regard to this Series with the object of raising each one to at least 700 copies of each title. This will enable us to have on hand sufficient stock to handle the heavy orders which will be received for these books during the summer holidays.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Apparently they are quite strong and will stand being dropped or thrown on the floor; they are more hygienic as they cannot be \"chewed upon\", and they should last longer.\n\nTherefore, I am attaching hereto a requisition for one gross of these penholders, in assorted colours, to be forwarded to the Six Nations Indian schools for trial purposes.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

RUSSELL\n\nProfessor of Education and Associate Director of Supervised Teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, and a well-known reading expert examines the reading program in the elementary school. His new book gives real insight into how children learn to read and how they may be helped to reading attainments approximating their reading capacities.\n\nChildren Learn to Read\n\nGINN AND COMPANY\nPublishers\nDAVID H. RUSSELL\n\nChildren Learn to Read\n\n\"Reading achievements seem closely related to both general school success and to personality adjustments. An activity of such continuing importance in the lives of children and teachers cannot be examined too often or too critically,\" says Dr. Russell in the Preface to Children Learn to Read.\n\nIn this book he thoughtfully examines research and good practice and applies them to the reading problems of a modern elementary school, with emphasis always on child development.\n\nIn two ways this book goes beyond most published discussions of reading. First, it gives the teacher a better understanding of her task by suggesting the sociological, historical, and psychological backgrounds of reading instruction. Second, it emphasizes the developmental or vertical nature of growth in reading abilities, thus giving the teacher greater insight into the child's reading achievements in relation to his total development.\n\nPart I of Children Learn to Read, as is logical, concerns itself chiefly with the background material mentioned above. Part II presents an overview of the whole program of reading instruction and gives typical aims and activities at various levels. Part III makes clear that reading, far from being a simple process, is a complex of various abilities which grow, not by hard-and-fast levels, but continuously from infancy at least through the junior college. It shows how the development of reading abilities reflects other phases of the child's maturing.

I was impressed with the new organization and feel that when the system is in effect, our teachers and principals will get their books in faster time than at present.\n\nI made a careful check of the books on the shelves and I was naturally perturbed at the short supply. I immediately made an estimate of the requirements up to the end of December, 1949. Please find attached this list of books with the code numbers from your stock catalogue.\n\nIt is of course possible that some of these books have already been ordered but have not yet been delivered by the suppliers. Therefore, you can have the orders checked and can reduce the quantities shown accordingly.\n\nI would suggest that the suppliers be contacted to fill your outstanding orders as soon as possible. I am most anxious that all requisitions placed by me up to July 21, 1949, be filled as fully as possible and sent to the schools before the opening date of September 6, 1949.\n\nIf\nIf Mr. July or yourself require further information, please do not hesitate to call me at Local 4465 or Mr. Tyack, who has charge of all requisitions and orders, at Local 7663.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n| Quantity | Book No. | Title |\n|----------|----------|-------|\n| 2,000    | B.235    | Think-and-do Book for Pre-Primary Program |\n| 50       | B.236    | Combined Guidebook for the First Grade Program |\n| 50       | B.237    | Guide Book for Second Grade Program |\n| 1,000    | B.238    | Before We Read |\n| 2,000    | B.239    | We Come and Go |\n| 2,000    | B.240    | We Work and Play |\n| 2,500    | B.241    | We Look and See |\n| 2,000    | B.242    | Fun with Dick and Jane |\n| 2,500    | B.243    | Think-and-do Book for B.242 |\n| 2,000    | B.244    | Friends and Neighbours |\n| 2,000    | B.245    | Think-and-do Book for B.244 |\n| 1,000    | B.246    | More Neighbours |\n| 2,000    | B.247    | Think-and-do Book for B.246 |\n| 800      | B.248    | Workbook in English Grammar - Grade 7 and 8 |\n| 60       | B.249    | Natural Science Through the Seasons |\n| 1,500    | B.252    | More Friends and Neighbours |\n| 3,000    | B.253    | Think-and-do Book for B.252 |\n| 500      | B.255    | The Pupil's Own Vocabulary Speller, Book 2 |\n| 50       | B.257    | Speak and Spell |\n| 50       | B.258    | The Health Parade |\n| 50       | B.259    | Growing Big and Strong |\n| 50       | B.260    | Safety Every Day |\n| 750      | B.261    | Opportunity Work Book in English, Grade 8 |\n| 700      | B.262    | Opportunity Work Book in English, Grade 7 |\n| 500      | B.263    | Health Safety and Success |\n| 500      | B.264    | Your Health and Safety |\n| 1,000    | B.265    | Paths of Grace |\n| 500      | B.266    | Workbook for B.265 |\n| 500      | B.267    | Tales to Tell |\n| 500      | B.268    | Workbook for B.267 |\n| 100      | B.269    | Stories for Every Day |\n| 100      | B.270    | Treasure Trove |\n| 50       | B.271    | More Tales |\n| 700      | B.278    | Word Ways |\n| 400      | B.279    | Words at Work |\n| 500      | B.280    | More Progress |\n| 400      | B.280A   | Carry On |\n| 1,500    | B.282    | Jolly Numbers - Primer |\n| 2,000    | B.283    | Jolly Numbers - Book 1 |\n| 2,000    | B.284    | Jolly Numbers - \" 2 - First Half\" |\n| 2,000    | B.285    | Jolly Numbers - Book 2 - Second Half |\n| 60       | B.286    | Beginners' Course - Teacher's Manual |\n| 60       | B.287    | Jolly Numbers - Book 2 - Teacher's Manual |\n| 50       | B.287    | The New Canadian Speller - Book 1 |\n| 50       | B.288    | The New Canadian Speller - Book 2 |\n| 100      | B.289    | New Canadian Geography |\n| 200      | B.302    | These are our Friends |\n| 600      | B.303    | Workbooks for B.302 |\n| 100      | B.304    | This is Our Family |\n| 600      | B.305    | Workbook for B.304 |\n| 100      | B.306    | Our First Book |\n| 100      | B.309    | More we Can |\n| 300      | B.311    | Workbook for B.309 and 310 |\n| 200      | B.313    | A Story Workbook in Canadian History |\n| 300      | B.317    | Workbook for They Are Our Neighbours |\n| 600      | B.318    | Streets and Roads |\n| 300      | B.319    | Think-and-do Book for B.318 |\n| 400      | B.321    | More Streets and Roads |\n| 500      | B.351    | Nelson's School Atlas |\n| 200      | B.322    | Highlands Dictionary |\nJuly 21, 1949.\n\nMr. Romeo Querry,\nDirector of Services,\nDepartment of Public Printing and Stationery,\n75 St. Patrick Street,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMaps for use in Indian Schools.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRecently, we ordered a number of maps from the Angus Mack Company, P. O. Box 223, Toronto, Ontario. These are the maps which we wish to use in our Indian schools.\n\nThere are on hand in the stock-room a number of old and dirty maps. In the past, these maps have been sent to our schools and we do not feel that it is fair to have these sent and to be charged high prices for this stock.\n\nI feel that the entire stock of maps should be carefully reviewed and that the old ones should be disposed of in the usual manner.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nBernard F.

You will note that these pages list the library books in stock at the present time. On this list I have clearly marked those books which should be kept continually in stock and which should be re-ordered as soon as their stock falls to one-third of the amount originally ordered. In many cases these books should be re-ordered immediately as the quantity has fallen below this danger point.\n\nFrom time to time, we will advise you further concerning the titles of library books which should be kept in stock.\n\nTitles not listed, can be discontinued when the present supplies are depleted. In many instances they were purchased as job lots and no further supplies of these titles can be obtained as they are permanently out of print. Mr. Joly can therefore drop these from future catalogues.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

There is no reduction in cost when a number of prints are made from one negative at the same time.\nUnfortunately, we cannot furnish samples except in the 8 x 10 size, as only these can be reabsorbed in our files if returned unused. If you wish though, you could put in an order for just one enlargement, and if it proved satisfactory to you, we could go ahead and make up the rest.\n\nIf there is any way we can help you further, please do not hesitate to let us know.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\nDorothy Hall,\nAssociate Photo Editor.\n\nNY:DC\nWax Crayons\nThirst Tacks\nPen Nibs fine medium\nRubbers A\nB\nC\nD\n1973\n2933\nWater Colors Box 10\nBrushes #5\nDry Tempera\nWater Refills deep red & blue\nHand Bills\nWhite Chalk\nPoster Paper 4 x 12\nFolding 6 x 9\n6 x 6\nScissors\nDrawing Books #1\n#2\nUnited Kingdom Information Office,\nOttawa.\n\nWith the Compliments of\n\n(Mrs.) W.T.

McLean, President, McLean's Merchandize Sales Limited was in town on September 28th soliciting business for books and reading materials he is handling.\n\nAmong other things, he interested me in a set of Richard's Topical Encyclopedias. These books were originally planned as a 20 volume set for use in schools retailing at $15.00 a set. Through some miscalculation they overprinted eight volumes each dealing with a different topic as shown on the attached circular. Each volume carries an index for the volume and there is no reference from one volume to another, making each book complete in itself.\n\nThe binding, quality of paper, illustrations, vocabulary material etc., are exactly the same as in the Book of Knowledge. Mr. McLean tells me that the Department of Education for Saskatchewan and Quebec have purchased these sets. The price of $15.00 for each set of eight volumes is very reasonable.\n\nIn view of the fact that many of our residential schools have a set of the Book of Knowledge and the Grolier Encyclopedia, I would respectfully recommend that Mr. Driscoll be requested to place in stock ten sets of these Encyclopedias.\n\nM.F. Track.\nRichard's Topical Encyclopedia\n\nVol. 1 - Science - Geology, the story of the Earth, Astronomy, the story of the heavens; Meteorology, the story of the weather; Physics, the laws of the Universe; Electricity; Chemistry.\n\nVol. 2 - Science - The Animal Kingdom; Birds of all kinds and all countries; Mammals; Animals of all kinds, both wild and domesticated.\n\nVol. 3 - Science - Prehistoric Life, the record of the rocks, the dawn of life; Zoology, the Animal Kingdom; the story of Life, Centipedes, Insects, Spiders, Amphibians, Reptiles.\n\nVol. 4 - Basic Industries - Clothing, Food Plants, Plant Products, Meat, Minerals and Metals; Petroleum, Precious Stones, Textiles and origins of fashions, their history, growth, production and use.\n\nVol. 5 - Applied Science - Communication; Language, Newspaper, Postal Service, Radio and Television, Transportation primitive and modern, Sea, Rail, Automotive and Air.

They informed me that they are not satisfied with these readers and would rather use the readers authorized by the Provincial Departments of Education. They pointed out that there is little catechism in the Corona Readers and any that there may be can be taught from the catechism books.\n\nI have made a study of these readers and am convinced that the idea is a sound one. However, as you have a large stock of Corona readers, I do not wish to discontinue issuing these readers but will continue to supply them to our schools when the teachers request them.\n\nI would suggest that you discontinue stocking any more of these readers and cancel all outstanding orders. Should requests for these readers exceed your stock, it will be in order for you to make individual purchases for each requisition. The Corona Readers series include:\n\nB. 265 Paths of Grace, Grade 3\nB. 266 Workbook for Paths of Grace\nB. 267 Tales to Tell, Grade 4\nB. 268 Workbook for Tales to Tell\nB. 269 Stories for Everyday Grade 5\nB. 270 Treasure Trove, Grade 6\nB. 271 Fact and Fancy, Grade 7\nB. 272 Wide Horizons Grade 8\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMr. Romeo Query,\nDept. of Public Printing & Stationery,\nOttawa.\n\nBernard F.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No., dated.\n\nVoucher No.: Date:\nNovember 4, 1949.\n\nDear Mr. Query:\n\nIn my letter of October 21st, I pointed out that we are gradually working away from the Corona Readers and it was suggested that these should not be re-stocked.\n\nWe are eventually going to discontinue supplying the Faith and Freedom Readers for the same reason. However, as your present stock is limited and as there will be some demand for these, I would suggest the reduction of the maximum and minimum as follows:\n\n| Stock Number | Number of Book       | Minimum | Maximum |\n|--------------|----------------------|---------|---------|\n| B. 302       | These Are Our Friends| 50      | 100     |\n| B. 303       | Workbook             | 50      | 150     |\n| B. 304       | This Is Our Family   | 50      | 100     |\n| B. 305       | Workbook             | 50      | 150     |\n| B. 306       | Our First Book       | 50      | 100     |\n| B. 309       | Here We Come         | 50      | 100     |\n| B. 310       | This Is Our Home     | 50      | 100     |\n| B. 311       | Workbook for B.309 & B.310 | 50 | 100 |\n\nIt is suggested that these books be placed in stock up to the maximum stock. When the minimum stock is reached, it is suggested that the Department be contacted on the next move. This decision cannot be made at present as it is not certain how the teachers will respond.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

This book has become obsolete and will no longer be supplied and therefore should not be stocked. We will continue with B298 The Canadian Speller Book 2 for some time, at least until the present stock is depleted when the matter will be re-considered.\n\nIn place of the Canadian Spellers, Book 1, Pupils Own Vocabulary Spellers Book 1 and Book 2, B. 254, B255 will be in use.\n\nAs B254 is in short supply it will be in order for you to stock six hundred copies of Pupils Own Vocabulary Speller, Book 1.\n\nYou are authorized to cancel all dues for Canadian Speller, Book 1 and advise me of the ones cancelled in order that appropriate action considered necessary may be taken.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Neary;\n\nSince writing you yesterday we have taken over another very beautiful Encyclopedia known as \"THE HOME UNIVERSITY\".\n\nThis set compares very favourably with the Richards Encyclopedia, with the exception that it just leans a little more toward the student and scholar type of encyclopedia.\n\nThis set is very beautifully bound and is brought right up to date in 12 volumes and the subscription price is $79.80. If you would use a quantity of these we shall be very glad indeed to supply them to you at $25.00 per set, P.O.B. Toronto.\n\nUnder separate cover we are mailing complete circular describing the work and also a sample volume - #6 of the set.\n\nThis is another instance where there is only a limited quantity and we are giving the educational departments the first opportunity to procure them at this price, which you will note is about one-third the regular price of the set.\n\nThanking you and looking forward to hearing from you, we remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMcLEAN MERCHANDISE SALES LTD.\n\n[Stamp]\nJanuary 23, 1950.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nI have your letter of January 17th and a copy of Volume 6 of The Home University Encyclopedia.\n\nWe have given the book a careful study and feel that it has much to be desired. Although it would appear from the face page that the edition was revised in 1946, on going through the book it is found that the information was not brought up to date, (e.g.) Hamilton, Halifax, Goering, etc.\n\nThe volume we received has a considerable number of pages on which no printing appears making the whole book defective.\n\nThis encyclopedia may be useful for United States schools but cannot comply with our requirements.\n\nI am returning the sample copy in order that you may find the defects.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

This book is the second of its kind as \"First Year Woodwork\" was published about six months ago.\n\nThe first year book is now in use in Indian Day and Residential schools and is of course on the market for use in provincial schools. You will note that Mr. Doucet has divided the work into \"projects\". Each project is described in a job sheet and the materials, tools, and procedures are carefully outlined.\n\nYou will find tests at regular intervals and other important items such as stock bills, progress record cards, etc. Many of the sketches are Mr. Doucet's own work and of course all the text has been prepared by him.\n\nI also attach two forms which accompany the book. One is entitled \"Student Record Sheet\" and the other \"Complete Stock Bill Sheet\". These are for use in schools in which there is a Manual Training instructor employed.\n\nWhile primarily designed for Manual Training teachers, this book will prove very helpful to Day School teachers who are trying to carry out a small programme of Vocational Training.\n\nBernard F.

Woodley\n\nI have just completed reading the above-noted manuscript and cannot be too sure as to the purpose it can be put to, if any, in our schools.\n\nThe material included is far from complete as there are enormous possibilities for covering more subjects such as culture, mode of living, religion, contributions to the White man, etc. Many of the subjects are covered but not as fully as required for school children, as not only facts are required, but these have to be elaborated to make the reading both interesting and educational.\n\nThe style is most unsuitable for school children. Mr. Woodley treats the subject matter as if he were writing a Chemistry book or Arithmetic book for he is stating facts after facts. To make a history book readable and valuable one must introduce short stories, incidents, comparisons, etc. A history book ought to be written like a novel rather than an assembly of facts.\n\nI am attaching a list of notes picked up from time to time while reading the manuscript.\n\nI think the book has possibilities as there has been a great deal of research made on the material, but it would have to be entirely rewritten to suit our pupils' requirements.\n\nM.F. Track.\n1. Lack of variety of types of seat work problems such as True, False, Matching, Filling blanks, completion sentences.\n\n2. Lack of variety of seat work (e.g.) Draw your version of a totem pole (2) buffalo (3) buffalo fence, sand table work, projects, cutting, constructing etc.\n\n3. \"The Coming of Jacques Cartier\" Page 22 begins too abruptly. It might be worthwhile to introduce the reader to the geographic locations in Eastern Canada where Cartier landed.\n\n4. Dates are very frequently used. These are meaningless to pupils, expressions such as \"350 years ago\" might be better.\n\n5. \"Order of Good Cheer\" Page 26 provides a good incident to give a short interesting story on what it meant to recreate an interest for the reader.\n\n6. Port Royal could be connected with the nearest present place name.\n\n7. \"Coureur-de-bois\" should be more elaborated on such as his work, his hardships, etc. A short interesting story would prove very valuable and interesting to the reader.\n\n8. A more vivid explanation of the hardships encountered by the missionaries may prove interesting reading. Such things as contrasts of living, homes, foods, habits. Just saying \"hardship\" has little meaning to the reader.\n\n9. \"Quebec\" should be connected with the present \"Quebec City\".\n\n10. Where are the \"Alleghany\" Mountains?\n\n11. A short story on Madeleine de Vercheres would prove interesting to a reader.\n\n12. Where is \"La Prairie\"? A larger present day city would have more meaning to the reader.\n\n13. Location of Caughnawaga should be given in miles from Montreal.\n\n14. Carrying the large bell to Caughnawaga would be a good place to say something on the mode of transportation used by the Indians of that time.\n\n15. Brantford, the large manufacturing centre could be given as the location of the Six Nations Indians in Canada.\nBeing given a \"Baronet\" and becoming \"Sir William Johnson\" P. 43 is meaningless to a reader of elementary school level. More explanation may be necessary.\n\n17. More explanation of the term \"Seven Years War\" may be called for.\n\n18. \"Delivering my pipe\" would warrant more explanation such as What was it? What was meant? etc.\n\n19. Where is Louisburg. Page 46. More explanation would seem necessary.\n\n20. What is a navigator? Page 46. \"Making Soundings\" \"Preparing a Chart\", \"Transit of Venus\" \"Astronomy\".\n\n21. What is a rattle? Page 47. What use might the Indian have for it? What was it like?\n\n22. Did the Indians sing songs as we do. Page 47. Was there any reason for their songs?\n\n23. Where did the Indians get the red paint? Page 48.\n\n24. How did the Indians skin the caribou and make the clothing? What did they use for thread, needles, buttons?\n\n25. Did Indians wear shoes, hats, socks? Page 48\n\n26. More on religion would be useful. A story or two would be useful and interesting to the reader.\n\n27. The medicine man should get more special treatment.\n\n28. Hudson's Bay Company, particularly its establishment and its connection with the Indians, how it operated would be useful and interesting to the reader. Page 55.\n\n29. What were palisades? Page 50. A good opportunity to describe the early forts, their construction, their use, the powder house, etc.\n\n30. Marriage is brought in from time to time, what a good opportunity to give a short story on marriages, the ceremonies, etc. as applied to Indians.\n\n31. Where is Fort Nelson? Would a present location not be clearer?\n32. Land and westward from Fort Churchill Page 51 would not lead to Assiniboine River or the Prairie Provinces except in the northern section.\n\n33. More incidents from Kelseys Journal would be interesting. Such exerts as locations, Indian mode of living, villages, food, etc.\n\n34. \"Advanced him (Kelseys) in their service\" Page 52 should be further explained.\n\n35. Was all of Canada declared a Dominion in 1867? This should be explained. Page 58.\n\n36. What was Rupert's Land? Page 58\n\n37. How did liquor have bad effects on the Indians? Page 58. Why was it sold to the Indians? Page 58. These questions should be given more space.\n\n38. Why did the police wear red uniforms? Page 58. A short story on their hardships, both physically and mentally. How they reached their destination, where their headquarters were, who their chief was, their equipment. All this would be useful information to the reader. What were some of the common offenses of law that were encountered.\n\n39. What are treaties with Indians? Page 59. What did the Indian receive for signing the Treaty. What did he promise the Queen in return. A story on treaty celebration interweaving pertinent facts would be very interesting to a reader.\n\n40. More information on reservations, grants would be useful. Page 60.\n\n41. Need for education should be given more space. Page 61\n\n42. What was the Canadian Pacific Railway. Page 61.\n\n43. Who are the Metis? Page 65.\n\n44. Where is Lower Canada? Page 66.\n\n45. A description of an Indian feast and ceremony thereto would be interesting.\n\n46. What are wampum belts. A description and story behind it would help. Page 87\n\n47. What was the Red Rebellion? Page 101.\n48. Description of lacross might be helpful.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nTo: Teachers in Isolated and Seasonal Schools\n\nNotes on the Use of the Phonograph\n\n1. Purpose:\nThe machine and records are supplied for use by the teacher in a planned programme. As the battery-pack has a limited number of hours of life, and replacement is inconvenient and expensive, the use of the apparatus must be rationed and spread over the school term. It is not, therefore, a device for amusement at recesses and before and after school.\n\n2. Use-history:\nOn a line in the Register in the \"Name of Pupil\" column write \"Radio-phonograph\" and on days when the apparatus is used record the number of minutes of hook-up time under the day and date. A study of this log will permit anticipation of the date when the battery-pack will be worn out.\n\n3. Subjects of instruction:\nThe apparatus is intended primarily to assist with the teaching of English (or French). It is hoped also that it will reinforce those teachers who are not naturally musical, and thus add to the attractiveness of the schoolroom.\n\n4. Using the records:\nEach record is to be used with a definite plan. Before embarking on a programme of instruction the teacher should play over all the records in the absence of the pupils and select the one which is to be the basis of the first selection of lessons. The pupils must first become familiar with the melody. Having learned the melody they must then learn to sing the words to the melody. At this stage the teacher must be alert to stop the music if necessary and drill on pronunciation of the words. By the third or fourth day the more advanced pupils may be ready to read the words from the blackboard. By the end of the week such pupils should be ready to copy out the words correctly in their song-writing books. Thereafter they should be required to write the stanzas with complete accuracy from memory and to recite them orally from memory with due regard for correctness of pronunciation. From time to time they should, of course, sing in unison with the apparatus. Mastery of the song requires that they sing it without the apparatus, at the same time conserving electricity. A programme of this sort may be expected to give a majority of the pupils mastery of the language and melody of one song in a week. Some of the songs supplied may take longer, especially if the teacher includes in the term \"mastery\" a reasonable degree of efficiency in any dramatization or singing game associated with the song e.g., \"London Bridge\". Or the teacher may invent action to accompany the song. It is expected that teachers will devise various routines to go with \"Ten Little Indians\" and that groups of the children rather...\nthan the school as a whole will required to master these routines in addition to the language and melody. Teachers are reminded that properly spaced repetition of the lessons will permit mastery to be achieved more efficiently than an occasional long lesson. Two fifteen minute lessons a day for one week might be considered as an initial standard. As we are proceeding on an experimental basis the experience of teachers and any data or suggestions based on that experience will be helpful.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**PURCHASE ORDER**\n\n**TO**\nC.W.

Many teachers have discovered that Rowney's Fixed Powder Colours are ideal for the training of young students. These are the factors which influence their choice:\n\nFirst, they are so quick and simple to mix. No time is wasted on elaborate preparations, and even the youngest child can obtain good colours at once.\n\nSecond, the colour and the medium are already combined in the powder. Just add a little water and a smooth, rich and beautiful mixture is ready to apply.\n\nThird, they are available at modest prices, in airtight tins, so that wastage, in the form of deterioration, are ruled out\u2014the classroom stays cleaner, too.\n\nFourth, there is a wide range of 34 colours (including the 12 Ostwald colours) to suit every need and shade. They mix beautifully together, or white can be added to make tints.\n\nFinally, George Rowney & Co., have specialized in artists' materials for over a century. In consequence, great care has been taken to make sure that a flat, even wash is provided, so that for covering large areas quickly, easily, and economically, Rowney's Fixed Powder Colours are the perfect medium.\n\nLook overleaf for the full range of Rowney's Fixed Powder Colours.\nHere are the sizes and shades in which Rowney's Fixed Powder Colours can be obtained.\n\nNo. 16 size, containing 500 c.c.\nNo. 9 size, containing 275 c.c.\nNo. 5 size, containing 150 c.c.\n\nBlack\nBright Green\nBright Red\nBurnt Sienna\nBurnt Umber\nChrome Yellow\nCobalt Tint\nCrimson Lake\nEmerald Green Tint\nGamboage Tint\nIndian Red\n\nLemon\nLight Red\nPrussian Blue\nSepia Tint\nTerra Verte\nUltramarine\nVermilion Tint\nViolet\nViridian Tint\nYellow Ochre\nWhite\n\nOSTWALD COLOURS (NA Circle)\n\nHUES\nYellow 2\nOrange 5\nRed 9\nPurple 11\nBlue 14\nTurquoise 17\nSea Green 20\nGreen 23\n\nNEUTRALS\nWhite (a)\nGrey (g)\nMauve Black (o)\nBlack (p)\n\nFor the application of these powder colours, George Rowney & Co., recommend their Fitch Hog Hair Brushes.

Many teachers have discovered that Rowney's Fixed Powder Colours are ideal for the training of young students.\n\nThese are the factors which influence their choice:\n\nFirst, they are so quick and simple to mix\u2014no time is wasted on preparations, and even the youngest child can obtain a good colour without any trouble. All colours in the medium are already combined in the powder. Just add a little water, stir to a smooth paste, and then the mixture is ready to apply.\n\nSecond, they are so economical in use. A little pressure is sufficient to the powder ensures that the colours stay fresh after mixing, even when left over from several lessons. This means a tremendous saving in time and money, since it is impossible to judge exactly how much colour will be used in any one lesson.\n\nThird, they are available at modest prices, in airtight tins, so that wastage, impurity, and deterioration are ruled out\u2014the classroom stays cleaner, too.\n\nFourth, there is a wide range of 34 colours (including the 12 Ostro colours) to suit every mood or shade. Colours can be mixed together, or white can be added to make tints.\n\nFifth, Grimwades & Co., have specialists in artists' materials for over 150 years. In this instance, great care has been taken to make sure that the flat washes are just as effective as that for covering large areas rapidly, smoothly, economically. Rowney's Fixed Powder Colours are the perfect medium.\n\nLook overleaf for the full range of Rowney's Fixed Powder Colours.\nHere are the sizes and shades in which Rowney's Fixed Powder Colours can be obtained.\n\nNo. 16 size, containing 500 c.c.\nNo. 9 size, containing 275 c.c.\nNo. 5 size, containing 150 c.c.\n\nBlack\nBright Green\nBright Red\nBurnt Sienna\nBurnt Umber\nCobalt Yellow\nCobalt Tint\nCrimson Lake\nEmerald Green Tint\nGamboge Tint\nIndian Red\n\nLemon\nLight Red\nPrussian Blue\nSepia Tint\nTerra Verte\nUltramarine\nVermilion Tint\nViolet\nViridian Tint\nYellow Ochre\nWhite\n\nOSTWALD COLOURS (NA Circle)\n\nHUES\nYellow 2\nOrange 5\nRed 9\nPurple 11\nTurquoise 17\nSea Green 26\nLeaf Green 33\n\nNEUTRALS\nWhite (a)\nGrey (g)\nMedium Black (n)\nBlack (p)\n\nFor the application of these powder colours, George Rowney & Co. recommend their Fitch Hog Hair Brushes. Made of selected hair, with long White-wood handles, these brushes give a smooth, clear wash and are both stout and durable.\n\nAvailable in sizes 4, 6, 8 and 10\n\nFLAT or ROUND\n(series 137) (series 140)\n\nJUNIOR SCHOOL PAPER\nThis is a reliable white sugar paper, specially made to take Powder Colour well.

Track,\nEducational Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mike,\n\nI have just received a letter from Miss Roberts at the Walpole Island School in which she asks concerning school books. Her letter reads in part as follows:\n\n\"If you have a moment in your last hours with Indian Affairs, would you kindly leave word with those in charge that I have received no reply to my request last October for music books or library books. Nor have I received a reply from a Moyer's order that I placed with Mr. Stallwood at Christmas for construction paper and other handicraft materials.\"\n\nI told her I was writing to you concerning this and that you would have a check made.\n\nKindest regards.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBFN:ER\nFebruary 5, 1951.\n\nMr. M. Track,\nEducational Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mike,\n\nKnowing that you are on the lookout for library books\u2014at a good price\u2014I am sending you two series which I believe will be satisfactory. One is a series of Bible Stories which are being widely sold to both Protestants and Catholics. In fact both Landy and Desmarais and Robitaille are among the best buyers of these series. We also sell them to the British and Foreign Bible Society, Ryerson, and General Board of Religious Education. I have marked the list prices on the front page and these, to you, would be less $3 1/3\u00a2. The only reason we can sell them so cheaply in Canada is because they are not printed here!\n\nI am also sending you two animal stories from the NELSON ANNIVERSARY LIBRARY. These are both Canadian stories and deal with Canadian children. LEFTY has had a very wide sale followed closely by BLACK VIC.\n\nI will be in to see you on Thursday or Friday.\n\nKindest regards.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBFN:ER\nFebruary 12, 1951\n\nLt. Col. B.F.

Beverly Gray's Secret |\nMay 1st\n1951\nOur 53rd year\n\nGentlemen:\n\nAttached is a copy of the latest Grosset & Dunlap catalogue.\n\nIn the month of February we announced certain price changes that were to be effective on March 1st, and at that time informed you that any orders received by us before the first of March would be honoured at the current prices.\n\nIn this announcement, we told you there was a possibility that Series Books such as BOBBING TAILS, HARRY BOX, etc., were to be increased in price from 75\u00a2 to 85\u00a2 in the United States, and there was a great possibility that they would be increased over the $1.00 Canadian list price. However, fortunately, with the co-operation of Grosset & Dunlap, Inc., who, as well as ourselves, made a sacrifice profitwise, we were able to hold this price to the $1.00 Canadian list.\n\nAs you no doubt are aware, on the new Canadian Budget which was announced on April 11th, Sales Tax was increased from 6\u00bd to 10\u00bd, which virtually means that our costs on importing books from the United States have increased 3\u00bd on the cumulative import costs.\n\nIt is now our intention not to raise the prices generally in order to regain some of our additional import costs, but to change one price only, which we do not feel will affect the sales on this Grosset & Dunlap line. As of July 1st, all books listed in this catalogue at $1.39 will be increased to $1.49, and in this way we hope to save, at least for the time being, increasing any other prices.\n\nWe will honour any orders postmarked not later than June 30th for $1.39 books at the $1.39 price. We ask you to go through this catalogue carefully and try to anticipate your Fall requirements. The only stipulation we make is that the books ordered, must be for immediate shipment, as we could not begin to warehouse stocks for later shipments.\n\nWe would appreciate in turn your co-operation on this price change and do hope you will take advantage in ordering immediately.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGEORGE J.

This letter was not an order and was not intended as such.\n\nOn receipt of your letter of March 27th we requested the Department of Public Printing and Stationery to order the books and it is this Department who will forward you the order. We are not prepared to say what the order number is.\n\nI hope this will help you clarify the matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMay 9, 1952.\n\nMr. J.O.

Davey,\nAssistant Superintendent of Education.\nMay 13, 1952.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nCOLONEL ACLAND\n\nRe: Telephones in Education Division\n\nThe present telephone arrangement in this Division is as follows:\n\n1. No. 4465 - Main Station - Mr. H.F. Davey\n   Extension Mr. C.A.F. Clark\n\n2. 7683 - Main Station - Mr. M.F. Track\n   Extension Outer Office\n\nThe above arrangement was decided on a temporary basis when the Branch moved into this building and the position of Assistant Superintendent of Education was vacant.\n\nSince taking over the duties of Assistant Superintendent of Education, Mr. Davey's work has increased to such an extent that it is felt the extension from his phone should be discontinued.\n\nMr. Davey makes calls and receives calls from the Director and other officials, consequently it is necessary to have the lines clear and available when required.\nAs the extension serves two officials now, it will be necessary to secure a \"Main Station\" to replace the extension. If a \"Main Station\" is provided it is suggested that the extension from 7683 be discontinued. It is proposed, therefore, that two extensions be replaced by one \"Main Station\".\n\nIt is therefore, respectfully requested that:\n\n1. Extension from 4465 be discontinued\n2. Extension from 7683 be discontinued\n3. New \"Main Station\" be established replacing the extension from 4465 listing it under C.A.F. Clark.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMay 20, 1952.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n402 Copeland Bldg.,\nOttawa.\n\nOffice Reference\n\nGeorge J.

It writes smoothly and erases easily and completely.\n\nWhere intense colour effects on paper are required we suggest using Amaco Dustless Coloured Chalk.\n\nAMERICAN ART CLAY COMPANY OF CANADA LTD.\n\n536 Eastern Avenue \u2014 TORONTO 8, ONTARIO\nJune 5, 1952.\n\nMr. A. Vary,\nSuperintendent of Stationery,\nDept. of Public Printing & Stationery,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour records indicate that in the past you have been purchasing white chalk and coloured chalk from S.J. Reginald Saunders, Toronto, Ontario. Mr. Gerald V. Parker, representative of the American Art Clay Company of Canada Limited, 536 Eastern Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, was in my office the other day and pointed out that Saunders is a jobber selling this company's products and that Saunders is no longer dealing in chalk. Mr. Parker suggested that all orders should be placed with American Art Clay Company in future.\n\nIt is noted from your Department of Public Printing and Stationery accounts that this Department is billed for white chalk at the rate of forty-six cents a box. It has been arranged with the above-mentioned firm that in future the billing for white chalk will be at the rate of $10.32 a case of twenty-four gross, consequently this Department should be billed at the rate of forty-three cents a box for this chalk.\n\nThe American Art Clay Company is offering permo-plast \"modelling clay\" which it is felt may be suitable for our schools. The price of this clay is $8.64 a case of forty-eight pounds. This is considerably cheaper than the Klean klay we have been buying in the past.\nand it would be appreciated if in future orders would be placed with the above-mentioned firm. We will continue to use the following colors:\n\norange, blue, red and green\n\nEach color should be individually packed in one pound boxes.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nJune 5, 1952.\n\nMr. A. Vary,\nSuperintendent of Stationery,\nDept. of Public Printing & Stationery,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt is noted from the copies of your Blue Slips that there are no thumb tacks in stock. It has been noted also that in the past you were shipping pressed-out thumb tacks which are sometimes called one piece.\n\nFrom experience it has been found that these thumb tacks are not suitable for schools where thumb tacks are used and re-used several times for various displays. It is requested, therefore, that all future orders for thumb tacks be solid head type, 7/16\" in diameter. These are more substantial tacks and can stand abuse which is required of them in schools.\n\nA representative of McFarlane, Son & Hodgson Limited, Ottawa, was in my office today and quoted the following prices for the solid head thumb tacks:\n\n| Quantity | Cartons | Boxes | Tacks | Price per Carton |\n|----------|---------|-------|-------|------------------|\n| 1000     |         |       | 10    | $2.09            |\n| 5000     |         |       | 10    | 1.99             |\n| 10000    |         |       | 10    | 1.85             |\n| 25000    |         |       | 10    | 1.77             |\n| 50000    |         |       | 10    | 1.71             |\n\nIt is respectfully suggested that 10,000 boxes of the above-mentioned thumb tacks be purchased immediately as the above-mentioned firm have these on hand for immediate delivery.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMay 29, 1952.\n\nMr. Bernard McEvoy,\nLongmans, Green & Company,\n215 Victoria Street,\nToronto 1, Ont.,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of May 27th regarding the Horace Mann Readers and am interested in the prices you show for these.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would forward me a copy of each of the books you have in order that they may be reviewed.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMay 27th, 1952.\n\nMr. M. S. Track,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nCopeland Building,\n294 Albert Street,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Track:\n\nWe have just been through our stock-taking period here and I find that we have a number of copies of the HORACE MANN READERS. These story readers have been popular for some years for supplementary use. However, they have had their day and we would be quite willing to sell them off at a special price so that we might have a little more room in our warehouse.\n\nIt has occurred to me that you might be interested in taking advantage of a bargain. I have indicated below the titles and quantities that we have available:\n\n| Title                  | Quantity |\n|------------------------|----------|\n| PRACTICE PRIMER        | 159      |\n| NEW PRIMER             | 489      |\n| NEW FIRST READER       | 467      |\n| NEW SECOND READER      | 1946     |\n| INTRODUCTORY FOURTH READER | 421   |\n| FOURTH READER          | 130      |\n\nI should like to make you the following offer:\n\na) $.20 net f.o.b. Toronto for any quantity of any title\n\nb) $.15 net f.o.b. Toronto for the complete stock of any title\n\nc) $450.00 for the complete stock of all titles to be supplied f.o.b. Toronto\n\nI might add that each of these prices is considerably lower than the current net price and, as indicated above, the offer is being made to prevent our warehouse from \"bursting at the seams\".\n\nVery best regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard McEvoy,\nAssistant Manager.\nJune 16, 1952.\n\nMr. Bernard McEvoy,\nAssistant Manager,\nLongmans, Green & Co.,\n215 Victoria St.,\nToronto 1, Ont.,\n\nDear Mr. McEvoy:\n\nWith reference to your letter of May 27th regarding the Horace Mann Readers, you are advised that we have received the sample copies and are asking the Department of Public Printing and Stationery to purchase the following books:\n\n| Book                  | Price |\n|-----------------------|-------|\n| Practice Primers      | @ 15\u00a2 |\n| New Primer            | @ 20\u00a2 |\n| New First Reader      | @ 20\u00a2 |\n| New Second Reader     | @ 20\u00a2 |\n| Introductory Fourth Reader | @ 20\u00a2 |\n| Fourth Reader         | @ 20\u00a2 |\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nJune 16, 1952.\n\nMr. A.

Bounsall\nRE: Yardsticks\n\nDear Mr. Bounsall:\n\nAnswering your favour of October 30, with reference to a price for the Dept. of Indian Affairs. I have asked the Acme Ruler to forward to you, samples, and quote as follows.\n\n#350 Hardwood Yardsticks $51.70 per gross\n#350 Metal Ends $85.80 per gross\n\nEither in 1, 3, or 5 gross lots.\n\nJ. F. TAYLOR\n\nJFT/rs.\nNovember 7, 1952.\n\nMr. F.O. Lajoie,\nDept. of Public Printing & Stationery,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn our letter of July 5, 1951, the Department of Public Printing and Stationery was requested to stock ink powder, blue, quart size available from A.J. Reeves Company, Toronto, Ontario. It was pointed out at that time that the cost of Reeves ink was fifteen cents a packet while the ink which we have been receiving sold at forty-three cents. As the school ink handled by Reeves was considered satisfactory and as the price was considerably lower it was decided to use this type of ink.\n\nIt is noted that Reeves ink was provided to our schools for some time but later we began to receive the more expensive ink which is packed in glass containers. It is felt that the reason for issuing the more expensive ink was due to the fact that both the Reeves ink and the more expensive ink was listed under stock #4074.\n\nIt would be appreciated if in the future all orders for ink for schools be purchased from Reeves Company and a stock number given for the ink used for our schools.\n\nIn the past we have provided #4323 yardsticks from your stock. These yardsticks were billed at sixty-one cents each. We have now obtained a sample of a yardstick that would meet our requirements, the cost of\nwhich is thirty-six cents each. It would be appreciated if you would place in stock six gross of #350 hardwood yardsticks at $51.70 per gross available from W.J. Cage & Company Limited.\n\nPlease advise the stock number designated for this yardstick.\n\nI am forwarding you an additional copy of this letter and it would be appreciated if you would return a copy with the stock numbers indicated on it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n### MODELLING CLAYS (Continued)\n\n| No.   | Description                                                                 | Packing | Shipping Weight | Net Price per Single Case | Net Price per Gross Box |\n|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------------|---------------------------|------------------------|\n| 550   | Permoplast Modelling Clay Set, 14 ounces clay in 6 brilliant colours; one pair of moulds having 4 three-dimensional designs; 3 modelling tools | 24      | 45             | $9.00                     | $8.10                  |\n| 590   | Permoplast Modelling Clay Set, 23 ounces modelling clay in 8 brilliant colours; one pair of moulds having 4 three-dimensional designs; 3 modelling tools | 12      | 33             | $9.00                     | $8.10                  |\n\n### WAX CRAYONS\n\n#### AMACO and FINE ART WAX CRAYONS\n\n| No.    | Description                                      | Packing | Shipping Weight | Net Price per Single Case | Net Price per Gross Box |\n|--------|--------------------------------------------------|---------|----------------|---------------------------|------------------------|\n| 708R   | Amaco Wax Crayons, round, 8 colours              | 1 gr.   | 13\u00bd lbs.       | $7.80                     |                        |\n| FA 708R| Fine Art Wax Crayons, round, 8 colours           | 1 gr.   | 13\u00bd lbs.       | $7.80                     |                        |\n| 708H   | Amaco Wax Crayons, hexagon, 8 colours            | 1 gr.   | 15\u00bd lbs.       | $9.75                     |                        |\n| FA 708H| Fine Art Wax Crayons, hexagon, 8 colours         | 1 gr.   | 15\u00bd lbs.       | $9.75                     |                        |\n| 716R   | Amaco Wax Crayons, round, 16 colours             | 1 gr.   | 30 lbs.        | $16.60                    |                        |\n| FA 716R| Fine Art Wax Crayons, round, 16 colours          | 1 gr.   | 30 lbs.        | $16.60                    |                        |\n| 716H   | Amaco Wax Crayons, hexagon, 16 colours           | 1 gr.   | 32 lbs.        | $18.45                    |                        |\n| FA 716H| Fine Art Wax Crayons, hexagon, 16 colours        | 1 gr.   | 32 lbs.        | $18.45                    |                        |\n\n#### Amaco Wax Crayons\n\n| No.    | Description                                      | Packing | Shipping Weight | Net Price per Single Case | Net Price per Gross Box |\n|--------|--------------------------------------------------|---------|----------------|---------------------------|------------------------|\n| 724    | Amaco Wax Crayons, 24 colours                    | \u00bd gr.   | 30 lbs.        | $27 box                   |                        |\n| 732    | Amaco Wax Crayons, 32 colours                    | \u00bd gr.   | 42 lbs.        | $34 box                   |                        |\n\n#### Amaco Wax Kindergarten Crayons\n\n| No.    | Description                                      | Packing | Shipping Weight | Net Price per Single Case | Net Price per Gross Box |\n|--------|--------------------------------------------------|---------|----------------|---------------------------|------------------------|\n| 778    | Amaco Wax Kindergarten Crayons, 8 colour box     | 1 gr.   | 40 lbs.        | $.25 box                  |                        |\n| FA 778 | Fine Art Wax Kindergarten Crayons, 8 colour box  | 1 gr.   | 40 lbs.        | $.25 box                  |                        |\n\n### DRY TEMPERA and LIQUID SHOWCARD COLOURS\n\n#### FINE ART DRY TEMPERA COLOURS (F.O.B.

Lajoie,\nDept. of Public Printing & Stationery,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn the past we have provided our Indian day and residential schools with \"Justrite\" white chalk. As you are aware this chalk is packed in boxes of 144 sticks. We have had some complaints from teachers and school inspectors indicating that the white chalk is not suitable where classrooms have a tendency to go dark. It has been decided to provide \"yellow site protective chalk\" to these schools. It is proposed to provide both the white chalk and the site protective chalk in the future.\n\nIt would be appreciated, therefore, if you would place in stock 480 boxes of Amaco yellow site protective chalk costing $11.76 per case of 24 gross. This chalk is obtainable from American Art Clay Company of Canada Limited, 536 Eastern Avenue, Toronto 8, Ontario.\n\nI am attaching an extra copy of this letter in order that you may return the duplicate copy with the stock number assigned to this yellow chalk.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nMPT/HM\nNovember 12, 1952\n\nMaple Leaf Plastics,\n703 Bloor Street West,\nToronto 1, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nIn the past we have used your plastic cups for mid-day meal purposes in our Indian day schools.

It is acknowledged to be a work of almost incalculable magnitude and importance. Many thousands of alphabetically arranged subject headings, which cannot be found in any other publication, are at your finger tips.\n\nSUBJECTS are arranged ALPHABETICALLY with BIBLIOGRAPHIES and CROSS REFERENCES. Beginning with the discovery of Canada, the progress and development of the country in every branch of learning is traced step by step down to the present day.\n\nEDITORIAL The editor and advisory council have taken care that each subject, though not exhaustively treated, is given sufficient scope for proper and adequate explanation. You will find in this publication information of great value in your work. The bibliographies arranged by experts for the use of students and those seeking additional information will open a storehouse of knowledge.\n\nCONTRIBUTORS A distinguished body of specialists, scholars and publicists throughout the Dominion have been for the past three years steadily engaged on this important undertaking. All special articles are being signed by the writers. The production of such a work, the first of its kind, should be more than a literary incident. It is an undertaking of National importance.\n\nMANUFACTURED in Canada. All other books of reference sold in Canada are of foreign origin and manufacture. Consequently, they are very limited in their treatment of things Canadian. A few hundred headings would be the maximum in any one instance, whereas in this first National Reference work there are upwards of 15,000 headings. It is impossible to attempt a full description of the contents of this publication within the compass of a general prospectus. The words \"ENCYCLOPEDIA OF CANADA\" convey, as fully as a title can possibly do so, the vast area of knowledge covered, and while it may be used for the acquirement of knowledge\u2014as a standard work of reference on all matters Canadian\u2014it is so written that readers will turn its pages eagerly as a narrative of adventure, travel and achievement. The list of subjects treated will show the wide scope of this National undertaking.\nTHE ROMANCE OF CANADA\n\nHISTORY\n\nHistory becomes fascinating romance when reduced to glowing facts. Fact, in the first place, is essential or history means nothing. And one fact, given its proper setting and told with inspiration, is the essence of history, its vitalizing quality. The early days of Acadians, the French R\u00e9gime, the pioneers of Upper Canada, the opening of the Great Northwest, the Hudson's Bay Company and hundreds of other pioneer and adventurous enterprises tell the whole story of Canada in vivid language.\n\nGeography has become so important nowadays that it takes its place as a distinct department in leading universities. Then, what so important as a knowledge of the geography of your own country? That does not mean just a map knowledge. It includes pen-pictures, aerial views, panoramic displays, visualizations of great natural beauty, great enterprises, great achievements such as can be obtained only in this reference library.\n\nTRAVEL\n\nThe Department of Railways and Canals has established a branch to look after the ever-growing importance of travel and the influx of tourists to Canada. But how much does the average Canadian know about the topographical features and attractions of his own country? Everybody cannot travel. Still everybody with the assistance of the illustrations, pen-pictures and general information diffused through these fascinating pages gains a generous enthusiastic knowledge of the gentle to overpowering attractiveness of Canadian natural scenery all the way from Cape Breton to Alaska and the Yukon.\n\nThis is still a subject of vital importance, notwithstanding the general impression that all our vast territories have been completely explored. The lure of the unknown, longing for the unknown things to be seen at the end of strange roads and strange waters. What can be more interesting than to read of the explorations of Cartier, LaSalle, Marquette, MacKenzie, Thompson, Radisson and the many others who ventured the rapids of our rivers, the long treks over rugged country, the dangers of the Red Man, etc.\n\nCOMMERCE\n\nYour daily newspaper gives you glimpses, which you notice casually and usually forget, of what is taking place and has already been done in building up our Dominion and placing it among the great trading countries of the world. But how much do we actually know? To impart this information is but one of the functions of this outstanding National reference library. For articles by experts in all lines of endeavor are found in its pages, articles on subjects which affect every man, woman and child in the country.\n\nThe call of the great out-of-doors. To feel the thrill of the woods with their scents of trees and flowers! Why not go prepared? Why not know beforehand many things about our forests, our wild animals, birds, fishes, wild flowers, butterflies, insects? These subjects are expertly treated and beautifully illustrated. This wild life feature is a joy in itself, and it is of especial value and extra charm to children.\n\nNATURE STUDY\n\nNothing is truer than the old saying that Truth is Stranger than Fiction. Then what so true as strange adventures of all kinds that have befallen Canadians in all walks of life from the early days of the Red Man's supremacy even to the present time dominance of the White?

Questions which, however painful, have to answer and answer correctly. An inadequate answer is worse than none at all. It will interest your children as well as yourself, and it will help them in their homework and examinations. It will enable you to speak with the authority of knowledge and will give your children an opportunity to fill many leisure moments with interest and easily acquired knowledge. This complete and authoritative library of knowledge about Canada should be in your own home.\n\nLIBRARIES\n\nNo library could be on a proper working basis without the ENCYCLOPEDIA OF CANADA. For it is a history combining all histories of this great Dominion. It contains concise, authentic information about every historical event and every inspiring active or noteworthy individual that has ever crossed the pages of our history. Nothing of importance has been overlooked or left out. And all this material, this really magnificent array of facts, together with complete bibliographies and cross references, is all assembled and arranged so as to be at finger-tip immediately.\n\nEDUCATIONIST\n\nEvery educationist and teacher\u2014and who isn't, even in some remote way, either one or other\u2014must be intensely interested in this great national work, the ENCYCLOPEDIA OF CANADA. For nobody knows all. Therefore, who is more embarrassed than the one who is supposed to know but cannot admit his ignorance? But all he need do is to grasp a minute and consult the ENCYCLOPEDIA OF CANADA. And if it's some question about Canada you will find it set forth by an expert on that subject.\n\nBUSINESS MAN\n\nNo up-to-date business man seeking information about his country can afford the time ordinarily given to consulting heavy histories, biographies, pamphlets, booklets, catalogues, etc., in order to obtain a few simple facts. For instance, where is such and such a town or city? How many people live there? Has it anything to recommend it? The ENCYCLOPEDIA OF CANADA answers all these questions for you.\n\nPUBLIC MEN\n\nPublic men, men in the public eye (and women, too) constantly find themselves in need of immediate information about some question of moment to everyone. They are dictating letters, preparing speeches, about to attend a committee meeting, getting ready to receive a deputation, or to do any one of the many important \"jokes\" they have to do from day to day. \"Oh, if I only had some concise data about Champlain, Cartier, Confederation, Macdonald, or Laurier, mining or industries, I'd be all set.\" And he would be if he could consult the ENCYCLOPEDIA OF CANADA.\n\nBANKS\n\nA pivot of Canadian prestige is the standing of its financial institutions. Apart from the use of the ENCYCLOPEDIA OF CANADA in banks throughout the world, there is the ability of this handsome, illustrated work to enhance the prestige of Canada, and to impress those who see it with the size, resources and stability of the Dominion.\n\nAside from the obvious value when made available to clients on office table or reading-room\u2014let us look at the practical aid it affords banking officials in their daily work. The Gazetteer section locates and gives population, industries, etc., of every town\u2014it covers finance, commerce, industry, mining, agriculture, citizenship, etc.\nGOVERNMENT AID\n\nRealizing the value of the vast area of knowledge covered in this Encyclopedia of Canada and its importance from the viewpoint of education and National publicity, being a comprehensive, uniform and illustrated work of reference free from political bias, the Departments of Governments, both Federal and Provincial, have actively aided its production in many phases by the vast means at their disposal.\n\nTHE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF CANADA should be in EVERY HOME, OFFICE, LIBRARY and EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION. NO OTHER PUBLICATION CONTAINS SO FAST AN AMOUNT OF VALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT CANADA.\n\nDO YOU KNOW\n\nWhat is the Aurora Borealis?\nWho was the first white man to explore the Rockies?\nWhere was the first newspaper printed in Canada?\nWhich is the oldest city or town in Canada?\nWhere was the first capital of Upper Canada?\nWhat was the first railway in Canada?\nWhere is Radium refined in Canada?\nWho was the discoverer of Insulin?\nWho was the discoverer of Calcium Carbide?\nWhere is the world's largest Hydro-power generator?\nWhat Canal in the world has the longest single lock?\nWhere was the first M.C.A. in North America?\nWhere is the largest hotel in the British Empire?\nWhere is the largest Grain Elevator in the world?\nWhich was the pioneer country in the use of Electro-Chemistry?\nWhat city 1,000 miles inland is 300 navigable miles nearer Liverpool than New York?\n\nThe first successful airflight in the British Empire?\nThe longest span cantilever bridge in the world?\nThe largest dam in the world?\nThe first use of pulpwood for paper?\nWho was the first Governor of New France?\nThe longest and greatest steel viaduct?\nTo what country was the first Atlantic cable laid?\nThe first telegraph ever invented and demonstrated?\nThe first to originate and develop Standard Time?\nThe first electric street car ever operated?\nThe first steamship to cross the Atlantic was built in Canada?\nThe first domestic stove manufactured?\nThe finest varieties of wheat\u2014Marquis and Garnet\u2014ever developed?\nThe first to build and demonstrate a compound steam engine?\nThe first country to build and demonstrate the submarine telegraph?\nDOMINION AND LOCAL REFERENCES\n\nThe ENCYCLOPEDIA OF CANADA is tested, owned and used by the foremost men and women of every section, among whom may be mentioned:\n\nDOMINION\n\n| Hon.

As you are aware this chalk is packed in boxes of 144 sticks. We have had some complaints from teachers and school inspectors indicating that the white chalk is not suitable where classrooms have a tendency to be dark. It has been decided to provide \"yellow site protective chalk\" to these schools. It is proposed to provide both the white chalk and the site protective chalk in the future.\n\nIt would be appreciated, therefore, if you would place in stock 480 boxes of Amaco yellow site protective chalk costing $11.76 per case of 24 gross. This chalk is obtainable from American Art Clay Company of Canada Limited, 536 Eastern Avenue, Toronto 6, Ontario.\n\nI am attaching an extra copy of this letter in order that you may return the duplicate copy with the stock number assigned to this yellow chalk.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nDecember 4, 1952.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nSupt. of Education,\nDepartment of Citizenship & Immigration,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nWe wish to thank you for your letter of December 3rd, and are pleased to note that your department has decided to purchase four sets of the Encyclopedia of Canada, and that we will be receiving the official order shortly.\n\nAs soon as we get the official order, we will ship the sets to the various addresses.\n\nThanking you for your cooperation.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA.

I understand this klean klay cost the Department twenty-five cents a pound. The American Art Clay Company of Canada Limited, 536 Eastern Avenue, Toronto, Ontario sell # 535 Permaplast or fine art modelling clay, one pound packages in the following colours, orange, blue, red and green - one colour per package. This product sells at $8.64 per case in five case lots. Each case holds forty-eight packages.\n\nIt will be noted from the above information that this permaplast or fine art modelling clay will retail to us at 18\u00a2 one pound packets. We have examined the samples of this clay and feel that it is suitable for our schools.\n\nAs klean klay is a trade name we have removed it from our Standard School Supply Stationery List and have replaced the heading by \"Modelling Clay\". We have used the old stock numbers and have simply changed the name of the article.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would place future orders for modelling clay with American Art Clay Company of Canada Limited.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nTHE CHOICE OF WORDS\nA Book of Synonyms with Explanations\nby V. H. Collins\n\nTHE CHOICE OF WORDS contains 1500 words arranged in 400 groups of synonyms, including those wrongly used as synonyms. The correct use of each word is explained and illustrated with numerous examples.\n\nTo aid quick reference THE CHOICE OF WORDS includes an index to all the words, a list of the synonym-groups, and an appendix consisting of classified lists of formal words, genteelisms, snob-words, jargon, jurnalese, officialese, commercialese and archaisms.\n\nTHE CHOICE OF WORDS is an excellent complement to ROGET'S THESAURUS since it will enable its user to decide which of the many alternatives is the right word for his purpose.\n\nEXAMPLE OF TREATMENT:\nGroup 287, page 144: REFER, ALLUDE, ADVERT\nTo refer is to draw attention to a thing or person directly. Thus in the present book the Oxford dictionaries are often referred to. To allude is to draw attention indirectly: \"No doubt the writer is here alluding to Shaw's early books\"; or covertly \"Are you alluding to me?\" (sc. \"It looks as if you are\"). Advert is officialese. \"Adverting to your letter of June 23rd I am to tell you...\"\n\nALSO PUBLISHED IN 1952:\n\nDICTIONARY OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL WORDS\nby W. E.

S. G. I. A.\nOttawa, March 20th, 1898.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nMr. Ogilvie,\n\nWill you please see the Accountant and prepare an estimate of the prices for buildings such as shown on the new plan.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nWith reference to the proposed establishment of a new type of Day School on certain of the reserves in the North West where such an institution might be of use, I have to say that Mr. Ogilvie made rough plans of the building which would give proper accommodation and which would cost, furnished from eight to nine thousand dollars. This building would accommodate the School Teacher and his wife and a trained nurse on the following scale:-\n\nBasement throughout, with furnace and cold storage chambers, vegetable cellar, etc.\n\nGround Floor:- School room, Dining Room, work room, kitchen, Dispensary.\n\nSecond Floor:- Sitting Room, Dining Room, 2 Bed Rooms, Nurse's Bedroom, small infirmary for sick children.\n\nThe scale of pay and expenses for running such an institution might be calculated as follows:-\n\nSchool Teacher & wife, in cash, $500.00\nTwo Rations, 130.00\nFree House, 200.00\nNurse, in cash, 400.00\n1 Ration, 60.00\nMedicines & medical supply for Nurse, 200.00\nFree quarters, 100.00\n\nForward, $1890.00\nCarried Forward, $1880.00\n\nFood for pupils, to provide a meal in the middle of the day for an average attendance of 30 @ 5\u00a2 per dish - 216 days, $224.00\n\nFuel, Ice & Unforeseen, $196.00\n\nCost on May 17th, $2000.00\n\nIn comparison, a Boarding School might be calculated to cost about as follows:\n\nBuilding to accommodate 30 pupils & staff, $30,000.00\n\nPer capita grant, 30 pupils at $150., $3,900.00\n\n$33,900.00\n\nThe cost of food for the pupils is placed at $224.00. It should be less than that, as a garden should produce a quantity of vegetables once the scheme is started. The beef would be obtained from the ration house. As only the poorer part would be used in making soup, the cost for meat would not be large. The other staple for the meal would be bread, with molasses occasionally. The duties of the Teacher's wife (who might be called Field Matron) would be to teach the Indian women ordinary domestic economy; how to make good bread, to cook meat, etc., and to keep their houses clean. The nurse's duties would be house to house visitation looking after the sick, disinfection, isolation of tubercular patients etc.\n\nAccountant.\nOttawa, December 5th, 1910,\n\nSir,\n\nI have to request that you will proceed at some convenient time before the end of March to inspect the school buildings at the following places:\n\nMount Elgin,\nMohawk Institute,\nShingwauk,\nWabun,\nPt. William Orphanage,\nKenora,\nFort Frances,\nCecilia Jeffrey.\n\nKindly make yourself familiar with the requirements to which these buildings should conform under the new arrangement with Boarding Schools in order that you may be able to give the necessary information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. M. Ogilvie, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 10, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of December 5th, last, in which you were asked to inspect and report upon the residential school buildings in Ontario I beg to say that the name of the Chapleau Boarding School was inadvertently overlooked. When you go on your northern trip you will be good enough to call at Chapleau and inspect the building there.\n\nI may state that this building is the property of the Department and any repairs necessary will have to be made by it. The question of providing increased accommodation here has also been under consideration and I would ask you to look carefully over the situation and make any recommendations that you may see fit as to the best means of not only improving the present accommodation, but extending it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nBy H. Ogilvie, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 12th., 1900.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to request that you will leave headquarters at the earliest convenient date to continue the inspection of the buildings of the Indian Boarding Schools. As Mr. D. Chene has been engaged to perform like services, the work has been divided between you, and I have to request that you will visit the following points in the order which you think to be most convenient,-\n\n- Pine Creek R.C. Boarding School,\n- Birtle (Pres.)\n- Ft. Alexander R.C.\n- Sandy Bay\n- Cowessess\n- Missinewaun's\n- Crowstand (Pres.)\n- Gordon's (O. of E.)\n- Keesekhouse R.C.\n\nAs it is advisable that the management of the Schools should know at the earliest possible date the changes and improvements that will require to be made at the Schools it has been decided to authorize you to issue instructions, with plans and specifications, for any changes, additions or improvements which may be required to Boarding School buildings owned by the Churches.\n\nImprovements or additions to schools which are the property of the Department should be reported to the Department as they will have to be carried out by public tender. You should keep copies of your instructions, plans and specifications and submit them upon your return.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR. M. O'Gorman, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\nOttawa, June 14th, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to request that during your tour of inspection you will keep the Department constantly informed of your whereabouts in order that you may be reached either by wire or letter. I have, therefore, to ask you to send a night telegram to the Department whenever you leave one point for another, giving your address in each instance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRe M. Ogilvie, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,-\n\nI have to request that you will leave Ottawa at the earliest convenient date to take up the inspection of buildings of Indian Boarding Schools. It will be your duty to visit the following schools:\n\n- Blackfoot R.C. Boarding School.\n- Peigan\n- Peigan (C. of E.)\n- Blood\n- Blood R.C.\n- Ermineskin's R.C.\n- Blue Quill's\n- Thunderchild's\n- Onion Lake\n- Onion Lake C. of E. Boarding School.\n\nYou have familiarized yourself with the new requirements of the Department for Boarding School buildings as fully set forth on the Departmental files. As it is advisable that the management of the Schools should know at the earliest possible date the changes and improvements that will require to be made at the Schools it has been decided to authorize you to at once issue instructions, with plans and specifications, for any changes, additions or improvements which may be required to Boarding School buildings owned by the Churches. Improvements or additions to schools which are the property of the Department should be reported to the Department as they will have to be carried out by public tender. You should keep copies of your instructions, plans and specifications and submit them to headquarters as completed from time to time.\n\nIn addition to the above work I have to request that you will visit the Kootenay Industrial School which is situated near Cranbrook.\n\nD. Chene, Esq., C.R.,\n108 Alma Street,\nHILL, P.Q.\nB.C. at St. Eugene Mission. The contract for this School has not yet been formally awarded, but the lowest tenderer is Mr. John J. Wood, of Fernie, B.C. Mr. John F. Hutchcroft, of Cranbrook, has been appointed to oversee the work during its progress, and the Indian Agent for the district is Mr. R.L.T. Galbraith who resides at Fort Steele. You should after conferring with these gentlemen indicate the position in which the school is to be built and make the necessary investigation to ascertain how the water is to be brought into the building and what is the source of supply, and also lay out a plan for the disposal of sewage.\n\nIt is desired that during your tour of inspection you will keep the Department constantly informed of your whereabouts in order that you may be reached either by wire or letter. I have, therefore, to ask you to send a night telegram to the Department whenever you leave one point for another, giving your new address in each instance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSt. Albert, Alta., Aug. 11, 1911\n\nMy Honorable Sir,\n\nAllow me to make a few remarks on the occasion of the inspection recently made by Mr. Chene, of the Indian Boarding schools in this diocese.\n\nOf course I have no opinion to offer concerning the appointment of Mr. Chene, whom I had the opportunity to meet at Gleichen, and who gave every indication of being a gentleman in every way. But I must say that I have been a little surprised to find that we had not been informed of his appointment and of his authority to deal in the matter of the Indian Boarding schools. We knew that Mr. Hanna is also inspector of these Indian schools, but in place of Mr. Hanna, another gentleman comes and states that he is inspector for said schools.\n\nMr. Chene has left some recommendations and specifications as to improvements and repairs. I do not mean to deal with these recommendations for the present, as I have not had the opportunity of studying them, as yet; but I simply ask if we are expected to act immediately on these recommendations, without waiting for the sanction and approbation of the Department. Such has not been the policy of the Department in the past, and I would like to be enlightened on this point. This is the only motive that prompted me to write this letter, as I specially deplored any intention to appear, in any way, Mr. Chene's appointment and his suggestions.\n\nAnd I have the honour to remain, My Honorable Sir,\nOttawa, August 17th., 1911.\n\nRt. Rev. E. J. Legal, O.M.I.,\nBishop of St. Albert,\nSt. Albert, Alta.\n\nMr. Chene is an Architect appointed temporarily to inspect Boarding School buildings. He is not an Inspector of Roman Catholic Indian schools. Am writing you today.\n\nJ. D. McLean.\n\nCharge Dept. of I. A.\nOttawa, August 17th., 1911.\n\nMy Lord,\n\nIn reply to your letter of August 11th. I have to inform you that I today sent you the following despatch:\n\n\"Mr. Chene is an Architect appointed temporarily to inspect Boarding School buildings. He is not the Inspector of Roman Catholic Indian Schools. Am writing you today.\"\n\nIt is regretted that the purpose of Mr. Chene's visit has been slightly misapprehended. While Mr. McKenna is the Inspector of R.C. schools he has not the technical qualifications requisite to make an examination of the buildings, and this is the duty for which Mr. Chene was temporarily engaged. Upon receipt of Mr. Chene's recommendations, if they are approved by the Department, the management of the Schools will be asked to carry out the improvements.\n\nUpon reference to Page 6 of the letter addressed to you on the 25th. of November 1910 you will observe that the action with reference to the improvement of buildings and contracts was there outlined. As the Department desired the schools to have the benefit of the increased grant from the 1st. of April, the Contracts were sent for signature and the new per capita grant went into effect from that date, and of course we would like the improvements to the buildings to be made within a reasonable time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. B. J. Legal, O.M.I.,\nBishop of St. Albert,\nSt. Albert, Alta.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nTo the Secretary, Dep. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nSt. Albert, Alta., Aug. 24, 1911\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of this 17th inst. By reference to my previous letter you will see that I raised no objection whatever against the appointment of Mr. Chant, but only expressed my surprise that without having been informed beforehand, he was expected to act on the recommendation of the Inspector, without waiting for the sanction of the Department. This was entirely at variance with the policy of the Department, and indeed in your letter you state that the recommendation of Mr. Stone must be approved by the Department.\n\nI expect that the recommendations of the Inspector will be reasonable enough so that we may find it possible to have them carried out, as you say, in a reasonable time.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n+ Emile J. Royal,\nour Rep. of St. Albert.\nOttawa, August 19, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to request that you will leave headquarters at the earliest convenient date and make an inspection of the boarding school buildings in the province of British Columbia, such as you did in 1911 of the same class of buildings in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. As you are aware, this work is undertaken in order that the management of these schools may know the changes and improvements that will have to be made to these institutions to meet the requirements of the new agreement for their maintenance.\n\nIn 1911 you were authorized to issue on the ground instructions with plans and specifications for any changes, additions or improvements that might be found necessary to buildings owned by the churches, but in this case it is considered that you may wait until your return to Ottawa when the necessary instructions and information will be issued from headquarters, unless you find any special cases in which, in the interests of the pupils and staff, you consider immediate action necessary, in which event you may issue instructions and report fully to the Department at the same time. Upon your return from this inspection trip the Department desires to have a separate report made on each building with such information in the way of plans, etc., as necessary to be placed on file for reference.\n\nThe following are the boarding school buildings:\n\nR. M. Ogilvie, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nthat it is desired you should visit in British Columbia:\u2014\nYale, Port Simpson Boys' Home, Port Simpson Girls' Home,\nAlert Bay Girls', Sechelt, Squamish, St. Mary's, Ahousaht\nand Alberni. The Kitamaat School has been omitted from\nthis list as it is not considered necessary at the present\ntime to go there owing to its isolated position. You will\nalso note that the Alert Bay Girls' Home is in the list.\nSome repairs and changes have been asked for there and you\nalready have a note in reference to the Boys' School. While\nat Port Simpson you should obtain the necessary data for\nthe preparation of the plans for the proposed new boys'\nhome. While at Sechelt you will be good enough to look\ninto the question of the water supply, as well as the re-\npairs to the building. You should also visit the site of\nthe Kuper Island School, sketch plan of which you have now\nin course of preparation.\n\nThe Department would also like you to visit\nsome of the industrial schools which may happen to be on\nyour line of travel, such as Kamloops, which is the pro-\nperty of the Department, Lytton, Coqualeetza and Olayoquot,\n(the latter only if convenient) the three of which are owned\nby the respective churches who have control of the work\nthere.\n\nYou will be good enough to keep the Department\nadvised from time to time as to your whereabouts, so that\nyou may be communicated with if anything should turn up.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nAn expenditure of roughly $2,500,000.00 for new buildings is required to provide proper facilities for the education of the Indian children in Canada.\n\nDay School Buildings:\n\nRoughly, 24 day school buildings are required, at a cost of $140,000.00.\n(This includes Continuation schools on the Six Nations and Caughnawaga reserves).\n\nResidential schools:\n\nThese are grouped under the various religious denominations, and in order of their importance.\n\nRoman Catholic:\n- Duck Lake $175,000.\n- Claresholm 200,000.\n- Keeseekoose 80,000.\n- Kamloops 150,000.\n- Beauval 50,000.\n- St. Mary's Mission 150,000.\n\nChurch of England:\n- Central Saskatchewan $175,000.\n- Southern Alberta 175,000.\n- Shingwauk Home 100,000.\n\nMethodist:\n- Edmonton $175,000.\n- Cogswell 100,000.\n- Fort Simpson 200,000.\n- Muncey 75,000.\n- Brandon 50,000.\n- Norway House 75,000.\n\nPresbyterian:\n- Cecilia Jeffrey $100,000.\n- Ahousaht 80,000.\n\nIn addition, two residential schools are required in Eastern Canada, to provide for orphan and neglected children. One could be placed in the Maritime Provinces and one in Eastern Ontario. An approximation of the total cost for the two would be $250,000.00.\nIMPRESSIONS OF THE INTERVIEW\nBETWEEN THE CHURCH REPRESENTATIVES AND THE SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL\nAPRIL 13, 1922.\n\nDr. Chown, General Superintendent of the Methodist Church, who introduced the delegation, mentioned the State's obligation arising out of the treaties with the Indian people of Canada.\n\nCanon Gould, of the Church of England in Canada, spoke at some length of the urgent need for funds for the erection of residential schools.\n\nFather Guy, of the Roman Catholic Church, enlarged upon the remarks of the previous speaker and made the suggestion that Indian trust funds be applied in a more extensive way to the problem of Indian education.\n\nDr. Edmison, of the Presbyterian Church, explained the financial condition of his organization, and asked the Government to recommend taking over the responsibilities in connection with buildings and equipment. He requested a new school for Cecilia Jeffrey, on a site to be chosen, and suggested that the Government take over the Presbyterian residential school property in the near future.\n\nDr. Manning, of the Methodist Church, commented on the unity among the various societies doing Indian work, and asked that there be included in the Supplementary Estimates for 1922-23 the several requests already made to the Department. He referred to the immediate needs of the Methodist Church at Edmonton, Coqualeetza and Muncey.\n\nThe Hon. Charles Stewart, Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, in reply, stated that there was great need at the present time of economy in connection with state expenditures. He mentioned that, if his efforts to obtain funds for new residential school buildings were abortive this year, the Department would at least keep the old buildings in repair during the interim before such time as funds could be provided. He stated that the possibility and advisability of taking Indian trust funds on loan for the purpose of erecting residential schools had been, and would continue to be, a matter of serious consideration. Mr. Stewart realized the unique position of the unfinished plant at Edmonton, and stated that this particular school and its needs would receive due attention.\nDr. Edmison thanked the Minister for his interest in the work and promised that no undue pressure, in connection with new buildings, would be brought to bear at this time. He was personally gratified that the Minister had admitted the principle that the state should assume the responsibility for buildings in connection with residential schools, and was pleased that the Government was prepared, even this year, to do the repairing that would be found necessary from time to time.\n\nCanon Gould inquired if the Government would make any distinction between church-owned and state-owned property in connection with the temporary programme of upkeep.\n\nThe Hon. Mr. Stewart, in reply to Canon Gould's question, stated that the Department would endeavour to keep the church-owned buildings in state of good repair, until such time as new buildings could be provided.\n\nDr. Chown thanked the Minister for the hearing and for his evident interest in the education of the Indian people.\nOttawa, May 12, 1922.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart.\n\nRe: Ownership Indian Residential Schools.\n\nThere are 75 Indian residential schools under the auspices of this Department. This figure includes 2 institutions (Edmonton and Elkhorn) at which there are, at present, no Indian children. 43 of these residential schools are owned by the Churches and 32 by the State.\n\nRoman Catholic.\n\nThere are 40 residential schools under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church. 27 of these institutions are owned by the Church authorities. The Oblate Order owns 22 of these Roman Catholic church-owned boarding schools.\n\nAlbany Mission, Ont. (5)\nKenora, Ont. (1)\nPine Creek, Man. (1)\nCowessess, Sask. (1)\nMascouquane, Sask. (1)\nThunderchild, Sask. (5)\nBeauval, Sask. (2)\nDuck Lake, Sask. (5)\nOnion Lake, Sask. (5)\nPeigan, Alta. (5)\nErmineskin, Alta. (5)\nBlue Quills, Alta. (5)\nFort Chipewyan, Alta. (4)\nSt. Bernarde, Alta. (4)\nSt. Brice, Alta. (4)\nSturgeon Lake, Alta. (4)\nVermillion, Alta. (4)\nWabiskaw Lake, Alta. (4)\nFort Resolution, N.W.T. (4)\nProvidence Mission, N.W.T. (4)\nSt. Mary's Mission, B.C. (3)\nCariboo, B.C. (3)\n\nThe schools marked (1) are modern, up to date buildings, in good condition and are adequate for the purpose of Indian education. The Provincial of the Oblate Order in Winnipeg (Father Beys) has urgently requested that these 4 properties be purchased. In the Supplementary Estimates for 1922-23 there is an item of $48,000 to provide for the purchase of the Kenora Boarding School, after an adjusting\nof the valuation. If this amount is voted, the principle involved, i.e., the gradual acquisition of all residential school buildings owned by the churches, will be acknowledged; and from time to time, as parliament provides funds, the other 3 institutions marked (1) and the 2 schools in British Columbia marked (2) could be purchased. These 2 institutions in British Columbia and a third one, the Squamish Boarding School, owned by the Sisters of the Holy Infant (R.C.) have been offered to the Government at a valuation (not stated) by the Church authorities in the Western Province. Beauval Boarding School, Sask., marked (2), has been named by the Oblates as the last school the purchase of which is desired.\n\nI wish to refer to the possibility of future requests on the part of the Roman Catholic Church that the State purchase the other church-owned residential schools. Those marked (4) are north of the main lines of communication and could be considered largely missionary activities for some years. The institutions marked (5) are either in poor condition or are not modern and would likely be turned over to the State from time to time, at practically no cost. As you are aware, it has hitherto been the policy of the Department to supply modern, up-to-date buildings in place of the original residential schools erected with church funds which, owing to lapse of time and the development of the work, become dilapidated and inadequate. At the time of the transfer, the monetary consideration is generally nil.\n\n5 Roman Catholic church-owned institutions have not been listed above. This Department would never purchase the Fort William Orphanage, Ont., or the St. Albert Boarding School, Alta., as these are primarily convents for the education of white children. The Squamish Boarding School, B. C. should not be considered, as the property is entirely inadequate for Indian residential school purposes. The Christie Industrial School, B. C. is modern, and the possibility of taking it over, at a valuation, must be considered. The last named institution is owned by the Basilian Order. The Spanish Industrial School, Ont., a large, modern institution belonging to the Jesuit Order, is worth about $150,000, and I believe, may be offered to the State.\n\nChurch of England.\n\nThere are 21 residential schools under the auspices of the Church of England. 10 of these are not owned by the State. When the time comes to take over these institutions, the monetary consideration will be nil, because of the poor condition of the buildings or their situation.\n\nMethodist.\n\n7 residential schools are under the Methodist Church. 2 of these are church-owned, and would likely be offered to the Department, gratis, when we are able to re-build.\n\nPresbyterian.\n\n7 Indian residential schools are under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church. 4 of these are church-owned. 3 are modern and well designed for the purposes of Indian education, and we will be asked to purchase these in the future. One is dilapidated, and we would pay nothing to the Church when we decide to re-build.\nRECAPITULATION.\n\nRoman Catholic:\n\nOblate Order\n\n1. Kenora $45,000.\n2. Pine Creek $2,000.\n3.

There are certain regulations governing the expenditure of public funds, and it will assist our officers if principals of Indian schools and church officials will remember the following instructions.\n\nThe Department's authority must be obtained for expenditures that are to be met other than from the school per capita grant. Requests should be forwarded through the office of the local Indian agent, so that his recommendation can be attached. It is quite in order for the principal to secure the assistance of the church authorities in the case of major expenditures, but the original request should come through the Department's officials in the field.\n\nThe requirements of the Purchasing Commission must be kept in mind. If authority to purchase locally is granted, the principal or agent should secure competitive prices for all material over $15. If manufactured articles are desired, this Department will ask the Purchasing Commission for the business houses that should be asked to quote. The principal, when requesting equipment, should intimate the type desired by referring to a price list or catalogue of some Canadian firm. The Purchasing Commission emphasizes the importance of buying, as far as possible, goods that are manufactured in Canada.\n\nWhen the business has been awarded to a firm the bill should not be paid by the principal, unless it is his intention to finance the purchase out of per capita earnings. The account, in duplicate, should be given by the principal, not to a church representative, but to the Indian agent, or direct to the Department in the case of some residential schools not in Indian agencies. Our agent will certify the accounts if they are in order, and this Department will send a cheque to the firm that has supplied the equipment. When authority has been granted to purchase locally, a memo must be attached showing the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted, and whether the goods selected were manufactured in Canada or otherwise.\n\nYour attention to the above requirements will assist this Department in its effort to administer the Vote for Indian Education in a satisfactory manner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nTo Principals, Indian Agents,\nChurch and Department Officials.\n\n160 copies.\n| Name | Address |\n|------|---------|\n| Rt. Rev. J.J.

Day School Salaries show an increase because it has been found necessary to engage better trained teachers in many of the schools. The actual number of day schools is not increased. Several buildings are needed in Eastern Canada where day schools are fairly successful. The most important item in this connection is for a Continuation school on the Six Nations Reserve.\n\nRepairs and Alterations to Residential Schools show a decrease. Last year an extra effort was made to place the existing buildings up to the required standard. However, many outbuildings and portions of the main administration buildings have to be repaired or altered. In this connection the Roman Catholic Schools Fort Alexander, Qu'Appelle, St. Mary's, Seehelt, Cariboo and Fraser Lake, the Church of England Schools Mohawk, MacKay and Old Sun's and the Presbyterian Schools Cecilia Jeffrey, File Hills and Ahousaht require the largest appropriation.\n\nA total of $849,000.00 is required for New Buildings at Residential schools. At this type of institution splendid results are being obtained and in every province the schools are filled to the limit of their accommodation. The Indian peoples are at last seized with the importance of educating their youth, and residential schools must be continued.\n\nAn effort has been made to apportion - commensurate with their needs - the proposed expenditure among the four churches interested in the education of Indian children.\n\nThe buildings at the Kamloops Industrial School are practically uninhabitable. Nearly 300 children are available in the vicinity. $250,000.00 is needed for an entire plant. Some years ago the church authorities gave up the Indian Residential School at Red Deer. $150,000.00 is required to complete the buildings at Edmonton so that the important work may be carried on.

Such cases, however, should be rare, as generally, requirements can and should be foreseen, and the regulations complied with. When such emergency purchases have to be made all possible competition should be obtained and full records kept of those who were asked to quote; also their replies. This information together with a proper description of articles on which prices were obtained to be submitted with the accounts.\n\nIt must be understood that Canadian made goods are to be purchased where possible and the lowest tenders are to be accepted. When the lowest tender is not accepted, a full explanation should be made.\n\nWhen a requisition is referred to the Department for authority to purchase and a list of names from whom to call for tenders, a full description of the article or goods required should be given, and if possible, a catalogue reference as a guide to those tendering. Requisitions should always give the name of the nearest City, Town, or Village, to the Reserve where it is proposed making the purchases.\n\nAn abstract, in duplicate, of all Tenders received should accompany all accounts.\n\nThese regulations will not apply to authorized purchases, the account for which does not exceed $100.00, which may be made without further reference to the Department, after obtaining competitive prices, but to such an account an abstract in duplicate of the tenders received should be attached for the information of the Purchasing Commission, to whom all accounts for are submitted before payment can be made.\n\nCompetitive prices need not be obtained for purchases the value of which do not exceed $15.00 but the account should bear a certificate to the effect that the purchases have been made to the best possible advantage and that the prices are fair and reasonable. It is the desire of the Purchasing Commission that this business shall be divided as much as possible and when there is more than one store in the Town where the purchases are made. What is meant by this is, that should you make a purchase one week at a certain store in the Town where you do business, the next purchase should be made at another store, if the goods can be purchased to advantage. In this way the Government's business will be equally divided amongst interested Merchants throughout the year. The accounts for these as well as all other purchases should be forwarded in duplicate, direct to the Department monthly, and not allowed to accumulate for months.\n\nPurchases of Live Stock and Seed Grain are exempt from these regulations; also purchases of Beef, Hay, and wood, when made from Indians.\nThese regulations cover all purchases made by any officials of the Department whether on behalf of the Department or for Indians and irrespective of the Fund from which payment is to be made.\n\nYou are therefore required to carefully observe these regulations and acknowledge receipt of this letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n| ROMAN CATHOLIC                  | METHODIST          |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Fort Frances                   | Mount Elgin        |\n| Kenora                         | Norway House       |\n| Fort Alexander                 | Brandon            |\n| Grass Lake                     | Edmonton           |\n| Sandy Bay                      | Coqualeetza        |\n| Qu'Appelle                     |                    |\n| Crowfoot                       |                    |\n| Blood                          |                    |\n| Kootenay (not Oblate)          | PRESBYTERIAN       |\n| Kamloops                       |                    |\n| Sechelt (not Oblate)           | Portage            |\n| Kuper Island (not Oblate)      | File Hills         |\n| Fraser Lake                    | Alberni            |\n\n| CHURCH OF ENGLAND              | UNDEMONSTRATIONAL (leased) |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Chapleau                       | Mohawk                      |\n| Elkorn                         | Lytton                      |\n| MacKay                         |                             |\n| Gordon's                       |                             |\n| Lac la Ronge                   |                             |\n| Old Sun's                      |                             |\n| Alert Bay                      |                             |\nSir,\n\nIn an application recently received by me for the issue of a cheque for the amount of $45,000 for the purchase of the Kamora Boarding School from the Rev. Oblate Fathers, it was stated that that amount was included in your estimates for the current year. As no such specific amount was voted for that purpose, I infer that it was included in your general vote for Indian Education, and I also understand that the same vote was supposed to include an amount of $75,000 towards the erection of a new school in the vicinity of Edmonton.\n\nYour total expenditure under the head of Indian Education appears to me to be naturally divisible into two heads, viz: (1) the maintenance of existing schools and (2) the acquisition of school buildings either by purchase or by erection by the department. As these two classes of expenditure are of an entirely different nature, might I suggest that it would be advisable in future, when preparing your estimates, to ask separate amounts for the maintenance of the schools and for the erection or purchase of new schools.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Auditor General.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nJWR/MVT\nOttawa, March 26, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Kearns:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, with general reference to Parliamentary Appropriation for Indian Education. Careful consideration will be given to your suggestion that separate votes be asked for the maintenance of Indian schools and for the erection, or purchase, of new schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.

Leck,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nMy dear Mr. Leck:\n\nIn accordance with the Office letter to you of the 10th instant, there are forwarded blue prints of some of the principal buildings comprising the complement of a typical residential or boarding school in this Service. As the complement is quite large, there are a number of other buildings of which there are no surplus blue prints on hand, and the latter are now being made and will be forwarded to you at the earliest possible date. The buildings comprising a typical boarding school of the largest type in this Service consist of dormitories, schoolhouses, domestic science buildings, mess halls, hospitals, superintendents' residences, employees' quarters, gymnasiums, offices, shops, laundries, boiler and power houses, barns (dairy and horse), garages, chicken houses, hog houses, oil and paint houses.\n\nWith the blue prints of these buildings, there will also be included the most recent type of sleeping porches adapted to secure increased dormitory capacity, standard method of securing stucco finish to adobe walls, moving picture booths, and sound stands. Several copies of specifications covering the construction of various buildings are also forwarded. Should you desire any additional data, your request will be gladly complied with.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\nAssistant Commissioner.\nOctober 25, 1923.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant, and to say that the blue prints which you have forwarded me of some of the principal buildings comprising the complement of a typical residential or boarding school in your service have been received, and I beg to thank you very much for these.\n\nI note that you are having some further prints made, and I shall appreciate very much your sending them. These blue prints are all that we will require at the present and will be of value to us.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE. B.

You may proceed with the erection of these buildings. The amounts in any case should not be exceeded.\n\nWith reference to the proposed work at the File Hills School, I would point out that we are only granted $20,000.00 for this work, and I should be glad if you would report how it might be best expended, and what alterations it will be possible to make in the main building after the expense of erecting the principal's house has been provided for.\n\nIt is advisable that no expenditure should be undertaken at the Edmonton Residential School without careful consideration. It is represented that a cow-barn and other outbuildings are necessary, but I would ask you to give this matter your special attention, and report.\n\nWith reference to the school buildings, you will be given all the information and any details that we have affecting the special buildings and localities at a very early date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, April 17, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI wish to add to my letter of yesterday's date, with reference to the building programme for Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. As you were informed, communications will be addressed to you, concerning the individual school buildings. To obviate the necessity of mentioning in each letter the regulations which should guide you in your purchases and supervision, I am drawing to your attention the following:\n\nIn no case should tenders be called for a building or for any installation. As you are aware, before a contract can be let, an Order in Council has to be secured. The different buildings should be erected under proper supervision, by day labour. For building activity at residential schools, as much of the work as possible should be done by the older boys, under the supervision of the staff. The pupils will then benefit by the practical instruction and the expenditure will be kept as low as possible.\n\nIf any items for material such as lumber or brick are $1,000 or over, please submit to the Department a requisition listing the quantity, quality and where the material is required. The Department Purchasing Agent, in conjunction with the Government Contracts Supervision Committee, will then arrange for the purchase and delivery. Where the proposed expenditure for material is under $1,000, you should invite sealed tenders from the best available source of supply. Such tenders shall be safeguarded and opened on the due date by two of your officers. The lowest tender in conformity with the specifications shall be accepted, unless good and sufficient reasons for departure from this procedure can be given. When you are submitting the properly certified\n\nM. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\naccounts, in duplicate, in favour of the firms given the business, you should support them with Abstract of Tender forms showing the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted.\n\nTime sheets, in duplicate, should be kept for all the labour employed. Indian labour should be engaged whenever practicable and not more than the current wage allowed in the case of expert tradesmen.\n\nIt will be satisfactory if you wish to arrange for the payment of the labour locally, but all accounts for materials should be forwarded to the Department for payment. It would be well to use the services of agents and principals wherever possible as supervisors, without remuneration.\n\nThe amounts allowed for each building should not be exceeded and do not hesitate to effect a saving if the work can be satisfactorily completed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nApril 17th 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have to inform you that the following buildings will be erected in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, under contract:\n\nNorway House Hospital, Norway House Agency, Man...........$30,000.00\n(Plans are prepared and tenders will be asked for at an early date).\n\nDwelling for Doctor, Norway House Agency, Man...........5,000.00\n(It is possible that we may be able to buy the house which we are now renting for Dr. Stone. This matter will be taken up immediately. The old hospital building was destroyed by fire last year).\n\nCross Lake R.C. Residential School, Norway House Agency 20,000.00\nTo complete addition-(This addition is being constructed under the supervision of the principal and staff. The stonework was done last year. The building can be completed cheaply and expeditiously by the Fathers in charge. We are asking for tenders for all materials to be shipped from Selkirk.\n\nNorway House Methodist Residential School:\nNew hen-house..................................................600.00\nRepairs to buildings..........................................900.00\n(These repairs can be made by the staff).\n\nDuck Lake R.C.

Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Supt. General.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK. APRIL 22, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nRelying to your letter of the 17th instant with reference to the building programme for Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta and particularly with regard to the regulations which should be followed in reference to the purchase of material and supervision, I note what you say with regard to getting the work done by day labor and I am glad that there will be no contract covering the whole including labor, material and so forth, but I do not see how we can possibly carry on the work unless we give the actual labor out by contract, for as you know, this work will be carried on in remote parts where we have no officer who can daily supervise the work, keep time tables, and see that there is no loafing. In fact, I believe that nothing will be gained at all if we have to send laborers and a foreman out to do the job without being in a position to have them checked up daily by an officer of our Department, and I would not be prepared to certify vouchers for time sent in unless I was sure that the services, as shown on the time sheet, had been rendered.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nCould we follow the practice which was adopted last year in connection with the buildings which were erected on Piaqots and Muscowpetung reserves. What we did in these cases was to get out bills of material for the different buildings, submit the list to all the lumber companies and buy from the lowest tenderer.\n\nWith regard to labor we invited various carpenters, men whom we knew, to come to this office, examine the plans and give us a price for the labor only. By doing this we were relieved of the responsibility of keeping time tables, employing carpenters to work under a foreman\u2014which is no easy job\u2014arranging for board of men and setting men transported to and from the job. In fact it cannot be done in many cases. It seems to me it would be very simple and can be arranged, but I want to have your approval before starting any work. I may say that we followed this plan in connection with building the office and warehouse and altering the various buildings at Broadview last year, the office at Put'Appelle Agency also nine houses and nine barns in the Piaqots and Muscowpetungs Reserves for Indians. By carrying out this method we affected a saving of at least 20% on the labour alone not counting what was saved by purchasing material.\n\nThere is one other matter I wish to draw to your attention with reference to the buildings at the File Hills School. Could the purchase of material be divided so as to bring the separate tenders under $1000.00? I ask this as I foresee trouble if there is any delay in getting material that is purchased in British Columbia, or other points in car lots which is likely to take months, and having men on the job waiting for the material, it would not do.\nI find the various lumber companies which supply material from their yards submit just as close prices in competition as people who ship from the mills in British Columbia.\n\nWe have a large building programme and the season is short. In order to get the work done, I would ask to have the regulations made as workable as possible. I would be glad to know if you are in accord with the plan followed during the past two years, as set forth in this letter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.M. GRAHAM,\nIndian Commissioner.\nMay 2nd, 1924.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 22nd ultimo with reference to the building program in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, principally with regard to the employment of the necessary labour on the different buildings, I would say that it will be satisfactory if you have the labour performed in a manner similar to that adopted in the building of the Indian houses on the Pinapot and Muscowpetung Reserves last year.\n\nWith reference to the purchasing of materials, and separating the tenders in order to keep the amount under $1,000 this arrangement will be satisfactory.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nWm.

It is the Department's experience that the unearned per capita grant is sufficient to meet the incidental repairs that are necessary from time to time. Any recommendations concerning work that should be undertaken this season will receive the usual favourable consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 20th inst., and in reply would say that I fear I did not make my first letter quite clear.\n\nI am sometimes notified by the Department that certain sums have been allowed for repairs, etc., at Schools, and I assume that when a request is made to the Department for an appropriation, the school authorities have stated for what purpose they require the money, and this is the information that I would like to secure.\n\nFor instance, in advising me that $10,000 has been set aside for a cow barn and outbuildings at Edmonton, the particulars as to what outbuildings are required, have not been given. I would like to know what has been applied for in this case.\n\nThe point I wish to make is that it will be difficult for me to effect economies, if it is left to the decision of the school authorities how the money is to be spent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, June 2, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 100-7B of the 27th ultimo and in reply I have to inform you that, when school authorities make requests for repairs and the Department allows a definite amount for the purpose, all the information available is given to the Department officer who undertakes the work. Further, if requests for repairs reach the Department from school or church authorities, the recommendation of our local officers is secured. Principals have been informed again and again that their requests for current repairs and unforeseen expenditure should be directed to the office of the local Indian agent, to be supported by his recommendation.\n\nInformation concerning the outbuildings at Edmonton will be the subject matter of a separate communication.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSection 9 of the Public Works Act provides that the Minister of Public Works shall have the management, charge and direction of the following properties belonging to Canada: (a) The public buildings.\n\nSection 10 provides that nothing in section 9 shall be deemed to confer upon the Minister of Public Works the management, charge or direction of such public works as are, (b) by or under the authority of this Act or of any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, placed under the control and management of any other minister or department.\n\nSection 35 provides that the Governor-in-Council may at any time transfer the management, charge and direction of any public work, or any power, duty or function with respect to any work or class of works, which is assigned to, or vested by statute in, any minister or department, to any other minister or department.\n\nAs I have been unable to find anything in the Indian Act which can be interpreted as conferring upon the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs the management, charge or direction of the buildings erected for or occupied by the Department of Indian Affairs, I am of the opinion that under Section 9 the management, etc., of such buildings is with the Minister of Public Works unless formally transferred to the Superintendent General by the Governor in Council in accordance with section 35.\n\nOn March 23rd, 1923, I wrote you suggesting that in future, when preparing your estimates, you ask for separate\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nfor separate votes, (1) for the maintenance of existing schools and (2) for the erection or purchase of new schools; to which letter you replied on March 26th that careful consideration would be given to that suggestion. I find, however, on examining the estimates submitted to parliament for the current fiscal year that my suggestion was not acted upon.\n\nAs there thus appears to be no statutory authority for your department making any expenditure on account of the erection or maintenance of the buildings and as no formal transfer under the provisions of section 35 appears at any time to have been made I am of the opinion that the practice of your department of making such expenditure is contrary to the provisions of the Public Works Act, and I have to ask that you seek to obtain the necessary authority to permit of your incurring such expenditure in future.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeo. [signature]\n\nAuditor General.\n\nJWR/MVT\nJune 7, 1924.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd of May.\n\nYour suggestion that when preparing our estimates we should ask for separate votes, (1) for the maintenance of existing schools, and (2) for the erection or purchase of new schools, was, I regret to say overlooked, but I am asking my Chief Accountant to take note that the estimates should be prepared in this manner for next year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nGeorge Genther, Esq.,\nAuditor General,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 14, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Walker:\n\nReplying to your telegram of the 12th instant with reference to the contracts awarded for the Indian Residential Schools at Edmonton and Cardston, I would give you the following information:\n\nThe contract price for the Edmonton School was $158,000. When the plans and specifications were being prepared for this building it was not definitely decided the exact location of the proposed building, and it was, therefore, impossible to include the necessary details for the septic tank and drainage system, water supply system and electric lighting plant. This work was carried out by the contractors on a proven-cost plus ten per cent basis. It was also decided later to install store shelves and an ash hoist, which work was carried out by the contractors on a proven-cost plus ten per cent basis. After the building was completed the furnishings required this firm was authorized to build all tables, benches, cupboards and shelving, etc., on the same basis. The total cost of all of this additional work amounted to $27,076.03.\n\nWith reference to the Blood School at Cardston the contract price for this building was $125,251. and no extra work has been authorized.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. G. Walker, Esq.,\nManitoba Liberal Association,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nJuly 9, 1924.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nMr. Pratt.\n\nIncl.\n\nWith reference to the attached telegram, from Mr. M. G. Walker, I beg to inclose herewith copy of the list of building operations, dated April 16. We have changed the location of the farm-house and stable from Dog Creek to Sandy Bay. The Commissioner is proceeding with that building and with that at Waywayseecappo's reserve, also the Grand Rapids day school and the Fort Alexander painting.\n\nThe material has been purchased for the Jack River day school, and I have made a recommendation as regards labour. For the present, we are not proceeding with the barn at the Portage la Prairie Presbyterian boarding school. The contract has been let for the Norway House hospital and the doctor's residence, and the Church authorities are themselves proceeding with the work on the Roman Catholic school at Cross Lake.\n\nI cannot understand the point of Mr. Walker's telegram, unless he is in some way interested in the purchase of the lumber for the Norway House, Jack River day school.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Mr. Walker:\n\nTenders sent in from the Pas for painting McKay Indian Boarding School, near the Pas, were opened at Regina last week and none were accepted by Commissioner Graham and returned to Indian Agent Waddy for information. All were considered too high except one, which was too low.\n\nThe lowest were (of the highest ones) those of friends George Davis and of M. Faquet. The tenders were figured upon from the plan of the school. Since the rejection, Mr. Davis and Faquet went over and made an inspection of the building itself, and both say they would submit much lower figures than they did at first from an examination of the blue print. They would like to be given a chance to submit new figures. Mr. Waddy won't be back for ten or twelve days from a treaty payments' expedition. Perhaps some time could be gained by attending to this matter now, from Winnipeg.\n\nI am yours faithfully,\n\n(signed) Dr. A.

Larose, of The Pas.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner at Regina is looking after the repairs to our buildings in the West this year, and no doubt, under his instructions, he was endeavouring to obtain the lowest price for painting on the McKay boarding school. There will be no reason why he could not ask for tenders again, if he did not find the first offers were fair and reasonable, and I am asking the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs to instruct him to do so.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nM.

There would certainly be no use in Mr. Walker's applying to Inspector Bunn for information on these points.\n\nAs for the reorganization in the Province of Manitoba, we intend to close the warehouse and really diminish the staff there following the policy of centralizing at Regina, so that Mr. Walker's suggestion is at variance with this policy.

Provision is being made for the following main buildings at residential schools:\n\n- Onion Lake C., of R., Sask. $68,000.\n- Blood R. C., Alta. $123,500.\n- Guy, (Sturgeon Landing), Sask. $25,000.\n- Morley, Alta. $35,000.\n\nPlans are prepared or are in course of preparation in connection with the above buildings and it is the present intention to have them erected by contract. The appropriation for the Guy Residential School is for a commencement of the work - the building to be finished as soon as further appropriation can be arranged.\n\nProvision is being made for the following building activity and you are authorized to purchase the materials necessary and commence the work, on a day labour basis, as soon as all the information you require is at your disposal.\n\nResidential Schools:\n- Norway House, Man. Carpenter shop and roothouse $2,800.\n- Sandy Bay, Man. Farmer's residence $2,000.\n- Portage, Man. Stock shed and implement shed $2,000.\n- Elkhorn, Man. Roothouse $600.\n- Round Lake, Sask.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nRapids, Oxford House, Little Pines and Fort \u00e0 la Corne. The work may be proceeded with immediately. Further, you may correspond with the principals and agents, if necessary, and arrange for the buildings listed at Elkhorn, Qu'Appelle, Old Sun's, St. Paul's, Swan Lake, Fairford, The Pas and Red Earth. I shall direct that the necessary information concerning the Norway House and Ermineskins buildings be forwarded to you at an early date. If any questions of policy arise or there is any information that you require for any part of the work, do not hesitate to correspond with the Department.\n\nThe Appropriation for Indian Education for this fiscal year is completely assigned, and, as certain of last year's accounts are being paid from the new Vote, I have to request you to exercise economy and to effect a saving whenever possible. If you are in doubt as to the urgency of any of this activity, please let me know and careful enquiry will be made before the expenditure is undertaken. The amounts allowed for each building should not be exceeded, unless you receive specific authority.\n\nIt will be satisfactory if you wish to arrange for the payment of the labour locally; but all accounts for materials should be forwarded to the Department for payment. If you require a travelling inspector of construction this year, you should apply immediately so that an appointment can be made by the Civil Service Commission. In the purchasing of materials and in the engagement of labour, please be guided by the regulations. For building activity at residential schools, as much of the work as possible should be done by the older boys, under the supervision of the staff. The pupils will benefit by the practical instruction and the expenditure will be kept as low as possible. For the day school work, Indian labour should be engaged whenever practicable and not more than the current wage allowed in the case of expert tradesmen.\n\nThere are several items in the Estimates for the purpose of painting school buildings or for general repairs. In this connection letters of instruction will be directed to you in a few days.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

The school when completed will house 60 Indians and is expected to be ready to start at an early date. The cost of the building is $15,000.\n\nIn addition to this school in Saskatchewan, the Government has also built schools in Alberta and Manitoba. In the former province an Indian boarding school will be opened at date. 375 pupils will be built on the Blood Reserve in Manitoba, an Indian school will be built at Morley to accommodate 60 pupils.\n\nSeeding Progressing\n\nW. M. Graham, commissioner of Indian affairs, states that seeding operations on the various reservations are very favorable. In the fall month of Edmwood there was a total of 500 acres seeded by Saskatchewan Seeding Operations have been going forward in a satisfactory manner on all the Indian reserves in the three prairie provinces.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., April 23rd, 1925\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of letter of 9th instant, instructing me with regard to the building programme for Indian Residential Schools.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that several of the items mentioned can be eliminated. In the case of the Old Sun's School you have an item for five buildings at a cost of $3600.00. These buildings are not necessary. Last year we constructed at this school out of the existing outbuildings, an ice house, implement shed, chicken house, pigsty, granary and garage, which buildings are perfectly in keeping with the institution, and nothing more in this line is required, except some painting which could be done by the older boys of the school and the cost of the paint would probably be in the neighbourhood of $125.00.\n\nI am waiting for your instructions regarding the employment of the boys at the schools before I say anything to the Principals about getting work done by school labour.\n\nI also see where several items can be curtailed, but will not go into this at the present time.\n\nI note that you are going to instruct me further regarding the Norway House and Ermineskin buildings. I shall await this hoping that it will come along at an early date so that we can get the work under way. In the meantime, steps have already been taken to start work at the Grand Rapids School and residence, Oxford House school building, and a teacher's residence at Red Earth.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nI hope the amounts set opposite the various buildings have not been made known to the school authorities. If they have, it places me in an awkward position when you ask me to economize, and in my opinion it is not good business, as the parties concerned will make a desperate effort to see that the amounts authorized are expended. I have already drawn your attention to this, but so far have had no satisfaction. This is a very important matter and I would like to have this information.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, May 6, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 100-11A of the 23rd ultimo, with reference to the building programme at Indian schools in the Prairie Provinces. Your second paragraph has been replied to under separate cover.\n\nWhenever practicable, you should have the principals at Indian residential schools supply the rough labour, without cost to the Department. The older boys and members of the staff are expected to do whatever they can when buildings are being erected or repairs carried out on a day labour basis.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., May 15th, 1925\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nReferring to the last paragraph of Department #1-1-5 dated the 9th ultimo, I shall be glad to know if the information referred to therein in regard to the painting of, and repairs to school buildings is as yet compiled and ready for transmission to me, as I am beginning to receive applications for authority to perform certain work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. H. Graham\nIndian Commissioner,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 23, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 100-114 of the 15th instant, in which you refer to the last paragraph of my letter of this file number of the 9th ultimo. The letters in question have been directed to you and are as follows:\n\nFort Alexander - 125-1-6 - April 23.\nMuscowequans - 121-5-5 - \" 23.\nGordon's - 121-1-9 - \" 23.\nCrowfoot - 104-2-5 - \" 23.\nSt. Paul's - 103-1-9 - \" 7.\n\nIf expenditures for buildings at Indian schools are necessary and you have not received authority, please correspond with the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nThe policy of the present administration is to care for capital expense at Indian schools whenever funds can be provided for the purpose. This releases the finances of the missionary societies for better food, clothing and instruction. During the past four years 7 old Indian residential schools and many day schools have been replaced by modern buildings adequate for the purpose of Indian education. Major alterations and additions have been made to 8 other boarding schools. Further, 4 new large institutions are in course of erection. At the present writing, 51 of these residential schools are lighted electrically, heated by one unit and are equipped with modern plumbing.\nSir:\n\nMr. R.M. Phelps of Hamilton, light and power expert, was in to see me regarding the question of lighting and power at our various schools. He claims that we are not using an economical or proper system. I have told him that this was a matter that would have to be taken up with the Department at Ottawa, and that if he wished to do this I would write you a letter introducing him. I understand that Mr. Phelps will be in Ottawa in the course of a few days and he will probably call upon you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. M.

Section B of Section II of Civil Service Regulations re Bonus and Salary, approved by this last mentioned Order in Council, was considered authority for adding $150 to the salary of each teacher for the fiscal year 1925-26.\n\nI understand that Miscellaneous Vote No. 492 includes an item of $65,950 for salary adjustments in the Outside Service of Indian Affairs. Arrangements should now be made for a transfer from this Vote to Indian Education of the funds necessary to pay the increase in salaries of teachers of Indian day schools. The amount required is $55,031.25, as shown on the attached list.\n\nThe Treasury Board will give favourable consideration to our application provided it is approved by the Civil Service Commission. I wish to recommend that steps be taken to secure such approval.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDept. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, February 16, 1926.\n\nHis Excellency\nThe Governor General in Council.\n\nThe undersigned begs to report that it is the established practice of the Department of Indian Affairs to undertake the erection, maintenance, repair, control and management of buildings required in the service of the Department, where funds are available therefor from Parliamentary Appropriations for Indian Affairs.

Such control has in practice been used by the Department of Indian Affairs for many years, but the Auditor-General has now drawn attention to the absence of statutory authority therefor. In order to regularise the procedure an Order in Council is necessary under the said Section 35 of the Public Works Act.\nFebruary 16, 1926.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI write to ask that you will alter the caption of the Vote for Indian Education in the Estimates of this Department for 1926-27. We should like to substitute this wording:\n\nIndian Education, including the Construction of School Buildings.............$1,829,490.00\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nApproved\n(signed) C.S.\nSuperintendent General\n\nJ.C. Saunders, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister,\nDepartment of Finance,\nOTTAWA.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMinister's Office\n\nThis Order in Council came in just shortly after I had phoned you today about the memo to Council.\n\nK. Allan\nAT THE GOVERNMENT HOUSE AT OTTAWA\nTuesday, the 23rd day of February, 1926.\n\nPRESENT:\n\nHIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL:\n\nWHEREAS the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs reports that it is the established practice of the Department of Indian Affairs to undertake the erection, maintenance, repair, control and management of buildings required in the service of the Department, where funds are available therefor from Parliamentary Appropriations for Indian affairs;\n\nThat the Auditor-General has drawn the attention of the Department to the fact that Section 9 of the Public Works Act provides that the Minister of Public Works shall have the management, charge and direction of public buildings, which in the absence of other statutory authority can only be transferred to another Department by Order of Your Excellency in Council, pursuant to the provisions of Section 35 of the said Act; and\n\nThat it is considered to be convenient and desirable that the erection, maintenance, repair, control and management of such buildings should continue to be conducted by the Department of Indian Affairs;\n\nTHEREFORE His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, is pleased to order that such power, duty and function be transferred to and vested in the said Department of Indian Affairs, pursuant to the provisions of the aforesaid Section 35 of the Public Works Act.\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\nOttawa, March 4, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Gonthier:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th ultimo, pointing out that in the Supply Bill, 1925-26, the Vote for Indian Education is divided and requesting a complete list of payments indicating in each case the sub vote.\n\nI did not anticipate that payments from this appropriation, which has but one vote number, should be so marked. Consequently, I gave no instruction to change the method of bookkeeping. The sub-division in the Supply Bill was made following the request in your letter of May 23, 1924, with the purpose of obtaining parliamentary authority for the erection of buildings. In this connection you will note that P. C. 283, dated the 23rd ultimo, transfers to Indian Affairs the power, duty and function of erection, maintenance, repair, control and management of such buildings as are required in our service.\n\nIf this Department is required to separate the payments from Vote 274 at this date, over 6,200 vouchers would have to be re-examined and listed. Compliance to your request would have been less difficult if it had been made when the first accounts from the fiscal year were before you for audit.\n\nThere has been for many years a uniform arrangement of your printed report, which is constantly referred to in the preparation of comparative statements. If this arrangement is disturbed for the one year, it will result in considerable inconvenience to our officers.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Used on a fairly heavy strong skiff specially designed for it, this motor will show a speed of close to sixteen miles an hour, which we think is exceptional and which we feel would bring to your service many advantages not now obtainable with any Outboard on the market.\n\nA little later in the season we shall have one of each of these models on constant display here in Ottawa, but in the meantime if we can be of any service in the supplying of information or in assisting to solve any water transportation problems you may have, we shall count it a privilege to be called upon, when any knowledge or experience we may possess will be placed freely at your disposal.\n\nAwaiting with interest your further esteemed commands,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nR.

The amount provided is $255,000.00, which I have proposed to spend as follows:\n\nCompletion and furnishing of the Guy Roman Catholic Residential School, Sturgeon Landing ............. $95,000.00\nPeigan Roman Catholic School ........................................... 50,000.00\nPeigan Church of England School ........................................... 50,000.00\nLytton School, Anglican .................................................. 30,000.00\nOnion Lake Roman Catholic School, Sask. ......................... 30,000.00\n\nMy reasons for making these recommendations are as follows:\n\nGuy Roman Catholic Residential School.\n\nThis school was begun last year, and $29,086.40 was spent in the erection of a unit consisting of the boiler room and boilers, kitchen, powerhouse, laundry, store rooms, chapel, and necessary incidentals. It is essential that the work should be continuous and that the building should be finished during the present season.\n\nPeigan Residential Schools.\n\nIt is considered of first importance to furnish new buildings for these schools. The present buildings which were constructed years ago by the Roman Catholic and Anglican Churches are dilapidated and insanitary, and cannot longer be used.\n\nOnion Lake Roman Catholic Residential School.\n\n$30,000.00 will be provided to begin the erection of this building. It has been urged upon us by the ecclesiastical authorities and by our own officers. In deciding this matter I had to consider the claims of the school which we know is required on the Keeseekoose reserve, in the Pelly Agency, Sask. These two schools are in different provinces of the Oblate Order. We were prepared two\nyears ago to provide for the Keesekoose school, but the Church authorities urged us to give precedence to a new school at McIntosh, in the province of Ontario, and to postpone the erection of a new school at the Keesekoose reserve. We have been very liberal with this eastern province of the Oblates, and have purchased all the Church-owned schools in the province within the jurisdiction of the Provincial who is now the Very Rev. J.B. Beys, so that the postponement of the erection of the Keesekoose building until next year cannot be considered a great hardship. In Father Blanchin's provincial district we have not spent very much money, and Archbishop O'Leary is pressing for a more liberal provision for the education of the Indians in his archdiocese.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nJune 2nd, 1926.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Paget\nMr. Ferrier\nMr. Ott\n\nI think we should have a better system for estimating for our school and agency buildings. In future when we contemplate erecting a building I should have a memorandum initialed by each of you showing the detail of the item; the amount to be provided should include the main building, all major out-buildings cost of furnishing, inspection, clearing of land and any other incidental items. I think this is necessary because I find that our estimates are inadequate.\n\n[Signature]\n\nD.S.G.T.A.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOFFICE OF THE\nDEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL\nOTTAWA\n\nJune 2nd, 1926.\n\nCOPY FOR MR. FERRIER\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Paget\nMr. Ferrier\nMr. Orr\n\nI think we should have a better system for estimating for our school and agency buildings. In future when we contemplate erecting a building I should have a memorandum initialled by each of you showing the detail of the item; the amount to be provided should include the main building, all major out-buildings, cost of furnishing, inspection, clearing of land and any other incidental items. I think this is necessary because I find that our estimates are inadequate.\n\nD.S.G.I.A.\nMemorandum\n\nDr. Scott.\n\nRespecting the Expenditure Appropriation, Indian Education, 1925-26.\n\nPursuant to my study of recent expenditure for Indian Education, I have to report that approximately $325,600 is required from the 1926-27 appropriation to pay last year's salaries and per capita grants and to complete last year's capital improvements. The amount is made up as follows:\n\nBalance, March Quarter Day School Salaries ...... $52,600.\n\" \" \" Residential School Grants 161,700.\nAmount required to complete Sioux Lookout ...... 59,000.\n\" \" \" Blood ...... 40,200.\n\" \" \" Morley ...... 12,100.\n\nTotal: ...... $325,600.\n\nApproximately $60,000 for March quarter day school teachers' salaries and residential school per capita grants is unavoidably paid from the new appropriation. So, I consider that, as far as Indian Education is concerned, we are approximately $265,000 behind in our financing.\n\nCertain appropriations in the Vote for 1925-26 were unused, either wholly or in part, as follows:\n\n| Item                  | Provided | Expended | Unused |\n|-----------------------|----------|----------|--------|\n| Day School Salaries   | $208,000.| $192,000.| $16,000.|\n| Per Capita Grant      | 937,000. | 871,000. | 66,000. |\n| Inspection            | 9,000.   | 6,000.   | 3,000.  |\n| Transportation        | 8,000.   | 7,000.   | 1,000.  |\n| Cecilia Jeffrey       | 90,000.  | 500.     | 89,500. |\n| Lytton                | 19,000.  | 500.     | 18,500. |\n| Back Settlement       | 2,000.   | --       | 2,000.  |\n| Gitladamix            | 5,000.   | --       | 5,000.  |\n\nTotal: $201,000.\n\nI do not add here $11,000 of the $34,000 odd from Miscellaneous Vote No. 492 to care for salary adjustments for teachers, Indian day schools. This $11,000 is found in the $52,600, the amount mentioned above as required in 1926-27 to pay the balance of the March quarter, 1925-26 salaries.\nAdding to $201,000 the earlier inclusive figure of $385,600 indicates that $526,600 of the 1925-26 Appropriation was expended for purposes other than estimated.\n\nOf course, the Appropriation ($1,917,000 - Main Estimates $1,873,000, Supplementary Estimates $10,000, Miscellaneous Vote $42, $34,000) was practically wholly expended. I carefully analyzed the payments for the year in an effort to ascertain to what use the $526,600 was put. My analysis showed the following:\n\n1924-25 Day School building and other capital accounts paid in 1925-26 (page B) ........ $4,300.\n1923-24 and 1924-25 Residential School building and other capital accounts paid in 1925-26 (page C) ........ 137,800.\nOver expenditure, current appropriation, day school buildings, etc. (page D) ........ 5,600.\nOver expenditure, current appropriation, residential school buildings, etc. (page E) .. 41,200.\nDay School capital expenditure, authorized without provision (page F) ........ 6,800.\nResidential School capital expenditure authorized without provision (page G) ........ 35,300.\nCurrent minor repairs, Residential Schools, more freely authorized due to present policy (see analysis page M) ........ 23,000.\nCurrent Replacements to equipment, Residential Schools, more freely authorized due to present policy 75 schools at estimate of $200 ........ 15,000.\nOver expenditure, miscellaneous appropriations, (pages H & L) ........ 46,000.\nMiscellaneous Expenditure with no provision (page I) ........ 7,200.\nUnusual or inaccurate charging to School Vote (page J) ........ 3,400.\n1924-25 March Quarter Day School salaries paid from 1925-26 ........ 44,000.\n1924-25 March Quarter Residential School grants, paid from 1925-26 ........ 156,000.\n\n$ 525,600.\n\nI might add that the current appropriation is being burdened to the extent of $12,600. In addition to\nthe $265,000 mentioned above. The following amounts are required to complete capital expenditure at residential schools, provision for which was made two or more years ago:\n\nMcIntosh $1,100. St. Paul's $3,600.\nCross Lake 2,100. Kamloops 3,100.\nDuck Lake 300. Coqualeetza 1,400.\n\nI estimate that $20,000 will be saved by our general policy for this year, i.e., no authority even in small matters whenever requests can be put off or postponed. I hope another $5,000 can be saved from the $37,000 voted for repairs and equipment at residential schools. $31,000 is being saved in the Day School New Building appropriation. $17,000 of the item for Additions and Outbuildings, Residential Schools, will not be expended. The \"Unforeseen\" item under Residential School New Main Buildings is $50,000. I am hopeful that $7,000 of the Miscellaneous item on page 178 will not be expended. This amounts to a total of $140,000. If the $99,000 to complete the Blood and Sioux Lookout institutions is allowed in our Supplementary Estimate for the current year, Indian Education will be on a good financial basis when we commence 1927-28.\n\n[Signature]\nRussell H.

I am writing this general letter so that instructions concerning purchasing, engagement of labour, etc., will not have to be repeated. Competitive prices should be secured before awarding any business, and when accounts are being presented, they should be supported by memoranda showing those asked to quote and the prices quoted. When it is necessary to engage labour, time sheets in duplicate, showing the receipts of the men, should be attached to vouchers.\n\nThe Department expects the management of Indian residential schools to do freighting, rough labour and assist in every way without payment. The older boys and the staff at these institutions should be used as much as possible.\n\nThe Appropriation for Indian Education is extremely limited this year and I am particularly desirous that this summer's expenditures shall be as low as possible. Whenever it is not necessary to expend the amount allowed, the Department will be very pleased to learn that you have been able to effect a saving. If you are in doubt as to the urgency of any of the improvements, please let me know and careful enquiry will be made before the expenditure is undertaken.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

C. and C. of E. Schools on the Blood Reserve. In the case of the R. C. School the buildings in question are, cow barn, horse barn, chicken house and implement shed, and in the case of the C. of E. buildings, these are a combined ice house and dairy building and a hen house.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

Unforeseen 15,000.\n\nTotal: $142,150.\n\nThe items were actually larger than these, but these are the amounts of the new work that was contemplated. Against this amount, there has been authorized the following amounts:\n\n1. Repairs and Equipment $6,060.\n2. Day School Activity nil\n3. Additions and Outbuildings 11,700.\n4. Unforeseen and Miscellaneous 1,800.\n\nTotal: $19,560.\n\nNone of the above figures include the work which was given to Mr. Commissioner Graham, which must be added. Authority for $66,600 expenditure on account of buildings was directed to him originally but recalled by your telegram of the 4th instant. Mr. Graham indicates in two of his letters that the work on the Blood reserve is going forward ($10,000) as well as the repairs at Norway House ($4,000). However, recent correspondence from him suggests that he may be proceeding with other activity see File 116-1-9 and 110-0-5, etc., so I consider $5,000 should be added. This makes a total of approximately $19,100 expenditure from the Regina office, or a total of $38,660.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nRefunds & Expenses in Hand\n\nPoveshagen\n\nChaplain x 65 450 \u2713\n\nKerrison\n\nLockhouse\n\nLowe Starch\n\nWoodman Co. x 0 \u2713\n\nHoffeldt & Co.\n\nHay House\n\nKortenau\n\nSpanish\n\nAlbering x\n\nAlbertson\n\nCarreras\n\n$666.00\n\nAdditions & Increases in Hand\n\nPoveshagen\n\nW.

O. BOX 666\nVICTORIA, B.C. Oct. 30, 1926\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Indian Education\n\nIn connection with my report on the Estimates for the Fiscal Year 1927-28 I dealt only with the item for General Administration, leaving out anything pertaining to Indian Education. In the Agents' Estimates the figures dealing with day schools, which include salaries of teachers, janitors' services, fuel, light etc., the amounts for each agency are as hereunder set forth:\n\n| Agency          | Amount |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| Babine          | $7,447 |\n| Bella Coola     | 3,200  |\n| Cowichan        | 4,415  |\n| Kamloops        | 720    |\n| Kwawkewlth      | 1,650  |\n| Lytton          | 2,600  |\n| Nass            | 16,882 |\n| New Westminster | 3,050  |\n| Okanagan        | 2,970  |\n| Queen Charlotte | 3,515  |\n| Stikine         | 1,115  |\n| Vancouver       | 3,150  |\n\nTotal...$50,714.\n\nIn connection with residential schools, the per capita grants are not dealt with as they are not completed, but there are considerable improvements needed at some of the school buildings which have been brought to my attention.\n\nAt the Sechelt school a Kelvinator Freezing Plant has been promised, the cost of which will be approximately $1,800.00.\n\nFor the Fraser Lake school Agent Moore is asking for $2,900.00 for improvements to the barn and other out-buildings.\n\nAt the Alberni school the Principal is desirous of having a manual training department. It is proposed that the old class-room building should be moved close to the main school and fitted out for manual training purposes, the cost of which will be approximately $600.00 to cover the cost of removing present building equipment, all tools and working materials.\n\nI am attaching hereto copies of correspondence from Indian Agent Frost on this subject. As these came to hand after the Estimates for 1926-27 had been forwarded to Ottawa I decided to hold the matter off until dealing with those for 1927-28.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nAnother Pease Economy Furnace is required for the boys' building of the Williams Lake school. Necessary repairs to the walls and floors in the basement are much needed as the children feel the cold in the winter very severely.\n\nJust what programme has been laid out for the construction of new school buildings next year I do not know, but besides the completing of the Kamloops and Lytton schools there is very great need of a new building at Alert Bay for the boys. The building at present in use is now the oldest in British Columbia, having been erected in 1891. For the purpose of economical administration it would be advisable that any new buildings for the boys should be erected as near the Girls' Home as possible, with a class-room section connecting up with the Girls' School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. DITCHBURN\nIndian Commissioner For B.C.\nOttawa, November 13, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Ditchburn:\n\nI have your 125/8051 of the 30th ultimo, with reference to the British Columbia requirements of our Indian educational programme for the coming fiscal year. Your recommendations and proposals have been noted and an effort will be made to secure the appropriation required to effect the various improvements.\n\nI am dictating a special letter concerning the manual training activity at the Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nOttawa, November 20, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letters of the 16th instant, concerning improvements that have not been effected at the following Indian Residential Schools: Duck Lake, MacKay, Edmonton, Thunderchild, Crowfoot, Elkhorn, Old Man's, Round Lake and Cowessess. Notes for the 1927-28 Estimates have been made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, February 12, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, enclosing vouchers Nos. 305 to 307. No. 306, in favour of the Drew Machine Company, for $86.15, covering an emergency repair to the pump; No. 304, in favour of the Norwood Foundry Company, for $15.00, covering emergency repairs to the kitchen range; and No. 307, in favour of Reed & Turnbull, for $55.65, covering emergency repairs to the furnace in the Principal's residence - are being paid. Vouchers Nos. 305 and 306, which are returned herewith, are for minor repairs and the amounts are inconsiderable. These should either be paid by the school management from the per capita or other earnings or you should adopt the plan in use at certain other Indian residential schools where the Department endeavours to pay for all unavoidable repairs to the mechanical plant. The practice referred to is to deal with one plumber, one electrician, one hardware, one lumber firm for a stated period and, at the end of each quarter, submit certified accounts in duplicate from these firms, covering the materials and services supplied and rendered during the three months period. It is not necessary for me to point out that this method is preferable to a continual stream of accounts from various firms, all for small amounts. When the quarterly accounts are being forwarded, you should exercise care so that no items are included which should properly be met from the per capita grant.\n\nIn order that this letter may be a more complete writing concerning the Department's wishes relative to accounts, may I remind you that authority for expenditures other than minor ones should be secured from the Department before purchase, except in emergencies. You should secure competitive prices from the best available local sources when making purchases which involve expenditures of more than Fifteen or Twenty Dollars.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J. F. Woodsworth, B. A.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\n|                      | DUCK LAKE | ST.

The accounts for these inspections should be forwarded to the Department by the Principal, together with the Boiler Inspector's report.

I am writing this general letter, so that instructions concerning purchasing, engagement of labour, etc., will not have to be repeated. Competitive prices should be secured before awarding any business, and when accounts are being presented, they should be supported by memoranda showing those asked to quote and the prices quoted. As far as possible, local markets should be patronized and local labour engaged.\n\nThe Department expects the management of Indian residential schools to do freighting, rough labour and assist in every way, without payment. The older boys and the staff at these institutions should be used as much as possible.\n\nWhenever it is unnecessary to spend the amount allowed, I shall be very pleased to learn that you have been able to effect a saving. In no case, should the authority be exceeded without departmental sanction. If you are in doubt as to the urgency of any of the improvements, please let me know and careful enquiry will be made before the expenditure is undertaken.\n\nIn the case of minor repairs and replacements at certain schools in the Prairie Provinces, authority is being sent direct to the local management.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo Principals of Indian Residential Schools:\n\nThe recent tragic fire at the Beauval School, resulting in a serious loss of life, prompts me to write concerning the necessity of constant care, if the fire hazard to life and property is to be minimized. If you are not satisfied with the present fire escape facilities at your school, I should be grateful if you would let the Department have a report.\n\nExits to fire escapes should open out, and, if they are sealed in any manner, it should be possible for even a young pupil to break through with a chair or boot. In each dormitory where small children sleep, an elder trusted pupil or a member of the staff should have his or her bed near the fire escape exit, and it should be that person's immediate duty, in the event of any alarm whatsoever, to prepare and guard the way to the fire escape.\n\nFire drill from the dormitories should be practised at least once a month. At such drills, the children and staff should actually complete their exit via the fire escapes and the practice should not be considered ended until every individual is out of the building.\n\nThe Principal should satisfy himself that there are a sufficient number of hand fire extinguishers at strategic places in the building and that those which require recharging from time to time are ready for effective use.\n\nIf there is no regular night watchman at your school, a member of the staff must make a thorough inspection of the building at ten o'clock and again at midnight; and there should be an hour's patrol following the laying of fires in the early morning.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n| Map No. | School | Church | Date of Construction | Type of Construction | Pupilage | Other Remarks |\n|---------|--------|--------|----------------------|----------------------|----------|---------------|\n| I       | Atikativik | R.

While our officers agree that practically no damage will be caused by such a small attachment, the fact remains that our experience at Indian residential schools indicates that we cannot expect that electrical attachments will always be used with the necessary intelligence on the part of those responsible for the power plant. This has led to the general rule that they shall not be used and I cannot agree to any exceptions. Whenever you or your inspectors find that toasters, irons, percolators, heaters, etc., are in use where we generate our own electricity at schools, you should see that the practice ceases. I have, also, to request that you will direct that the pump at the new St. Phillip's School will be operated by a gasoline engine.\n\nYou may be surprised to learn that, approximately, $27,000 per annum is expended on the replacement of batteries alone at Indian residential schools. This charge on our appropriation is quite heavy and nothing which might increase this expenditure should be allowed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., September 29th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt has been brought to my attention that at some of our residential schools the means of exit from the buildings, in cases of emergency, are in some instances difficult of access and the doors leading to the fire escapes are kept locked.\n\nIn view of the fact that the Principals of our schools are carrying a great responsibility in having so many children under their care, I would like to impress upon you the importance of having the buildings provided with adequate fire escapes which should have easy means of access. The doors or windows leading to the outside fire escapes should be provided with easily operated fastenings and should open out to prevent crowding and should not be kept locked, particularly in the dormitories during the hours when they are occupied by the children. Fire protection equipment should receive frequent inspections to make sure that it is efficiently operating at all times. The pupils should be given fire drill exercises at regular intervals that they may know exactly what to do in an emergency, even if left to their own resources. On no account should exits to the fire escapes be covered or nailed up. It is expected that you will co-operate in reducing the danger of loss of life by fire.\n\nIf the equipment for fire protection or quick evacuation of the building, in case of fire, is not, in your opinion, adequate at your school, I would be glad to receive a report from you pointing out in what particular you consider it inadequate.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW. H. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., Dec. 17th, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nIn reply to your No. 110-0-1 of the 24th of October and advised you that I had been circularizing all Principals of Residential School with reference to their fire equipment, etc., and now enclose copy of that circular. In a letter I received from the Rev. Principal of the Pine Creek Residential School he intimates that he has received a circular on the same subject from you and perhaps you will kindly let me have a copy of this as it would be undesirable that instructions to the Principals from your office and mine should conflict.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

The buildings at these institutions were originally erected by the missionary societies and orders interested in Indian educational work. Up to the present time, we have provided a per capita grant for maintenance purposes and have at times made repairs and replaced worn out equipment. It is now many years since the original buildings were erected and it is becoming necessary to reconstruct them. The Honourable the Superintendent General and myself are receiving applications for financial assistance in this connection, but, up to the present time, no decision has been reached.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Certain expenditures have heretofore been paid from Trust Funds but by this appropriation these accounts will be relieved of educational costs and the policy of a free education for all Indians in the Dominion will be inaugurated. Expenditures incurred up to the 31st March 1928 will be charged as usual but when the funds provided by Parliament become available all expenditure for Indian Education from April 1st should be paid from the Parliamentary appropriation.\n\nD.S.G.I.A.\nMay 28, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nDuring the next few days, there will be directed to you authority for the erection of buildings and other improvements at Indian schools. I am writing this general letter, so that instructions concerning purchasing, engagement of labour, etc., will not have to be repeated. Competitive prices should be secured before awarding any business, and, when accounts are being presented, they should be supported by memoranda showing those asked to quote and the prices quoted. As far as possible, local markets should be patronized and Indian and other local labour engaged.\n\nThe Department expects the management of Indian residential schools to do freighting, rough labour and assist in every way, without payment. The older boys and the staff at these institutions should be used as much as possible.\n\nWhenever it is unnecessary to spend the amount allowed, I shall be very pleased to learn that you have been able to effect a saving. In no case, should the authority be exceeded without departmental sanction. If you are in doubt as to the urgency of any of the improvements, please let me know and careful enquiry will be made before the expenditure is undertaken.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nREGINA, SASK.\nAugust 30, 1928.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nAt the present time, salaries for field matrons and nurses in British Columbia are voted as follows:\n\nB.

I may say that at the present time this question is under consideration, and a few days ago, Mr. Indian Agent McCookin was asked for a recommendation. You will understand that, if we provide a hot lunch for this school, four others in the same Agency will have to be considered, and it is just possible that many other schools in the province will be affected.\n\nThere is no question of the advisability of a hot lunch for school children. However, when the parents are able to provide it, there is doubt concerning the expediency of having it done by the Department. After all, one of our chief aims is to make the Indian independent. I have found the best solution is to ask the parents to give the children a little solid food for the noon hour, which is supplemented by soup, cocoa or milk, provided by the Department and prepared by the older girls under the supervision of the teacher.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

SCOTT.\n\nThe unusually small amount now remaining in the Indian Education Appropriation for the current fiscal year has made imperative a study of the expenditure to ascertain the reasons. I am satisfied that there has been overexpenditure in connection with current expenses, but an effort to arrive at conclusions in this connection would be very unsatisfactory unless postponed until the end of the fiscal year, when all payments have been made. It is comparatively easy to analyze the expenditure for main buildings at Indian residential schools, and, after a preliminary study, I have been able to draw certain conclusions.\n\nA year ago, three new main buildings were under construction - Shubenacadie, Cecilia Jeffrey and Alert Bay. There were included in the Main Estimates for the current year items to complete and furnish these buildings and for the establishment of the school generally. These amounts were determined in November, 1928, and in March, when it was found that the building programme was not as far advanced as was anticipated, you will remember that the effort to secure a supplementary estimate was abortive. The following figures are approximately correct:\n\n| School          | Voted   | Expended As on Dec. 31st. | Unprovided for |\n|-----------------|---------|--------------------------|---------------|\n| Shubenacadie    | $14,000.| $70,500.                 | $56,500.      |\n| Cecilia Jeffrey | 15,000. | 60,000.                  | 45,000.       |\n| Alert Bay       | 70,000. | 166,500.                 | 96,500.       |\n| Total           |         |                          | $198,000.     |\n\nThe Department's inability to proceed with the Birtle and Blue Quills new main buildings this fiscal year has led us to authorize unprovided expenditures. The following table shows the main overexpenditures:\n\n| School        | Voted   | Expended As on Dec. 31st. | Unprovided for |\n|---------------|---------|---------------------------|---------------|\n| Old Sun       | $40,000.| $93,500.                  | $53,500.      |\n| Pine Creek    | 3,000.  | 19,000.                   | 16,000.       |\n| Edmonton      | 2,000.  | 13,500.                   | 11,500.       |\n| Beauval       | 25,000. | 29,500.                   | 4,500.        |\n| Guy           | 3,000.  | 5,000.                    | 2,000.        |\n| St. Bruno's   | 24,000. | 30,000.                   | 6,000.        |\n| Kenora        | 4,500.  | 10,000.                   | 5,500.        |\n| Kamloops      |         | 2,500.                    | 2,500.        |\n| Ahousaht      |         | 5,500.                    | 5,500.        |\n| Christie      |         | 4,500.                    | 4,500.        |\n| Total         |         |                           | $111,500.     |\nThe overexpenditure for new buildings and improvements at Indian residential schools has amounted to $309,500. Against this, there is a saving of approximately $134,500 because of Birtle and Blue Quills appropriations, or a net unprovided expenditure of approximately $175,000.\n\nThis is undoubtedly the main reason for the present financial position - the causes leading to it being: 1. Our inability to secure a supplementary estimate at the beginning of the current fiscal year to complete Shubenacadie, Cecilia Jeffrey and Alert Bay; 2. Underestimating the cost of establishing new residential schools. It should be stated here that the estimates concerning main buildings have been more accurate than the estimates concerning water supply and sewage disposal, furnishings, outbuildings and extras to main buildings; 3. The rather free authorization of unprovided expenditure because of the unused Birtle and Blue Quills appropriations.\n\nTo remedy the present situation, I wish to recommend - 1. That the original proposal for financing the Old Suns re-establishment be followed, i.e., $40,000 only from the current appropriation and the balance from Band Funds, which will be reimbursed at a later date; 2. That an effort be made to secure a supplementary estimate for the current fiscal year for the completion of Shubenacadie, Cecilia Jeffrey and Alert Bay. All three schools can now be considered established, and further expenditure for any needed outbuildings, etc., can be provided in future estimates.\n\nA refund from Band Funds of $53,500 on account of the Old Suns building (or whatever amount has been expended over and above $40,000 at the time of the refund) plus a supplementary estimate of $198,000 will relieve the situation to the extent of $251,500, making a total available from January first to March 31st of $617,500, which is more than the average amount available for the period during the last 8 years.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell F. Ferrier\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nFebruary 25, 1930.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDR. SCOTT.\n\nRe: Supplementary Estimate, Indian Education for the Current Year.\n\nA year ago, three residential school new main buildings were under construction at Shubenacadie, N.S., Cecilia Jeffrey, Ont., and Alert Bay, B.C. In the main Estimates for the current year, there were included items to complete and furnish these buildings and for the establishment of the schools generally. These amounts were determined in November, 1928. During the next few months building operations were very slow, and in March, last, when it was found that the building programme was not as far advanced as was anticipated, I suggested a supplementary estimate to include items for these three main buildings and one for the reconstruction of the Gordon Indian Residential School, which was destroyed by fire a year ago. Only the item for the Gordon reconstruction was allowed.\n\nThe following figures show the expenditure at Shubenacadie, Cecilia Jeffrey and Alert Bay, which was unprovided for:\n\n| School          | Voted | Expended as on February 25th | Unprovided for |\n|-----------------|-------|------------------------------|----------------|\n| Shubenacadie    | $14,000 | $74,259                      | $60,959        |\n| Cecilia Jeffrey | $15,000 | $69,229                      | $54,229        |\n| Alert Bay       | $70,000 | $166,939                     | $96,939        |\n\n$212,127.\n\nThe Department's inability to proceed with the Birtle and Blue Quills new main buildings this fiscal year has made available for other purposes approximately $125,000. Approximately $65,000 of this has been expended for unforeseen needs at Pine Creek, St. Bruno's, Edmonton, Kenora, Ahousaht and Christie. This leaves $60,000 to be applied on the unprovided expenditure at Shubenacadie, Cecilia Jeffrey and Alert Bay, or a balance of approximately $152,000. The Appropriation for Indian Education is now short this amount, and, by the end of March, it will be approximately $165,000. A supplementary for this amount for the three main buildings that are now completed is necessary if accounts are to be paid during the last three weeks of the fiscal year.\n\nRussell R. Perrier\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, March 27, 1930.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart,\n\nPursuant to our conversation on the subject of new residential school buildings to be erected during the coming fiscal year, I have pleasure in informing you that the plans and specifications for the following school buildings are now ready:\n\nNew Blue Quill Indian Residential School,\nnear St. Paul de Metis, Alberta.\n\nNew Muscowequan Indian Residential School,\nnear Leestock, Sask.\n\nNew Birtle Indian Residential School,\nnear Birtle, Man.\n\nAs I have stated, I do not think we can carry out our full programme without getting supplementary assistance. Perhaps you will think it proper to ask for tenders at an early date, but I think it would be advantageous to have some assurance of our Supplementary Vote before doing so.\n\nWe also have the plan ready for the addition to the Lady Willingdon Hospital on the Six Nations Reserve. As the funds for this building do not come out of the School Vote, I will ask for tenders at an early date.\n\nDuncan C. Scott.\n\nDr. Scott - To ask for tenders for the three schools mentioned.\n\nApril 3, 1930\n\nC.S.\nOttawa, April 17, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith further reference to vouchers received with your statement \"Contents of Envelope\", dated the 22nd ultimo, I wish to state that the Department's filing system is such that there is considerable difficulty when accounts of various natures are forwarded under cover of one letter. The general rule is one subject per letter, with any vouchers that are relative thereto attached. Several subjects may be grouped in one letter and vouchers, if any, attached, provided that all pertain to one or other of the following main questions:\n\n1. General policy at the Institution, appointments, etc.\n2. The quarterly returns.\n3. Per capita payments and current expenses.\n4. Classroom equipment, texts, athletic equipment, etc.\n5. Buildings, repairs, painting, improvements.\n6. Indian agent's inspections and reports.\n7. Public school inspector's inspections and reports.\n8. Farm and building site, fencing, clearing, etc.\n9. Correspondence re pupils, applications, discharges, etc.\n10. Vocational training.\n11. Furnishings.\n12. Medical, dental and hospital.\n13. Livestock and agricultural implements.\n14. New main building under construction or recently constructed.\n15. Water power development, if any.\n16. Students' organizations, Boy scouts, etc.\n\nYou will note that there is no 8 subject. The reason for this is that I have given you the numbers that\n\nRev. J.F.J. Marshall,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nSicoux Lookout, Ont.\ncorrespond with the Department's filing system. The agency in which the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School is situated is No. 129; the school is No. 6 and practically all letters which you will receive from the Department will commence with 129-6- and will end with one or other of the sub-numbers listed above. When you are replying to a communication or indicating authority, you should quote file number and date and, as a general rule, keep one subject to one covering letter.\n\nWhen authority has been given to you for some improvement or expenditure and this authority has been executed as directed, a covering letter is really not necessary, as you can forward the account in duplicate, properly certified, referring to the Department's letter on the face of the account; but where there is any comment to be made or explanation or a request for an answer, a covering letter should be prepared.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\nMemorandum:\n\nApril 28, 1930.\n\nDR. SCOTT.\n\nPursuant to phone conversation, I wish to report that the annual current expenses at southern Alberta schools are as follows:\n\n| Institution            | Expenses |\n|------------------------|----------|\n| St. Cyprian Residential| $5,300   |\n| Sacred Heart           | $8,400   |\n| Morley                 | $10,200  |\n| Old Sun                | $11,200  |\n| Crowfoot               | $10,600  |\n| Blood                  | $21,600  |\n| St. Paul's             | $19,700  |\n| Sarcee Day             | $850     |\n\nTotal: $97,850.\n\nThese institutions at the present time represent a capital expenditure of approximately:\n\n| Institution            | Expenditure |\n|------------------------|-------------|\n| St. Cyprian Residential| $92,500     |\n| Sacred Heart           | $94,900     |\n| Morley                 | $42,400     |\n| Old Sun                | $139,300    |\n| Crowfoot               | $115,000    |\n| Blood                  | $183,000    |\n| St. Paul's             | $196,300    |\n| Sarcee Day             | $4,000      |\n\nTotal: $867,200.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSir:-\n\nWould it be possible for the Department to advise me at an early date what they intend to do with regard to the building of Day Schools asked for in the Estimates. It would be a great help to me if I could have this information at once.\n\nFor instance, in the case of Fisher River where we are building a Clerk's house, if the schools that were asked for are to be built it would be a great advantage if we could have the carpenters who are on the ground go ahead and erect them. If we get this advice at a later date it will mean that new consignments of lumber will have to be sent in, and the carpenters will have to go back a second time.\n\nAs I have pointed out before, when we get these authorities so late in the season, most of the carpenters have already made their arrangements, and we have to take what is left, which is not satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMay 14, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nWith reference to your 100-11A of the 10th instant, I may say that, in the near future, there will be directed to you authority for the erection of buildings and for other improvements at certain Indian schools. Last year, I was unable to get a supplementary Indian Education Estimate to complete the large buildings under construction. The result is that these accounts have been held over and paid from this year's Vote. It is, therefore, impossible to effect all the improvements and replacements at schools that we would like to do. I rely on you to ask for no expenditure from Indian Education which can be safely postponed, and, if any authority is directed to you and you believe that the improvement is unnecessary at this time, do not hesitate to say so.\n\nI wish to refer you to the general instructions concerning the purchase of materials and the engagement of labour, etc., in my letter of May 6th, 1929.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

MURPHY,\n\nI regret to inform you that, recently, two barns have been destroyed by fire at Indian residential schools in western Ontario - one at the Indian Residential School at Fort Frances and the other at the Cecilia Jeffrey Institution, near Kenora. These losses are incidental to the work and the buildings must be replaced as soon as possible. I have hesitated to ask for authority to rebuild this fall, because of the condition of the Appropriation for Indian Education. However, the postponement of the large new main building at the Shingwauk Home School, Sault Ste. Marie, relieves the situation somewhat. Regarding the condition of the Vote, I may say I have informed the Minister of Finance that we should have a supplementary appropriation for Indian Education of $45,000.00 so our obligations of this year are to be met promptly. At the first opportunity, I wish to have a full and frank discussion with you in this connection.\n\nThe two barns must really be replaced without delay, or there will be serious consequences, and I should be grateful if you would let me have the name of a competent carpenter-foreman at Fort Frances and one at Kenora, to whom the reconstruction could be entrusted. I believe it advisable to have the work done on a day labour basis, the Indian Agent to purchase the materials.\n\nI should also like to have the names of lumber, cement and hardware dealers at Kenora and Fort Frances, so that the materials can be purchased without delay. Plans for these barns will be forwarded from the Department.\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOctober 21, 1930.\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nFor your information I quote the following from a letter addressed to the Superintendent General:\n\n\"You will doubtless recall our conversation concerning the present policy of inspection of merchandise delivered on contract, and our suggestion that some improved system of inspection is necessary, and it has occurred to me that the system used by the railroads might be given consideration.\n\n\"The railroads, and certain other large corporations, employ a firm of professional inspectors such as Charles Warnock and Company, whose head office is at Montreal, and who at the expense of the purchasing corporation inspect all merchandise at point of manufacture, stamping each and every article indelibly with their stamp of approval, which then authorizes the contracting party to ship same out against contract.\n\n\"Some such system as this would also be an assurance to the principal of the school, and we could then check the invoices and receipts with confidence.\"\n\nMr. Murphy would like a memorandum from you containing your views on the suggestion of his correspondent as to the feasibility of carrying out a plan of inspection as outlined to him.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, October 23, 1930.\n\nMr. Paget,-\n\nWould you kindly let me have a short memorandum as to our method of inspection, insofar as it is necessary for us to have inspections.\n\nDuncan Scott\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDr. Scott:\n\nOur contract supplies such as Blankets, Tweeds, Serge, etc., are inspected either at Ottawa or at point of manufacture before being shipped, by a qualified Inspector employed at Ottawa at intervals. Altogether the time occupied in this work would not exceed one month duration at the most.\n\nAs regards such contract supplies as Flour and Bacon which are delivered direct to the Indian Agencies in the Prairie Provinces, they are subject to inspection by the Indian Agent who reports before accepting them, if he considers they are not equal in quality to the specifications of the contract and forwards samples which are inspected here, and if necessary the contractors are communicated with.\n\nBefore awarding contracts for Tea, Soap, etc., which are delivered at Regina, and distributed from there, samples are submitted to the Government Analysts at Ottawa to determine whether they are equal to what is called for. After delivery at Regina samples are sent here for inspection again.\n\nThis system of inspection has been in vogue for many years with satisfactory result, is inexpensive and safeguarding.\n\nChief Accountant.\nOctober 24th, 1930.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Buskard -\n\nI have given careful consideration to your memorandum of October 21st, with reference to the inspection of contract supplies. I think I should note the last sentence quoted from your correspondent's letter:\n\n\"Some such system as this would also be an assurance to the principal of the school, and who could then check the invoices and receipts with confidence.\"\n\nYour correspondent is labouring under a misapprehension if he thinks the Government is responsible for supplies for residential schools. These supplies of food, clothing, etc., are purchased by the management of the schools and paid for from a per capita grant allowed by the Department. In the bulk these purchases, covering all our schools, amount to fairly large quantities, but we are not in any way responsible.\n\nWith regard to the inspection of other supplies, the delivery of blankets, tweeds, serges and clothing generally is inspected either at Ottawa or at the point of manufacture by a qualified inspector employed at intervals. We would, of course, obtain from you the name of an inspector for this work.\n\nIn connection with such staples as flour and bacon, notice is given in the tender forms that \"flour to be equal to Second Patent, to be fresh ground, etc.\"; and \"all Bacon must be very fat, of the best quality 'Canadian Short Clear' without bone, sides to weigh from 45 to 50 lbs., etc.\" These supplies are delivered direct to the Indian agencies and the Indian agents\ninspect before accepting them.\n\nGrocery supplies of tea and soap are delivered at Regina and distributed there. We set a price of 50\u00a2 a pound for tea and ask for samples which are submitted to the Government Analyst at Ottawa for a report on quality.\n\nTaking all the circumstances into consideration I do not think we could advantageously adopt the system suggested.\n\nDuncan Scott\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDr. Scott:\n\nThe appropriation available for Indian Education for the five remaining months of the current fiscal year amounts to $651,529.35 on October 31st.\n\nThe expenditure during the five months ending March 31st, 1930, was as follows:\n\n- November, 1929: $217,152.07\n- December, 1929: $230,758.38\n- January, 1930: $263,474.83\n- February, 1930: $153,426.32\n- March, 1930: $37,516.40\n\nTotal: $902,328.00\n\nWe had to cease paying accounts early in March as funds were exhausted.\n\nAmounts payable to contractors on uncompleted buildings are as follows:\n\n- Birtle School: $60,205.00\n- Blue Quills School: $93,593.00\n- Muscowequans School: $65,322.00\n\nTotal: $219,120.00\n\nThese figures do not include extras for sewage disposal, etc.\n\nThe December quarter School Grants will amount to about $285,000.00 in the aggregate.\n\nChief Accountant.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nNovember 24th, 1930.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Orr.\n\nWe are now preparing our Estimates and it is necessary to know the actual accommodation at the under-mentioned Indian residential schools.

A year ago, this Vote was approximately $100,000 short of this average; so, I believe, with careful financing, that we ought to be able to advance nearly $200,000 on the March grants & salaries in 1932. This estimate may appear rather optimistic, but may I state that there are two factors which will place the Vote for Indian Education in good condition for the year: 1 - For the first time we are securing (in our main Estimates) an amount sufficient to complete last year's building obligations. 2 - There will be no new buildings undertaken this year and, consequently, no extras or unprovided capital expenditure incurred.\n\nThe item of $88,399 for New Residential School Buildings includes four progress payments to contractors (Birtle, Muscowequans and Blue Quills) and the final payment to the New England Company on account of the purchase of the St. George's Indian Residential School.\n\nRussell T. Harrier\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., January 7th, 1932.\n\nSir:-\n\nI beg to inform you that, from time to time, the Department have been called upon to send men to the various schools to make repairs to heating plants or do some plastering, painting, etc. Some of the schools furnish these men with board and room, while others make a charge to the Department. Personally, I am of the opinion that the school could well afford to supply the small amount expended on food for these men during the time they are working there. No special expense is added, so far as furnishing sleeping accommodation and service is concerned.\n\nI should like to have a ruling on this matter. I would recommend that the school bear the cost of the man's board and room, not the Indian Department. If I am given a ruling on this, I will take steps to see that the same course is followed at all schools - in fact, it might be of sufficient importance to send a circular out to the different schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, January 14, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 100-11A of the 7th instant, and in reply I have to state that the Department expects Indian residential schools to provide, without payment, board and room for mechanics, carpenters, etc., who are sent to the institution by the Department for repairs. When buildings are to be erected and workmen are engaged for a considerable period, this rule can be relaxed somewhat. I doubt the advisability of a circular in this connection, as most schools understand the Department's wishes. If any accounts are forwarded for room and board when repairs are being undertaken, the items will be disallowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, No. 1-1-5, with reference to the matter of Indian Residential Schools making charges for board and room to mechanics, carpenters, etc., sent out to make repairs to the machinery etc., at the institutions.\n\nMy object in writing about this matter, in the first place, was to have a definite understanding with the Department that charges would not be made by the schools for board of workmen when rendering services.\n\nI note that you doubt the advisability of a circular in this connection as most schools understand the Department's wishes. I fear I do not agree with you at all in this matter. At the present time I am holding a voucher here, sent in to be forwarded for payment to Ottawa, which I have not done, amounting to $36.00. This is in favour of the Principal, Gordon's Indian Residential School, and he has requested the Department to pay this account. I am going to inform the Principal that the Department do not feel they should make payment. On another occasion there was a bill of $54.00 paid by the Department to the Gordon's School for board of men while installing filter and changing engine. In 1929 we sent plumbers down to the Lebret School, and the Department paid for their board. I also know of other cases where the mechanics, or the firms who sent them out to do the work, have paid the Principals direct for board and room, and, of course, added the cost to their bill. In view of all this\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nI do not see why there should be any objection to sending a circular out. However, I just wish to make it clear to you that I cannot agree with your statement that most of the schools understand the Department's wishes in this connection. My experience has been that they do not. However, I shall now inform any mechanics or other workmen sent out by me in future that the schools will supply free board.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., 2nd December, 1931.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nUpon recent visits to one or two Indian Residential schools Inspectors have found that exit doors to the fire escapes have been locked. This is a very dangerous practice. It defeats the purpose for which fire escapes are provided and must immediately be discontinued. Other means must be devised to guard against the possible mis-use by the pupils of fire escapes at night, and such protection cannot be allowed in any way to interfere with free passage to them should a fire or panic occur.\n\nIf at your school doors to fire escapes are locked they must be unlocked at once and so remain.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW. H. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., December 10th, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI recently reported to you that the fire escapes leading from the dormitories at the McKay Boarding School, The Pas Agency, were locked, and pointed out that this was a very serious matter. You will recall that two years ago when I visited the Fort Alexander School I found the fire escapes locked, and you instructed me to have these unlocked and a remedy effected by partitioning off a portion of the dormitory for a room in which the supervisor of the dormitory could sleep, so that in the event of anybody escaping by the fire escape they would have to go through this room. These instructions were issued and carried out.\n\nI have, from time to time, instructed the inspectors to be very careful to see that the fire escapes were never locked. It would be a very serious situation if a fire occurred, the fire escape locked, and the key in the hands of some member of the staff who was not handy to the door. The children would naturally run for the door where the fire escape was located, they would pile up, and there would be a repetition of what has occurred at schools in the north. Inspector Hamilton recently visited the Elkhorn Indian Residential School, and I was surprised to learn, when reading his report, that he found the fire escapes at this school locked and the keys in the hands of the matron.\n\nAfter receiving these two complaints, I circularized the Agents and Principals of Boarding Schools, a copy of which circular is enclosed herewith, making it clear that the doors to the fire escapes should not be locked. I am today in receipt of a letter from Mr. Jurrie, Principal of the Birtle Indian Residential School, in which he states that the doors leading to the fire escapes in this new school are kept locked; he goes on to say that\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nthe very fact that the Department recently ordered special locks put on these fire escape doors led him to believe that it was the purpose to keep them locked. I am of the opinion that if a fire took place at this school tomorrow and lives were lost, the blame would be placed on the department, and I do not think this is as it should be.\n\nI would like to receive assistance from the department with regard to this matter. I feel we must now allow these doors to be kept locked, and will have to devise some scheme whereby there will not be entrances gained by outsiders to these dormitories or pupils escaping from them. Of course, if the schools were built so that any person entering or leaving the dormitories would have to pass through an attendant's room, it would overcome all difficulties.\n\nI shall be glad to receive a reply to this letter at an early date as I wish to communicate again with these people who are in the habit of locking fire escape doors, making it clear that they are not to be locked. One principal suggests that a night watchman be employed, but I do not think this is necessary. This system is not carried out at convents - they have proper regulations regarding fire escapes.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\nW. REGINA, SASK., 23rd December, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nOn the 10th instant I wrote you in regard to the practice which prevails at a number of our Residential Schools of locking the doors to the fire escapes. With the latter enclosed copy of a circular which had been addressed to principals at all Boarding schools and of letter from Mr. Currie, Principal of the Birtle Residential School. I am now in receipt of one from Mr. G. H. Gooderham who points out that one of the fire escape doors at the Old Sun School on the Blackfoot Reserve also is kept locked and the Principal does not wish to leave it unlocked as it is \"off a store room\".\n\nThe practice is dangerous and ought not to be allowed, and I shall be glad to have an early reply from you in reply to my letter of the 10th instant on the subject.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan J. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nTo Principals of Indian Residential Schools:\n\nThe Department again wishes to urge those in authority at Indian residential schools to give constant and intelligent thought to the danger of fire. Fire escapes must be efficient, kept in repair, free from snow or ice and unlocked exits to them must open out. In dormitories which contain space for a supervisor, the best arrangement is to have the fire escape exit in the supervisor's room. If this is not possible, an older trusted pupil should have his or her bed near the exit and it should be that person's immediate duty, in the event of any alarm whatsoever, to prepare and guard the way to the fire escape. In dormitories where small children sleep, a member of the staff or a trusted older pupil must have their bed.\n\nFire drill from the dormitories must be practised at least every week in September, October and November and once each month throughout the rest of the year. At these fire drills, the children and the staff should actually complete their exit via the fire escapes and the practice must not be considered ended until every person is out of the building.\n\nPrincipals should satisfy themselves that there are a sufficient number of hand fire extinguishers at strategic places in the building and that those which require recharging from time to time are ready for effective use. All members of the staff and the older pupils should receive instruction in the use of this fire fighting equipment.\n\nAt some older schools, windows open on the fire escapes.* If these are kept sealed in any manner, it should be possible for the officer or trusted pupil responsible for opening the window. Every night before retiring, this officer or pupil must test the window by raising it to insure easy operation if necessary during the night. In the event of an alarm at night and there is any difficulty with a window, the one in charge of that exit must clear out glass and sash with a strong chair which shall be always in a convenient place.\n\nAt a few Indian residential schools, it is found really necessary to keep locked the doors leading to fire escape. It is only in special circumstances\nthat the Department can countenance this practice. Where this dangerous habit is imposed by conditions, principals of schools must intelligently accept the risk they are incurring, and, in addition to the regular precautions there must be two members of the staff provided with a key for each dormitory. Both shall proceed immediately to the dormitory exit and supervise the evacuation of the room. Even this is not sufficient precaution. A third key to the door must be provided and placed in a little glass-fronted box, hung conveniently. A small inexpensive hammer must be attached so that the glass can be broken readily.\n\nAt all Indian residential schools where the interior of the building is of frame construction, there must be a thoroughly reliable night watchman, who will constantly patrol the building during the night. In the case of semi-fireproof and fireproof buildings where there is a night watchman, a member of the staff must make a thorough inspection of the building at 10 o'clock and again at midnight; and there should be an hour's patrol following the laying of fires in the early morning.\n\nAll members of the staff and those responsible pupils who have specific duties during fire drill or in the event of fire must have strict instructions as to what action they should take. The school should be thoroughly organized for escape in the event of fire and at all drills the fire escapes themselves must be used. Pupils must realize that the fire escape is the exit in emergencies. Several lives have been lost at our institutions in the past because pupils rushed to their regular stairs. Any principal who is not satisfied with the fire escape and fire prevention facilities should report immediately to the Department.\nDecember 31, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your letters of the 10th and 23rd instant, with reference to fire escapes at Indian residential schools. This matter has been given considerable thought and the enclosed writing appears to me to be a good basis for a circular letter. We must remember that at some schools it is certainly necessary to have the exits locked. As soon as I receive your criticism of this letter, I will have a circular sent out to all schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., January 4th, 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, No. 1-1-5, enclosing a copy of a circular, with reference to fire escapes, which you propose sending to the Principals of all Indian Residential Schools.\n\nI have read the draft circular, and am of the opinion that everything is set out pretty clearly.\n\nHowever, there is one most important point which I think the Department should reconsider. It is stated in the circular that \"At a few Indian residential schools, it is found really necessary to keep locked the doors leading to fire escapes. It is only in special circumstances that the Department can countenance this practice.\"\n\nI feel satisfied, if the circular goes out this way, it will be interpreted by many Principals as authority for keeping the doors locked. Many of those who are today keeping the doors unlocked are doing it against their will and only because we have insisted upon this being done. However, if they feel it is up to them as to whether the doors are to be kept unlocked, I am afraid there will be many who will keep them locked, and others who have hitherto kept them open, will keep them locked. In my opinion, placing the responsibility with the Principal will have little or no effect.\n\nI shall be glad to have the Department take the stand that the doors to the fire escapes should be kept unlocked at all times. If this can be done at one school, it can be done at another. Leaving a key in the hands of a grown-up pupil or member of the staff will not, in my opinion, be safe. This member of the staff\n\nDuncan C. Scott, ESq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nstaff may be outside or anywhere around the buildings when a fire takes place. Why not insist on the doors being left unlocked and a member of the staff sleeping close to the door, behind a screen if necessary, or a small sleeping compartment could be built in the dormitories around the door leading to the fire escapes. This could be done at little cost.\n\nOnly this morning I received the report of the inspection of the Mackay Indian Residential School at The Pas, made by the Acting Indian Agent in December, in which he makes the notation \"All doors locked\". This situation exists in the face of the circular which I sent to all Principals of schools, warning them that the fire escape doors were not to be locked, and the situation here is aggravated by the fact that the management of this school is unsatisfactory and the supervision lax.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nTo Principals of Indian Residential Schools:\n\nThe Department again wishes to urge those in authority at Indian residential schools to give constant and intelligent thought to the danger of fire.

As our Commission had issued a Circular on the same subject to the Principals of our Society's Schools only a couple of days before your letter came to hand, you will understand that the matter has been receiving their careful attention. This, however, will not prevent them from addressing a further communication to the respective School Managements, in which directions will be given for the instructions set forth in your Circular to be put immediately into practice.\n\nWhile dealing with this question I desire to refer to two of the major objections against the ladder type of fire escape which have been reported to me by the Principals of our Society's Schools: (1) Where the school is located on a Reserve, or near an Indian settlement, access to the school dormitories by outsiders has frequently been secured by means of the fire escape ladders. To protect the pupils, especially the girls, from intrusion of this sort, some of the Principals considered it necessary to keep the exits to the fire escapes closed at certain periods of the year. This has been strictly forbidden by our Commission, and is not likely to be repeated. At the same time, the Principals have been advised to take up with the local Indian Agent the question of having an electric alarm bell installed at the door or window leading to the exit to each fire escape, so that they may receive immediate warning of the opening of the same. Should your Department receive any application for the installation of this equipment, I trust it may be favourably considered and granted. (2) Principals of\nIn larger schools where the ladder type of fire escape is installed, have repeatedly referred to the difficulty they have experienced in training the younger pupils especially, to make use of the same. The height, even when the dormitories are only on the second floor, appear to terrify the little ones, and this is not lessened by the open and unguarded frame work of which the ladder type of fire escape is made. If a wire net work were placed on both sides and also underneath the iron ladder the usefulness of this type of fire escape would be increased, but our Commission have felt for a long time that the best course to take would be to have the ladder type of fire escape replaced by the spiral chute. The cost would probably be greater, but the sense of security it would afford to all the parties concerned, would fully justify the expenditure.\n\nI commend this suggestion to the careful and favourable consideration of your Department, and remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, February 23, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to fire protection at Indian residential schools. Where it is considered advisable to have the exits leading to fire escapes locked from the outside, there is no reason why a suitable door lock cannot be supplied - one where the outside knob refuses to turn the lock and the inside one opens freely. There are comparatively inexpensive sets of this kind on the market. I believe this would be less expensive and just as suitable as an electric alarm bell.\n\nThe Department has given considerable thought to the best type of fire escape which can be secured at a reasonable cost and has decided in favour of the steel stair type.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. T. B. R.

Deductions of 10% shall be made from all payments which are remuneration, regardless of their amount or designation, whether such payments be in cash or in kind, or be paid at annual, monthly, weekly, hourly, or other rates, or be based on fixed or prevailing rates, or authorized by statute, by order in Council, by the civil Service Commission, or by other competent authority.\"\n\n\"2. The deduction shall apply whether the compensation be in the form of wages, commissions, fees, allowances, extra pay, overtime pay, or in any other form, so long as the same constitutes remuneration for services in virtue of any employment in the public service of Canada as distinguished from such employment arising out of a specific contractual relationship. Conversely, regardless of designation, mode of authorization, or rate, payments made for abnormal living costs, travel or other similar purposes shall not be subject to the deduction.\"\n\nThis means that in addition to the regular full time employees who are paid at monthly or annual rates, it is intended that the provisions of the Act be applied to casual labour, skilled and unskilled, which may be employed from time to time at prevailing hourly rates. This matter has been seriously considered by the Auditor General and the Comptroller of the Treasury who feel that the spirit of the Act will be complied with re casual labour so long as the rates paid this fiscal year are at least 10% lower than the rates paid for similar classes of labour during the past year.\n\nI beg to request, therefore, that the personnel who may have occasion to employ casual labour be instructed accordingly and to certify on all pay lists for casual labour that the rates paid are at least 10% below those paid last year or failing this to make a deduction of 10%.\n\nN.

Allen,\nRepresentative of the Treasury.\nIndian Residential School at Lebret Burns Down\n\nSunday morning's disastrous fire at Lebret destroys the Indian School pictured above, with a total loss of $25,000. Father Huguenard, famous Oblate missionary of the early days, founded the school in 1881. Since then, the Oblate Fathers have conducted it, and Lebret school, beautifully situated on Katepwa Lakes, was justly rated one of the best Indian schools in Canada. The Oblate Fathers, in conjunction with the Department for Indian Affairs, will rebuild immediately.\nKenora, Ont., January 26th, 1933\n\nHon. T.G. Murphy,\nMinister of the Interior,\nAnd Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nHonorable Sir:\n\nMay I draw your kind attention to some very important items in connection with the care and operation of some of our Indian residential schools, a cut of one of which I herein inclose as an example of what these structures really are, and the question comes up can fires in such institutions be really prevented? and the answer would be \"Yes\" in a great many instances, therefore being in the Fire Fighting and Fire Prevention business practically all my life I have consequently obtained very valuable experience in both fighting fires and in ways and means of preventing them. Why not conserve these buildings and save money, pardon my apparent ire in this respect but I cannot help it; I seem to know that many of these structures could be better looked after if the right efforts were put into practice.\n\nThe conditions found around some of them is deplorable, and it is no wonder that they burn up so frequently, allow me to refer to your instance but I will not mention any names but I can produce the facts in full if necessary. I found hand chemicals, the two and a half gallon size supposed to be in readiness for business in case of fire in such shape that they would not even shoot a drop of water in examining them I found that the metal cork usually used for corking the acid bottle setting on the head of the bottle with the original rubber cork still in the neck of the bottle it had never been taken out and naturally no acid would flow if the machine was tipped over for use, the one setting up these machines did not even know why and how the metal corks were used. I might say that metal cork replaces the rubber ones when the machines set for use, and these machines had not been touched for at least over twelve years when in reality they should be charged yearly. I can go on many other items but such is not necessary, it is therefore possible to have all these structures carefully inspected at least yearly by an expert inspector and I am certain that many fires and many present conditions would be greatly changed and improved the rest.\n\nI leave ..........\nI leave to your own judgment, should not there be something done in this respect? I am willing to assist in any way I can and I am sure that wonderful results would be derived if you had something done in this line.\n\nI remain yours truly,\n\nsgd) F.

BURKARD,\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 30th ultimo, with copy of portion of a letter addressed to the Minister by the Chief of the Fire Department at Kenora, Ont., regarding fire prevention and fire equipment at Indian residential schools, I attach hereto copy of a circular forwarded to the Principals of all the Indian residential schools as well as Indian agents and church representatives.\n\nThere are fire escapes and fire extinguishers at each of the schools, and, in quite a number of the schools, fire hose, which can be attached to the school water supply. As you will observe from the circular, the principals were instructed to carry out regular fire drill and to see that all fire extinguishers and other equipment are kept in a satisfactory condition, ready for effective use. In the cases of the schools recently burned, there was ample fire equipment, if same was in good condition. All agents are instructed that, during their visit to a school, they are to see that the fire extinguishers are properly charged and that fire drill is regularly held.\n\nWe spend a considerable amount each year in supplying new fire extinguishers and refills for old extinguishers, fire hose and in improving and adding fire escape facilities. The principals are continually being impressed with the importance and necessity of keeping fire equipment in good condition and ready for use. Should the equipment at any school be not properly looked after, it is entirely due to neglect on the part of the principal and staff.\n\nNight watchmen are engaged at residential schools where the interior of the building is of frame construction and a fire hazard. Watchman's clocks have been supplied and it is necessary that the watchman makes hourly rounds during the night.\n\nThe reports of our agents and inspectors, regarding fire equipment, are carefully checked and any requests for refills or additional extinguishers or other fire equipment are promptly met. It has been the endeavour of the Schools Branch to take every step possible to see that adequate fire protection appliances are supplied. The principals must be held responsible, in view of the frequent instructions given, if all fire equipment is not properly looked after.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nFebruary 11, 1933.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Buskard,\n\nIn further reference to your memorandum of the 10th ultimo and my reply of the 2nd instant, regarding the communication received by the Honourable the Minister from the Chief of the Fire Department, Kenora, Ont., concerning fire prevention and fire equipment and drawing attention to the conditions found by him, I have to say that this matter was referred to Mr. Frank Edwards, Indian Agent, Kenora, for a report. He was requested to interview the Fire Chief and ascertain from him the school referred to in his letter.\n\nFor your information, I attach hereto the reply of Mr. Edwards, together with copy of a communication he received from the Fire Chief. I am sure you will observe from the correspondence that the Fire Chief was not referring to conditions which obtain at the present time. The fire equipment at the two residential schools at Kenora is kept in good, serviceable condition.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nEXTRACT from Inspector Barry's Report regarding his visit to the TSARTLIP INDIAN DAY SCHOOL on March 15th, 1933. - Original on File 152-14-6.\n\nI would strongly recommend the Department of Indian Affairs to issue a circular instruction to all the Indian Schools in B.C. to the effect that all toilets must be inspected by teachers daily. This is the standing rule of the Provincial School Department and I can see no reason for the generally poor condition in which I find the toilets of our Indian Day Schools. I would also ask that the Indian Agents be instructed to see that such a rule if issued be observed.\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMarch 6, 1933.\n\nDR.

This is accounted for by the increased accommodation in the new Birtle, Brandon, Muscowequan's, Blue Quills and Old Sun's Schools and by increases in pupilage granted to the following schools that have the necessary accommodation: Shubenacadie, Mohawk, Sioux Lookout, St. Albert, Alert Bay and Kamloops. Further, everywhere in Canada, Indian Residential Schools are now earning...\ntheir full Per Capita Grant and it is no longer possible to vote the item at 94% or 95% of the possible earnings.\n\nSalaries at Day Schools are practically the same as last year.\n\nAssistance to Graduates shows an increase of $8,000.00. Demands to assist with high school and vocational training are constantly increasing.\n\nMedical Attention - Residential Schools is increased by $8,000.00. This branch of the Department's service has been better organized with the result that more physical defects have been brought to the Department's attention.\n\nClassroom Equipment shows an increase of $4,000.00. The Department has found it advisable to place in the hands of Indian pupils better and more varied texts and other instruments.\n\nThe item for Repairs and Equipment at Residential Schools is increased $8,000.00. Several institutions which will eventually need replacement must be kept in repair until funds can be provided for new buildings.\n\nAdditions and Outbuildings at Residential Schools is practically the same as last year.\n\nIn the past, the Appropriation for Indian Education has been confined to regular and foreseen expenditures. No provision has been made for emergencies, such as loss by fire, and, as a result, the Appropriation has become exhausted before the end of the fiscal year. This Miscellaneous item, which is approximately 2.8% of the Vote, is required to care for unforeseen and emergent needs.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nEstimates\n\nINDIAN EDUCATION 1931-32\n\nDAY SCHOOL NEW BUILDINGS ........ $76,600.\n\nBURN'T CHURCH, N.

E.)\n\nThe main building at this school was erected in 1874 by the church and it is now in a very unsatisfactory condition. Temporary repairs have been made from time to time; but recent inspections show that there is a very serious fire hazard and that the pupils and staff are living under really unsanitary conditions. It is proposed to rebuild on the same site near Sault Ste. Marie, at a cost of $175,000.\n\nANY MISSION, Ont. (R. C.)\n\nThe Oblate Order, under whose auspices this school is conducted, with the help of the Department are erecting a modern building on James Bay. The old building has outlived its usefulness. The Department's grant for this purpose this year is $10,000.\n\nBEAUVAL, Sask. (R. C.)\n\nThe main building at this school was destroyed by fire in September, 1927. The church authorities offered to erect a new building if the Department would finance the scheme. $50,000 has been granted during the past two years. There is now required to finish the buildings and to furnish them $75,000.\n\nST. BRUNO'S, Alta. (R. C.)\n\nAt this school it has been necessary to erect an addition. Very successful work has been accomplished here, but the accommodation for boys and for kitchen, laundry and other functions has been most inadequate. The Department is adding to the present administration building and there is now required to finish the work and to install the necessary mechanical plant $37,000.\n\nWABASCA, Alta. (R. C.)\n\nThe church authorities have found it necessary to rebuild the Wabasca R. C. Indian Residential School. P. C. 2006, dated October 9, 1929, authorised the Department to give a grant of $15,000 towards the purpose - approximately one-half of the total expenditure. The work has now been completed and the church authorities are asking for reimbursement to the extent of the grant $15,000.\nMay 21, 1931.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. SCOTT,\n\nIf it is possible to secure a Supplementary Appropriation for Indian Education, 1931-32, I should be grateful if the following urgent needs would receive consideration.

(R. C.)\n\nThe Oblate Order, with the help of the Department, is erecting a new school on James Bay. The total cost will be approximately $60,000, and the Department is asked to grant $25,000 toward the undertaking. $15,000 has been given during the past 2 years and the final grant amounts to $10,000.\n\nGARIBOO, B. C. (R. C.)\n\nAt this large and important school in central British Columbia, the water supply has been doubtful as to quantity and bad as to quality. The Dominion Water Power Branch has recommended a new system which will provide not only domestic supply but fire protection. The cost, including alterations to plumbing, is $32,000.\n\nGARCROSS, Yukon, (C. E.)\n\nThis small school is greatly handicapped by lack of necessary facilities. The provision of a small addition has been postponed as long as possible. The cost will be $10,000.\n\nBEAUVILLE, Sask. (R. C.)\n\nThe church authorities have erected a new fireproof building, at a cost of $135,000. The Department has already granted $50,000 for the purpose and there is now required $85,000.\n\nSHINGWAUK HOME, Ont. (C. E.)\n\nThe main building at this school was erected in 1874 and is now both unsanitary and beyond repairing. In addition there is a serious fire hazard and it is proposed to rebuild on the same site, at a cost of $165,000.\n\nLESSER SLAVE LAKE, Alta. (C. E.)\n\nA new building is urgently required to replace three small and dilapidated Church of England schools in this area. To commence building $100,000.\n\nSANDY BAY, Man. (R. C.)\n\nAt this school, it is impractical to arrange for proper water supply and sewage disposal. The building is not worth extensive repairs and it should be replaced on a new site. To commence building $100,000.\n\nOLD SUN, Alta. (C. E.)\n\nIn 1930, the Department borrowed $80,000 from Band Funds, so that the school could be rebuilt immediately. It is proposed to make reimbursement $80,000.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nEstimates\n\nINDIAN EDUCATION\n\n|                | 1932-33 | 1931-32 | Increase |\n|----------------|---------|---------|----------|\n|                |         |         |          |\n| $2,683,095.    | $2,005,000. | $678,095. |\n\n|                | 1932-33 | 1931-32 | Increase | Decrease |\n|----------------|---------|---------|----------|----------|\n| CURRENT EXPENSES: |         |         |          |          |\n| Per Capita Grants | $1,366,110. | $1,338,715. | $27,395. | -

C. Schools in Alberta; and at Kuper Island and St. George's in British Columbia.\n\nThe item for Repairs and Equipment - Residential Schools is increased by $19,000. Last year, very little was expended on this work, with the result that there are many repairs and much painting to be done.\n\nNew Day Schools shows an increase of $26,100. During the past year, there was practically no building activity, but there are certain day schools where replacement and improvement is absolutely necessary.\n\nAdditions and Outbuildings - Residential Schools shows an increase of $68,505. At many schools, outbuildings are needed so that the work can proceed in a proper manner. Indian children cannot be trained for farm life without having barns and other buildings for live stock, granaries, root houses, etc.\n\nThese increases are offset by the decrease of $141,000 in Residential School New Main Buildings, none of which are included in this Estimate.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nEstimates\nINDIAN EDUCATION 1932-33\n\nDAY SCHOOL IMPROVEMENTS AND BUILDINGS... $32,200.\n\nCAUGHNAWAGA, Que.\nTo level and prepare playgrounds at new school ....... $1,500.\n\nSAGAMOOK, Ont.\nTo erect combined school and teacher's residence .... 2,500.\n\nSERPENT RIVER, Ont.\nTo erect combined school and teacher's residence .... 3,000.\n\nSHEGUANDAH, R.C., Ont.\nTo erect combined school and teacher's residence .... 7,000.\n\nSUCKER CREEK, Ont.\nTo erect combined school and teacher's residence .... 5,800.\n\nWIKWEMIKONG, Ont.\nTo prepare new building for occupation ......... 1,500.\n\nWATERHEN RIVER, Man.\nTo erect addition to teacher's residence ......... 500.\n\nFAIRFORD, Man.\nTo provide water supply and to paint buildings ........ 1,600.\n\nASSINIBOINE, Sask.\nTo effect general repairs, painting, etc. .... 500.\n\nGOTE, Sask.\nTo provide heating system .................. 1,500.\n\nDAY STAR, Sask.\nTo erect addition to residence ............ 600.\n\nAHTAHKAKOOPS, Sask.\nTo erect classroom ......................... 4,000.\n\nSARGEE, Alta.\nTo alter building to increase accommodation .. 1,000.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nEstimates\n\nINDIAN EDUCATION 1932-33\n\nREPAIRS AND EQUIPMENT AT RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS . . . . . $40,000.\nADDITIONS AND OUTBUILDINGS AT RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS . . . . . 101,265.\n\nTOTAL - - $141,265.\n\nSHUBENACADIE, N.

The purpose of this control is to guard against the over-committing of appropriations. The introduction of this system involves:\n\n1. Establishing a break-down of each appropriation into allotments for the different classes of expenditure provided for.\n\n2. Setting up a system of commitment control over all appropriations that will enable the Comptroller to guard against authorising the incurrence of expenditures by Departmental Officers, that would overdraft an appropriation.\n\nMAIN ALLOCMENTS OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n1. The purpose of allotments is to assist Administrative Officers and the Comptroller in keeping commitments within the limits of appropriations. The extent to which appropriations may require to be sub-divided into allotments will depend on the nature and relative amount of the expenditures provided for and the break-down deemed necessary to ensure adequate control.\n\n2. The classification of appropriations provided for Section 26 should be established by Administrative Officers of Departments working in conjunction with the Accounting Officers and other representatives of the Treasury, at or before the beginning of each fiscal year and should be designed to fulfil the purpose referred to in the next preceding Section. The allotments so agreed upon should be approved by the Treasury Board and should not be varied except by authority of the Board.\n3.- An example of the allotments that may be established for certain appropriations, follows:\n\n- Allotment for Salaries.\n- Allotment for Travel Expenses.\n- Allotment for Printing and Stationery.\n- Allotment for Supplies and Materials.\n- Allotment for Miscellaneous Expenses.\n- Unallotted balance of Appropriation.\n\n4.- It is important that the allotment for miscellaneous expenses shall be as small as possible. While materials and supplies may in some instances be covered by a single allotment, in every case where particular items of supplies are indispensable to the service concerned, or form a substantial part of the total required under this head, such items shall be covered by separate allotments.\n\n5.- In establishing these allotments it is deemed advisable to retain a part of each appropriation as an unallotted balance. This balance may be used to supplement allotments already made or for the establishment of additional allotments. However, before any part of an unallotted balance may be used, the proper Administrative Officer of the Department concerned, must apply to the Comptroller for the required allotment of it. The Comptroller will submit the application to the Treasury Board together with his recommendation. If the application is approved by the Board, the allotment certificate will be issued and the Department advised. In the event of Departments applying for the transfer of an amount from one allotment to another, the same procedure will be followed.\n\n6.- If an Administrative Officer, in applying for the allotment or transfer described in the preceding paragraph, represents to the Comptroller that the amount is urgently\nand immediately required, the Treasury Board might authorise the Comptroller, in his discretion, to grant a temporary allotment and authorise commitments chargeable thereto, pending approval by the Treasury Board.\n\n7.- A separate ledger account should be maintained for each allotment of an appropriation. It should show the amount allotted, commitments entered into, commitments liquidated, unliquidated balance of commitments, expenditures made, refunds and the unencumbered balance of the allotment.\n\nSUB-ALLOTMENTS.\n\n8.- It will be necessary in certain instances to divide the main allotments described above, into sub-allotments, in order that the Comptroller may be in a position to furnish the Administrative Officers with the information they require. These sub-allotments should be established by the Administrative Officers and the Comptroller working in conjunction with each other. The Administrative Officer may, with the concurrence of the Comptroller, change the sub-allotments after they have been established, without reference to the Treasury Board.\n\nCOMMITMENT CONTROL.\n\n9.- The Act provides under Section 29, that no obligation of any nature shall be incurred unless the Comptroller has certified that there is an unencumbered balance of an appropriation available to which the expenditure may be charged. This provision calls for the establishment of a system of control over all Departmental commitments. In order that Administrative Officers may not be unduly hampered in the performance of their duties, the Treasury Board may, by regulation, authorise the Comptroller to modify\nthe application of control over commitments when he is satisfied that conditions warrant such modification.\n\n10.- The procedure to be followed in charging commitments to the appropriation allotments and authorising Administrative Officers of the Department to incur the obligations, is outlined hereunder.\n\nSALARIES AND WAGES.\n\n11.- Where an appropriation provides for salaries and wages, it is intended that an allotment shall be made for this purpose.

PAGET,\n\nPursuant to instructions you have received from the Comptroller of the Treasury, I wish to make some comments and to ask for certain blanket authority for expenditures in connection with the 1932-33 Appropriation for Indian Education, which may be called Allotment No. 9, Vote 201. This allotment has already been divided into sub-allotments, and you will note that there is no unallotted balance. To provide such balance would be extremely difficult, as each sub-allotment is reduced to a minimum. However, after reading the instructions from the Comptroller, I am satisfied that the retention of an unallotted balance within an allotment is not necessary, as the Comptroller is empowered to authorize an administrative officer to change sub-allotments without reference to the Treasury Board. In fact, at present I am inclined to recommend that Allotment 9, Indian Education, be not subdivided into sub-allotments. It is extremely desirable that all expenditure at any one school, whether for grants, salaries, repairs, equipment, or even new buildings, be shown in one ledger account. This greatly simplifies cost accounting. If the Comptroller insists on sub-allotments in this allotment, then I should be grateful for an opportunity of making a new classification.\n\nWith reference to commitment control, I believe some modification is warranted because of the nature of the expenditure and the conditions which obtain in Indian educational work. The procedure outlined by the Comptroller for maintaining commitment control over allotments for salaries will be entirely suitable for 1 - per capita grants, 2 - day school salaries, and 3 - tuition grants. At the beginning of each fiscal year, the allotment could be charged with the full amounts and a certificate issued.\n\nIn connection with the construction of new buildings, the procedure indicated by the Comptroller will, of course, be satisfactory. For all other expenditures from this allotment (Nos. 4 to 10 and 13 as listed hereunder), it is impracticable to obtain specific certificates. The first intimation the Department has concerning a great number\n\nof expenditures\nof expenditures in the presentation, by Indian agents, or school principals, of the actual accounts. To indicate the detailed nature of the expenditure, I might state that, last fiscal year, $916 cheques were issued against the Appropriation for Indian Education. Less than $200 of these were for grants, salaries and the construction of buildings; leaving about $700 payments of amounts under $75 or $80. I have to recommend, for these miscellaneous expenditures, that blanket authorities or treasury warrants for the year be issued.\n\nFor the Comptroller's information, I briefly explain the nature of the expenditures for Indian Education, Allotment No. 2, Vote 201. It should be remembered that, if he insists on sub-allotments, I should like to suggest another classification.\n\n1. Per Capita Grants for Residential Schools - $1,239,492.\n\nThere are 80 institutions which the churches manage for the Department. The per capita grants vary from $150 to $350 per annum. Payment is quarterly and is based on average attendance. Grants are cut 10% for the coming fiscal year.\n\n2. Salaries, Day School Teachers - $250,782.\n\n286 full time and 20 part-time teachers at 264 schools. Salaries are cut 10% for the coming fiscal year.\n\n3. Tuition and Assistance to Graduates - $54,000.\n\nApproximately 375 Indian children are attending public schools, orphanages, high schools or colleges. A few graduates are assisted to establish themselves. Grants for these purposes are made.\n\n4. Inspection of Schools - $8,000.\n\nIn two provinces, the Department has an Inspector of Indian Schools, but elsewhere in Canada we enlist the cooperation of the Provincial Departments of Education for this service.\n\n5. Fuel, Janitors and Hot Lunches at Day Schools - $47,000.\n\n6. Transportation of Pupils - $8,000.\n\n7. Medical and Dental Attention, Residential Schools - $36,000.\n\n8. Classroom\n8. Classroom Equipment - $39,000.\n\nIn the past, all textbooks, scribblers and stationery used at Indian schools has been ordered in small quantities from the King's Printer. I am seriously considering ordering in quantity and stocking in our own Department. This would reduce the requisitions, which must be dealt with by several officers, to a minimum. I am also prepared to recommend that special authority be given to this Department to purchase scribblers, exercise books and readers locally. This would save all requisitioning and transportation costs. There is very small margin on this class of school equipment and it would be in the interests of economy, from the standpoints of time, labour and money, if we could authorize schools to purchase themselves. Other texts, stationery, etc., could be stocked in Ottawa.\n\n9. Repairs, Painting, Equipment, etc., Day Schools - $21,000.\n\n10. Repairs and Equipment, Residential Schools - $49,699.\n\n11. Day School Improvements - $4,200.\n\nThis item includes new buildings or other major improvements.\n\n12. Improvements and Outbuildings, Residential Schools - $14,500.\n\nUnder this heading is provided funds for any expensive equipment, alterations, clearing land, painting of buildings, the construction of small additions and new outbuildings.\n\n13. B. C. Special - $15,000.\n\nThis fund is used for young Indians in British Columbia to assist them with technical education, vocational training or establishing them in their homes.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nSupplementary Estimates\n\nINDIAN EDUCATION 1932-33\n\nFURTHER AMOUNT REQUIRED - $134,675.00\n\nPER CAPITA GRANTS FOR RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS\n\nThis summer, the Missionary Society of the Church of England are opening a school at Fort George, in northern Quebec.

ALLEN,\n\nYour officers have drawn to my attention the difficulty of charging the undermentioned expenditure to Indian Education Primary Allotment:-\n\nAthletic Equipment,\nSewing material for instruction,\nSchool garden seeds,\nArticles for Christmas trees.\n\nI have discussed these items with Mr. Donnelly, and I believe that we should set aside the following:-\n\n285 - Miscellaneous supplies $4,000. Reserve $400. Other Expenditure.\n\nIf you concur, I will prepare a Requisition for Encumbrance Certificate for the amount of the reserve. This will leave the unallotted balance at $25,299.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Harrier\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nThe Supplementary Estimates 1932-33 contained for Indian Education $19,100, as follows:\n\nPer Capita Allowances $4,200.\nM. & R. Buildings 4,900.\nConstruction of Buildings 10,000.\n\nI propose to have these subdivided for the Sub-allotments, as follows:\n\n211 - Equipment for Schools $4,200.\n\nThe reason for this shift is that at least this amount voted for per capita allowances in the Main Estimates is being used to furnish Beauval. This posting will then balance that item.\n\n242 - Construction of Buildings $6,400.\n\nI find that, when I allotted $6,700 from the Main Estimates for this purpose, I included $3,600 which should have gone to M. & R. Buildings (Day Schools).\n\n243 - M. & R. Buildings-$4900 plus $3600 or $8,500.\n| Province | Estimated Expenditure by Provinces (1922-33) |\n|----------|---------------------------------------------|\n| P.E.I.   | $585.00                                    |\n| N.S.     | $25,920.00                                 |\n| N.B.     | $10,440.00                                 |\n| Que.     | $34,187.00                                 |\n| Ont.     | $204,106.00                                |\n| Man.     | $146,653.00                                |\n| Sask.    | $281,762.00                                |\n| Alta.    | $262,667.00                                |\n| B.C.T.   | $38,700.00                                 |\n| B.C.     | $293,741.00                                |\n| Totals   | $1,233,699.00                              |\n\n| Item Description | Estimated Expenditure |\n|------------------|------------------------|\n| Salaries Tuition & Allowances | $290,783.00 |\n| Teachers' Agists | $29,000.00            |\n| Janitors' Porters & Gasbees | $10,000.00 |\n| Dental | $1,200.00             |\n| Medical Staff | $1,040.00             |\n| Trans-Porters | $1,000.00             |\n| New Buildings | $1,300.00             |\n| Repairs | $1,500.00             |\n| Residences | $4,100.00             |\n| Improvements | $8,550.00             |\n| Day | $5,000.00             |\n| Total | $865,299.00           |\n\n| Additional Information | Estimated Expenditure |\n|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Poor Copy              |                        |\n| No.   | Details                                                                 | Application                  |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| 201-203 | Communication Services $200.                                           | Other Expenditure            |\n| 211-212 | Equipment for Schools and Graduates                                    | Major items - sep. requisition Reserve $4,000.

C. Benson, Esq.,\nActing Secretary,\nTreasury Board,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have discussed the statement of \"Suggested Reductions\" in the appropriations of the Department of Indian Affairs with the administrative officials of that Department, and am satisfied that the following represent the maximum reductions which can safely be made without seriously affecting the administration of the several services concerned.\n\nCivil Government Salaries .................. $ 4,614.\nContingencies, on account Miscellaneous Expenditure... $600.\n\nGeneral Vote for Administration of Indian Affairs -\nAdministration Allotment .................... $ 30,000.\nIndian Education ................................ $8,000.\nMedical Services .............................. $6,000.\nAids to Indians ............................... $20,000.\n\n$111,600.\n\nWhile the reductions proposed to be made by the Department of Indian Affairs appear to be small in comparison with the amounts suggested in your memorandum, it might be pointed out that the appropriations of this department have already been reduced by $1,650,000, or approximately 20-1/2% since 1930-31. The consequence is that only the most urgent and essential services are provided for.\nI cannot see any prospect of effecting any further reductions or savings in cost of personnel other than the amount shown for civil government salaries. The outside establishment of this department, owing to the nature of its functions, comprises over 100 small units ranging in strength from one to six employees. It is, therefore, not practicable to make reductions in the staff.\n\nThe proposed saving to be effected in administration expenses, can only be accomplished by curtailing or postponing expenditures on government owned buildings and exercising the strictest economy in miscellaneous items of expenditure. This allotment was drastically cut last year with the result that charges for maintenance of and repairs to government property could not be incurred.\n\nThe Per Capita Grants to Residential Schools have already been reduced by 10% so that any further reduction in this particular class of expenditure is, in my opinion, neither desirable nor advisable. Substantial amounts were struck out of the current estimates for Education before they were submitted to the Treasury Board so that the total reduction from 1932-33, including the amount now proposed, will be $350,000.\n\nThe amount estimated for the current year for Medical Services is $25,000 less than last year. A further reduction of $16,000 is proposed. This class of expenditure is being kept down to a minimum consistent with reasonable health conditions. No provision is made to meet the additional expenses of unforeseen epidemics and the consequent costs of increased hospitalization. Even now requests for hospital treatment are being refused owing to lack of funds. It is considered that any arbitrary restriction of expenditure would mean a definite reduction in the activities and usefulness of the Medical Branch.\n\nLast year the expenditure on account of aids to Indians (including relief of destitute) was $955,000, while for the current year only $800,000 has been provided. Therefore, a saving of $155,000 must be effected to keep within the appropriation. A further reduction of $40,000 is proposed, but the saving should not be effected unless absolutely necessary especially in view of the trend of less unemployable nature of this class of expenditure and conditions existing generally throughout the country.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n| School          | Pupilage 1932-33 | Pupilage 1933-34 | Increase | Decrease | P.

Under these circumstances I would recommend that the sum of $1,500.00 be transferred from Per Capita Grants (No. 217) and added to the item RENTS (No. 275).\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS.\n\nStatement of Expenditures, April 1st, to September 30th, 1935.\n\nB.C.

There are approximately 40 children for whom no school facilities are provided and who do not attend any school. The present school is situated at the west end of the island - a distance of approximately five miles from where the Indians at the east end of the island reside. An officer of the Department, who visited the reserve in August, last, states that the Indians are anxious for the children to have the advantage of an education but they were unable to have them attend the day school on the west end of the island, owing to the distance. He says this situation is causing unfavourable comment amongst the adjoining white municipalities. The need of school facilities is urgent.\n\nCornwall Island is located in an angle between the boundaries of the province of Ontario and Quebec and the State of New York.\n\nWIKWEMIKONG - Addition to school building, to provide increased living accommodation for teachers - $1,000.\n\nA new 2-roomed school building has recently been completed and classes opened therein on the first instant. At the rear, a very narrow part is partitioned off for living quarters for two teachers. There is insufficient accommodation. It will be necessary to extend the building to provide increased accommodation. No doubt, it will be possible to obtain certain of the material from the old school building, which is to be demolished. The providing of more space for the teachers' living quarters is absolutely necessary.\n\nThis school is located in the village of Wikwemikong, on the Manitoulin Island Unceded Reserve, Manitoulin Island, Ont.\n\nLETTAGAMI - To assist in erection of school building with rooms attached for living accommodation of teacher . . . . . . 750.\n\nA request has been received from the Anglican missionary, strongly supported by the local Indian Agent, for school facilities for the Indians residing on this reserve - No. 71, in the Chapleau Indian Agency, province of Ontario. The\nIndians of the Band have become fairly well established, and the move towards a school would encourage them to remain on the reserve instead of wandering all over the north country, as they have been in the habit of doing for the past number of years. If a small school was erected and a suitable teacher engaged, the children could remain on the reserve while the parents are away trapping. There are 25 children of school age. In the erection of a building, the Indians have agreed to do a great deal of the work, themselves, voluntarily, and they propose that a log building be erected, but lumber for flooring and other purposes will be required, together with windows, doors, etc. - which will cost about $750. At present, the children on this reserve are receiving no education.\n\nELSAS - To assist in erection of school building with living accommodation for teacher - $1,200.\n\nOn this reserve - No. 83, on Kapuskasing Lake, in the Chapleau Indian Agency, there are 15 children of school age at the present time, but the number will be increased as soon as the Indians are assured that their children will be able to attend school. The Indians would gladly labour, voluntarily, in the erection of a building doing the work under a competent foreman who would have to be engaged for the purpose. There is no timber suitable for building purposes. The building would be of frame construction and the material will have to be supplied. The probable cost will be about $1,200. There are no educational facilities provided for the Indian children on this reserve.\n\nRABBIT ISLAND - To erect a school building with teacher's living quarters - $4,000.\n\nThe Rabbit Island settlement is located some 7 miles north of the present Wikwemikong Indian Day School and is on the Manitoulin Island Unceded reserve. On this section of the reserve, there are 34 children of school age. The lack of school facilities in this section has necessitated a number of families deserting their farms to live in the village of Wikwemikong. The Indians have been requesting a school for some years, in order that they could live on their farms and at the same time have their children receive an education.\n\nSAGAMOOG - To erect a school building with teacher's living quarters - $4,000.\n\nThe Sagamook Indian Day School has been closed for about 5 years, owing to the fact that it was not properly located. It is on the Spanish River reserve No. 6 Thengalon Indian agency. The Indians do not reside in the vicinity. Requests have been made for the erection of a new school at a more central point. A proposal has been submitted to the Department from time to time, that the old school building be torn down and any lumber that would be of service transported to the new site and used in the erection of a new school. The Indians would, no doubt, do part of the labour, voluntarily. It would be necessary to supply the building materials. There is need of a school for the Indian children, who are growing up wild, without education. The Agent and the Church Authorities request that a new school be erected next summer.\nCHRISTIAN ISLAND - To erect new school building with teacher's living quarters for R. C. Indian children - $6,000.\n\nThis school, on Christian Island reserve, No. 30, was opened last September, at the urgent demands of the Roman Catholic Church authorities (Jesuit Order) and is being conducted, temporarily, in the church building. It will be necessary to erect a school building with living quarters for the teacher. There are approximately 30 Roman Catholic Indian children of school age who can attend. The present arrangement for carrying on the work in the church is unsatisfactory and a new building, with classroom accommodation and teacher's living quarters, is needed.\n\nWHITE BEAR'S - New school building with teacher's living quarters for R. C. Indian children - $6,000.\n\nNew school building with teacher's living quarters, to replace present old building, for Protestant Indian children - $6,000.\n\nThe building which is at present used for the day school conducted under the auspices of the United Church of Canada is very old and not worth an expenditure for repairs. This building will accommodate less than one-half of the available pupils from the reserve. The Indians are about equally divided between the United Church and the Roman Catholic denominations. It would not be satisfactory, from the church standpoint, to erect a two-roomed school to accommodate all the children. Therefore, it will be necessary to have separate buildings. At the present time, there are 13 children on this reserve attending Catholic residential schools. A number of the remaining Catholic children do not attend any school, and the few who are enrolled at the school conducted under the auspices of the United Church attend irregularly. The erection of a two-roomed day school building, with living accommodation for teachers and conducted without church control would be the best means of solving the difficulty in providing school facilities for this reserve, but, as stated, there would be objection on the part of the two above named denominations in relinquishing their claims for separate schools for each denomination. In any event, it is necessary that a new school be erected, to replace the present school under the auspices of the United Church, and, if this is done, the Catholic Church authorities would expect a school for the Catholic children.\n\nFORT McLEOD - To complete building for day school purposes - $200.\n\nThere are 28 Indian children at Fort McLeod who have never attended any school. A request has been received, urging that a summer school be conducted. The Indians have agreed to get logs and put up the building, if the Department would assist in providing windows, doors, flooring and finishing materials. The local Agent estimates that the cost would be $200.\n\n- Fort Graham -\nFORT GRAHAME - To complete building for day school purposes - $100.\n\nThere are 47 children of school age at this point. A few have attended the Lejac Indian Residential School, but the majority have never attended school. A request has been made that a summer school be conducted. There is a church building at this point, which, the Agent states, could be improved at much lower cost than erecting a new building for school purposes. The Agent estimates that, for the sum of $100, the quantity of building material could be supplied to fit up the church building - which would provide suitable accommodation for school purposes for a number of years.\n\nCAMPBELL RIVER - To erect new school building - $1,500.\n\nThe Indians have petitioned, during the past three years, for the establishment of a school for the Indian children of the Campbell River Band, Kwawkewlth Agency. The census of the Band shows that there are 35 children on the reserve, 16 of whom are of school age. A few children from this reserve have been in residential schools, but the majority have never attended school. Mr. School Inspector Barry and the Assistant Indian Commissioner have strongly urged the establishment of a school on this reserve. Mr. Perry, Assistant Commissioner, states that a building could be provided at a cost of approximately $1,500, of sufficient size to accommodate 25 children. The United Church authorities have requested that, if a school is established, it be conducted under their auspices - they have a majority on the reserve and nearly all the children are Protestant.\n\nKLETU - To erect new combined school and teacher's residence - 4,000.\n\nThe school on this reserve is being conducted in a very old building, belonging to the Indians. The roof and foundations are in an advanced state of decay and the whole building is leaning over to one side. A request has been received from the United Church authorities, under whose auspices the school is conducted, and from the local Indian Agent, that a modern classroom and teacher's residence be erected. The present building is no longer worth repairing and it will be necessary, if school activities are carried on, that a new building be provided.\nESTIMATES\n\nINDIAN EDUCATION 1935-36\n\nBUILDINGS AND WORKS - RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS\nREPAIRS AND EQUIPMENT\n\nNOVA SCOTIA\n\nSHUBENACADIE (R.C.)\n\nResidence for Assistant Farmer ........ $1,000.\nGeneral Repairs .................. 300. $1,300.\n\nONTARIO\n\nCECILIA JEFFREY (G.E.)\n\nPurchase land for farming purposes .......... 0.000.\nGeneral Repairs to Buildings ........... 300. 9,300.\n\nCHAPLEAU (C.E.)\n\nRaising roof and repairing barn .......... 400.\nGeneral Repairs .................. 300. 700.\n\nFORT FRANCES (R.C.)\n\nSewage disposal system .................. 1,500.\nPainting exterior and interior of building .... 1,400.\nGeneral Repairs and flooring boys' playroom and kitchen ......... 425.\nRepairing and cleaning 4 chimneys .......... 325.\nElectric refrigerator ................. 900. 4,550.\n\nKENORA (R.C.)\n\nRepairs to Dock .................. 150.\nRepairs to Road and Drainage System .......... 800.\nImprovements to heating system ............ 2,000.\nClearing land .................. 500.\nHog pen .................. 900. 5,350.\n\nMcINTOSH (R.C.)\n\nGeneral Repairs, painting, etc. .......... 300.\nRoot Cellar .................. 500.\nBarge for freighting purposes .......... 450. 1,250.\n\nMOOSE FORT (C.E.)\n\nSchool Desks .................. 600.\nGeneral Repairs .................. 200. 800.\n\nMOUNT ELGIN (U.C.)\n\nTo complete third classroom ............ 800.\nRepairs and alterations, interior, main building 20,000. 20,800.\nForward - 42,750.\nESTIMATES\n\nINDIAN EDUCATION - 1935-36\n\nBUILDINGS AND WORKS - RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS\n\nREPAIRS AND EQUIPMENT\n\nONTARIO (concl'd.)\n\nForward - 42,750.\n\nSHINGWAUK HOME (C.E.)\n\nErection outbuildings ........................................... $0,000\n(Principal's residence, Farmer's cottage,\nStock barn, Implement shed, Granary,\nPiggery & ice house)\n\nPurchase 200 acres land ........................................... 4,000.\nFarm Implements .................................................. 250.\nFurnishings for new school building ............................... 6,000.\n\n................................................................. 40,250.\n\nSIOUX LOOKOUT (C.E.)\n\nNew floor in barn and steel fittings for stable .................. 1,150.\nPainting interior, school building ................................. 500.\nFarm Implements .................................................. 500.\nNew batteries for electric light system ............................ 500.\n\nTOTAL - ONTARIO .................................................. 85,650.\n\nMANITOBA\n\nBIRTLE (Presby.)\n\nPaint, only, for interior decoration, school building .......... 200.\nGeneral repairs .................................................. 200.\n\nBRANDON (U.C.)\n\nGeneral Repairs .................................................. 500.\n\nELKJORN (C.E.)\n\nInstallation\nLow pressure boiler and alterations to heating system ........... 8,000.\nNew classroom and playroom building ............................. 10,000.\nElectric refrigerator .............................................. 600.\nGeneral repairs to buildings ..................................... 500.\n\nFORT ALEXANDER (R.C.)\n\nInstalling water purifying system .................................. 3,000.\nRebuilding and alterations, laundry building ...................... 4,000.\n\nForward - 18,000.\nESTIMATES\n\nINDIAN EDUCATION 1935-36\n\nMANITOBA (concl'd.)\n\nNORWAY HOUSE (U.C.)\nLaundry machinery (dryer & mangle) 1,500.\nGeneral repairs, school and residence 500.\n\nPORTAGE LA PRAIRIE (U.C.)\nGeneral repairs 300.\n\nSANDY BAY (R.C.)\nGeneral repairs 400.\n\nTOTAL - MANITOBA 20,700.\n\nSASKATCHEWAN\n\nBEAUVAL (R.C.)\nFurther Amount to reimburse R.C.

There are approximately 40 children for whom no school facilities are provided and who do not attend any school. The present school is situated at the west end of the island - a distance of approximately five miles from where the Indians at the east end of the island reside. An officer of the Department, who visited the reserve in August, last, states that the Indians are anxious for the children to have the advantage of an education but they were unable to have them attend the day school on the west end of the island, owing to the distance. He says this situation is causing unfavourable comment amongst the adjoining white municipalities.\n\nCornwall Island is located in an angle between the boundaries of the province of Ontario and Quebec and the State of New York.\n\nONTARIO\n\nWIKWEMIKONG - Addition to school building, to provide increased living accommodation for teachers - $1,800.\n\nA new two-roomed school building has recently been completed and classes opened therein on the first instant. At the rear, a very narrow part is partitioned off, for living quarters for two teachers. There is insufficient accommodation. It will be necessary to extend the building to provide increased accommodation. No doubt, it will be possible to obtain certain of the material from the old school building, which is to be demolished. The providing of more space for the teachers' living quarters is absolutely necessary.\n\nThis school is located in the village of Wikwemikong, on the Manitoulin Island Unseeded Reserve, Manitoulin Island, Ont.\n\nNETTAGAMI - To assist in erection of school building with rooms attached for living accommodation of teacher - $750.\n\nA request has been received from the Anglican missionary, strongly supported by the local Indian Agent, for school facilities.\nNEW DAY SCHOOL BUILDINGS - ESTIMATES, 1935-36\n(sent'd.)\n\nNETTAGAMI (Consld.)\n\nschool facilities for the Indians residing on this reserve - No. 71, in the Chapleau Indian Agency, province of Ontario. The Indians of the Band have become fairly well established, and the move towards a school would encourage them to remain on the reserve instead of wandering all over the north country, as they have been in the habit of doing for the past number of years. There are 25 children of school age. In the erection of a building, the Indians have agreed to do a great deal of the work themselves, voluntarily, and they propose that a log building be erected, but lumber for flooring and other purposes will be required, together with windows, doors, etc. - which will cost about $750. At present, the children on this reserve are receiving no education.\n\nELIAS - To assist in erection of school building with living accommodation for teacher - $1,200.\n\nOn this reserve - No. 83, on Kapuskasing Lake, in the Chapleau Indian Agency, there are 15 children of school age at the present time, but the number will be increased as soon as the Indians are assured that their children will be able to attend school. The Indians would give labour, voluntarily, in the erection of a building - doing the work under a competent foreman, who would have to be engaged for the purpose. There is no timber suitable for building purposes. The building would be of frame construction and the material will have to be supplied. The probable cost will be about $1,200. There are no educational facilities provided for the Indian children on this reserve.\n\nRABBIT ISLAND - To erect a school building with teacher's living quarters - 4,000.\n\nThe Rabbit Island settlement is located some 7 miles north of the present Wikwemikong Indian Day School and is on the Manitoulin Island Unceded reserve. On this section of the reserve, there are 34 children of school age. The lack of school facilities in this section has necessitated a number of families deserting their farms to live in the village of Wikwemikong. The Indians have been requesting a school for some years, in order that they could live on their farms and at the same time have their children receive an education.\n\nSAGAMOOG - To erect a school building with teacher's living quarters - 4,000.\n\nThe Sagamook Indian Day School has been closed for about 5 years, owing to the fact that it was not properly located. It is on the Spanish River Reserve, No.5,\nThese Indian agency. The Indians do not reside in the vicinity. Requests have been made for the erection of a new school at a more central point. A proposal has been submitted to the Department from time to time, that the old school building be torn down and any lumber that would be of service transported to the new site and used in the erection of a new school. The Indians would, no doubt, do part of the labour, voluntarily. It would be necessary to supply the building materials. There is need of a school for the Indian children, who are growing up wild, without education. The Agent and the Church Authorities request that a new school be erected next summer. There are 20 children of school age.\n\n**CHRISTIAN ISLAND** - To erect new school building with teacher's living quarters for R.C. Indian children - $6,000.\n\nThis school, on Christian Island reserve, No. 30, was opened last September, at the urgent demands of the Roman Catholic Church authorities (Jesuit Order) and is being conducted, temporarily, in the church building. It will be necessary to erect a school building with living quarters for the teacher. There are approximately 30 Roman Catholic Indian children of school age who can attend. The present arrangement for carrying on the work in the church is unsatisfactory and a new building, with classroom accommodation and teacher's living quarters, is needed.\n\n**SASKATCHEWAN**\n\n**WHITE BEAR'S** - (Moose Mountain Agency)\n\nTo erect two-roomed school building with living quarters for two teachers - $8,000.\n\nThe building at present in use for day school purposes is so old that it is not worth an expenditure for repairs. It is not centrally located and will accommodate less than one-half of the available pupils from the reserve. This school is conducted under the auspices of the United Church of Canada. The Indians are about equally divided between the United Church and the Roman Catholic denominations. At present, there are 15 children from this reserve attending Catholic residential schools. A number of the remaining Catholic children do not attend any school and the few enrolled at the United Church day school attend irregularly.\n\nMr. Inspector Murison and the local Indian Agent report that a two-roomed day school building, to provide classroom accommodation for 75 children and living quarters for two teachers, should be erected, at a more central point. The school should be conducted without church control, and if this were done, it would solve the difficulty in providing ample school facilities for this reserve. No doubt, there would be objection on the part of the two above named denominations in relinquishing their claims for a separate school for each denomination. In any event, it is necessary\nthat a new school be erected, to replace the present building. It would involve less expense to erect a two-roomed school and conduct it in future as an undenominational school, solely under the control of the Department, rather than erect two separate buildings and provide their maintenance costs. There are 75 children of school age on this reserve.\n\nBRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nFORT MCLEOD - To complete building for day school purposes - $200.\n\nThere are 38 Indian children at Fort McLeod who have never attended any school. A request has been received, urging that a summer school be conducted. The Indians have agreed to get logs and put up the building, if the Department would assist in providing windows, doors, flooring and finishing materials. The local Agent estimates that the cost would be $200.\n\nFORT GRAHAM - To complete building for day school purposes - 100.\n\nThere are 47 children of school age at this point. A few have attended the Lajac Indian Residential School, but the majority have never attended school. A request has been made that a summer school be conducted. There is a church building at this point, which, the Agent states, could be improved at much lower cost than erecting a new building for school purposes. The Agent estimates that, for the sum of $100, the quantity of building material could be supplied to fit up the church building\u2014which would provide suitable accommodation for school purposes for a number of years.\n\nCAMPBELL RIVER - To erect new school building - 1,500.\n\nDuring the past three years, the Indians have petitioned for the establishment of a school for the Indian children of the Campbell River Band, Kwawkweith Agency. The census of the Band shows that there are 36 children on the reserve, 16 of whom are of school age. A few children from this reserve have been in residential schools, but the majority have never attended school. Mr. School Inspector Barry and the Assistant Indian Commissioner have strongly urged the establishment of a school on this reserve. Mr. Parry, Assistant Commissioner, states that a building could be provided at a cost of approximately $1,500, of sufficient size to accommodate 36 children. The United Church authorities have requested that, if a school is established, it be conducted under their auspices\u2014they have a majority on the reserve and nearly all the children are Protestant.\n\n- KLENTU\nNEW DAY SCHOOL BUILDINGS - ESTIMATES, 1935-36\n(concl'd.)\n\nITEM XII - Repairs to Building $300.\n\nThe school on this reserve is being conducted in a very old building, belonging to the Indians. The roof and foundations are in an advanced state of decay and the whole building is leaning over to one side. A request has been received from the United Church authorities, under whose auspices the school is conducted, and from the local Indian Agent, that the urgent repairs be carried out. This would place the building in condition to make it serviceable for a number of years.\nESTIMATES\nINDIAN EDUCATION - 1935-36\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS,\nBUILDINGS, REPAIRS AND EQUIPMENT, 1935-36\n\nEXPLANATION OF INCREASE:\n\nAMOUNT REQUIRED, FISCAL YEAR 1935-36 - $145,895.00\nAMOUNT PROVIDED, \" 1934-35 - $7,895.00\nINCREASE: - $8,000.00\n\nDuring the past four years, owing to reduced Appropriation, only the minimum repairs to Residential School buildings were carried out. Consequently, at each school extensive repairs are urgently required if the buildings and plant are to be maintained in at least fair condition. No extensive repairs have been made to buildings and little equipment provided during the period mentioned. The school managements are experiencing considerable difficulty in their work in carrying on with equipment needing replacement or repair. Requests from Principals, Inspectors, Agents and Church Authorities emphasize the need of extensive repairs to buildings and the renewing of equipment.

It was necessary to admit six extra orphan and neglected children. This school is located near the Cecilia Jeffrey (Presbyterian) Residential School, which is allowed\nfor 145 pupils. There are more Catholic children in the Kenora agency than the Kenora Residential School can accommodate. The number for which an increase in grant is now requested, viz.: 82 pupils, is the full number the school can accommodate. The six extra pupils now in residence over the number provided for in our Estimates were taken in by the Principal at the request of the Department, as they were neglected children. I beg to recommend that grant be provided for 6 extra pupils.\n\nSPANISH (R.C.)\n\nGrant is requested for an increase of 20 pupils. At present, grant is provided for 230 pupils at $160 per capita. There are now 250 children enrolled. This is the only Roman Catholic Residential School in Ontario, east of Sault Ste. Marie. There are many urgent requests to provide for orphan and neglected children from Caughnawaga, St. Regis and the reserves, in Quebec. It has been necessary to place them in this school and allow grant as supernumerary pupils. There is ample accommodation, and I would request that provision be made in the Estimates for the coming fiscal year for an increase of 20 in the pupilage. There is ample accommodation for 250 children at this school.\n\nSHINGWAUK HOME (C. of E.)\n\nA new residential school building is in course of erection and will likely be completed early next Spring, to provide accommodation for 125 pupils. The present Estimates provide a grant for 100 pupils only. There are requests from the various reserves in Ontario and Quebec for the admission of orphan and neglected children of the Anglican Church to this school, and there will be a sufficient number of pupils available to fill the new school to capacity. I would suggest that provision be made in our Estimates for the coming fiscal year for an increase of 25 pupils.\n\nBRANDON (U. C.)\n\nThe Principal has requested that the pupilage at this school be increased by five, i.e., 170 instead of 165, as at present. There is ample accommodation for the increased pupilage. Requests received by the Principal from agents and parents indicate that a total of 170 pupils will be available. In some cases, the Principal has had to refuse admissions, as he had an enrolment up to the full number for which grant was provided. I submit the request for provision of grant for 170 pupils for your consideration and direction.\n\nROUND LAKE (U. C.)\n\nThe church authorities and the local Indian Agent have requested that grant be provided for an increase of 5 pupils. The dormitories provide accommodation for 40 boys and 40 girls, and this number of pupils are available from the reserves in the Crooked Lake agency. At present, grant is allowed for 75 pupils. This request is submitted for your consideration and instructions, whether the increase asked for be provided.\n\n- Morley\nPlans are under way for the building of an addition to this school, to provide accommodation for 100 pupils. At present, grant is only provided for 70 pupils. As the addition will, no doubt, be completed early next Spring and as there are a sufficient number of children available on the Stony reserve to fill the school, I would recommend that provision be made in the Estimates for the coming fiscal year for an increase of 25 in the pupilage. This will provide a grant for a total of 100 pupils at this school.\n\nST. BERNARD'S (R.C.)\n\nHis Lordship Bishop Guy has urged that grant be provided for an increase of 25 in the pupilage at this school. At present, grant is provided for 75 pupils. His Lordship wishes this to be increased to provide for 100. The parents of the children are hunting Indians, and the school management is called upon to accept their children when the parents are absent. Bishop Guy states that there is ample accommodation for 100 children in the school. This request is submitted for your consideration and direction.\n\nWABASCA (R.C.)\n\nBishop Guy has requested grant for 25 extra pupils at this school. At present grant is provided for 100. The same reasons apply as in the case of the St. Bernard's School, mentioned above. His Lordship states there is accommodation for 125 pupils, and this number are available. I would ask your direction as to whether the increased pupilage, as requested by Bishop Guy, in the case of this school be provided.\n\nALERT RAY (C.E.)\n\nThe Missionary Society of the Church of England, under whose auspices this school is conducted; the Principal and the local Indian Agent have requested that provision be made for an increase of 10 in the pupilage. At present, provision is made for 200 pupils. The school has already the increased number of pupils in residence - there being sufficient space and accommodation for them. The local agents have many requests to place children of indigent parents, and they frequently request the Principal to take in cases of special emergency. During the past two years, this school has been handling several pupils over the number for which grant is provided. I beg to recommend that provision be made for an increase of 10 in the pupilage, providing a grant for a total of 210 pupils.\n\nLEJAC (R.C.)\n\nRequests have been received, during the past two years, for an increase in pupilage at this school. A new principal was appointed last April, and he and the local Indian Agent state that there is accommodation for 25 pupils more than the number for which grant is provided. The Indian Agent states that the new Principal has put new spirit into this school. It is requested that at least 15 extra pupils be allowed. The\nAgent says the parents of the children uphold the school and there is a large number of Roman Catholic Indian children in British Columbia from which recruits can be obtained. There is no difficulty in keeping this school to its full accommodation. I would recommend, for your approval, that grant be provided for 15 extra pupils, making the total number for which grant is allowed 165.\n\nST. MARY'S (R.C.)\n\nDuring last year, the church authorities who own the buildings at this school carried out alterations, repairs and extensions and can provide accommodation for 200 children. At present, grant is provided in our Estimates for 125 pupils. The Principal, who has visited the Department, has strongly urged that a grant be provided for a total of 200 children. Last year, in view of the alterations made to the building, the grant at this school was increased from 107 to 125 pupils. There are 160 children at present in the school. The Principal states he was forced to accept this extra number and that there is easily available the full number of pupils, viz.: 200, for which accommodation can be provided. I would request your favourable consideration for increasing the pupilage by at least 50, if you consider it not advisable to provide the increase asked for, viz.: 75 pupils, in our Estimates for the next fiscal year.\n\nAs shown by the figures in the summary above, it would require, approximately, the sum of $34,650.25 to provide for the increased pupilage asked for by the church authorities, principals and agents for the above mentioned schools. This would require an increase in our Appropriation for Per Capita Grants over that provided last year.\n\nI might say, further, that the church authorities have requested that at least part of the 15% in grants be restored. I should be pleased to have your direction as to whether, in preparing our Estimates, the deduction of 15% be continued.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nDecember 21, 1934.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nAs you are aware, the Minister directed that the sum of $10,000 be transferred from the appropriation \"Tuition, Indian Children, High Schools and White Schools\", to \"Per Capita Grants, Residential Schools\". It will therefore be necessary to appropriate this amount among the residential schools, and I would beg to suggest that this be done by providing for an increased pupilage at a number of schools, as follows:\n\n| School                  | Increase | Pupils | Cost |\n|-------------------------|----------|--------|------|\n| Brandon (U.C.)          |          |        | $825.00 |\n| Cowessess (R.C.)        |          | 5      | $825.00 |\n| Hay River (C.of E.)     |          | 15     | $3,000.00 |\n| St. Bernard's (R.C.)    |          | 10     | $1,750.00 |\n| Wabasca (R.C.)          |          | 10     | $1,800.00 |\n| St. Mary's (R.C.)       |          | 15     | $2,700.00 |\n\nTotal: $10,900.00\n\nLess 5%: $545.00\n\nVoted at 94%: $10,345.00\n\n$9,724.30\n\nI would appreciate your concurrence in the above.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nO'Brien Lake R.C. minus 10 pupils\nfrom 110 to 120 = $1620\nClosed Dec-1934\nSee 1.1.5a\nPersonal\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(RG 10, Volume 6011)\n\nFile 1-1-5, part 1\nHeadquarters - School Buildings - General.\n(PERSONAL). 1908 - 1934\n\nFile 1-1-5A, part 1\nHeadquarters - School Buildings - General.\n(PERSONAL). 1931 - 1934\n\nFile 1-1-5A, part 2\nHeadquarters - School Buildings - General.\n1935 - 1948\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nGeneral\n\nSchool Buildings\nFebruary 20, 1935.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nI submit the following schedule of Buildings and Works, in the order of their importance, to be included in any extension of the Public Works Construction Appropriation:\n\nSturgeon Lake and St. Bernard's - These schools are located in the Lesser Slave Lake Residential Schools Agency, Alberta, Federal District of Peace River. They are not on reserves. It is proposed to amalgamate the two above named schools and erect a new residential school building of fireproof construction - to accommodate 200 children - to replace the present old buildings, which have outlived their usefulness. The new building will be erected on a central site, near transportation facilities, and will accommodate the Roman Catholic Indian children from both these points.\n\nWabasca (C.E.) and Whitefish Lake (C.E.) - These schools are located in the Lesser Slave Lake Residential Schools Agency - Federal District of Athabaska and Peace River, respectively. It is proposed to erect a new residential school building, on a central site, to replace the present old buildings at the above schools. The buildings at these points have outlived their usefulness. The new building is to accommodate the children of the Anglican Church in the Lesser Slave Lake agency and will be conducted under the auspices of that denomination.\n\nThunderchild (R.C.) - To install water supply system $15,000.\n\nThis school is situated at Delmas, Sask., Battleford Indian Agency (Federal District of South Battleford). It is intended to improve a spring, install pumping equipment and a pipe-line a distance of approximately one mile, to provide an ample supply of water for use of the above school.\n\nSt. Philips (R.C.) - To install electric power line $5,500.\n\nIn order to provide electric power service for school use, it is intended to install a power line, a distance of approximately 6 miles, from the nearest source of supply.

Ont. - To erect a new school building, with two classrooms, to provide seating accommodation in each for 30 pupils and also living quarters for two teachers, for the Protestant Indian children on the Christian Island Reserve, No. 30 - Federal District of Simcoe East. The present building is unsuitable for school purposes and does not accommodate the Indian children available. At the present time, it is necessary to have the second classroom in the council hall. It is also difficult to obtain suitable living accommodation for teachers. It would be necessary to provide adequate heating facilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $740\n\nOneida No. 1, Ont. - To erect a new school building with classroom accommodation for 40 pupils and teacher's living quarters, also adequate heating facilities.

ALLEN,\n\nUpon telephone instructions from the Deputy Superintendent General, I beg to advise that a further amount of $67,000.00 will be required to be included in the Supplementary Estimates, 1935-36, to provide for a further increase of five per cent. in the Per Capita Grants to Indian Residential Schools.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note: Poor Copy]\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nSUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES 1935-36\n\nGENERAL VOTE\nFurther amount required ........................................ $133,000.\n\nExplanation\n\nIndian Education\nTo provide for -\n\n(a) Final payment towards cost of construction\nof the Beauval Indian Residential School .. $40,000.\n\n(b) Furnishings for Indian Residential\nSchools erected from funds provided\nunder Public Works Construction Act.\nShingwauk Home $16,000.\nQu'Appelle School 28,000.\nMorley \" 3,000. 47,000. $67,000.\n\nMedical Services\nTo provide for -\n\nFurnishings and Equipment for the\nfollowing buildings erected from\nfunds provided under Public Works\nConstruction Act.\nQu'Appelle Hospital $17,500.\nMorley Health Unit 3,500. 21,000. 21,000.\n\nAids to Indians\nTo provide for -\n\nConstruction of thirty new houses\nfor Indian families forced to move\nthrough raising of water level of\nLac Seul.

This will result in flooding certain Indian Reserve lands to a depth of 14 feet.\n\nIt therefore becomes necessary to re-establish thirty Indian families on higher ground during the present year.\n\nIt is not considered feasible, owing to their condition, to move the houses which these families now occupy. Consequently, new houses will have to be constructed.\n\nAccording to plans and estimates prepared, each of these houses will cost in the neighbourhood of $850.00. Therefore, at least $25,000.00 will be required for this purpose.\n\nThe actual expenditure incurred will be included in this Department's claim for compensation under the provisions of the Lac Seul Conservation Act, passed on June 11th, 1928.\nSpecial Item\n\nTo provide for payment of the Six Nations Indians' claim for funds and lands taken from them in connection with the canal and works of the Grand River Navigation Company incorporated 1832 by an Act of the Legislature of the Province of Upper Canada .................. $ 215,109.\n\nExplanation\n\nCash paid out of funds of the Six Nations Indians on stock in the Grand River Navigation Company .......... $ 160,000.\n\nValue in 1832 of 365 7/10 acres of land granted the said Company without consideration at $40.00 per acre ........................................... 14,748.\n\nOther lands granted Company, without consideration, 182\u00bd acres in 1832 at $10.00 per acre ................. 1,825.\n\nLands permanently flooded by works of Welland Canal, amounting in 1837 to 1826 8/10 acres at $20.00 per acre. 36,536.\n\n$ 215,109.\n\nFunds of the Six Nations Indians, to the amount of $160,000., were invested by the Government in the Grand River Navigation Company without the knowledge or consent of the Indians, and were entirely lost.\n\nThe lands granted to the Grand River Navigation Company were to be paid for but this was never done nor was compensation ever paid for the lands permanently flooded in connection with this scheme.\nIndian Education\n\nBeauval Indian Residential School ($40,000.00)\n\nThe Beauval Indian Residential School, conducted under the auspices of the Oblate Order and located in northern Saskatchewan, was totally destroyed by fire on September 19th, 1927. The church authorities erected a new building, to accommodate one hundred pupils, during the years 1928 and 1930. The total cost incurred by the church authorities in the erection of the building was $133,763.56. Reimbursement has been made by the Department to the amount of $33,763.56. His Lordship Right Reverend M. Lajeunesse, O.M.I., Vicar Apostolic of Keewatin, has urged, on behalf of the Oblate Order, for a final payment of the above amount, in full settlement of the cost incurred in the erection of the building.\n\nShingwauk Indian Residential School, Sault Ste.

Of this amount, the sum of $1,561,225, or 79% of the total appropriation, is fixed charges, viz.:-\n\nPer Capita Grants - $1,286,925.\nSalaries, Teachers, Janitors, Truant Officers, Night Watchmen, etc. - $274,300.\nTotal - $1,561,225.\n\nFrom the above, it will be seen that only the sum of $408,775 remains, to provide the cost of the erection of five day schools, repairs, alterations, equipment, fuel, classroom supplies and equipment, travelling expenses, freight, and miscellaneous expenditures.\n\nThe total expenditure for Indian Education, to October 31st, 1935, was $1,150,546.78, leaving the sum of $729,453.22 to cover the expenditures for five months - the balance of the present fiscal year.\n\nFrom the above balance on hand, there will be required, to meet all commitments for the balance of the present fiscal year, as follows:-\n\nPer Capita Grants - $321,700.\nSalaries - $114,300.\nBuildings, Repairs & Equipment - $150,000.\nSupplies, Fuel, Stationery - $50,000.\nTravelling Expenses of pupils and Tuition Grants - $20,000.\nMiscellaneous and Unforeseen - $90,000.\nTotal - $746,000.\n\nCommitments which have already been made cannot be altered. The work on construction of new day school buildings is practically completed, as is, also, the work in connection with the carrying out of repairs, alterations, improvements and the supplying of equipment.\n\nIt may, therefore, be possible to save an unexpended balance from the Appropriation for Indian Education, to the amount of, approximately, $43,000.00.\n\nActing Supt. of Indian

McGill,\n\nWith reference to the letter from the Honourable the Minister of Finance, of the 29th ultimo, dealing with control of expenditure, I attach hereto a statement, giving the following information as regards the Appropriation for Indian Education, 1935-36:\n\n1. Amount and details of each sub-allotment.\n2. Amount encumbered to October 31, 1935.\n3. Amount of expenditure from each sub-allotment, to October 31, 1935.\n4. Estimated further amount required to meet all expenditures to March 31, 1936.\n5. Estimated amount of Appropriation of the various sub-allotments not required.\n\nFrom the statement, it will be seen that the estimated amount that will not be required to meet all expenditures for Indian Education for the current fiscal year will be $41,000. However, I may say that the Department could use this amount in paying advances on per capita grant for the quarter ending March 31st, next.\n\nThe total amount provided in the Main Estimates was:\nSupplementary Estimates - $1,846,000.\nTotal: - $2,000,000.\n\nFrom the above, only the amount of $1,952,114 has been assigned by the Treasury Department, being a decreased amount of $47,886. This amount, together with the estimated amount that will not be required, as shown by the statement attached, will make a total of approximately $88,000 of the Appropriation for Indian Education which, it is possible, may not be required.\n\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\nMINISTER OF FINANCE\nCanada\n\nOttawa, November 13, 1935.\n\nMy dear Colleague,\n\nWill you kindly take the necessary steps to ensure that the 1936-37 estimates for services under your direction are prepared at once. As you know, our present financial position demands we strive to balance income and outgo and to eliminate duplications of effort and services. In view of his relations with the Departments, and the experience gained in the past three and a half years, the Comptroller of the Treasury, acting under instructions, is making studies for the foregoing purposes, and will discuss with departmental officers their proposals before they reach your desk. Might I, therefore, suggest you give instructions that, when your officers submit final drafts for your decision, these be accompanied by copies of any comments the Comptroller has filed with them.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Signed) Chas. A.Dunning\n\nThe Honourable T.A.Crerar,\nMinister of Mines,\nOTTAWA.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMrs. Sutherland\n\nI attach for your information a copy of a letter from the Minister of Finance, dated November 13th, which has been forwarded for attention by our Minister.\n\nActing Purchasing Agent.\n\nNov. 15th., 1935.\nESTIMATES\n\nINDIAN EDUCATION 1936-37\n\nBUILDINGS AND WORKS -

The Indians have been requesting a school for some years, in order that they could live on their farms and at the same time have their children receive an education.\n\nMETAGAMI\n\nTo assist in erection of school building, with rooms attached for living accommodation of teacher ... 1,500.00\n\nThe Anglican Church authorities, strongly supported by the local Indian Agent, have requested that school facilities be provided for the Indians residing on this reserve (No. 71, in the Chapleau Indian Agency, Province of Ontario. The Indians of the Band have become fairly well established, and the move towards a school would encourage\n\n$15,000.00\n\nForward ... $15,000.00\nESTIMATES\n\nINDIAN EDUCATION 1936-37\n\nNEW BUILDINGS - DAY SCHOOLS\n\nONTARIO - continued\n\nForward . . . . . 15,000.00\n\nMETAGAMI - continued\n\nencourage them to remain on the reserve, instead of wandering all over the north country, as they have been in the habit of doing for the past number of years. There are 25 children of school age. In the erection of a building, the Indians have agreed to do a great deal of the work, themselves, voluntarily. At present the children on this reserve are receiving no education.\n\nSEINE RIVER\n\nTo erect school building with teacher's living quarters . . . . . 2,500.00\n\nThis school would be located on the Seine River, Reserve No. 23A, Fort Frances Indian Agency, (Electoral District of Kenora-Rainy River) Ont. There are approximately 35 children of school age, for whom no educational facilities are provided and who do not attend school. The Indian Agent has requested, during the past three years, that a school building be erected. The Chief and members of the Band, also, have been urging the establishment of school facilities for their children. The Indian Agent, in a recent communication, states as follows: \"I have been asking that a day school be built on this reserve for the last three years. I hope that, next year, we may be able to erect a school. I will have a hard time in explaining to the Indians why their reserve cannot have a school.\" The Agent states that a building of an inexpensive type, 20' x 30', would be satisfactory - the outside to be shiplap, paper and siding. The building could be erected by the Indians, under the charge of a competent foreman-carpenter.\n\nMUD LAKE\n\nTo erect two-roomed day school building . . . . . $4,000.00\n\nThis school is situated on the Mud Lake Reserve, No. 35, Electoral District of Peterborough West.

Cloakrooms and adequate heating facilities will also be required.\n\nONEIDA NO. 1.\n\nTo erect new school building with teacher's living quarters . . . . . . 7,000.00\n\nThere are at present two schools on the Oneida reserve, No. 41, in the Caradoc Indian agency - Electoral District of Middlesex West. There are approximately 230 children of school age on the reserve. There is urgent need for further school facilities, as there are a large number of children who do not attend any school. The local Indian Agent has been requesting further school facilities for this reserve for some time.\n\nNEW CREDIT\n\nTo erect two-roomed school building with living accommodation for two teachers . . . . . . 8,500.00\n\nThis school is located on the New Credit Indian reserve, No. 40A, in the New Credit Indian agency - Electoral District of Haldimand. The school building at this point was destroyed by fire a few years ago, and, since that time, classes have been conducted in the council hall. The members of the Band have repeatedly asked that a new school be erected, having two classrooms with accommodation for thirty pupils in each, and also that living quarters be provided for two teachers, as it is difficult to obtain suitable boarding accommodation in the neighbourhood. Outdoor toilets and heating facilities would also be necessary.\n\nTOTAL, ONTARIO . . . $40,000.00\nESTIMATES\n\nINDIAN EDUCATION 1936-37\n\nNEW BUILDINGS - DAY SCHOOLS\n\nMANITOBRA\n\nPOPLAR RIVER\n\nTo erect new school building . . . . . . . . . $3,000.00\n\nThis school is situated on the Poplar River Reserve No. 16, Clansboye Agency (Electoral District of Springfield), Man. There are forty (40) children of school age on the reserve. The Agent reports as follows regarding the condition of the present building: \"The log foundation has rotted and the walls have bulged. The lumber construction was a rather poor erection in the first place, as the lumber dried out to such an extent as to render the building no longer weather-proof in severe weather, and in extreme cold or windy weather it is impossible to heat the building. . . . The present building is beyond repair.\"\n\nThe Agent recommends that a new building, of frame construction, with classroom accommodation for 40 children, be erected. The work can be carried out by Indian labour, in charge of a competent foreman-carpenter. The Agent strongly urges the erection of a new building during the coming summer.\n\nDEER LAKE (U.C.)\n\nTo erect log building with lean-to addition for teacher's living quarters . . . 1,200.00\n\nThe Deer Lake Band reside at Sandy Lake, located in that part of the Clansboye agency in the province of Ontario. Sandy Lake is situated approximately 360 miles north of Sioux Lookout. No reserve has been surveyed or set aside for these Indians. This Band is one of the largest and most self-sustaining in the agency. There are no school facilities provided and the Indians are anxious to have their children receive an education. There are approximately 100 children of school age. Requests have been received from missionaries and representatives of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church for the establishment of a school. The Agent states that a building 25' x 30', with a lean-to 15' x 22' would be sufficiently large to accommodate the children and house the teacher. The building would be of log construction and the Indians would do all the work, if rations were supplied them. The Agent states that he is sure the cost would not exceed $1,200.\n\nForward: . . . . . $4,200.00\nESTIMATES\nINDIAN EDUCATION 1936-37\n\nNEW BUILDINGS - DAY SCHOOLS - continued\n\nMANITOBA - continued $4,200.00\n\nUPON GASHING\n\nTo erect school building with living quarters for teacher . . . . . . . . $1,200.00\n\nUpon Gashing is an Indian settlement located on an island about miles north east of the Little Grand Rapids Reserve, No. 14, Glendybaye agency. These Indians are members of the Little Grand Rapids Band. They have had their homes on this island for many years and are the most prosperous families of the Band. They reside permanently in this place and the Agent states that they will continue to do so, indefinitely, because of the fact that there is plenty of hunting and fishing - more than on their own reserve. There are 30 children of school age, who have never been in school. The Indians would do the work of erecting a log building, if they were provided with an allowance for finishing materials, freighting and rations. A petition was recently received from these Indians for the establishment of a school.\n\nTOTAL, MANITOBA . . . . $5,400.00\n\nSASKATCHEWAN\n\nMONTREAL LAKE (C.Ea)\n\nTo erect teacher's residence . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,800.00\n\nThis school is located on the Montreal Lake Reserve, No. 106, Carlton Agency - (Electoral District of Prince Albert). The teacher is residing in a small shack, which is the property of the Anglican Church. This building is in a poor state of repair and has very limited accommodation. The Agent reports that this house is not fit for any person to live in, and Mr. Inspector Burison and himself have strongly urged the providing of a suitable residence for the teacher. His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan also has requested that a suitable building be provided. It will not likely be possible to retain the services of a teacher under present living conditions.\n\nABTAKAKOOPS (C. of E.) - To erect school building . . . . . . . . 3,500.00\n\nThis school is located on the Abtakakoops (Sandy Lake) Reserve, No. 104, Carlton Agency (Electoral District of Prince Albert).

There is an Indian population of over 400 on the reserve, with approximately 75 of school age. A new two-roomed school building is required. The work in erecting the building could be carried out by Indian carpenters, under a white foreman.

His Lordship the Bishop of Calgary has strongly urged that increased accommodation be provided. The present building accommodates 75 children, and there are a further number of Roman Catholic children on the reserve for whom it is necessary to provide school facilities. Mr. Inspector Christianson and the local Indian Agent both endorse the erection of an addition to the present building. It is proposed to build two wings, which will provide dormitories, chapel, and a laundry and boiler room; also to make some alterations in the present buildings.\n\nWhitefish Lake (C.R.) - To erect new school building $40,000.\n\nA new residential school building is required, to provide accommodation for 80 pupils, at Whitefish Lake (Utikoomak Lake Reserve, No. 165), Lesser Slave Lake Indian Agency, northern Alberta, to replace the present old residential school building at this point, and also the residential school building on the Wabasca Reserve, No. 166. The present buildings at these points have become unfit for use, are dilapidated and beyond repair and a menace to the health of the pupils. These schools are conducted under the auspices of the Church of England. The erection of a new modern school building will meet the needs at both points and provide school facilities for all pupils of the Anglican faith in the Lesser Slave Lake agency.\n\nTOTAL, RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL NEW BUILDINGS $90,000.\n| Schools                  | Details                                                                 | New   | Maint'ce. & Repairs |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|---------------------|\n| Nova Scotia              |                                                                         |       |                     |\n| Shubenacadie (R.C.)      | General repairs and painting                                            | $     | $ 400               |\n| Ontario                  |                                                                         |       |                     |\n| Cecilia Jeffrey (Pres.)  | Extension, sewage disposal system                                       | 500   |                     |\n|                          | Painting exterior and interior, main building                           |       |                     |\n| Chapleau (C.E.)          | Repairs to electrical equipment, motors, pumping and heating plant, and re-wiring barn |       | 1,000               |\n|                          | Painting interior and exterior of buildings                             |       | 500                 |\n| Fort Frances (R.C.)      | Installing sewage disposal system                                       | 3,600 |                     |\n|                          | General repairs                                                          |       | 300                 |\n| Kenora (R.C.)            | Repairs to verandah                                                     |       | 250                 |\n|                          | Enlarging storehouse                                                    |       | 600                 |\n| Moose Port (C.E.)        | Miscellaneous repairs                                                    |       | 300                 |\n| Mount Elgin (U.C.)       | Water supply, sewage disposal system and general repairs                 |       | 5,000               |\n| Shingwauk (C.E.)         | Residence for Principal                                                 |       | 7,500               |\n| Sioux Lookout (C.E.)     | Erecting Silo                                                           |       | 625                 |\n|                          | To complete barn and root-house                                         |       | 500                 |\n| Manitoba                 |                                                                         |       |                     |\n| Birtle (Pres.)           | Painting and miscellaneous repairs                                       |       | 500                 |\n| Brandon (U.C.)           | Building retaining wall to prevent flooding, rear of school             |       | 500                 |\n|                          | Painting barns and outbuildings and interior decorating of school       |       | 400                 |\n|                          | Erecting chicken house                                                  |       | 350                 |\n| Schools          | Details                                                                 | New   | Maint'ce & Repairs |\n|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|--------------------|\n| **Manitoba (cont'd.)** |                                                                         |       |                    |\n| Elkhorn (C.E.)   | Low pressure boiler 10' heating system                                  |       |                    |\n|                  | Miscellaneous repairs                                                   | 400.  |                    |\n| Ft.

For the fiscal year 1933-34, per capita grants were further decreased by 5%, making a total deduction of 15%. Ten per cent. of the cut in the per capita grants was restored in the Estimates for the fiscal year 1935-36. In the cutting of the per capita grant by 10% in the Appropriation for 1936-37, it will reduce the rate to the same as was paid during the fiscal year 1934-35. The church authorities under whose auspices the residential schools are conducted, made a strong demand for the restoration of the 15% deduction in per capita grants, and the previous administration agreed to a restoration of only 10%. In preparing the Estimates for the fiscal year 1936-37, the grants were calculated on that basis - this being, as stated, the same rate as was paid during the current\nthe current fiscal year. There will, no doubt, be very strong objection made, on the part of the church authorities, to a cut in grants at the present time; but this will be entirely necessary if the Appropriation for the fiscal year, 1936-37, is to be reduced as requested.\n\nGrants - Tuition Deduction $5,000.00\n\nThis will leave the amount requested in the Appropriation for 1936-37 at the same rate as was provided during the fiscal year 1935-36. Each year, more Indian children are passing their Entrance to high schools and are anxious to obtain a higher education. There are many demands, and it has been necessary to set a fairly high standard before any pupil is allowed a grant. Besides, there are more Indian children attending white schools in cases where the Department has no facilities provided. In the Estimates for 1934-35, the sum of $30,000.00 was provided for tuition grants, but this was cut in the current year's appropriation to $25,000.00. By reducing the amount asked for in the Estimates for 1936-37, it will mean that a number of deserving pupils will be deprived of the opportunity to obtain a higher education than our Indian day schools provide.\n\nAssistance to Ex-pupils Deduction $2,400.00\n\nIn the past, very little provision has been made to assist pupils of residential schools after they graduate. It is a difficult problem to know what to do with these pupils when they return to their reserves. In cases where they marry and take up farming and housekeeping on their own account, the Department has provided a small grant to the man, to assist him in building a house, and to the woman in supplying household equipment. There are many demands to increase the assistance to our ex-pupils in becoming established on their reserves; and it has been only through lack of funds that greater assistance has not been given the ex-pupils. The time has arrived when very serious consideration will have to be given to the problem of establishing ex-pupils on their reserves.\n\nGrants - Fall Fairs Deduction $100.00\n\nThis grant was given to encourage pupils of Indian day schools to carry out home gardening for the boys and sewing, cooking and general household duties for the girls. Fall fairs are held on a number of the reserves and small grants awarded for prizes in the various classes of the exhibits. From the appropriation provided, the Department is unable to meet the requests for grants for prizes for these school fairs.\n\n- New Buildings -\nNew Buildings - Residential Schools\n\nDeduction $90,000.00\n\nThis amount was to erect an addition to the present Crowfoot R. C. Residential School building, on the Blackfoot reserve ($50,000) and to erect a new residential school building at Whitefish Lake, Lesser Slave Lake agency, northern Alberta ($40,000).\n\nThe present building at the Crowfoot Residential School accommodates 75 children, and there are 30 children on the reserve for whom no school facilities are available. It was intended to erect an addition and make alterations in the present building, to provide for the accommodation of these children and also to provide facilities for the tubercular pupils. At present, there are 18 pupils of this school who are afflicted with active tuberculosis. By not providing the funds required to erect the addition and make alterations in the present building, it will result in a very serious menace to the health of the children at present in the school, and about 30 children will be deprived of educational facilities. This school is conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nThe present old residential school buildings at Whitefish Lake and Wabasca, in the Lesser Slave Lake agency, are dilapidated and beyond repair. They have become unfit for use and are a menace to the health of the pupils. It is intended to amalgamate these two schools by the erection of a new modern school building on the Whitefish Lake reserve. It was proposed to forward building material and prepare a foundation during the winter of 1936-37, as all materials have to be forwarded by sleigh. If the work is not proceeded with, it may be necessary, in the interests of the children's health, to close both present buildings and send the children to their homes, pending the erection of a new building. The Church of England authorities, under whom this school is conducted, have, during the past several years, strongly urged the erection of a new building, to accommodate 80 children.\n\nNew Works - Residential Schools\n\nDeduction $13,000.00\n\nThe above amount was to provide new out-buildings at several of the Indian residential schools. While there is need for these buildings, the schools at which they were to be erected will have to carry on the work under present conditions.\n\n- New Buildings Day\nNew Buildings - Day Schools\n\nDeduction $60,700.\n\nIt was intended to erect 13 new day school buildings, 6 of which were to replace present old buildings and 7 to establish new schools on reserves where there are at present no educational facilities provided. It was also intended to erect one teacher's residence, to provide living accommodation for a teacher. While there is necessity for the erection of new buildings, where they have been hanging on, on a number of reserves, without educational facilities, the children can continue to do without schooling. Where it was intended to erect new buildings, to replace the present ones, the work will have to be carried on under existing conditions.\n\nRepairs - Residential Schools\n\nDeduction $4,000.\n\nWhile the repairs covered by the above amount are necessary, the schools at which it was intended to do the work can manage without the repairs being carried out until such time as it is possible to provide the funds for the purpose.\nApril 30, 1936.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. ORR,-\n\nThe Main Estimates for Indian Education for the fiscal year 1936-37 provide the sum of $5,000.00 for water supply, sewage disposal system and general repairs at the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School. The authorities of the United Church are very anxious that the work in regard to the sewage disposal system be completed this coming summer. I would suggest that you undertake the necessary arrangements to have the work mentioned above carried out. The sum stated is the full amount that will be available for any work undertaken at this school during the present fiscal year.\nApril 30, 1936.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. ORR,-\n\nThe Main Estimates for Indian Education for the fiscal year 1936-37 provide the sum of $500.00 for the extension to the sewage disposal system at the Cecilin Jeffrey Indian Residential School. On the file hereunder, you will see a report from Mr. Gordon, Acting District Chief Engineer, Winnipeg, accompanied by a blueprint outlining the proposed location of the addition to the sewage disposal bed, together with an estimate of the cost. I had included the amount of $1,400 in the first draft Estimates for this work, but this amount was subsequently reduced to $500. I do not know how far this amount will go in doing the work. I shall be pleased if you will give the necessary directions to the Dominion Water Power Branch to undertake the work, as far as funds provided permit.\nApril 30, 1936.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. OHR,-\n\nThe Main Estimates for Indian Education for the fiscal year 1936-37 provide the sum of $3,400.00 to install a sewage disposal system at the Fort Frances Indian Residential School. In this connection I would refer you to a preliminary report, prepared by Mr. Grew, Acting District Chief Engineer, Winnipeg, dated July 5, 1935. I would request that you make the necessary arrangements with the Dominion Water Power Branch to have this work proceeded with.\nApril 30, 1936.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. ORR,-\n\nThe Main Estimates for Indian Education for the fiscal year 1936-37 provide the sum of $7,500.00 to erect a residence for the Principal at the Shingwauk Indian Residential School, Sault Ste. Marie, Ont. This work should be started at an early date, in order that the house can be completed before the cold weather sets in next fall. I would suggest that you make the necessary arrangements. As the Appropriation has been considerably reduced, the above mentioned is the full amount that will be available for the materials, labour, etc., in the erection of the building.\nApril 30, 1936.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. ORR,-\n\nThe Main Estimates for Indian Education for the fiscal year 1936-37 provide the sum of $800.00 to complete the laundry building at the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School. As you are aware, the greater part of the materials for the addition and alterations to the present building were purchased from last year's appropriation. This material is really delivered. I would suggest that you make the necessary arrangements for the work being carried out.\nMay 4, 1936.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. ORR,-\n\nThe following items are provided in the Estimates for Indian Education for the current fiscal year at the Kamloops Indian Residential School:\n\n1. Repairing sewage disposal system and installing a second septic tank unit, with the necessary disposal beds - $3,500.\n\n2. Painting roof of girls' and boys' wings and outside of windows and doors, entire building - 500.\n\n3. Repairs to girls' toilets - 900.\n\n4. Miscellaneous repairs - 500.\n\nI would request that you make the necessary arrangements for the carrying out of the above work.\nMay 4th, 1936.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. ORR,-\n\nThe Estimates for Indian Education for the current fiscal year provide for the following work at the Cequaleetza Indian Residential School:\n\n1. Supplying and installing two vacuum pumps in boiler room - $1,800.\n2. Supplying one - 15 h. p. high pressure boiler - 500.\n3. Purchase of one hot water tank - 400.\n4. Re-shingling and re-conditioning roofs of buildings - 325.\n5. Miscellaneous repairs - 400.\n\nMr. Agent Daunt, in forwarding his Estimates, last fall, states that the installation of the two vacuum pumps in the boiler room is rendered necessary because the steam return from the upper radiators back to the boilers is so slow that condensation takes place too rapidly and pockets are formed. To overcome this, the Engineer has to resort to forcing his furnaces at full capacity. This waste of fuel does not bring results and, in consequence, the building is cold on its exposed side and radiators are frozen.\n\nRe high pressure boiler, the Inspector of Boilers of the Public Works Department condemned the present boiler in use and stated it could not be used after the end of the present school year, June next. A new hot water tank - capacity 500 gallons - with heating coil, is required for laundry purposes.\n**LIST OF DAY SCHOOL BUILDINGS FOR WHICH FUNDS ARE PROVIDED IN THE SPECIAL BUILDING PROGRAMME FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 1936-37**\n\n| Province       | School Name                  | Amount ($) |\n|----------------|------------------------------|------------|\n| **QUEBEC:**    | Restigouche                  | $7,500     |\n| **ONTARIO:**   | Christian Island R.C.        | $7,000     |\n|                | Rabbit Island R.C.           | $6,000     |\n|                | Metagami C.E.                | $1,500     |\n|                | Seine River C.E.             | $3,000     |\n| **MANITOBA:** | Poplar River U.C.            | $4,000     |\n|                | Deer Lake U.C.               | $1,200     |\n|                | Upon Gashing U.C.            | $1,200     |\n|                | (Sandy Bay)                  | $6,500     |\n| **SASKATCHEWAN:** | Montreal Lake (teacher's residence) | $1,800 |\n|                | Ahtahkakoops                 | $3,500     |\n| **BRITISH COLUMBIA:** | Bella Coola U.C.            | $5,000     |\n|                | Gitladamicks C.E.            | $5,500     |\n|                | Kiteselas U.C.               | $5,000     |\n| **NORTH WEST TERRITORIES:** | Fort Rae                    | $12,000    |\n\n**Total:** $70,700\nDEPARTMENT\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY\n\nINDIAN EDUCATION\n\nIncrease of 10% Allowance to Residential Schools\n\nIn view of increased costs, the Appropriation will be increased by 10%, which was found necessary, in order to meet the Estimated for Indians for the school year 1936-37, to fit the needs of the Residential Schools by increasing the per capita grants from $250 to $275, the same as in the preceding year.\n\nThe schools, under whose auspices these studies are conducted, have requested the restoration of the former grants, to permit the Department to operate the schools at the same rate as last year, and from the usual rate, an increase of $130,000 be provided.\nOttawa, May 22, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your No. 200-4A of the 19th instant, regarding the condition of the sign boards located near the entrance of the schools and agencies in your inspectorate and requesting that, owing to their present condition, they be either removed or placed in good repair.\n\nIt is considered, if a large expenditure is not required, that these signs should be repaired and repainted.

This meant that the per capita grants were reduced by 10% from the preceding year. The church authorities, under whose auspices the residential schools are conducted, have made a strong demand for the restoration of the 10% in the grants. To permit the Department to pay per capita grant at the same rate as last year, viz.: 5% deduction from the usual rate, it will require that the sum of $130,000 be provided.\nSir:\n\nI wish to bring to the Department's attention the condition in which I find the sign boards provided some six years ago for the Indian Residential Schools and Indian Agencies.\n\nThese signs are approximately $2\\frac{1}{2} \\times 3\\frac{1}{2}$ ft., made of lumber and located in a conspicuous spot near the entrance of the school or agency.

A.\nOctober 30, 1936.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honorable the Superintendent General,\n\nThe Estimates for the fiscal year 1937-38 are now in course of preparation. I would request to be advised if you approve of including the following items for new residential school buildings:\n\nWHITEFISH LAKE (C.E.A.) - To provide materials towards erection, new school building - $50,000.\n\nA new residential school building is required, to provide accommodation for 50 pupils, at Whitefish Lake (Uteknook Reserve, No. 128) Lesser Slave Lake Indian Agency, northern Alberta, to replace the present old residential school building at this point, and also the residential school building on the Wabasecon Reserve, No. 166. The present buildings at these points have become unfit for use, are dilapidated and beyond repair and a menace to the health of the pupils. These schools are conducted under the auspices of the Church of England. The erection of a new modern school building will meet the needs at both points and provide school facilities for all pupils of the Anglican faith in the Lesser Slave Lake agency. On account of freighting conditions, it will be necessary to forward the building materials by winter freight, during the winter of 1937-38.\n\nCRONFOOT (R.C.A.) - To erect addition to present building - $50,000.\n\nThis school is situated at Cluny, Alberta, on the Blackfoot reserve. His Lordship the Bishop of Calgary has strongly urged that increased accommoda-\n\n[Signature]\n\nPOOR COPY\nCROWFOOT\n\naccommodates 75 children, and there are a further number of Roman Catholic children on the reserve, for whom it is necessary to provide school facilities. Mr. Inspector Christiansen and the local Indian Agent both endorse the erection of an addition to the present building. It is proposed to build two wings, which will provide dormitories, chapel, and a laundry and boiler room; also to make some alterations in the present buildings.\n\nProvision was made in both the General and Supplementary Estimates last year for the funds towards the erection of the school at Whitefish Lake and the addition to the Crowfoot R.C. School at Cluny, Alberta. These items were disallowed.\n\nOLD SUN'S (C.A.) - To reimburse Blackfoot Band for amount taken from their funds to erect school building $80,000.\n\nThe main building of the Old Sun Indian Residential School, on the Blackfoot Indian Reserve, was destroyed by fire in June, 1926.\n\nThe Indians, wishing to expedite replacement, petitioned the Department to take from their funds the sum of $80,000.00, which, with $40,000.00 provided by Parliament, enabled the rebuilding to proceed. Approval of the loan was granted by P.C. 307 of January 29th, 1930. It was proposed that the loan should be refunded to the band funds within the next two fiscal years, but no payments have been made. The band funds have not been credited with any interest on the above amount, and it is considered that the amount of the loan should be paid back to the band funds as soon as possible.\n\nI would also request that you will advise what other new residential school buildings, if any, you desire be provided for in the Estimates for the fiscal year 1937-38.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nESTIMATES\nINDIAN EDUCATION 1937-38\n\nNEW BUILDINGS - D.A.Y. SCHOOLS\n\nQUEBEC\n\nCAUGHNAWAGA (Prot.)\n\nTo erect addition to provide second classroom and living quarters for two teachers .................. $3,500.00\n\nThis school is on the Caughnawaga Reserve. The present school building is inadequate to provide classroom accommodation for all the protestant Indian children of school age. At present, an extra classroom is being rented and a building has been rented for living quarters for two teachers. The present arrangements, both for classroom accommodation and teachers' living quarters, are very inadequate and the school work is being carried on under difficulty. It is intended to erect an addition to the present school building and to provide living quarters for the teachers on the floor above the classrooms.\n\nMARIA (R.C.)\n\nTo erect addition to provide second classroom ........ 2,500.00\n\nThis school is on the Maria Reserve, No. 2, Bonaventure County, Que. The present building has accommodation for only 25 pupils, whereas there are 60 children of school age on the reserve. It is necessary to arrange for a second classroom to adequately provide school facilities for all the children of school age on this reserve. The local Agent and the departmental Inspectors have recommended the erection of an addition to the present building.\n\nLORETTE (R.C.)\n\nTo erect addition to provide third classroom .......... 2,000.00\n\nThis school is on the Lorette Indian reserve. The present classrooms are over-crowded and there is a sufficient number of children of school age to require an additional classroom. The local Agent has recommended the providing of a third classroom.\n\nRESTIGOUCHE (R.C.)\n\nTo erect building with two classrooms and living accommodation for two teachers, also necessary outbuildings, (toilets, woodshed, etc.) ........................................... $2,000.00\n\nThis school is on the Restigouche Reserve, No. 1, Bonaventure County, Que. The present building has adequate accommodation for only 80 pupils. It is much overcrowded, the enrolment being 123. There are 140 children.\nESTIMATES\n\nINDIAN EDUCATION 1927-38\n\nNEW BUILDINGS - DAY SCHOOLS (cont'd.)\n\nQUEBEC (cont'd.)\n\nRESTIGOUCHE (cont'd.)\n\n140 children of school age on the reserve. The present building, containing three classrooms, does not permit of being enlarged. The local Agent and our Inspector have recommended the erection of a separate building, to contain two classrooms, and to be erected on a site on the west end of the reserve.\n\nONTARIO\n\nMUD LAKE\n\nTo erect two-roomed school building with living quarters for two teachers .................. 7,500.00\n\nThis school is situated on the Mud Lake Reserve, No. 36, Electoral District of Peterborough West. A building is required to replace the former school, which was destroyed by fire. At present, classes are being conducted in the council hall, and it would be necessary to provide two classrooms - each to accommodate 36 children, with living accommodation for two teachers. Cloakrooms and adequate heating facilities will also be required.\n\nNEW CREDIT\n\nTo erect two-roomed school building with living accommodation for two teachers ........... 7,500.00\n\nThis school is located on the New Credit Indian reserve, No. 40A, in the New Credit Indian Agency - Electoral District of Haldimand. The school building at this point was destroyed by fire a few years ago, and since that time, classes have been conducted in the council hall. The members of the band have repeatedly asked that a new school be erected, having two classrooms with accommodation for thirty pupils in each, and also that living quarters be provided for two teachers, as it is difficult to obtain suitable boarding accommodation in the neighbourhood. Outdoor toilets and heating facilities would also be necessary.\n\n-ONIDA No. 1\nESTIMATES\nINDIAN EDUCATION 1937-38\n\nNEW BUILDINGS - DAY SCHOOLS (cont'd.)\n\nONTARIO (cont'd.)\n\nONEIDA No. 1\nTo erect new school building with teacher's living quarters ........................................... $6,000.00\n\nThere are at present two schools on the Oneida reserve, No. 4a, in the Caradoc Indian agency - Electoral District or Middlesex West. There are approximately 230 children of school age on the reserve. There is urgent need for further school facilities, as there are a large number of children who do not attend any school. The local Indian Agent has been requesting further school facilities for this reserve for some time.\n\nSIX NATIONS No. 9\nTo erect new school building ........................................... $6,000.00\n\nThe present building used for school purposes at the No. 9 School on the Six Nations Reserve is very old and is unfit for further use. It would be a waste of money to incur any expenditure in repairing it. The Indian Superintendent and departmental officials, who have visited the school, strongly recommend the erection of a new building to provide classroom accommodation for 55 children.\n\nMANITOBA\n\nBLOODVEIN (R.C.)\nTo supply finishing materials for school building, to be erected, of log construction ............... $1,000.00\n\nThis school is located on the Bloodvein Indian Reserve, Claneboye Agency. The Agent requests that a new school building be erected, of log construction, and states that the Indians would take out the logs and do part of the labour in erecting the building. It would be necessary for the Department to supply finishing materials, such as doors, windows, flooring, etc.\n\nLITTLE SASKATCHEWAN\nTo erect new school building ........................................... $3,000.00\n\nThe present school building, which is of log construction, has become unsuitable for further use. The Agent has requested that a new school building be erected.

There are 64 Protestant Indian children on the reserve. The present old building was erected some 20 years ago, with logs for foundation. The building is too small to accommodate the children and has deteriorated beyond repair. The building is very cold in winter. The walls are giving way, having been held together for some years by iron rods. The authorities of the United Church of Canada have been requesting the erection of a new school building during the past few years.\n\nISLAND LAKE (B.C.)\n\nTo erect new school building ......................... 1,500.00\n\nThis school is situated on the Island Lake Reserve, Norwak House Agency. The present building is of log construction and is in such bad repair that it would be a waste of money to expend any further amount in effecting repairs. His Lordship the Bishop of Keewatin and the Local Indian Agent have requested that a new school building be erected. There are 44 children of school age. The Church authorities have, at Island Lake, a portable sawmill and could supply the necessary lumber, etc. It is estimated that a suitable building could be erected, employing Indian labour, at a cost of $1,500.\nESTIMATES\nINDIAN EDUCATION 1937-38\n\nNEW BUILDINGS - DAY SCHOOLS\n\nMONTREAL AREA (C.E.)

The present school building is old and so small that some of the children attend in the forenoon and others, in the afternoon. There is an Indian population of over 400 on the reserve, with approximately 75 of school age. A new two-roomed school building is required. The work in erecting the building could be carried out by Indian carpenters, under a white foreman. Requests for a new school have been made by the local Indian Agent, the Medical Officer and the church authorities.\n\nBOOTHROYD (C.E.)\n\nTo erect new school building ........................................ $3,000.00\n\nThis school is located on the Boothroyd Reserve, Lytton Indian Agency (Electoral District of Cariboo).

The cost, including heating plant, blackboards and indoor toilets, was $3,097.65. Norwood School District No. 642 built a good school with a basement and this building, including the heating plant, blackboards and indoor toilets, cost $4,195.15. This will give you an idea of the cost of modern one-room schools. In 1937 a couple of districts built two-room schools with full-sized basement and indoor toilets, the cost in each case running a little over $5,000.00.\n\nDecker Consolidated School District built a four-room school with basement a couple of years ago at a cost of $14,000.00. Dugald School District has a three-room school with two rooms upstairs and one in the basement at a cost of about $8,700.00. I think prices today would range a little higher as material seems to have gone up a bit.\n\nUnder separate cover I am mailing you copies of our one and two-room schools with basement and beg to say that there will be no charge. At the moment I do not think we have a four-room plan available but if you are anxious for one I can arrange to have blue prints run off at a small cost. We have a very nice four-room school with the four rooms on one floor and full-sized basement.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. Fletcher\nDeputy Minister.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOTTAWA\nOttawa, March 21, 1939.\n\nDear Dr. Fletcher:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th instant and to thank you very heartily for the information contained therein. I can assure you that your prompt action in sending forward this information, together with the plans that reached me a few days ago, is very much appreciated.\n\nIt is our intention to proceed this year with the construction of a four room consolidated Indian day school in the Cowichan Indian agency, near Duncan, B.C. In view of this fact, I would appreciate it very much if you could send forward a copy of the plan referred to in the last paragraph of your communication.\n\nWith kindest personal regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.A. Hesey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. R. Fletcher, B.A., LL.D.,\nDeputy Minister,\nDepartment of Education,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nOttawa, March 21, 1939\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Jackson\n\nIn response to your request, I am sending forward herewith copy of a letter received by me from Dr. Robert Fletcher, Deputy Minister of Education, Province of Manitoba. This letter, you will note, relates to the cost of school construction in Manitoba.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, April 21, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDR. MCGILL -\n\nA number of requests have reached this Division during the last two years for the installation of electrical energy at Indian day schools. The pressure exercised upon us to provide this service has become so persistent of late that I feel a definite decision with respect to the matter should be reached by the Minister.\n\nMy experience with electric lighting at public schools in Manitoba was somewhat unfortunate. I learned there that the ordinary suspended light in the classroom was not in itself sufficient to provide the light necessary on dull days and was frequently responsible for the creation of shadows. Electric light in a one room day school, in order to be effective and to meet the requests of the specialists who demand perfect lighting facilities, should be provided through several lamps which are, as you know, very costly, particularly where three or four of them are required in a single room. The main objection, however, in the case of Indian schools, is not the number of lamps or the initial cost, although these are substantial. I have learned from experience since coming here that the few schools where electric lighting has been installed - or rather the teachers in charge of these schools - are constantly requesting electrical equipment such as washing machines, electric refrigerators and electric stoves. Last year we were called upon to provide an electric washing machine at Lorette Village and I have just refused a request that reached us yesterday from the Sisters in charge of the school at Pierreville for a fully equipped and rather expensive electric refrigerator.\n\nThe Ontario Hydro Commission and private companies who supply electrical energy have refused to install this energy in Indian day schools unless the Government, as owners of the property, guarantees the payment of all charges incurred in connection with the electrical service. I am not personally opposed to the installation of this lighting equipment if the Government is prepared to supply this service. I have never been able to convince myself, however, that it is necessary, and consequently, unless I receive definite instructions to install this equipment from time to time in our Indian day schools, it is not my intention to supply this service. I should appreciate it, therefore, if I could have, at your convenience, a definite ruling on this matter.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nApril 26, 1939.\n\nMemorandum: The Deputy Minister.\n\nRe: Electric Lighting in Indian Day Schools.\n\nYou will find attached a memorandum submitted to me by Mr. Hoey. I am in entire agreement with Mr. Hoey in this matter, and I feel that our educational funds could be expended to greater advantage to the Indians than by furnishing electric light.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to another memorandum of today's date in respect to the request for the installing of electric lights in the Council Hall and Church on the Saguenay Indian Reserve, Que. There is also a request for the installation of lights in the Teachers' residence on the Saguenay Reserve, which would not be a charge against said funds but against appropriation.\n\nDirector of Indian Affairs.\n\nM.W.\nJuly 29, 1948.\n\nMr. H. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOur Regina representative has recently completed an inspection trip to several Indian Residential schools and agencies in Saskatchewan and reports to us as follows:\n\nRound Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nBattery worn out and would recommend immediate replacement. Present battery is 16 cell, 32 volt Globelite type W15, installed August, 1939. The load at this school is far too heavy for a 32 volt plant and should be replaced with 110 volt plant. Would suggest that if another 32 volt battery is purchased, the department install at least a Globelite type W11 of 450 ampere hours.\n\nMarieval School.\n\nPlant and battery in excellent condition. The battery is a Globelite type GDL5, 56 cell, 110 volts, installed February, 1940.\n\nFile Hill School.\n\nSupervised the installation of a new Globelite type W15, 16 cell, 32 volt battery. Here again the load is far too heavy for a 32 volt plant and strongly recommend that same be replaced with a 110 volt plant.\n\nWESTERN CANADA'S LARGEST BATTERY MANUFACTURERS\nFile Hills Indian Agency.\n\nBattery and plant in good condition. Battery consists of a Globelite type W13, 16 cells, 52 volts, installed September, 1940.\n\nMuscow Indian Agency.\n\nBattery in very poor shape. The battery and plant has been sadly neglected. Battery consists of Globelite type W12, 56 cells, 110 volts, installed November, 1928.\n\nWe might advise that in regards to the equipment at Muscow Indian Agency, the writer inspected the plant and battery some years ago and also found same to be in a very badly neglected condition. The battery cells were covered with dirt to such an extent that the elements were not even visible through the glass jars. The writer pointed this out to the operator of the plant and instructed the operator to get the battery cleaned up and to pay a little more attention to the charging of the battery and further; the operator was advised that a report would go into the government respecting the condition the plant and battery was found in. Although this matter was not reported to your department, nevertheless, it was reported to your late Mr. Robertson who was in charge of your Regina office.\n\nTrusting that this inspection report will be of some interest to you, we remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nGLOBELITE BATTERIES LIMITED,\n\n[Signature]\n\nManager.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 25, 1943.\n\nEX'D A.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HICK\n\nI have recently had an opportunity of reviewing the general regulations for the public and separate schools in the province of Ontario and I find the following reference which I thought might be of interest to you:\n\n\"CLASSROOMS - General Requirements\n\n\"(a) Classrooms shall be oblong in shape.\n\n\"(b) A standard classroom for 40 pupils shall be 38 feet long, 25 feet wide and 12 feet, 3 inches high; with a floor space of 18.4 square feet for each pupil and an air space of 225 cubic feet for each pupil.\n\n\"(c) The floors of the classrooms shall be of hardwood or asphalt mastic.\n\n\"(d) The ceilings, frieze and walls shall be tinted or painted and woodwork shall be varnished, stained or painted.\n\n\"(e) Windows should be adjusted with weights and pulleys.\"\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nAugust 6, 1943.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, reporting on a recent inspection of the batteries at the Round Lake, Cowessess, File Hills and Muscowequan Indian Residential School. The Department appreciates receiving the information contained in your letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nGlobelite Batteries Limited,\n146 Alexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, July 17, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nEquipment for Residential Schools - Hand Potato Peelers.\n\nI have today had a visit from Mr. Whittle of the Hobart Manufacturing Company, who specialize in the construction of kitchen machines.\n\nWe had a thorough discussion on the use of hand potato peelers, both in civilian establishments and their projected use in our residential schools. Mr. Whittle pointed out that the Hobart Company no longer manufactures a hand potato peeler, for the following reasons:\n\n(a) A mechanical peeler does the work of three hand peelers.\n\n(b) A hand peeler is made with cast iron gears and is without ball bearings. This makes it a very difficult machine to operate. In fact, it would be almost impossible for children or school age to turn the handle.\n\n(c) The Canadian Army discarded the use of such hand peelers after using them for about a year. They found that these machines did not stand up to the heavy usage which they were given and, in general, proved unsatisfactory. They adopted, eventually, the mechanical peeler.\n\nMr. Whittle has recently been discharged from the Canadian Army, in which he served as Chief Equipment Officer with the Royal Canadian Army Service Corps Catering Branch. Therefore, I feel that his recommendations can be taken as\n\n.... not only\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nSURVEYS AND ENGINEERING BRANCH\nENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION SERVICE\n\nBILL OF MATERIAL FOR\nSTANDARD COMBINED\nONE CLASSROOM INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\nWITH TEACHER'S QUARTERS\n\nStone, Cement, Masonry, Tile Pipe Etc.\n\n20 tons.

S. Arnell  \nIndian Commissioner for B. C.  \nc/o Department of Mines & Resources  \nP. O. Box 70  \nVancouver, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed are 2 blueprints of the one roomed school which we showed you a few days ago and we believe this will meet the requirements of your department for this type of school in various parts of British Columbia.\n\nOn checking with the railroad, the approximate freight charge from our siding to Vanderhoof would be in the neighbourhood of $400.00. At the moment, cannot give you a Steamer rate to the West Coast Island points but would estimate the cost to be approximately the same with possible addition of cartage from our plant to dockside which would be in the neighbourhood of $75.00 per building.\n\nAttached for your information is a duplicate copy of the specifications covering this building but we wish to point out one change which we will be making on this plan should your department decide to order one or more of these buildings and that is, we would carry the 24' span of the building, which is the classroom, straight through for the total length of the building which is 56' and put on an \"L\" roof line for the span and in order to bring the living quarter ceiling height to 8' only, we propose putting 2 steps in front of the door leading from the corridor into the living quarters. This would have a number of advantages. Namely, cost of erection would be less, general appearance improved and 2' extra head room in the basement in that portion of the building beneath the living quarters.\n\nThe f.o.b. Factory price for this building including all items as shown in the specifications would be $5850.00. Approximate shipping weight 55,000 lbs. You will note that we have included in the specifications Ten/Tent for wall coverings. If gyproc is required a reduction of $73.00 from the above price can be made.\n\nWe trust the enclosed blueprint and specifications will be sufficient information for you to forward on to Ottawa for their okay.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIan B.

Arneil, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\n1948-49 Estimates - New Construction of\nIndian Day & Residential Schools in B.C.\n\nThe following items and amounts have been approved for inclusion in the Indian Affairs Branch, Education Vote for 1948-49:\n\n**Babine Agency**\n\nFort Babine 1 room school & residence $14,000.\nHazelton 3 room school & residence 40,000.\n\n**Bella Coola Agency**\n\nBella Bella Second class room 10,000.\nKlemtu 1 room school & residence 14,000.\n\n**Kamloops Agency**\n\nAniskamolith 1 room school & residence 14,000.\nNorth Thompson 1 room school & residence 14,000.\nKamloops Res. 4 class room block 40,000.\n\n**Kwawkelth Agency**\n\nAlert Bay C.of E. 4 class room block To be the subject of further correspondence.\n\n**Queen Charlotte Agency**\n\nSkidegate Teachers residence 5,000.\nNew Westminster Agency\n\nPemberton Second class room $10,000.\n\nLytton Agency\n\nSeabird Island 1 room school & residence 14,000.\n\nSkeena Agency\n\nKitkatla 2 room school 25,000.\nMotlakatla 1 room school 10,000.\n\nStuart Lake Agency\n\nStony Creek 1 room school & residence 14,000.\n\nWilliams Lake Agency\n\nAnaham Lake 2 room school & residence 28,000.\nRed Stone 1 room school & residence 14,000.\n\nYou will note that the above list varies somewhat from that proposed by Inspector Davey in your letter O-11-3 of January 9th. However, as previously mentioned in our letter of January 17th, our estimates were already before the Treasury Board at the time Inspector Davey's proposals arrived and it was not possible to make any changes.\n\nHowever, we have been advised by the Minister's office that the Treasury Board will give us some choice in reallotting sums as they are required. You will recall that this was done last year with regard to the Port Hardy project. It is naturally necessary for us to approach the Treasury Board and to get formal approval of the changes needed. Therefore, it would be appreciated if you would review your requirements in British Columbia and advise how you wish the above list amended by Treasury Board.\n\nAdditions: With regard to the one room additions, it is suggested that local builders be approached for the preparation of rough plans. If Lands and Development Services Branch are to enter into the picture, then a long delay must be anticipated. They already have a large number of priority jobs before them and it is unlikely that they will be able\nto spare engineers or architects to work on these additions. As you realize, it is not necessary to advertise for any construction work which is under $5,000.00.\n\nTeacherages: Where separate teacherages are required, it is suggested that a simple plan be followed or that a pre-fabricated house be ordered.\n\nPre-Fabricated Schools: We await with interest the plans for one and two room pre-fabricated schools which you are endeavouring to obtain and forward from B.C. firms.\n\nPlans and Specifications for One Room Schools: A good quantity of these is being forwarded to you for holding in your office for future use.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nBFN/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: School Construction Program - B.C.\n\nFurther to my letter of April 8th, I have now received from Prefabricated Structures, Vancouver, plans and specifications of a one-room school with teacher's residence, copies of which are attached hereto, together with a letter dated April 8th from the Company giving further details and quoting a price. Plans and specifications for a two-room school with accommodation for teachers will be supplied by the Company after we receive the proposed plans for the Anaham school, reference Mr. Neary's army signals message of today, which will serve as a basis for the preparation of plans for a prefabricated structure. The one-room school with teacherage, as shown and described in the attached enclosures, is in my opinion most suitable to our needs in British Columbia and should, I believe, be adopted wherever we contemplate a building of this size. In my letter of January 9th I listed the preferred order of work for the first six school construction projects as follows:\n\n(1) Metlakatla - The information we now have, and which we have asked the Agent to confirm, is to the effect that a two-room school is necessary here and it has been suggested that we should also provide accommodation for teachers. This matter is presently the subject of correspondence with Mr. Anfield as the need for additional accommodation for teachers is not apparent having in mind the large expenditure recently made on the present teacherage and its size which should provide ample accommodation for two teachers, either married or single.\n\nI might mention that in early February Mr. Anfield submitted tenders covering the transfer and re-erection of two Loxstave buildings from Pillsbury Cove to Metlakatla for school use and he has been requested to advise if these tenders still stand in which case they will be referred to the Department, or otherwise we may, if the\nPrefabricated Structures' plan of a two-room school is considered suitable, recommend the provision of prefabricated buildings.\n\n(2) Klemtu - I would recommend that the Department approve the use of a prefabricated building to provide one classroom and teacherage at this point; the order to be placed as soon as possible and the necessary work preliminary to erection of the building to be carried out at once. It appears that Prefabricated Structures have agreed to provide a foreman and one or two carpenters at hourly rates to superintend erection of the prefabricated building and it is possible that we might arrange with them for the use of this crew for the construction of foundations.\n\n(3) Bella Bella - Although we have already purchased a building at the Bella Bella Air Base from the War Assets Corporation, information received from the Lands and Development Services Branch indicates that use of this building for school purposes may not be feasible or economical. On receipt of the two-room school plan with teacherages above referred to and providing it is suitable it is intended to recommend use of a prefabricated structure of this size at Bella Bella.\n\n(4) Seabird Island - Construction of a one-room school with teacherage at Seabird Island has been the subject of correspondence between Mr. Indian Agent Strang and the Department and I note the matter has proceeded to the point where Mr. Strang has secured a tender of $4,300 for labour, the Department to provide materials for the construction in accordance with the Department's one-room school plan. In spite of the progress made in arranging for the construction of a school at this point I feel the Department would be well advised to consider the use of a prefabricated structure and would so recommend.\n\n(5) Pemberton - While the information available a year ago indicated that we should have a one-room addition to the Pemberton School with accommodation for an additional teacher, District School Inspector Davey is of the opinion that our requirements at this point should be investigated further before construction is proceeded with or even definite plans made. While the construction here should no doubt be carried out this year if found to be absolutely necessary, no action is indicated until a school survey has been completed.\n(b) Hazelton - Construction at Hazelton was the subject of correspondence with you, reference my letter of March 24th, at which time I recommended construction of a four-classroom school for the reason that it would be better to construct a school somewhat too large than to be confronted with overcrowded conditions immediately upon completion of construction.\n\nWe will, in addition to the four classrooms at this point, require accommodation for teachers as it is doubtful if we can count on securing accommodation for them in the adjoining town of Hazelton. I do not feel, however, that the Department should proceed immediately to construct teacherages for three or four teachers, one or more of whom might be married. I feel it would be preferable this year to construct a five-room residence for the Principal and in the event that the Principal is unmarried the other teachers might be accommodated in the same building. Prefabricated Structures have a five-room home, plans of which are attached hereto, which would be most suitable.\n\nI would recommend that the Department call for tenders covering the construction of a four-room school with manual training room and domestic science room in the basement and that authority be secured for the purchase and erection of a five-room prefabricated house to accommodate the teachers.\n\nWhile the above six projects are apparently the most urgent, it is hoped that construction will not be confined to these six only but that consideration will be given to the acquisition and erection of prefabricated one and two room schools with teachers' accommodation at the following listed points, as well as the Anaham Reserve:\n\nOne-room Schools:\n\nKitwancool - Babine Agency\nNeskainlith - Kamloops Agency\nNorth Thompson - \" \"\nAhousat - West Coast Agency\nUcluelet - \" \"\nAlberni - \" \" (a one-room addition is required here with accommodation for 2 teachers)\nStony Creek - Stunt Lake Agency\nFort St. James - \" \"\nFort Mcleod - \" \"\nGwinsha - Skeena River Agency\nChehalis - New Westminster Agency (one classroom only. There is a teacherage available).\nTwo-room Schools:\n\nFort Babine - Babine Agency\nMoricetown - \" \"\nKitwanga - \" \"\nKincolith - Skeena River Agency\nHartley Bay - \" \"\nChemainus - Cowichan Agency\nSonghees - \" \"\n\nIn addition to the above mentioned requirements it is anticipated that we will have to provide accommodation at Skidegate for two teachers. It is thought that the prefabricated five-room house, a plan of which is attached, would be most suitable here.\n\nWe also have information to the effect that a three-room school is required at Greenville for the Lakalsap Band but have yet to determine whether a two-room school would meet their needs or if we should construct a four-room school as plans for a three-room structure are not available.\n\nI am most anxious that concrete action be taken immediately in connection with this school construction program, particularly as far as the first six schools listed are concerned and would suggest that our requirements can be provided more expeditiously and economically by the use of prefabricated structures wherever such structures are considered to be suitable as in those cases above where their use is recommended.\n\nIn my letter of April 8th I asked for a complete list of the Estimates for new day schools, repairs and additions to existing day schools and repairs to residential schools and feel that with this information and the Department's approval of the program outlined above much headway will be made.

As you know, this is the two room school built to the plan sent you recently. We found the building entirely satisfactory and the contractor has done a very good job. Mr. Morris was particularly interested in the minor modifications which can be made in the plan so that he can make these minor improvements at Lennox Island. I would say that the following minor details are ones on which improvements can be made:\n\n(1) If steel beams are obtainable, then the posts in the basement can be eliminated and you will find that the two basement rooms will be much better for future classroom use.\n\n(2) The windows in the kitchen and living room downstairs are rather small and Mr. Buck is going to improve them (this will take some time as they are absolutely swamped with work).\n\n(3) The stairs from the teacher's living quarters can be straightened out to remove the landing. This will allow more space in the living room and also will give you to take furniture upstairs more easily. The contractor has been able to do this at Chenail by putting in fourteen steps and raising them to 6\" apart.\nThe classrooms are just perfect and I am sure that Bob Davey will be very pleased with them. Of course, we installed flush toilets, running water and electricity at Chenail as a result we have a very modern and satisfactory school.\n\nI was discussing the situation with Mr. Buck on the way home and we agreed that perhaps you would like to look at another two room school plan which has been especially developed for the Northwest Territories. There we can not put in a basement because of the perma-frost. The attached blue print is only a preliminary drawing and changes will be made. I brought to the Architect's attention the fact that the fenestration is not sufficient for our needs. This is due to the fact that Mr. McKinnon specifically asked for folding doors between the two classrooms so that it could be used as a community hall. This meant that they were unable to work in windows along the other side wall. However, I would ask you to look it over and let me have it back. If you feel that it would be better for your needs at Anaham and Hazelton then I can arrange to have you sent the final plans.\n\nI hope everything is going well with Mrs. Arneil and yourself and that you are both finding Vancouver to your liking. As you probably know I have had Betty out visiting my people in Victoria and she is now on her way home.\n\nAs ever,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nEnclosure\n\nBFN/HM.\nAIRMAIL\n\nApril 29, 1948.\n\nMr. W. S. Avisil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nSchool Construction Program, British Columbia.\n\nReference your 0-11-3 of April 15 -\n\nUpon receipt of your letter and attached plans of one-room school, etc., these blueprints and specifications were taken over to the Lands and Development Services Branch. Study has been given by them to the submissions of Prefabricated Structures, Limited, and as I advised you, I interviewed Mr. Buck yesterday concerning the plans.\n\nAs you are probably aware, Mr. Buck feels that these prefabricated schools will not be as satisfactory in the long run as buildings constructed in the usual way. However, he realizes our serious need for these schools and the impossibility of having them built by contractors. Therefore he concurs with the proposal that we order a certain number of these schools. I have asked that one of their engineers be made available for inspection of these buildings so that our 1949-50 building plans can be laid accordingly.\n\nMr. Buck feels that the Prefabricated Structures Limited's plans and specifications present certain features which are superior to similar plans and specifications presented by other prefabricated manufacturing concerns.\n\nThere are a few points with regard to the construction of prefabricated buildings which we would like to draw to your attention:\nFOUNDATIONS:\n\nIt is most important that the basement be put in according to the detailed specifications of the company providing the prefabricated building. The structure must fit the foundation exactly or outside air will penetrate the basement and the building will always have a cold floor. To doubly insure against this point, we are having the prefabricated schools ordered for Northern Manitoba provided with a floor insulated between the joists. While this may not be necessary in the Great schools, you may consider it necessary for the interior schools, where winter weather is severe.\n\nMr. Buck recommends that we try to interest Prefabricated Structures, Limited, in providing a foreman and one or two carpenters who could superintend the construction of foundations and also the erection of the building. If previous arrangements were made to have the excavation done, the cement and rough form lumber on hand and Indian labour available, this crew could do the job in a short time. It would be necessary to maintain constant liaison with the company to ensure that the prefabricated structures were on hand by the time the crew has the foundation finished. It would also be necessary for the Prefabricated Structures Limited to advise you as to the amount of cement, lumber, nails, etc., necessary so that these materials would be on hand when the construction crew arrived to begin work.\n\nFLOOR AND SIDING:\n\nYou may find it necessary to have the construction crew also lay the floor and put on the cedar siding unless local carpenters are available.\n\nCHIMNEY:\n\nHere again it will be necessary to arrange for a bricklayer and a supply of bricks if a brick chimney is to be provided. In our Northern Manitoba prefabricated schools we are specifying a Yukon special insulated metal chimney.\n\n....... Building\nBUILDING SPAN:\n\nWe would prefer the 56' span as described in para 3 of Mr. MacKay's letter to you of April 8. The extra head room in the basement will make it possible to use it for an extra classroom if need arises.\n\nINSULATION:\n\nThe substitution of Gyproc for Ten-test (Mr. MacKay's letter of April 8) depends on the location of the building. We are using Gyproc in our standard one-room school specifications but are insulating well behind it. You will note on the attached copy of Purchase Order (used with North American Buildings, Limited, for Little Grand Rapids, Man.) that we specified rock wool or other non-inflammable insulation. This may also be necessary for the interior of B.C.\n\nWATER SUPPLY and PLUMBING:\n\nThe water supply will present a problem on most reserves where it will be necessary to dig a well before the school is built. We are suggesting to Agents building schools under local arrangements that the well be located just outside the building and that the pump be placed in the teacher's kitchen over the sink. Some prefer to leave the pump outside and to have teachers draw the water there. However, local conditions will govern procedure in each case. The bath-room provided will probably end up being used as a utility room or extra bedroom, as in most areas running water will not be available. We have been providing chemical closets for the teachers' use in certain areas.\n\nHEATING:\n\nIt will also be necessary to arrange for a subcontract for the installation of the furnace. It is presumed that Prefabricated Structures Limited will provide a heating plan for the building and also recommend the size of furnace to be provided. You will note that North American Buildings Limited will provide the furnace as an extra to the contract.\n\nROOF:\n\nWe are endeavouring to provide some degree of fire protection in our new schools. We would prefer the supplying of\nasbestos or other fire resistant shingles. The cost will be more than for cedar shingles and we should be advised as to the extra cost. You will also have to arrange locally for the putting on of the roof.\n\nPAINTING: You will have to arrange for the purchase of the paint required for both the interior and exterior. Prefabricated Structures may supply the information as to the quantities provided or it can be obtained from our standard one-room school bill of materials. It will also be necessary to have this painting done.\n\nTo summarize, we have found out from past experience this last year that while prefabricated buildings do provide an answer, they are not as easy to arrange for erection as it would at first seem. You are provided with the shell of a building but you have to arrange locally for:\n\n(a) The excavation and foundation,\n(b) The brick work,\n(c) The laying of the floor,\n(d) The laying of the siding, etc.\n(e) The laying of the roofing,\n(f) The digging of the well,\n(g) The installation of the pump,\n(h) The installation of the furnace,\n(i) The painting.\n\nIn other words your local field official will have many administrative problems in connection with the erection of the school.\n\nHowever, we are not trying to discourage the ordering of these prefabricated schools but merely wish to point out the problems encountered by other field officials so that you can be guided by their experience. You will find that the total cost will add up to very close to the amount included in the estimates for a one-room school ($14,000.00).\nONE-ROOM SCHOOLS TO BE ORDERED:\n\nA review of your letter would indicate that it is recommended that we order the following schools (a wire has already been sent re Seabird Island):\n\n1. Klantu\n2. Redstone\n3. Neskaalinith\n4. North Thompson\n5. Stony Creek\n6. Kitmancool.\n\n(based on priority Major Davey's list January 8).\n\nAll of the above are included in our estimates with the exception of Kitmancool (for which a transfer would have to be arranged). We are prepared to recommend the ordering of the above six buildings from Prefabricated Structures, Limited. This, with Seabird Island, will provide seven new one-room schools. We can then decide in June if sufficient money is left over for others to be ordered. The Hazelton school in particular is likely to cost more than the $40,000.00 provided (a separate letter will be sent re this school).\n\nTWO-ROOM SCHOOLS:\n\nWe will await further developments re these plans.\n\nTEACHERAGE\n\nCould we be advised as to the cost of providing Model F plan for the Skidgate school for use as a teacherage? This should provide satisfactory accommodation for two teachers.\n\nEnc.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nPrefabricated one-room day school (with teacher's residence) as per your plan previously agreed upon.\n\nSpecifications as follows:\n\n(1) Rock wool or other non-inflammable insulation material\n\n(2) Floor should be insulated between joists.\n\n(3) Asbestos shingles or other fire-resistant shingles should be used on roof.\n\n(4) The Company to supply suitable furnace and piping and include cost of same in their quotation.\n\n(5) The Company to supply Yukon chimney for school.\n\n(6) The Company to provide Mr. B. Olson, Superintendent, Glendebay Indian Agency, Selkirk, Manitoba, with a plan of the basement which will have to be excavated by the Department prior to the school being erected.\n\n(7) Duo-therm, double pane glass or equivalent to be installed on all windows.\n\nThe Department will be responsible for engaging and paying the five men required to assist the Company's supervisor in the erection of this building. The Department will provide board for the Supervisor while he is working at Little Grand Rapids and also provide the cost of the foundation.\n\nBasic Unit, f.o.b.

He has now submitted the drawings and specifications of a one-room school with attached teacherage which can be prefabricated by Prefabricated Structures, Limited, P.O. Box 469, Vancouver, B.C. These plans have been shown to the Chief Architect of the Lands and Development Services Branch, who feels they are acceptable in localities where contractors are not available for the construction of these schools.\n\nIn a recent letter to the Branch, Mr. Arneil stated as follows:\n\n\"I am most anxious that concrete action be taken immediately in connection with this school construction program, particularly as far as the first six schools listed are concerned, and would suggest that our requirements can be provided more expeditiously and economically by the use of prefabricated structures wherever such structures are considered to be suitable as in those cases above where their use is recommended.\"\n\nTherefore, it is recommended that approval be given to the purchase of prefabricated day schools for the following\nRESERVES:\n\n(1) Klastu, Bella Coola Agency,\n(2) Redstone, Williams Lake Agency,\n(3) Neskonlith, (Aniskamllith), Kamloops Agency,\n(4) North Thompson, Kamloops Agency,\n(5) Stony Creek, Williams Lake Agency.\n\nWe will also be recommending a similar purchase for Kitwancool when a transfer of funds has been arranged.

There will also be one other standard one-room school to be decided upon, as mentioned in your telegram of 18th June. At the present time this is listed in our estimates as Fort Babine ($14,000).\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nJune 21, 1948.\n\nMr. R. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nSchool Construction Program - Manitoba.\n\nWe have for answer your recent request with regard to information on our 1948-49 building program in your region.\n\nIt is expected that funds will be provided for the following program when our Estimates are voted upon in the near future:\n\nPortage la Prairie Agency\n\nLake St. Martin ......................... $25,000.00\n($14,000 provided in Estimates and $14,000 to be transferred from Valley River).\n\nThe Pas Agency\n\nShoal Lake ................................ $14,000.00\nRed Earth ................................ $14,000.00\n(Our letter 126-10-5 of 8 March gives details re these two schools.

Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am enclosing confirmation of my Army Signals message of today's date in connection with school construction. Tentative arrangements have been made with the Agents concerned for construction of schools at Redstone, Klemtu, Stony Creek and Neskainlith and I do not anticipate any great difficulty in having the buildings completed at these points.\n\nWith regard to the proposed school on the North Thompson Reserve, while the information secured from the Kamloops Agency indicated definitely that construction of the school was warranted at this point, we are now informed that arrangements can be made for the admission of the Indian children who would attend such a school to the Provincial school at Chu Chu and as a matter of fact there are already nine Indian children in attendance at this white school. In view of this it is considered that construction at the North Thompson Reserve should be left in abeyance pending the revision of the Indian Act and careful consideration of the problem of the joint education of white and Indian children.\n\nWe are in a position, therefore, of having funds for two additional one-room schools, a total of $28,000, and having carefully considered all our requirements and provision made for schools of more than one room, reference Mr. Neery's letter of June 21st, I would recommend:\n\n(1) $14,000 of the amount be allotted for the completion of schools in the Kwawkewlth Agency, namely Alert Bay, Turnour Island and Campbell River. This amount will likely be in excess of our requirements and further transfers may be necessary. I am writing you separately regarding completion of the Alert Bay Day School building.\n(2) That the remaining $14,000 be added to the $10,000 already provided for an additional classroom at Bella Bella; the total to provide for a separate two-classroom school with teachers'age attached which, on the basis of information secured as a result of quite recent school surveys, will be necessary to accommodate the available pupilage at Bella Bella. We are presently negotiating with a contractor for the construction of the required building at this point which matter will be the subject of a separate communication.\n\nSummarizing our entire school construction program for this year, we hope to accomplish:\n\n(1) New one-room schools with teachersages at:\n   - Seabird Island\n   - Metlakatla\n   - Klentu\n   - Redstone\n   - Neskainlith\n   - Stony Creek\n\n(2) Two-room schools with teachersages at:\n   - Bella Bella and at Anaham Lake\n\n(3) A four-classroom block, Kamloops Residential School\n\n(4) An addition to the Pemberton Indian Day School\n\n(5) A teacher's residence at the Skidegate Indian Day School\n\n(6) Completion of Alert Bay, Turnour Island and Campbell River schools in the Kwawkewlth Agency\n\nWhile there are many other schools in the Province requiring additions or replacement and we are finding it difficult to decide in what priority our school construction needs should be met, the construction program detailed above will, I feel, be all that can be handled this year, apart from construction decided upon at Hazelton regarding which I shall be writing you shortly.

While it is realized that it will be impossible to accomplish all this construction in the coming fiscal year, the list has been compiled in order of priority so that construction may be proceeded with to the extent of the funds available. I would suggest that we endeavour to secure an appropriation sufficient for the construction of the first fifteen projects next year and feel fairly confident that, providing we are advised early in the year of the funds available, these fifteen can be completed without too much difficulty.\n\nThere are several other points at which improved facilities are required but these have not been included pending more detailed study of alternative plans. In this group are the Tsartlip, Koksilah and Songhees schools. Whatever decision is finally reached with regard to these three points it will not interfere with the priority list as set forth which can, I think, be maintained for at least a year and reconsidered when plans are being made for the building program for 1950-51.\n\nW.

By arranging them in priority, you have assisted greatly in our work here. We will do everything possible to advise you as soon as the funds are made available. It may interest you to know that other Regional Supervisors are now making plans for the erection of a minimum number of one and two room schools. They feel that only by lining up builders now can they be assured of having their 1948-49 program carried out. In Manitoba, we are particularly fortunate in having four good foremen carpenters who are prepared to go almost anywhere and work with Indians on the construction of the standard one-room school.\n\nI note that further educational surveys are required at Tsartlip, Songhees and Koksalah.\n\nBernard F.

The majority of these are now attending the Squamish Residential School in North Vancouver. He is of the opinion that a Day School should be established on the Musqueam reserve but that construction should be deferred until the 1950-51 fiscal year.\n\n(3) Fort Ware, Shelley, Nazco - Inspector Davey is not familiar with these areas and we have requested Mr. Supt. Howe to give us information regarding these. As soon as this information is received we will forward our recommendation.\n\n(4) Fort Nelson - We have no information with regard to this point as it is outside the jurisdiction of this office, being east of the Rocky Mountains.\n\nW.S.

Ross to give us information regarding these. As soon as this information is received we will forward our recommendation.\"\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: School Construction Projects in British Columbia\n\nYour file 1-1-3 (2)\n\nI refer to Mr. Neary's letter of November 1st concerning the provision of school facilities at Old Fort in the Babine Agency as included on our priority list submitted to the Department some time ago.\n\nThis point is located on Babine Lake about 30 miles S.E. of Fort Babine. A school survey indicates that there are 79 children 16 years of age and under at this point. Of this number 46 are in the age group 6 to 16. The pre-school age population is 33. Although the number of school age children would appear to warrant the construction of a two room school, due to the nomadic life of many of the families it is felt that a one room would probably meet the actual need.\n\nI might say that a school was operated at this point up until March of 1940 when the present teacher at Fort Babine was transferred from Old Fort. At the time of his transfer there were 23 pupils enrolled in the Old Fort School, with an average attendance of 11.3. The school apparently remained closed, partly because of the acute teacher shortage.\n\nThe building in use was an old structure rented from one of the natives belonging to the reserve. It is quite unsuitable for school purposes and is in very poor repair.\n\nW.S.

In reply I beg to advise as follows:\n\nFORT WARE I.R.\n\nDue to the remoteness of this Reserve and the nomadic tendencies of the population, a Day School would be very impracticable. The Right Reverend Anthony Jordan indicated last summer on our visit to this Reserve, that he intended to establish a Missionary at Fort Ware during the summer and his services may be utilized as a Teacher for a 3 months Seasonal term, if required. If this materializes, I intend to recommend opening a Seasonal School at this point.\n\nFORT GEORGE I.R. (SHELLEY)\n\nThere are only 8 children of school age on this Reserve, 5 of which are attending the Lejac Residential School. A Day School is out of the question for this small group.\n\nNAZKO I.R.\n\nThis Reserve is also located in a very remote area and the people lead a nomadic life. At present, there about 20 children of School age, 12 of which attend the Caribou Residential School. This number does not include children from Echimico and Kluskul Bands, who reside about 35 miles away from the Nazko I.R., and who would not benefit by a School established at the Nazko I.R. I do not think that these conditions warrant the erection of a Day School.\n\nM.

Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.,\n\nTwo Room Indian Day Schools\nBritish Columbia.\n\nWe have now been advised that the Architects have nearly completed the plans and specifications for the two-room Indian Day schools which will be built in areas in which electricity is available. This plan calls for interior plumbing and, of course, for electric lighting in the classrooms and teacherages. You can appreciate the fact that we are anxious to obtain specific information with regard to the availability of electricity for these two room schools as otherwise, we will have to follow the old plan which calls for outdoor toilets and no electric lighting. However, this old plan has been revised and you will note that the basement in particular, has been modified to provide more space in the furnace room for the janitor in firing the furnace.\n\nIn our estimates, there are four such schools provided for in British Columbia, namely:\n\nHartley Bay - Skeena River Agency\nLakalsap - \" \"\nKincolith - \" \"\nFort Babine - Babine Agency\n\nWe have an amount included for a two room school at Cape Mudge but it is understood that this is without a teacherage, and therefore, a different plan will have to be followed.\nAt a recent meeting with Mr. Buck and the Director, I was asked to write you immediately and to send you the forms attached hereto for completion by the Indian Superintendent concerned. These forms are to be completed in quadruplicate with one copy for the Superintendent concerned, one for yourself and the other two to be sent here. We will then have available the necessary facts, the lack of which in the past have often caused so much unnecessary correspondence.\n\nI might add that we will shortly be writing to all your Superintendents concerning the other projects included in our estimates, requesting that they complete these forms and send them as indicated previously. However, in the case of these four specific projects, we are writing directly to you in view of discussions in Ottawa recently.\n\nUnder separate cover, I am sending you a number of the revised two room school and attached teacherage plans. As previously advised, these have been revised in a minor way. The \"two room school with electricity\" is quite different in design, calling for a flat roof and presenting a much more modern appearance. When these are complete, we will forward a number to you also.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nBFN/HM\n\nEncl:\nJanuary 5th, 1949.\n\nRe: School Construction Program 1948-49\n\nFollowing is a brief summary of the progress made to date on school construction projects and the work which we hope to complete in the balance of the fiscal year:\n\nOne room schools with teacherages:\n\nSeabird Island - Interior practically complete and considerable exterior work done. The Contractor should have no difficulty in completing the building before March 31st.\n\nMetlakatla - This is a prefabricated one-room school with teacherage. Contract for erection of the building has been let. Work on foundation should be underway by now and the building should be shipped January 10th.\n\nKlemu - A prefabricated one-room school with teacherage, with partial basement. Completed.\n\nRedstone - Prefabricated one-room school with teacherage. Building complete apart from installation of heating facilities.\n\nNeskatinith - Supt. Bruce reported some weeks ago that erection of prefabricated sections was being proceeded with and it is presumed that only the interior finishing remains to be done.\n\nStony Creek - A full cement basement was installed and the prefabricated sections were shipped some weeks ago. It is thought that the building should be well underway towards completion, apart from interior finishing.\n\nTwo room schools with teacherages:\n\nBella Bella - While we had contemplated the erection of a two room prefabricated school at this point, information subsequently received indicates that three or possibly four rooms will be required. The construction of this school is to be the subject of discussion in Ottawa.\nTwo-room schools (Cont'd):\n\nAnaham - A two-classroom school with accommodation for three Sisters of the teaching Order who staff this school is nearing completion. Photographs taken several weeks ago are attached.\n\nPemberton - Materials have been delivered to the site for the erection of a prefabricated two-room school with teacherage at Pemberton and the Contractor has intimated that erection will be proceeded with this month and that five weeks should complete the job.\n\n3. A four-room classroom block, Kamloops School. It is thought that little apart from the foundation of this building may be complete at this time and it would seem doubtful if the building can be completed before March 31st. Long timber specifically cut for rafters, etc., will be shipped this week and as far as materials are concerned there would appear to be no reason why construction should not be proceeded with.\n\n4. New quarters for the teachers have been provided at the Skidegate Indian Day School by the erection of a prefabricated two-bedroom house.\n\n5. The Department has for consideration a proposal covering the erection of a prefabricated three-bedroom house for accommodation for the teachers at Massett. The prefabricated sections of the building have been ordered and are available for immediate shipment as soon as the erection proposal is approved.\n\n6. Funds were advanced to Supt. Todd for completion of the Turnour Island and Campbell River school buildings in the Kwawkewlth Agency but we have no information with regard to the progress made.\nBUILDING PROJECTS AS INCLUDED IN\n1949-50 ESTIMATES\n\nBRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nBABINE AGENCY\nHazelton 4-classroom school $ 40,000.00\n(Revote)\nFort Babine 2-room school and teacherage 30,000.00\n(Revote)\n\nBELLA COOLA AGENCY\nBella Coola Teacherage 7,000.00\n\nKNAKKEL/LETH AGENCY\nAlert Bay 4-classroom block (Revote) 40,000.00\nTeacherage (4 teachers) 15,000.00\nCape Mudge 2-room school 25,000.00\n\nLYTTON AGENCY\nShalalth Teacherage 5,000.00\n\nNEW WESTMINSTER AGENCY\nDouglas One-room school and teacherage 14,000.00\nChehalis One-room school and teacherage 14,000.00\n\nNICOLA AGENCY\nShuswap Teacherage 5,000.00\n\nSTUART LAKE AGENCY\nLejac Residential New barn School 12,000.00\n\nSKENA RIVER AGENCY\nHartley Bay Two-room school and teacherage 30,000.00\nLekalsap Two-room school and teacherage 30,000.00\nKincolith Two-room school and teacherage 30,000.00\n\nWEST COAST AGENCY\nAlberni Residential School Four-classroom block 40,000.00\nUcluelet One-room school and teacherage 14,000.00\nGlascoose One-room school and teacherage 14,000.00\n\nWILLIAMS LAKE AGENCY\nCariboo Residential Four classroom block School 40,000.00\n## Building Projects as Included in 1949-50 Estimates\n\n### British Columbia\n\n#### Babine Agency\n- **Hazelton**\n  - 4-classroom school (Revote) $40,000.00\n- **Fort Babine**\n  - 2-room school and teacherage (Revote) $30,000.00\n\n#### Bella Coola Agency\n- **Bella Coola**\n  - Teacherage $7,000.00\n\n#### Kwakwaka'wakw Agency\n- **Alert Bay**\n  - 4-classroom block (Revote) $40,000.00\n  - Teacherage (4 teachers) $15,000.00\n- **Cape Mudge**\n  - 2-room school $25,000.00\n\n#### Lytton Agency\n- **Shalalth**\n  - Teacherage $5,000.00\n\n#### New Westminster Agency\n- **Douglas**\n  - One-room school and teacherage $14,000.00\n- **Chehalis**\n  - One-room school and teacherage $14,000.00\n\n#### Nicola Agency\n- **Shulus**\n  - Teacherage $5,000.00\n\n#### Stuart Lake Agency\n- **Lejac Residential School**\n  - New barn $12,000.00\n\n#### Skeena River Agency\n- **Hartley Bay**\n  - Two-room school and teacherage $30,000.00\n- **Lakalsap**\n  - Two-room school and teacherage $30,000.00\n- **Kincolith**\n  - Two-room school and teacherage $30,000.00\n\n#### West Coast Agency\n- **Alberni Residential School**\n  - Four-classroom block $40,000.00\n- **Ucluelet**\n  - One-room school and teacherage $14,000.00\n- **Glooscap**\n  - One-room school and teacherage $14,000.00\n\n#### Williams Lake Agency\n- **Cariboo Residential School**\n  - Four classroom block $40,000.00\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa\n\nRe: School Construction Program\nYour File 1-1-5 (E)\n\nIt is noted that no reference is made in Mr. Neary's letter of March 7th, 1949, to the proposed construction of a two-room school with teacherage, at Fort St. James.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nBFN/HM\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: School Construction Program\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of April 29th, due to a change in management personnel at Prefabricated Structures Limited we have experienced some delay in securing an acceptable plan for a two-room school with teachers' attached but anticipate that we will be in a position to submit plans, specifications and quotations within the next few days.\n\nWith regard to the six one-room schools listed in your letter it is noted that the Department is prepared to recommend ordering six buildings from Prefabricated Structures Ltd., and it is presumed that we will be advised in due course if the recommendation is approved. In my letter of April 15th I made a definite recommendation that prefabricated buildings from Prefabricated Structures be used at the six points mentioned and although we are most anxious to have the construction program proceeded with it is not seen that this office can do anything to further the matter at the moment.\n\nI may say that I should like to be in a position to give complete estimates with respect to erection costs but this is not possible at the moment as we have yet to determine whether or not basements are necessary or feasible at some points and have also to make arrangements for the provision of labour at those points where local labour is not available or sufficiently skilled. It should be borne in mind that it might be necessary to employ one or two skilled carpenters preferably with experience in the erection of prefabricated buildings who can proceed from one school site to the next arranging for and supervising installation of foundations or basements and on\ndelivery of the prefabricated sections to the site supervising erection of the buildings at least to the point where they can be completed with local labour. Until we are definitely advised, however, that the purchase of the six buildings from Prefabricated Structures is approved it is difficult to make even tentative arrangements.\n\nW.J. Arnold\n\nW. D. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMarch 18, 1949.\n\nMr. W.S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.,\n\nIndian School Construction Projects 1949-50 Fiscal Year.\n\nThe Estimates for 1949-50 have been approved by Treasury Board, and we are in a position to advise you concerning our plans for erecting day schools in your region. Please find attached a list of the projects and amounts by agencies. Will you kindly, therefore, inform the superintendents concerning these items. We have been in correspondence concerning certain of these projects previously and have discussed some of them with you. You will find attached an information report which I would like to have completed and returned on each project which you would wish to have proceeded with immediately. If there are any projects which you wish to have delayed or wish to have transfers arranged, we would appreciate hearing from you.\n\nAuthority for Undertaking Construction\n\nIn writing to superintendents, please stress the fact that in giving them this information it is not to be interpreted to mean that this is authority for them to undertake any of the work or purchase any materials or equipment. Authority to proceed with work or incur any expenditure will be given by a letter of instruction from this Division and a financial encumbrance number to be quoted on all vouchers, accounts, etc. Until the financial encumbrance number is issued to them, they are not to undertake the work.\n\nInformation Reports\n\nThese information reports have been prepared so that there will be no misunderstanding between field officials and Departmental officials concerning each project. They\nprovide essential facts for our files and also indicate to field officials the procedure for carrying out a project. We would ask that they be completed by the Indian Superintendents concerned in quadruplicate; with two copies to be sent here, one to your office and one for the superintendent's office.\n\nIn writing to your superintendents would you please draw to their attention the following facts concerning these information reports:\n\n(1) Item 3 - Day School Plans\n\nWe have standardized our plans as much as is possible, and the main types are as follows:\n\nOne-Room Schools with Attached Teacherages\n\n(a) Plan No. 832 -\n\nThis is a one-room school with attached teacher's residence and a full basement. It is furnace-heated and is the same type of school previously erected at Seabird Island. Unfortunately, the cost of erecting this type of school has risen until it now requires an expenditure of between $18,000.00 and $20,000.00 to complete it. We feel that this is too high a cost for a one-room school.\n\n(b) Plan No. 888 -\n\nThis is the plan discussed at our recent meeting in Ottawa. Our architects have recently completed the drafts including the changes recommended at the Regional Supervisors Conference. You will note that a sheet has been added providing for combined storage and outdoor toilets shed. This school does not have a basement and is heated by stoves. This is the plan we intend to follow for most of our one-room schools required in 1949-50. We hope it can be erected\nat a sum considerably lower than that required for Plan No. 837.\n\n(c) **Plan No. 865**\n\nThis is an adaptation of Plan No. 837 and provides for the installation of electricity and running water. It is planned for reserves on which Hydro is available near the school site.\n\n**One-Room Schools**\n\n**Plan No. 890**\n\nThis is a one-room school where a teacherage is not required. Copies can be obtained by writing here.\n\n**Two-Room Schools with Attached Teacherages**\n\n(a) **Plan No. 889**\n\nThis is for a two-room school with attached teacher's residence. It has a full basement with Manual Training and Domestic Science rooms and is furnace-heated. It is similar to the Anaham School.\n\n(b) **Plan No. 891**\n\nThis is an adaptation of Plan No. 889 and provides electricity and running water. It is designed for reserves where Hydro is available close to the site of the school.\n\n**Two-Room School**\n\n**Plan No. 738**\n\nThis is for a two-room school without a teacher's residence. It has a full basement and is furnace-heated.\n(2) Item 4 - Method of Construction\n\n(a) Day Labour -\n\nIf a suitable foreman carpenter is available, we have found that this method of construction is quite satisfactory providing close supervision is maintained to ensure that the job does not take too long. Indians can be employed and they are able thus to learn building and carpentering techniques.\n\n(b) Prefabrication -\n\nThis matter was thoroughly discussed at the Regional Supervisors Conference, and as you know, we will be experimenting with a prefabricated steel building this Spring. Additional information can be provided if you so desire.\n\n(c) Contract -\n\nWhile in the past we have been able to approach contractors directly, this will be the exception this year. It is our intention to advertise, and we would appreciate your advice in each case on the projects for which we should advertise immediately.\n\n(d) Supervision -\n\nDay labour construction of course entails supervision by the superintendent concerned. Contract construction also require supervision by the superintendent concerned, but we can call on the Engineering and Construction Division for any assistance required in either the siting or the erection of the building.\n\n(3) Item 5 - Bills of Material\n\nIf the project is to be erected by day labour, we have available bills of materials for most of the above school types. Superintendents concerned can make application for these, and the Departmental Purchasing Agent is prepared to fill requirements as the information in Items 5 and 8 are provided.\n(4) Items 9, 10 and 11 - Essential Services\n\nUnder no circumstances will a construction project be commenced until we are assured of a steady supply of water. We have today too many day schools to which water has to be transported and wish every precaution taken to avoid this in future.\n\nThe availability of Hydro in the vicinity of the school will naturally determine the type of building to be erected. Individual attention will have to be given to each project in this regard.\n\nIt is not our intention to provide oil furnaces or stoves unless wood is not immediately available.\n\n(5) Item 12 - Title to School Site\n\nInstruction as to procedure in securing title can be obtained from the Reserves and Trusts Division.\n\n(6) Items 9 and 13 - Selection of Site\n\nThe three main factors in selecting the school site are:\n\n(a) Proximity to main pupil supply -\n\n(The standard ruling is that children under 10 years of age can be expected to walk up to two miles each way daily, and children of 10 can be expected to walk up to three miles.)\n\n(b) Water Supply -\n\nSee (4) above.\n\n(c) General Suitability -\n\nThis includes playground space (approximately an acre), nearness to roads, and last but not least, Elevation. A school must be located on a site sufficiently high to prevent any basement flooding or\nwater in the playground. Remember that the school will be standing for a good many years and that a careful decision now may save years of trouble later for the superintendent and his successors.\n\n(7) Item 14 - Orientation\n\nOur architects have carefully designed a classroom with maximum window space. Please do not orient the school so that these windows are wasted. They are meant to face in a southerly direction. We also ask that the school be situated sufficiently far from trees which might spoil this window space.\n\nTo summarize, therefore, we would like to have your entire building program under way by April or May so that the schools can be finished and we can avoid rushing projects in September and October. By presenting this information to your superintendents early, we hope that we are helping them to build as many of these schools as possible this Spring and Summer.\n\nBernard F.

We anticipate receiving plans, specifications, etc., from all three of these companies within the next few days.\n\nWe have already written to Superintendent Boys and Anfield with regard to the two room schools with teacherages which will be built at Fort Babine, Hartley Bay, Lakalsap and Kincolith and have received the attached completed questionnaire with regard to each. You will note that Mr. Anfield recommends the erection by contract of prefabricated schools at Hartley Bay, Lakalsap and Kincolith, and that Superintendent Boys recommends the erection of a prefabricated school by contract on a cost plus basis at Fort Babine. It would appear that both Mr. Boys and Mr. Anfield are favourably impressed with the prefabricated buildings erected last year in their Agencies, that of the school at Metlakatla and the office building at Hazelton, but until we receive plans and tenders from the Quonset people and Precision Housing we cannot decide which structure will best meet our needs.

As you are probably aware, we are not interested in constructing on a cost-plus basis unless this can not be completely avoided. The reason that the recommendations of your superintendents are to the effect that these schools be prefabricated buildings, but that they be erected by contract. As you are aware, we prefer the erection of schools by standard means of construction. It may be necessary to advertise immediately for tenders for the construction of building $89. Failing this, we may then be permitted to turn to the building of prefabricated schools. I am referring this matter to the Engineers, but I am afraid that they may insist that we first exhaust the possibilities of erecting schools of standard type construction.\n\nBernard F.

Mr. Arneil intends sending you the same set for approval.\n\nOur dealer states that by reason of the great difficulties of unloading material at some of the Coast Reserves with the lack of docking facilities, a loss of cement through spoilage would be high. To overcome partially this problem, they suggest lengthening the columns of the building to eliminate the concrete wall above grade.\n\nAlso, the gravel problem is major, not only supply but local means of transportation. Availability of good local Indian labour presents another problem. The dealer would necessarily be forced to use his own crews entirely.\n\nThe final plans we prepared will be further detailed, and, revised where necessary to include a floating slab and whatever other inclusions deemed advisable, upon your advice.\n\nThe location of a 350 Quonset house project in Montreal is between Sherbrooke and Notre Dame Streets. Construction will be commenced this week. Other projects of similar size for various industries in Montreal, namely, General Electric and others will soon be under way. The dealers' expected production quota for each project is one house per day. The dealer is Quebec Steel Structures Company, 6999 Cote des Neiges Road, Montreal.\n\nThey will be only too pleased to invite your inspection of their program.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ. N.

Probably it would be advisable to follow the same procedure at Fort Babine.\n\nI may say that although we were aware that it would be necessary for us to advertise for tenders we presumed it would be permissible to call for tenders for the erection of prefabricated schools and with this in mind we have during the past few weeks been endeavouring to secure sufficient information for the preparation of advertisements.\n\nOther items of our school construction program will be the subject of separate communications.\n\nW.S.

You can expect to hear from me at a later date.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMay 16, 1949.\n\nMr. W. S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, British Columbia.\n\nPrefabricated Schools, British Columbia.\n\nI have received a self-explanatory letter from a Quebec Journalist who wishes to do an article on Prefabricated Indian Schools. I attach a copy of this letter and if you have extra copies or photographs of these schools, I would appreciate your forwarding them to me.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nRFB/Em\nMay 16, 1949.\n\nMr. W. S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nSchool Construction Program - British Columbia.\n\nReference your 0-11-3 of April 27 -\n\nWe are still patiently awaiting the completion of the specifications and plans of building 891, which might be more acceptable for the three reserves than plan 889. However, if these are not ready next week, I will write you immediately concerning proceeding with plan 889.\n\nIt will be quite acceptable for Prefabricated manufacturers to submit tenders for erecting these schools when advertisements are called for. I understand that the Great Lakes Steel Corporation intend to do this when we call for tenders. I note that you have been in contact with these companies concerning such advertising.\n\nBernard F.

Residential school Principals should be asked to state their requirements and the Indian Superintendents and yourself should decide if the improvements and equipment that any Principal requests are absolutely essential, and if they should be supplied during the current fiscal year. It is not our general practice to advise Principals what amounts are specifically mentioned in the estimates for their particular school, because these amounts are only a guide towards reaching the total that Parliament provides.\n\nI feel certain that you will only request the expenditures that you consider are really necessary.\n\nBernard F.

Schools - 2 class rooms with teacherage:\n\nI have examined your plans for a two room day school with teacherage which calls for a basement and manual training and sewing room and in comparing this accommodation with the 4-room school that we designed for Bella Bella, I would like you to consider using the Bella Bella school for this accommodation.\n\nThe class rooms can be provided in the upper floor with the sewing and manual training on the lower floor.\n\nWe would place this building on a concrete slab and do not see that there would be any difference in the accommodation or the planning and it would at the same time allow us to use this standard plan or if we were cutting more of these buildings, we could reduce our price if these could be substituted for the 4-room schools with teacherage called for in your letter of April 11th. I would be pleased to have your reaction to this. If you would consider this, we would quote on the four units required.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC.B.K.

Van Norman, wherein he tenders on one and two-classroom schools with living accommodation for teachers.\n\nMr. Van Norman's tender on the one-room school apparently is based on a plan which he secured from Mr. Neary and to which the Precision Housing Company's method of pre-cutting has been applied.\n\nThe two-classroom school to which Mr. Van Norman refers is almost identical to the building which he designed for Bella Bella and the same price, $24,480.00 F.O.B. Vancouver, less installation of plumbing, heating and lighting facilities (approximately $1,800.00) as he cannot, of course, tender on these sub-trades unless the location of the building is specified.\n\nThe above is for your information only as presumably you are not in a position to consider the erection of prefabricated or precut schools unless we are unsuccessful in securing firm tenders for the erection of buildings in accordance with our standard plans.\n\nW.S.

Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nDay School Building Programs - British Columbia.\n\nDear Bill:\n\nI am still waiting anxiously for the final prints of plan 891, as I told you in my previous letter of May 16.\n\nI have decided not to wait much longer for these plans but would suggest the action outlined below:\n\nFort Babine Indian Day School\n\nAs this is a school without hydro, I would suggest that we proceed immediately to advertise for the erection of this two-room school with teachersage, plan 891. Please find attached the draft advertisement which I would like you to check over and if satisfactory, we will arrange to run this advertisement at once. I would suggest that it be advertised in the two main Vancouver papers, the Prince Rupert Daily News and the Interior News at Smithers, B.C. I have marked this advertisement No. 1 and would welcome an early message indicating if advertisement No. 1 is satisfactory or any changes which you would wish to have made in it.\n\nHartley Bay Indian Day School\nLaklumuk Indian Day School\nLincoln Indian Day School\n\nAs you are aware, a two-room school with electricity and running water is being designed and will be termed plan 891. I am sending you a draft advertisement marked No. 2 but we cannot\nproceeded with this advertisement until the plans are in your hands and deemed to be satisfactory. The one thing that concerns me is that the electricity is designed for hydro alternating current and I presume that the power supply at Hartley Bay, Kincolith and Lakalasp will be from a D.C. village lighting plant. I have spoken to Miss Walton about this and will get details of the lighting plants at these three villages from her if possible. I can then advise the electrical engineer accordingly.\n\nI would welcome your comments on advertisement 2 and will hold this in readiness until you have seen the plans and wired your approval to proceed with advertising. As recommended by Mr. Amfield, this advertisement should appear in both Vancouver papers and in the Prince Rupert Daily News.\n\nDouglas Indian Day School\n\nChehalis Indian Day School\n\nThese are one-room schools and teacherages and we have yet to receive the information reports. I presume that plan 686 will be followed and that both these schools could be advertised together. I have therefore drafted advertisement No. 3 which I think would cover these two projects. We should of course have the information reports first and a definite indication that water is available and that the site is satisfactory. However, I will expect a letter from you covering these two schools.\n\nUcluelet Indian Day School\n\nGlascoo Indian Day School\n\nWe will write a separate letter about this based on the information on Inspector Davey's recent report.\n\nTo conclude, therefore, I feel that we can take the following action immediately:\n\n(a) Advertise for tenders for the Fort Babine School\n(b) Advertise for tenders for the Douglas and Chehalis Schools.\nBe prepared to advertise for Hartley Bay, Lakalap and Kincolith Schools as soon as the plans are ready and seen by you.\n\nI sincerely hope that the above meets with your approval and that the advertisements will draw tenders. So far we have been quite pleased with the response received to date in answer to our advertisements on the Prairies and in Eastern Canada.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nB.F. Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nRe: Day School Building Programme\n\nYour file 1-1-5 B.C.\n\nI am enclosing confirmation of my Army Signals message of today's date in reply to your letter of May 27th. I had intended writing you at this time in any case with a view to bringing our proposed construction programme up to date. Insofar as the schools referred to in your letter are concerned, the position is as follows:\n\n(1) Fort Babine School:\nIt is hoped that tenders for the erection of this building, Plan 889, will be called for early in June.\n\n(2), (3) & (4) Hartley Bay, Lakelsap and Kincolith Schools:\nI have wired Mr. Anfield for information with regard to the electric power available at these three points and will include the information should it be received prior to the mailing of this letter.\nThe draft advertisement marked No. 2 is quite satisfactory and I hope will be published at an early date.\n\n(5) Douglas Indian Day School:\nYou will by now have received my letter of May 26th wherein I outlined a proposal regarding the acquisition of five buildings in the vicinity of the Douglas Reserve, three of which will adequately provide for our school accommodation requirements.\n(6) Chehalis Indian Day School:\n\nI am writing you under separate cover pointing out that the existing teacherage will provide ample accommodation for the teachers and that construction should be confined to a single classroom. It has been suggested that a classroom similar to the one erected at Bella Coola several years ago would be quite suitable but we do not appear to have a plan of this building in this office.\n\n(7) and (8) Ucluelet and Claoose Indian Day Schools:\n\nI wrote you on May 19th with regard to these two schools, pointing out that the available pupilage at Claoose did not warrant the construction of a school but that according to information secured by Mr. Davey, children from the Ucluelet and Toquart Reserves could be provided for by the erection of a two room school with teachers quarters on the Ucluelet Reserve.\n\nHydro power is not available on this Reserve and presumably the building erected will be No. 889 unless the Department is in a position to consider Prefabricated or Quonset buildings.\n\nWith regard to the conclusion of your letter, I would comment:\n\n(a) Tenders for the Fort Babine school should be advertised for immediately.\n\n(b) Tenders for the Douglas and Chehalis schools should not be called for until a decision is reached with regard to the acquisition of the five buildings available at the Douglas Reserve and until a plan for a one classroom school without teacherage is available.\n\n(c) Tenders for construction at Hartley Bay, Greenville and Kincolith should be advertised for as soon as information is secured with regard to the available electric power and plans and specifications are complete.\n\nW.S.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: School Construction Projects\nYour File 1-1-5 B3 (E.1)\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of May 10th, there are several school buildings additional to those listed in his letter, construction of which was started last year on which it will be necessary to expend further funds this year. Following is a completed list and the amount necessary to complete the building in each case:\n\nAnaham Indian Day School $3,164.00\nMetlakatla \" $5,000.00\nRedstone \" $500.00\nStony Creek \" $5,000.00\nPemberton \" $7,500.00\nNeskainith \" $3,650.00\nKlemtu \" $500.00\n\nThe Seabird Island Day School building is now completed but we have yet to secure details with regard to expenditures made since March 31st.\n\nIn addition to these expenditures it will be necessary to transfer funds for completion of the classroom block at Kamloops Residential School. I discussed this matter recently with Father O'Grady and was extremely disappointed to learn that very little construction had been carried out last year. As a matter of fact, only the forms for the concrete were built. I have yet to be advised by Father O'Grady what funds will be required for completion of this building.\nI have written or will be writing separately with regard to each of the above-mentioned schools and following a discussion with District School Inspector Davey when he returns from an inspection trip next week, will advise you which of our contemplated school construction projects, in addition to the Alberni classroom block, may be postponed until next year, in order that funds may be made available for completion of the buildings above-mentioned.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Prefabricated Schools - B.C.\nYour File 1-1-5 B.C. (E)\n\nWith reference to Mr. Phelan's letter of May 16th, only one prefabricated school building, that at Klemtu is complete, the others require paint and improvements to the grounds and until this work is done I would not think it would be advisable to supply photographs of the buildings for use of Arthur Prevost. If you wish, however, we can secure photographs from the Superintendents of the buildings as they now are.\n\n-W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: School Building Program\n\nNow that the Department is in a position to proceed with the advertising for tenders for the construction of school buildings this year, it would appear that we should review our entire construction program with a view to arranging transfer of funds where necessary and for the purpose of allotting priority to certain projects and postponing others until further funds are made available.\n\nIn my letter of May 31st I listed certain schools, construction of which was started last year and the amount of funds necessary for the completion of these buildings, a total of $26,334.00. This amount is not the full total, however, as we at that time were awaiting information with regard to the cost of completing the Seabird Island Day School and the Kamloops School block, which information has now been secured.\n\nFollowing is a statement of the amounts needed for the completion of the buildings referred to and for the erection of other buildings for which no specific provision was made:\n\nBuildings listed in my letter of May 31st $26,334.00\nSeabird Island School (This is a rough estimate based on incomplete information available from our files) $3,000.00\nKamloops School block  \nMasset Day School teacherage  \nAlert Bay Day School - Flooring 2,000  \nHeating 3,000  \nInsulation 800  \nPlumbing 700  \n\nConstruction of school at Bella Bella  \nConstruction of 2-room school and teacherage at Gilford Island  \n\nContribution towards capital cost of erection of Provincial school at Campbell River........... 18,700.00  \nContribution towards the cost of erection of Provincial school on Quadra Island (Cape Mudge). 30,000.00  \nContribution towards capital cost of erection of Provincial school, Alberni district........... 26,500.00  \n\n$220,034.00\n\nProjects above referred to with regard to which the Department is not yet informed will each be the subject of a separate communication as the object of writing at this time is to endeavour to present a revised list of projects within the amount of funds appropriated.\n\nThe total of the expenditures referred to above is additional to those referred to in the list received under cover of Mr. Neary's letter of March 18th. The total of the latter list is $401,000.00. It is obviously impossible for us to carry out the entire program this year but at the same time we also find it impossible to delete from our original construction program sufficient projects to make available the funds required for the unforeseen expenditures listed above. As a step in this direction, however, I would suggest that the following construction be deferred:\n\nAlberni classroom block 40,000.00  \nBella Coola teacherage - it is felt that we can successfully arrange for the admission of Indian children to the white school at Bella Coola which will obviate the need for additional classroom space, and that we can make arrangements necessary for accommodation for the teacher without constructing a residence.\nChehalis Day School - this project can be postponed for another year\n\nDouglas Day School - by using buildings available in the vicinity of the Reserve which matter has been the subject of correspondence with you we can save\n\nShalalth teacherage\n\nAlert Bay classroom block - the erection of this block can be deferred for another year if we can utilize buildings from the Port Hardy camp for the erection of 2 additional classrooms which will eventually be required in any case without the classroom block. Additional teacherage accommodation is not essential. The total for these two buildings - $55,000 can be reduced to $25,000, leaving available\n\nCape Mudge - the admission of the Indian children to the white school will obviate the necessity for a 2-room school at this point but replacement of the existing classroom is essential. It is hoped that replacement can be effected at a cost of $15,000, leaving available\n\n$112,000.00\n\nCompletion of all the other buildings referred to in the list enclosed with Mr. Neary's letter of March 18th is essential and I do not see how it can be further reduced to make additional funds available. I can only suggest at this time that priority be allotted to expenditures as follows:\n\n(1) Completion of buildings construction of which was started last year.\n\n(2) Contributions towards the capital cost of Provincial schools where arrangements have been made for the enrolment of Indian children.\n\n(3) Erection of the Bella Bella school which was postponed from last year, and erection of the school at Gilford Island so that we may utilize the buildings available from the Port Hardy camp.\nThe erection of new buildings apart from those which I have eliminated above in accordance with the list submitted under cover of my letter of October 25th, priority to be maintained as set out in the list within the funds available except in those cases where arrangements have already been made to advertise for tenders for the erection of the buildings.\n\nIn conclusion I would like to state that our willingness to postpone certain school construction projects should not be construed to mean that the urgent necessity for construction at these various points has in any way decreased. It is most unfortunate that the necessity for completing certain buildings started last year and the need for funds to meet other unforeseen expenditures should curtail our building program to this extent. It is hoped that additional funds can be secured when Parliament meets again.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nJune 27, 1949\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nW.S.

We will also require an occasional supervisory visit at this school.\n\nHowever, our main difficulty in the erection of two-room schools now lies with the following three projects, all in the Skeena Agency, Prince Rupert, B.C.:\n\nHartley Bay School,\nLakelsew School,\nKincolith School.\n\nIt was our intention to erect these buildings following your plan 691, with which everyone is quite satisfied. However, I have\nreceived a self-explanatory letter from Mr. Arnell concerning the electrical specifications which will render it impossible for this Branch to erect these buildings. I attach for your information a copy of this letter. You will note that Hartley Bay Village has 120 Volt D.C. current and Lekalasop and Lincolith Village have 110 Volt D.C., 60 cycle plants.\n\nHad it not been for the difficulty concerning the installation of electricity, we had intended to advertise for tenders for these three projects. Please find attached also a self-explanatory sample advertisement. I have purposely left the dates blank but you will note that it was our intention to advertise these three projects together. I feel that one contractor will probably be prepared to bid on all three schools and thus save money for the Department.\n\nThis therefore may be taken as an official request for your Branch to assume the responsibility of the erection of these three schools with the request that the electrical specifications for plan 891 be modified to suit the individual requirements of the three villages concerned. Once these specifications have been altered I would request that tenders be called for as soon as possible. We have the funds available for these three projects and had intended to advertise immediately. As I indicated to you on the telephone, construction during the winter should be possible at the three sites selected by Mr. Indian Superintendent Arnell.\n\nI am endeavouring to find out from the Agencies Division further details concerning the lighting plants at these three villages and will write you immediately I have this data on hand.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard E.

In view of the difficulties connected with the changes in the electrical specifications, it is impossible for this Branch to erect these three schools. I have discussed the matter with both the Electrical Engineer and Mr. Buck and they are prepared to assume this responsibility. Not only will this relieve Mr. Arfield and yourself of technical worries but I believe Mr. Buck intends to have one engineer from the Vancouver office selected to supervise all three projects during the course of construction. You will note I have specifically requested that tenders be advertised for immediately and you can rest assured that I will keep in touch with Mr. Buck to expedite this advertising.\n\nBernard F.

We had intended to erect three standard type two-room schools at each of these villages. These schools are designed for communities in which hydro power is available but the electrical specifications are not designed for D.C. plants.\n\nTherefore it has been necessary to request the Lands and Development Services Branch to assume the responsibility of erecting these three schools. It would be appreciated if a search could be made of your files as soon as possible to provide me with further details of these three generating plants. I can then inform Mr. Busk so that his electrical engineer can get to work at once on these changes in specifications required.\n\nBernard F.

Both are in urgent need of attention, and I was wondering if anything could be done to get the same agreement regarding the sharing of costs as exists between the B.C. Branch of your agency and our Department? As you know, in the Peace River area here, which takes in addition to the two schools I mentioned, the school at Fort Nelson, we are under the Alberta division of your Department. I have been unable to finalize any agreement for these schools which would lead to the payment of the net annual cost per pupil for the education of Indian youngsters. If you have a moment to look into this question, I know it would be appreciated by the school boards here and by my successor Mr. Earl Marriott.\n\nI am moving to Chilliwack next week, and I hope that if you are ever in that vicinity you will pay me a call.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nS.

C. Amell, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: New School Programme - Kincolith, Greenville\nand Hartley Bay, Skeena River Agency.\n\nThe Department has recently erected a one-room school by contract at Metlakatla, B.C. This building is a multi-flex unit with teachers' attached. Careful inspection of the completed unit (now painted and ready for occupancy on September 6th, 1949) shows that with minor adjustments by the contractor we have a practical and useful school unit. I am satisfied that it will serve well, operate economically and that the type of construction is suitable and most adaptable for the type of country in the Skeena Agency. The school has been viewed with considerable approval by the Provincial School Inspector, J. Sherrill at Prince Rupert. It is recommended that two-classroom schools of this type, with teachers' attached, be constructed at Hartley Bay, Greenville and Kincolith, with the least possible delay.\n\nI have approached Messrs. Mitchell and Currie, Greer and Bridgen, both contracting firms of Prince Rupert and they refuse to bid on the construction of new schools at these three points, giving isolation of location and risk re transportation as the main reasons. These and other contractors in Prince Rupert have so much other work on hand that they are just not interested.\n\nIt is my firm conviction that these prefabricated schools will have to be erected by day labour and that with competent foremen available they can go up this winter. I have two top flight building foremen available for this work who are\nprepared to work right through the winter on the construction of these three schools. They are presently employed at Cellulose Corporation at Port Edward but will be available when required. They will expect charges hereon on an annual scale for R.C. Arrangements have been completed for living accommodation for those men and two other badly Indian carpenters in each of these villages, as required. Storage facilities for material on all three jobs have been completed.\n\nFull basements will be required for all three schools referred to herein. The weather is predominantly wet in the Skeena River Agency. Basements beneath classrooms will be required for playrooms and those under the teachersages for furnaces and storerooms.\n\nExcavation required for each school will be (all sites are fairly level) based on average depth of 4 feet.\n\nMaterial for 400 cubic yards per school. Cost @ $2.00 per yard. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $1,200.00\n\nConcrete, 150 cub. yds per school @ $12.00. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,800.00\n\nForm lumber (10 M. ft all sizes), nails, wire ties, iron rods, estimated cost. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 750.00\n\nGravel, haulage, per school (100 miles open water) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 250.00\n\nLabour on concrete job, also unloading, approx... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,000.00\n\nEstimated cost of foundation & basement per school $5,000.00\n\nRecapitulation of costs will be approximately as follows:\n\n(1) Foundation as listed herein $5,000.00\n\n(2) Purchase of multi-flex bldg., f.o.b. Vancouver 10,000.00\n\n(3) Freight on building to sites 2 (includes steamship freight and cost of transportation up river and unloading material to school site) 4,000.00\n(4) Erection of building on foundation (labour cost only) $5,000.00\n\n(5) Furnace, installed 2,000.00\n\n(6) Painting (material & labour), less if machine painted 2,000.00\n\n(7) Lighting plant 2\u00bd KW - to handle lights and water pump 856.00\n\n(8) Wiring school - material and labour 850.00\n\n(9) Well water pressure system and plumbing material and labour 800.00\n\n(10) Contingencies and supervision, including cost of hiring stand by boat 2,000.00\n\nEstimated total cost - less furnishings and equipment for classrooms and teachersage........ $32,506.00\n\nIt is recommended that this work be proceeded with on this basis: That the buildings be purchased forthwith and instructions issued to proceed with labour on foundations. Cement, lumber, nails and wire can be purchased from either Philpott-Evitt or Albert and McCaffery, both of Prince Rupert, B.C.\n\nIt will be essential that a gasoline driven concrete mixer be supplied. This might come from the Welfare Vote and be made available for the housing programme.\n\nThe job would be speeded up immensely if a jeep with platform trailer could be supplied. This equipment could be used (if equipped with power take off) for hauling all equipment in a dragline to excavation end as a hoist on the job. It could also move all gravel and material to the site.\n\nThe need for these three schools is desperate, especially Kincolith and Greenville where present buildings are actually unsafe for use. The Department's instructions will be appreciated.\n\nF.F. Anfield\nIndian Superintendent\nprefabricated schools on a day labour basis.\n\nMr. Anfield, in his letter enclosed, gives what we feel is a reasonable estimate of the cost of the prefabricated two-room school at Wincolith, Greenville and Hartley Bay and you will note that he is in a position to make arrangements for the employment of carpenters with qualified supervisors in charge and can, if there is not too much delay in approving the proposal, have the foundations completed before winter conditions set in and will likely be able to complete the buildings before the end of the fiscal year.\n\nIn my reply to your Army Signal referred to above I did not concur in the proposal of advertising for the construction of standard school buildings at these three points for the reason that it is doubtful if any Contractor could undertake construction in these remote places at this late date and even if they did the possibilities of them making any progress before winter are very remote.\n\nPrefabricated Structures have advised that there will be a slight price reduction on school buildings this year and will submit a tender which will be forwarded to you at an early date.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept.

Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Kincolith, Hartley Bay, Lakalsap and Fort Babine Schools\n\nOctober 6th, 1949\n\nWe are greatly disappointed at not receiving a reply to our letter of September 6th wherein the erection of two-room prefabricated schools at the above mentioned points in the Skeena River Agency was recommended, particularly as it is only a matter of weeks until winter conditions will prohibit construction of any kind at these points.\n\nIn order to strengthen our submission covering the purchase and erection of prefabricated schools, District School Inspector Davey and Mr. Webster visited the new two-room school at Pemberton and secured photographs of the building, enlargements of which are attached. They found that the accommodation provided by this building was all that could be desired; that it was most substantially constructed and with one or two very minor changes to provide built-in storage space, was practically ideal. As a matter of fact Mr. Davey, who has only just returned from a visit to the new school at Anaham, is of the opinion that improvements such as those provided convenience of access to the various parts of the building, and appearance, the prefabricated two classroom building with teacherage is preferable to the Department's standard building. With regard to comparative costs of the two buildings, while our figures may not be absolutely accurate they are correct to within two or three hundred dollars, and it is apparent that the building at Anaham cost the Department approximately $35,000 including the lighting plant, whereas the building at Pemberton, including the lighting plant, cost the Department\napproximately $26,500, a saving of $8,500.\n\nIt would appear to me that the Department cannot afford to miss the opportunity of erecting schools at the three points mentioned in the Skeena River Agency this fall and that further we should take advantage of the funds available to purchase now the prefabricated school for erection at Fort Babine next summer. As an indication of the progress made by Supt. Anfield in arranging for the erection of the three schools in his Agency I am enclosing an exchange of Army Signals messages which we have had with him; also his letter of September 27th and enclosures referred to therein. In connection with this exchange I may say that although the erection of prefabricated schools in Mr. Anfield's agency was discussed with him when he was in Vancouver recently, no authority was given to him to proceed beyond clearing of the school sites. This is emphasized in my Signals of October 4th to him.\n\nThere would appear to be no additional information which this office can provide with a view to influencing the Department's decision and consequently we have no alternative but to leave the matter in abeyance until instructions are received.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nP.S. Since the above was written Mr. Davey has brought to my attention the fact that over thirty additional classrooms will be required next year and that construction to date this year will not even meet the needs of the natural increase in the Indian population.\n\nI would strongly urge the purchase and erection of prefabricated schools at the four points above mentioned which will reduce the number required and place us in a better position next year insofar as meeting our school construction requirements is concerned.\nMr. W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nOctober 15, 1949.\n\nTo: Regional Supervisors and Indian Commissioner.\n\nDAY SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM - 1950-51.\n\nAs you are aware, we will shortly be preparing our estimates for the 1950-51 fiscal year. As usual, we intend to concentrate on the erection of our main requirements, namely one and two-room schools.\n\nWe have already received from Mr. Ostrander the outline of his projected building program in Saskatchewan. It would be appreciated if you would forward similar outlines for your regions.\n\nIn British Columbia Inspector Innes will of course be able to provide an outline of requirements, to conduct educational surveys and to assist with site selections. In the other districts we cannot make any definite report as to the progress being made concerning Departmental school inspectors. Major Clark is on the road in the three Prairie Provinces now and will be available for use as required by the Regional Supervisors concerned.\n\nOne-room Day Schools.\n\nWe appreciate the limitations of plan No. 386. While it provides a very satisfactory classroom, it has to be heated by a stove or space heater located in the classroom and a small heater has also to be provided in the teacher's residence. We are requesting the Departmental Architects to modify this plan somewhat by providing a sub-basement in which a small furnace can be provided.\nto heat both the classroom and the teacher's residence. As soon as these plans are finished a copy will be sent to you for study.\n\nIn addition to the above type of one-room school we are also requesting the Architects to provide a new version of a one-room school building for reserves on which electricity is available and where running water can be installed. You can therefore anticipate the provision of plans for the following types of one-room schools:\n\n(a) where electricity is not available,\n\n(b) where electricity is available and running water can be provided.\n\nTwo-room Schools.\n\nOur recent experience in advertising for tenders in British Columbia has convinced us that the two-room school plans will also have to be modified very considerably. We are requesting the Architects to provide a two-room school without a full basement. A small sub-basement will be located centrally in which a furnace can be installed to heat both classrooms and teachersage.\n\nAs in the case of one-room schools, two types of two-room schools will be provided:\n\n(a) where electricity is not available,\n\n(b) where electricity is available and running water can be provided.\n\nInformation Report.\n\nIt is our intention to use these information reports again this year as they provided a valuable source of information during the present fiscal year. We were able to avoid a great deal of unnecessary correspondence by reference to these reports.\nSUMMARY.\n\nIt is requested that the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia and the Regional Supervisors for Alberta and Manitoba provide the Education Division with a list of their requirements in one and two room schools for the 1950-51 fiscal year. Many requests are made by local Indian Superintendents without sufficient investigation. This has led to embarrassment by the inclusion in the Estimates of items which should have been omitted and by the omission of items which should have been included.\n\nNew one and two-room schools are being designed and the plans and specifications and bills of materials will be available by February, 1950, when they will be mailed to you.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nEND OF REEL", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-06", "created": "2025-10-06", "metadata": {"Source-File":
