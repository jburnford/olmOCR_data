We do not mean to speak disrespectfully of the gentlemen who at present constitute the N.W. Council. They comprise as good men in every respect as are to be found in the Territories, and have no doubt been quite equal to deal with such matters as concern them, but when we consider what really constitutes the momentum questions of the day for the people of the Territories, the proceedings of our Councils unmixed with part that we read in the Lieut-Governor's speech and the reply thereto. We notice from the latter that it is intended during the next session to send representatives to the Federal authorities, but beyond urging some modification of the present liquor laws, and the granting of money bonuses to local or branch railways, we have no hint as to the measures to be entered upon. As to the brevity question and the present system of liquor permits, it is not long since we sufficiently clearly explained our views, and it is unnecessary for us to add anything to what we have repeatedly urged directly and indirectly with regard to encouragement of railways. But what strikes us, if we may make a statement standing on its own feet, is entirely omitted wants and grievances that is of representation in the Dominion Parliament. We say this not only because we all feel that we are being governed in a manner utterly unsuited to our requirements, but because we know that such representation could not fail to speedily bring about the redress of all our other grievances. We urge this will be peculiarly true and most necessary when the extension of the franchise to some two millions of British subjects is the all absorbing topic of interest in the Domestic policy of the Government, and when the voices of three Fathers have been solemnly warned that by endeavoring to frustrate this it is most seriously endangering its very existence. Now we are of opinion that the North West Council will be a great gain for any project of representation to the Federal authorities of more importance to the people whose interests they represent than this, nor do we see how such a course on their part could fail to produce serious attention. We have already expressed our want of faith in petitioning matters to Ottawa, unless presented in such a way as to render the perusal and consideration of them absolutely certain, and it occurs to us with regard to these being prepared, that the District that they might have a better chance of success if presented through the Council, which we are sure would not refuse to forward and endorse them.\n\nTHE INDIANS.\n\nIt would undoubtedly be very gratifying to us all to receive the assurance of His Honor, Lieut-Governor Dewdney, who is also Indian Commissioner, to the effect that \"despite the exaggerated reports which have been circulated to the prejudice of the country,\" there is no attempt to prevent amongst the Indians of the Territories, were it possible we are in a position to assure them that we are doing our utmost to prevent the truth from being known. The reports circulated must be most prejudicial to our interests we are only too well aware, and that is one of our reasons for having on several occasions raised our voice in demonstration against the treatment calculated to keep the Indians in an unsettled and disoriented frame of mind. With regard to the reports alluded to by His Honor, we have received information from those who have been in the midst of the disturbances, for saying that the reports were in the main in no wise exaggerated, nor was the true interest of the country be in any way endangered by them. Those best qualified to judge express the opinion that nothing but the determined pluck, coolness and resolution of Major Crozier, added to the excellent discipline of the police under his command (upon which we heartily congratulate the officers and men) prevented an outbreak, the horrible results of which are impossible to more than one. Before this outbreak, it was contended generally that the Indians were very indifferently provided with arms and ammunition, and it is a painfully significant indication of what must have been for long past the state of mind of these savages, to find them on the first symptom of a row springing up to a man better armed than the police themselves. Were there any imperable difficulty in obtaining arms, we should quiet, we could only deplore the present state of things, but when we consider how easily all this might be prevented we can not restrain our righteous indignation. Neither the cattle nor the crops are far to seek. The settlers of the district by the white man has driven away the herds of buffalo which formed the main support of the Indians. To compensate for this they are put by the Government on starvation rations, starved themselves by farming; but considering the utter unreasonableness of asking an Ehu to change his skin, common sense would lead us to conclude that the actual necessities of life to even such Indians as can be only induced to do a very little towards their own support instead of the present scale of almost starva- tion. Again it is a matter of strong import that the abode of settlers, who include numbers of women and children, should be exposed to the horrible possibilities of an Indian outbreak, by the Govern- ment allowing the Indians to roam at large, as many of the towns in the districts have proved themselves to be, some of whom in the event of an outbreak, should they by any chance escape the savages, would probably as the case of the white man be lynched by the white settlers.\n\nJAMES SINCLAIR\nMerchant Tailor.\n\nGENTS' FURNISHINGS.\n\nCONSUMPTION\n\nFits, Epilepsy, or Falling Sickness.\n\nPERMANENT REMEDY\u2014GUARANTEED INFALLIBLE FIT PREPARATION.\n\nThis preparation is guaranteed to remove all fits and convulsions, and to prevent their recurrence.
