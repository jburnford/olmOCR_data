If the amount payable to the Telegraph Creek Public School was computed at these rates the payment would be much higher than that requested by the Official Trustee and under these circumstances I recommend that the account be paid at $91.00.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada. This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No. dated.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 506\n\nReq. 1876\n\nVoucher No.: 91\n\nDate: November 14, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We allow a fair grant towards the teacher's salary and it is felt that the local school trustees should supply the necessary equipment other than the books required for the Indian children in attendance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Perry Esq from Victoria, B.C. is now paying this Agency a visit of inspection. Upon visiting the local school it was found that the seating accommodation for the Indian School children was short a matter of 10 desks.\n\nI was then instructed to write the Department requesting that some assistance be given this school and that 10 Desks be furnished for the Indian children's use.\n\nIf this request can be granted, may an Order Wire be sent to Indian Agent Ball of Vancouver B.C. instructing him to order this number of Desks from The Crown Manufacturing Co. of Vancouver B.C. and that same be despatched at once, so that the last river boat going up the Stikine River might bring same.\n\nThe sizes of the desks required would be all medium.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF C. C. PERRY, ASST. COMMISSIONER FOR B. C., HIS NO. 45/18704, DATED AUGUST 30, 1930, FORWARDED UNDER COVER OF COMMISSIONER DITCHBURN'S 45/18751, DATED SEPTEMBER 5, 1930, ADDRESSED TO DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL.\n\nOriginal on 77-158.\n\nTELEGRAPH CREEK\nINDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nSeveral of the 19 Indian children who attend the Provincial Public School are in need of better desk accommodation, there being insufficient desks for their use. Agent Reed was advised to ask the Department to authorize the purchase of new desks as may be reasonably required, not exceeding ten in number. Some school books are also wanted for which the Agent will make requisition. It is thought that assistance should be granted in the manner suggested, since no school tax is imposed in the district either upon white or Indians and the school is remotely situated. In a conversation with one of the local school trustees, Mrs. Hyland, I was advised that difficulty is experienced in securing from the Provincial Education Department sufficient equipment for the proper carrying out of school work here. No doubt, lack of school taxation in Telegraph Creek is responsible.\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer to the report of the Assistant Indian Commissioner dated August 30th in regard to his inspection of the Stikine Indian Agency. On page ten (10) he refers to School Affairs at Telegraph Creek. This portion of the report was sent to the Provincial Department of Education which points out that that Department provides free of cost to rural districts all pupils' desks that are required in any of the rural schools of the Province, and that all that is necessary is for the School Board to apply to the Education Department giving the actual number of desks of each size (small, medium or large) that are needed at the school. The district itself is expected to provide all other necessary equipment and supplies for the teacher. As a large number of Indian children are in attendance at Telegraph Creek the Superintendent of Education considers it to be in order for the Department of Indian Affairs to make a small yearly grant of say $25.00 to $30.00 for school supplies and maintenance.\n\nI have sent instructions to Agent Reed to take the matter of the school desks up with the School Board at Telegraph Creek with a view to their making requisition for necessary school desks.\n\nWith regard to other equipment and maintenance, I would recommend that this Department provide a grant as indicated by the Superintendent of Education. The same could be expended when necessary by arrangement between the Indian Agent, the local Trustees and Board of Education.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Ditchburn.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nP/AC\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I wish to correct the impression that there is a large attendance of Indian children at this school. For the past year, the average attendance has been but 6. The Department pays the teacher $600 for the academic year and provides classroom supplies to the extent of about $20 per annum. In view of this, do you still think that we should make a yearly grant towards maintenance?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nBox 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of Departmental letter dated October 4th, No.158-5-5, with reference to the accommodations for Indian children at the combined public and Indian day school at Telegraph Creek.\n\nIn reply thereto I beg to say that during the visit of the Assistant Commissioner to Telegraph Creek he was informed that there were 19 Indian children enrolled and on referring to these in my communication of September 15th as being a large number, this was intended to be comparative as the institution is but a small rural school. In view of the fact that the Department is already providing classroom supplies to the extent of about $20.00 per year, I beg to say it is thought that if the grant referred to in my previous letter is to be made the amount therein should be inclusive of the $20.00 referred to by the Department. I would suggest that the grant be made elastic as between $20.00 and $30.00 per year and should be drawn upon as the interest of the Indian children at this school may demand upon the record of attendance and the Agent's reports.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

The cost of these supplies will be in excess of the amount we provide towards the teacher's salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E.

I have the honor to report that I spoke to the Indians on this subject during my visit there the end of July, and found that the Indians had been chary in making promises with regard to a school, they having been promised a teacher before on two occasions and been disappointed; however they expressed themselves as being very anxious to have their children taught and offered the use of a house for teaching in till Mr. Swartout settled on a site for erecting a schoolhouse, they also offered to give a piece of land for the purpose. The tribe number 172 and there should be an attendance of 20 pupils. Mr. Swartout would like to make a trial of the school before building.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour Ob'dt.

Mr Swartout for permission to establish an Indian School at Ucluelet, which report should have accompanied your letter of the 29th ultimo; and in reply I have to refer you to the concluding paragraph of Departmental letter of the 10th inst., in which you were informed that the Department could make no payment for this school, no funds for the purpose having been provided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFor Deputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nA.W.Vowell, Esq:\nIndian Supt.\nVictoria, B.C.\nSir,\n\nIn answer to your letter of the 18th inst., I beg to state that the name of the Tribe referred to in my tabular statement is Cowichan Lake Band number on last Census 172 of children 45, of School age 22. The number of children and young people likely to attend school is 30. Since Mr. Swartout's application I have had an opportunity of meeting the whole of the Tribe, those I spoke to expressed their wish to have a school but said they would not make great promises till they saw the school started as they had been promised a school by Missionaries several times before which promises had not been fulfilled. The name of the Reserve on which the school is to be established is St. Thomas it is situated near the entrance of Melville Arm, Western side of Barclay Sound. I think if the school is opened the attendance would only be good two quarters in the year during the winter months; it is hard to give an opinion as to the utility of the school without making a trial, which as Mr. Swartout has obtained permission to use the late Agency House on that Reserve will not be difficult or expensive.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\nHarry Guellod\nAgent\nBritish Columbia,\n\nIndian Office.\n\nVictoria, 26 September 1894\n\nBranch.\n\nSir,\n\nIn connection with the Rev. Mr. Stewart's application for permission to establish an Indian school at Metlakatla in the West Coast Agency I have the honour to enclose herewith Mr. Agent Guilford's last report relative thereto.\n\nThis Report appears to contain all the information requested in your letter of the 10th instant. I beg however to explain that in the \"Annual Report of the Department for Indian Affairs\" for the year ending 30th June 1893, the name of the Tribe is spelled Ethel-with-lahk whereas Mr. Guilford spells the name Ethel-with-lahk substituting \"e\" for \"m\" in the first syllable of the name of the Tribe and \"e\" for \"w\" in the second syllable.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAlv.

The facts concerning it, are the following:\n\n1. The School was opened about the beginning of September, 1894.\n\n2. Mr. Swartout, our Missionary, a practical teacher of Normal School standing, and of some years experience, is at present, taking charge of the school, and reports that there are 45 names on the roll of whom 23 are between 5 and 17 years of age; of the remainder 19 are over 17 years, and 3 or 4 are outsiders temporarily residing in that vicinity.\n\n3. The average attendance, so far, has been only 10 or 11, which is partly owing to the location of the building, but chiefly due to the untamed character of the people.\n\nMr. Swartout cherishes the hope that after some time and considerable patient struggle, the average will be twenty (20) at least.\n(2) Mr. Reed.\n\n4. The F. M. C. has engaged another competent teacher, Mr. J. W. Russell, who is also a young man of experience, and devoted to the welfare of the Indians. He expects to enter upon his duties in a few days.\n\n5. Application was made last year for a grant for a School at this point, by Mr. Swartout, through Mr. Guillo, the Agent at Alberni. That correspondence is in the hands of the Department. It was therefore thought well to renew the application this year to the Department directly, and thus avoid delay.\n\nHoping the Government will give this application favorable consideration, and find it possible to make such a grant as the facts of the case will justify.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSec'ty F.

I trust it will be possible for you to secure an annual grant, and in doing so you may feel assured that you are contributing towards the support of men who command our absolute confidence. I do not think we have in all our service better men than Mr. Swartout and Mr. Russell, whose educational attainments and moral worth fit them in an eminent degree for the responsibilities laid upon them. Already we are receiving reports that are very encouraging, as to their influence in that region.\n\nDr. Moore has kindly sent me your letter, dated Aug. 20th., as to the liquor trade in British Columbia, which I shall submit in due time to our Committee.

His widow & daughter, a girl of perhaps 20 years of age remain there & the Church propose to allow them a salary to carry on the school & attend to evangelistic work among the Indians. The suggestion is that Mrs. Swartout should carry on the day school but should have permission to allow her daughter to assist or take her place in the school if her health should not always allow her to teach. The girl passed for the High School a year or two ago & is a very quiet steady lady. Mrs. Swartout is also, I think quite qualified to teach such a school but neither of them have a certificate & the Church writes me asking if that fact or allowing them both to teach would interfere with the grant from the Dept. I am going to Ucluelet next week & will have an opportunity to notice how they get on with the work but meantime have the honor to enquire whether you would have any objection to Mrs. Swartout being appointed teacher, tho not holding a diploma & also whether the daughter might be allowed to assist in the teaching occasionally, subject of course to there being no falling off in the work of the school. They are not of course well off & the Church would like to help them. I do not think there would be any danger of deterioration to the school.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour Obedient Servant,\n(sgd.) A.W. Neill.\n\nA.W. Vowell Esq.,\nSupt.

I am sorry if we neglected to notify you of Mr. Vanderveen's application and to seek the Department's approval of his appointment. The correspondence with him was conducted in October last, although he did not enter upon his duties until February.\n\nIn his application he states that he has had a High School education, followed by a special course at Cornell University. Before going west he had two year's city mission work, and during the three years of his service at the Regina School, whilst he was farm instructor, he came into touch with every department of the work on the Reserve, as well as the school; We felt that we could scarcely expect to get a man with better qualifications for so secluded a spot as Ucluelet. He was very highly recommended by Mr. Eaton, the principal of the Regina school, as well as by Rev. Mr. Henry, Presbyterian minister at Regina. So far I believe the indications are that the appointment is a good one. He seems to have entered into his work with a good deal of interest and writes as though enjoying it.\n\nThe frequent changes amongst the workers in the Indian work is embarrassing, but I think we are gradually getting a higher grade into the service. We have probably on the Plains one or two yet who are not very efficient, but all the others are, I believe, capable and doing satisfactory work. I hope Mr. Vanderveen's appointment will meet with your approval.\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.F.M./MBA.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

You will be good enough to point out to him the necessity of his interesting the children in their class-room work so that they may be encouraged to make greater progress. He should, also, put forth his best efforts to create, among the parents, a friendly interest in the work being done at the school, so that they will send their children regularly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG.A.Cox, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlberni, B.C.\nOttawa, September 26, 1916.\n\nRev.

If five pupils were taken each year from this\nreservation and enrolled in the Ahousaht boarding school,\nthen the Ucluelet Bay school could be closed and I am\nsatisfied that the results from an educational standpoint\nwould be much more satisfactory.\n\nThis (object) change could perhaps be brought\nabout now as Mr. Vandersteen expects to become the\nprincipal of Ahpushat boarding school in place of Mr.\nRoss who has resigned.\nMr. D.

T. Ross, missionary and teacher at Ucluelet, be asked to conduct services at Kildonan Cannery and Numuckmus, as well as at Ucluelet, provided the Government will allow Mrs. Ross to take charge of the school in his absence.\n\n(2) To recommend that the Women's Missionary Society provide Mr. Ross with $200 per year for travelling expenses.\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary.\nOttawa, April 24, 1917.\n\nRev.

In looking up our files I find that we are only receiving from the Government at the rate of $400 per year for this work. Would it not be possible for the Government to increase the salary of Mr. Ross? You are giving us at the rate of $750 a year for Mr. Vandersteen, the teacher at Ahousaht. It would seem reasonable that a rule which applies to a school like Ahousaht should also apply to Ucluelet.

You will, by this time, have my letter of the 12th, in which I suggest the name of Miss Gertrude Lawrence. I think the Department should give her $50 extra and make her salary $75 a month for the teaching months.\n\nI am not sure whether you have been in the habit of closing the school at Ucluelet during July and August. If you are planning to do this during the present summer it would hardly be worth Miss Lawrence's while going forward.\n\nHas it been the policy of the Government to pay the railroad fare of the teachers going to work, or will Miss Lawrence have to take care of this expense herself?\n\nI have taken up the matter of accommodation of the teacher with our W.M.S. and they notify me that we have a mission house at Ucluelet which can be used by Miss Lawrence. She is quite prepared to take possession of this. I understand that the house has been furnished in part at least by our women so the teacher should be very comfortable. Mr. Ross may be in the house now but he will leave soon. I do not expect he will live in Ucluelet, as this will not be the centre of his work. He will, of course, take charge of the work at Ucluelet.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/CMcC.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Mr. McLean:\n\nSince writing you the other day, I am teacher for Ucluelet. I have had an interview with Miss Gertrude Lawrence. Miss Lawrence was teacher at the Assiniboia School, Saskatchewan for some time, and I understand she gave very satisfactory service to the Government. The reports we had from our representatives indicate that she was a very efficient teacher. She is willing to take the work at Ucluelet, but, of course, could not do so at a salary of $400.00 a year. When she was in Saskatchewan, the Government paid her $720 per year. Salaries have gone up a little since that, so I would judge that she should receive $75 a month for the ten teaching months. She would be satisfied with a salary of $750 per year.\n\nKindly let me know if you approve of the appointment of Miss Lawrence at this salary.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/GMcC.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6417, file 850-1, part 1)\nOttawa, April 12, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant in reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Ucluelet Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that for a suitable teacher for this school, who will give all her time to teaching, the Department will be prepared to allow a salary of from $600.00 to $700.00 per annum, according to qualifications. Kindly let the Department know whether you have anyone in view for this position and, if so, the salary that you think should be allowed.\n\nThe Department would also like to know what accommodation there is for a teacher at this point.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Ross, teacher at Ucluelet Indian Day School on the Pacific Coast has tendered his resignation. We had a similar notice from Mr. Ross.\n\nAt the meeting of our Board of Home Missions held last week, there was before us a request from the Presbytery of Victoria, recommending \"that Rev. J. T. Ross be appointed missionary at Barkley Sound\". We agreed to the appointment of Mr. Ross as missionary. He will now give all his time to this work. He has been provided with a motor boat and will do the work of missionary on the Sound.\n\nThis leaves the day school at Ucluelet without a teacher. I have taken this matter up with our Home Mission Convener for the Presbytery and with our District Superintendent, Dr. Wilson. They assure me that it would be quite impossible for them to secure a teacher for $400. You will remember that I wrote you January 7th in regard to this. You replied January 14th, that the Department is unable to allow more than $400. As the arrangement has been previously, our Board gave Mr. Ross\nMr. J. D. McLean.\n\nApril 8/18.\n\n$500 and the Department gave him $400, making a salary of $900. Now that Mr. Ross is to give all his time to missionary work, I presume it will be necessary to employ a teacher who will give all her time to teaching.\n\nKindly advise us what we should do in the matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJHE/CMcG.\nMarch 30, 1918\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Department's letter, No. 118335/1, dated March 18, 1918, reporting resignation of Rev.

This was increased to $720.00 on the first of January, 1911, and she remained at this school until June 30th, 1916. She was appointed teacher at Ucluelet on September 4th, 1918, at $750.00 and remained there until June 30th, 1919, when she was transferred to the Cote's Day School at the same salary and left there on December 31st, last. It is now requested that she be again appointed teacher at Ucluelet at an increased salary of $900.00 per annum.\n\nShe has a Second Class Professional Ontario Certificate, with normal training, and also a Second Class Professional Certificate for Alberta.\n\nInspector Cairns, reporting on her work at Ucluelet, states that the school had a successful year, largely due to the fact that the teacher has been zealous and efficient. She knows how to present a lesson so as to interest the pupils. Her reason for leaving Ucluelet was lack of accommodation, and she thought the salary should equal that paid to the public school teachers in the same community.\n\nI should be pleased to be informed as to whether\nher appointment as teacher at Ucluelet should be approved,\nand, if so, whether she be granted a salary at the rate of\n$900.00 per annum.\n\nEnrollment: 20\nAverage: 10\n\nIndian Affairs.

Wilson, our District Superintendent for British Columbia, in which he intimates that Rev. J. F. Ross who has charge of the Indian school at Ucluelet, has resigned. His resignation is to take place Mar. 31st. Dr. Wilson says that he has been fortunate in securing Miss G. Lawrence a former teacher and he is taking the liberty of offering her the school at a salary of $900 per year, here work to begin April 1st. I trust this will be satisfactory to the Department. Miss Lawrence gave satisfaction to all concerned when she had charge of this work before.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/EB\n\nIndian Affairs.

McLean,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAt the meeting of the Executive of our Board held last week I conferred with Dr. Wilson, our District Superintendent from Vancouver, in regard to securing a teacher for Ucluelet. Dr. Wilson strongly advised that a male teacher should be sent to an isolated point like Ucluelet. It does not seem possible to keep a lady teacher there for any length of time. While we had our missionary Mr. Ross living there, the teacher stayed with them and seemed contented, but now the situation is different. Dr. Wilson says he could secure a male teacher but fears he could not accomplish this with a salary of $750. He thinks he could secure a man on the coast for $900 or $1000. Through him I learn that the Government is already paying $900 to some of the Indian teachers on the coast, and at schools where the attendance is no larger, if as large.

I shall, therefore, be pleased if you will take up the matter of nominating a suitable teacher for this school, and submit the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher obtained. I may add that a change was made in the summer holiday period at this school.

That meant $225 for the March and June quarters, $90 for the September quarter, and $275 for the December quarter. With the $150 bonus, there was a total of $960, instead of the $1050 which I had reported for the previous years.\n\nI am wondering whether all day-school teachers lost in the same way by the change in payment. Whether it was an oversight that I did not receive the $90 which I thus lost.\n\nI will be glad to have you look into\nDominion of Canada\n\nOffice of the Inspector of Taxation\n\nDistrict of\n\nBRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nMiss Gertrude Lawrence,\n(Indian Reserve),\nUcluelet, B.C.\n\n402 Pender St. West,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSept. 12th, 1934.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nReferring to the 1923 Income Tax Return filed by you, I note that you show income Item #1, Salaries or Wages received $960.00, whereas your employer reports having paid you $1050.00.\n\nPlease advise me by return mail which is the correct amount. If you dispute the amount paid you, it will be necessary to obtain a certificate from your employer setting forth the correct amount.\n\nAs this information is essential to making up your assessment, your prompt attention is required in order to avoid penalties for default as set forth in the Act.\n\nYours truly,\n\nC.

We are informed by the Presbyterian Church authorities that Miss Gertrude Lawrence intimated to them that she had changed her mind and would remain as teacher for a while at least. It will, therefore, not be necessary to secure another teacher at the present time. As a change was made in the holiday period at this school, in accordance with your request of June 5th, last - the school being closed during the months of September and October - it is presumed that Miss Lawrence will return in time to resume duties on the first of November, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Miss Lawrence, in the early summer, intimated her desire to give up the work at Ucluelet but in a communication we received about September 1st, she intimated that she had changed her mind and would remain for a while at least.

Prior to 1918, the missionary on the reserve taught the school, but for seven years Miss Gertrude Lawrence was the incumbent. She lived with the missionary.\n\nI am very desirous of having this activity re-opened and I should be grateful if you would let me know if you have a missionary at this point. If so, there should be no difficulty in securing a young lady who would be well qualified for the post.

I am writing again today and I trust that the class will commence some time in January. There is no teacher's residence at this school, but there is good accommodation at the missionary's home.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nIndian Affairs Dept.,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nI am asked by a resident of Ucluelet, B.C., to ask why there is not a teacher for the Indian day school there. He says that he is on the School Board and the Indians are applying to him to be permitted to attend the White School. My friend says he took it up with the head of the Union Mission Society and was told they could not find a suitable teacher. By that he means somebody that will do missionary work as well. So far as teachers are concerned it is notorious - there is a large surplus available. I could name one or two in Alberni.\n\nMy friend seems to think that your Department gives a grant of around $1000, a year but if I recollect right it is only $75.00 a quarter - is it not? At the\nsame time if the Union Church undertakes to keep\na teacher there they ought to do so irrespective\nof his or her qualifications as a missionary.\n\nI am told that there are nearly thirty\nchildren available. Probably the children would be\nmuch better off if they were sent to the good boarding\nschool you maintain at Alberni but there will be some\nthat cannot pass the medical examination and also it\nserves as a recruiting ground for the boarding school.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nAWN:A\n\nA.

The Department is taking this matter up with the authorities of the United Church of Canada, under whose auspices this school is conducted, and requesting them to nominate the services of a teacher in time to begin duties when the school reopens after the summer holidays, and you will be informed later of the name of the teacher nominated for this school. In view of the fact that Mr. McDevitt is giving up duties at the end of June, next, the usual summer holidays will be taken during the months of July and August, and the new teacher, when appointed, will begin duties on or about September 1st, 1930.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The action taken by you in this regard is approved and it is noted that this arrangement is to replace that mentioned in your letter of the 13th instant to continue the school in operation until the second week in August.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Palmer on the 16th instant found it advisable to close the school for two weeks owing to several fresh cases of Measles having occurred among the Indians, and the school was so closed.\n\nAs several of the Indians whose families are not affected are moving to other points to avoid the disease, the attendance at the school after two weeks, if it is then found advisable to re-open the school, would so materially reduced that the number of scholars would not warrant it; I have therefore instructed the teacher to close the school for the summer holidays from the 20th instant, for two months, instead of as suggested in my letter above quoted.\n\nTrusting that this action will meet the approval of the Department,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEd.

In this connection it is noted that the Indians will be leaving for the various fishing plants at the end of this month and that the number of pupils who would remain after that time would not warrant keeping the school open until the middle of August, as was authorized by the Department. This school may therefore close for the summer holidays at the end of the present month until the first of October, next. You should inform the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to refer to Department letter No.159-27-1 of June 22nd, re the closing of the Ucluelet Day for the summer holidays.\n\nI beg to advise the Department that owing to the fishing season being early this year, that is, fish running earlier than usual, a majority of the Indians whose children form the pupilage of the Ucluelet Day School, will be leaving Ucluelet for the various fishing plants at the end of this month and the number of pupils that will be at Ucluelet after that time will not warrant keeping the school open until the middle of August as authorized by the Department letter above quoted.

F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni,\nB.C.\nSir;-\n\nI have the honour to submit for the consideration and decision of the Department the suggestion of the teacher of the Indian Day School at Ucluelet, B.C., that the said school should delay the summer holidays until the middle of August, provided that the attendance remains such as to warrant that action.\n\nI beg to recommend the above suggestion. The attendance at the school is still good and is likely to remain fair until about the second week in August when the Indians will in all probability move to fishing plants for dog salmon fishing.\n\nShould the Indians move from the vicinity of the school unexpectedly before that time the Department will be so advised immediately.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 16, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, with reference to the summer holidays at the Ucluelet Indian Day School.

In reply I beg to say that, if the teacher and yourself are of the opinion that the school should be continued in operation until that time, the Department will approve of this arrangement. As this school was re-opened in January last, having been closed for nearly two years, it is considered that it might be to the advantage of the Indian children to have the school continued as long as there is a sufficient number in attendance to warrant keeping the school open.\n\nI should be pleased to hear from you about the middle of August next in further reference to the question of holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Neill, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nOn making the customary Reserve patrol when in Ucluelet and investigating certain reports that had been given by Indians, according to your instructions I investigated the reported religious activities at the Ucluelet Indian Church on the Itatscoo #1 Reserve.\n\nOn Sunday 26th, February, 1933, at 10 P.M. I arrived at the Ucluelet Indian Church on the Itatscoo Reserve. There I found the Indians and Miss Ryckman together with Mrs. Moore (a sister of Miss Ryckman, the teacher and missionary), engaged in a strange religious practice. These practices seemed to consist of working the Indians up to a frenzy and then they would all chant and some of the Indians would come up to the front of the Church and face the wall and after some time had elapsed they would start to break into an unintelligible gibberish, this gibberish was neither English, Chinook or the Indian language. I watched for some time and then the Indians started to leave the front of the Church, then noticed that there were several prostrate on the floor and that there was what appeared to be a sheet, or some white cloth fastened up to the wall and that the Indians had been facing this. During the time I was there I heard no religious instruction of any kind, but songs were chanted and religious ejaculations were heard throughout the crowd. Mrs. Moore was at all times at the front of the church and was passing through the Indians and inciting them in these demonstrations, while Miss Ryckman was at the rear of the church, holding her hands over her head and chanting. I left the vicinity of the church shortly after the closing of the services at 11:45 p.m. and proceeded to the M.S. Duncan Scott where I made my verbal report to you.\n\nI have enquired from some of the most reliable Indians re these services and they all report that it is the practice to hold them very late at night and that they are held every night but Monday.\n\nEd. E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nConstable, R.C.M.P.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6417, file 850-1, part 1)\nSir:\n\nAs requested by you, I made a patrol of the Ucluelet Indian Reserve (Itatsoo No. 1) on Sunday March 12th 1933.\n\nOn arriving near the Church my attention was called to unusual sounds apparently coming from the vicinity of the church. I went over to that building and looked through the window; there were about a dozen persons in the Church, two of whom were white women, and the rest Indians. They were practicing what appeared to be some form of religious ceremony or rite; they were chanting, moaning and posturing and making unintelligible noises also waving their arms and gesturing. There was some object on the wall at the end of the Church, that they seemed to be attracted to; I could not make out what it was. I arrived at the church at approximately 11 p.m. and left at approximately 12 noon at which time the service was still continuing.\n\nOn questioning an Indian youth (one Willie Tutube) who was on the sidewalk by the Church, he informed me that one of the white women taking part in the service was Mrs. Moore, a sister of Miss E.B. Ryckman, the United Church Missionary teacher at the Ucluelet School. Miss Ryckman was the other; he also stated that these services are held a number of times each week and that they often lasted until 2 or three o'clock in the morning.\n\n(Signed) A.L. Frost,\nConstable, B.C. Police.\nOttawa, April 18, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received - no doubt, in error - the enclosed communication addressed to you from a constable of the R.C.M.P., Port Alberni, as well as a copy of a communication from a constable of the British Columbia Police, regarding an investigation made by them into the religious activities being carried out by the teacher at the Ucluelet Indian Day School. I would request that you furnish the Department with your comments regarding the matter mentioned in the reports, together with any recommendation you wish to make.\n\nIt is considered that it would be advisable to request the Church authorities to make a change in the teaching services at this school for the coming school year, but, before doing so, the Department would like to have your views regarding the religious practices being carried on under the teacher and her sister. When replying, please return the enclosed correspondence or copies of same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. E.

It is noted that this school will be in continuous operation until the first mentioned date.\n\nThe teacher should prepare a return showing the attendance, days taught, etc., from July 1st to August 14th, and forward same through your office, when payment of salary due will be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

If so, the Department would have no objection to the holidays being taken this year from the dates mentioned in your letter. If, however, the school has not been in operation since the end of June, it is considered that it should reopen after the holidays at the regular time, viz., September 1st, next. Please advise whether the school will be continued in operation from the 1st of the current month to August 14th, the date of the proposed holiday period.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L.

Ryckman as teacher of the Ucluelet Indian Day School. Her appointment is approved, with salary at the rate of $90 a teaching month. I have to request that you will give her every assistance you can.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nEd. E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B. C.\nApril 2nd,\n1930.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMy dear Sir:\n\nRe Ucluelet Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply to your letter of March 25th, 1930, (File 159-27-1), I beg to state that we have already commenced to make enquiry about a successor to Mr. Donald McDevitt, and we shall notify you in due course when we are prepared to make a nomination.\n\nBelieve me\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAB.MLT\nSir;\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of the Department's letter of April 18th re religious activities at Ucluelet Day School, with reports from the R.C.M.P and Provincial Police of B.C., bearing on the matter.\n\nI beg to advise the Department that those reports were intentionally sent to the Department, they having been omitted from this Agency monthly report for March, the letter accompanying them so stated.\n\nRe the above mentioned matter, I beg to advise the Department that for some two months past been reaching this office verbally, of unusual religious ceremonies being carried out at the Ucluelet Church and conducted by Miss E.B. Richardson, the teacher at Ucluelet school and assisted by her sister Mrs. Moore, these verbal reports were made by whites as well as Indians and apparently were causing ridicule of the religious denomination which the Ucluelet Church represents. As I am not conversant with the regular form of worship practiced by the United Church and did not consider myself competent to judge whether the ceremonies being carried on at Ucluelet were the regular form of worship or not, I requested the R.C.M.P and the B.C. Police to attend at one or more of these meetings and make a report on what actually happened, the enclosed reports were made of meetings that took place on entirely different dates.\n\nAfter having received these reports I sent copies of same to the Rev. F.W. Pitts, who is an ordained Minister of that faith, for his information and if he considered it advisable, his action, Mr. Pitts later informed me verbally that he reported the matter to the United Church Mission Board at Toronto. To ensure that the Department being conversant with what had occurred, the attached reports were submitted to Ottawa.\n\nI am convinced of the wisdom of the Department's intended action to request the United Church to change the teaching service at Ucluelet as I feel sure that a change would benefit the teacher herself and be in the interest of the Church.\n\nEnc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEd. E. Frost,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 12, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department has received, through Mr. Agent Frost, Port Alberni, B. C., reports from the R. C. M. P. and the Provincial Police of British Columbia, regarding an investigation made by them into the religious activities being carried on by Miss E. B. Ryckman, the teacher of the Ucluelet Indian Day School, and her sister, Mrs. Moore. The Agent states that he also forwarded copies of these reports to the Reverend F. E. Pitts, Principal of the Alberni Indian Residential School, who informed Mr. Frost that he had reported the matter to the United Church Mission Board, Toronto.\n\nIn view of these reports, it is considered that a change in teaching service should be made at this school for the coming academic year and Miss Ryckman notified that her services will not be required after the 30th of June, next. Mr. Agent Frost states he feels sure \"that a change would benefit the teacher herself and be in the interests of the Church\".\n\nI should be pleased if, after consideration of the enclosed reports, you would inform the Department whether you would approve of a change of teacher at this school. If so, the services of a qualified teacher should be obtained to begin duties when the school reopens after the summer holidays, on or about September first, next. The Department understands that Mr. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for B. C., has a number of applications of qualified teachers. Should a successor to Miss Ryckman be appointed, the name, qualifications and experience should be submitted, in due time, to the Department for approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Perry.\nVictoria, B.C. 1st September, 1934.\n\nC.G. Perry, Esq.,\nAssistant Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nBox 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been informed this morning that Mr. Neil Perry, at present teacher of the Indian Day School at Uclulet, has been appointed Secretary of the Economic Council working under the Provincial Government, and that he wishes to resign his position as teacher of the above School. I have instructed Mr. Perry to forward a written resignation to the Department explaining the circumstances of the case through Mr. Indian Agent Frost.\n\nDr. Wilson of the First United Church, Victoria, and Professor Farr, Victoria College, have had conferences with me this morning with regard to the future of the work at Uclulet. I understand that the authorities of the United Church of Canada, on the recommendation of the above named gentlemen, intend to nominate the below mentioned candidate as teacher and missionary at Uclulet Indian Day School.\n\nMr. Charles Storch,\n1046 Lyall Street,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nI may say that I have interviewed Mr. Storch today and see no reason why he would not make a success of the work as teacher at Uclulet. He is a member of the United Church of Canada; twenty-six years of age; trained at Victoria Normal School 1926-29 and holds a first-class B.C. Teacher's certificate. He has full second year standing in the University of British Columbia and almost four years' experience teaching in the ungraded and graded Provincial schools. Mr. Storch is well recommended by the Provincial Inspectors and Principals under whom he served. He has taught the Sunday School at the First United Church, Victoria, for eight years and his class of boys is the largest in any Sunday School in Victoria. Mr. Storch can lead the Church singing at Uclulet as well as teach this subject in the Day School. He is in very good health, six feet three tall and weighs one hundred and eighty pounds.\nMr. Perry,\n\nI understand that it is quite possible that Mr. Storch will marry Miss Irene Helgesen, who is twenty-four years of age and a fully trained nurse, today.\n\nAs it is necessary that the teacher of the Uclulet Indian Day School should proceed from Victoria either by boat this evening or at latest by stage tomorrow, the United Church are instructing Mr. Storch to take over Mr. Neil Perry's work, pending his appointment by the Department of Indian Affairs. I would therefore ask you to communicate with the Department in this matter, if possible by night letter. I may say in conclusion that I think Mr. Storch a very good candidate for the position left vacant by Mr. Perry's resignation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"Gerald H.

Mr. Perry's work had been so eminently satisfactory that we were exceedingly sorry to lose him from our Indian personnel.\n\nI desire to nominate for Ucluelet, Mr. Charles Storch. He is twenty-six years of age; holds a first-class British Columbia certificate; has had several years' teaching experience; has been interviewed by Captain Barry; and altogether seems to be a very good type of man for an isolated Indian village like Ucluelet.

Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\nAll schools have now reopened and were inspected during the month.\n\nAt both Alberni and Ucluelet Day schools the attendance was low; Alberni being 12, and Ucluelet 8. This is due to parents being away at the various canneries and better attendance is expected after October.\n\nAt Ucluelet the school was found to be closed at the time of my visit, 2.30 P.M. and the teacher was instructed to keep the school open for the full period, as laid down by the instructions. Both day schools were clean and sanitary, and the grounds and sanitary arrangements properly kept.\n\nP.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\nAgent's report for May 1939.\n\nDay schools at Alberni and Ucluelet show an increase in attendance and both were found to be well conducted. Children were attentive, clean and well disciplined. Buildings and outhouses were clean and grounds well kept.\n\nAt Alberni the children had good sports, attended by parents and visitors, on May Day, and great interest was shown in the Indian people and school pupils.\n\nP.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\nWest Coast Agency,\nPort Alberni, B.C., Feb. 28, 1939.\n\nReport for February 1939.\n\nUcluelet Day School is not making quite the same progress as the Alberni school.\n\nMr. Severson is a good teacher and conscientious in his duties, and could do much better with his class if he would exercise more optimism and patience.\n\nThe school is much improved and kept clean and tidy. The children are attentive and well disciplined. Attendance is good.\n\nP.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\nWest Coast Agency,\nPort Alberni, B.C., Jan. 31, 1939.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT FOR MONTH OF JANUARY 1939.\n\nUcluelet Day school has an attendance of 13, which is below the average, and due to illness and the absence of the parents on the fishing grounds. Discipline and progress are very good and attempts are being made to carry out vocational training. The school and grounds are very well kept and tidy in appearance. Pupils are attentive, clean and all in good health.\n\nP.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\nWest Coast Agency,\nPort Alberni, B.C., Dec. 31, 1938.\n\nSir:\nI have the honour to submit the regular letter for month ending December 31st, 1938.\n\nUcluelet day school was found very clean and tidy, and most of the pupils clean and well cared for. Discipline was good and the health of pupils very good. Attendance has improved slightly. A sewing machine was transferred from the old Alberni Residential school, and instruction is being given by the teacher's wife to the girls in sewing.\n\nP.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\nAt Alberni Day School the attendance was very small due to so many being away at the hop fields. The classroom was very bright and clean, and the children are doing much better under the new teacher.\n\nAt Ucluelet Day School, the attendance also was low for the same reason, but it will increase within a few days. The new teacher, Mr. Severson, has made a great change for the better in the building and appearance of the school. He appears to have gained the confidence of the older people, and is well liked by the children.\n\nP. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge your notification of appointments and transfers of school teachers in this Agency, and shall be pleased to render these teachers every possible assistance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.

Noble as teacher of the Ucluelet Indian Day School. I have recently received a report from Commissioner MacKay in which he states that Mr. Noble's services are unsatisfactory and, as a result, Commissioner MacKay recommends that we dispense with his services at the end of the current academic year. I understand that Commissioner MacKay has discussed the matter with Rev. W.P. Bunt, who will, no doubt, communicate with you.\n\nWhile there is no necessity for any immediate action in this matter, I thought you would appreciate hearing from me so that you can arrange for another teacher for this school for the academic year 1942-43.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Geo. Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nExtract from report of Inspector Barry on his visit to the Ucluelet Indian Day School on March 20, 1942:\n\nThough I have not the official file with me I believe that Mr. Noble was only given a temporary appointment as teacher of the Ucluelet Indian Day School. It is quite obvious that he is not a success at that school, and I would recommend that he be not employed as a teacher of an Indian day school after the end of the present academic year.\n\nThe progress of the children at Ucluelet this year has been most unsatisfactory. It is very difficult for me to believe that Mr. Noble has in fact taught the pupils anything of a worth while nature.\n\nMajor MacKay's comments on the above:\n\nI beg to forward herewith Inspector Barry's report on the Ucluelet Indian Day School which was inspected on March 20th.\n\nIt will be observed that Inspector Barry found the progress of the children at the Ucluelet School most unsatisfactory.\n\nI may say that I discussed this report with Reverend W.P. Bunt, Superintendent of Home Missions for the United Church of Canada in British Columbia, a few days ago and informed him that in view of its adverse character, that it was very doubtful if the Department would consider the employment of Mr. Noble after the close of the current school year. Mr. Bunt informed me that he was not surprised to hear that Mr. Noble's work was unsatisfactory as he had received reports to this effect himself.\nOttawa, April 21, 1943.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nA.D. Noble, Teacher,\nUcluelet Indian Day School.\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter dated April 4, 1943, re the above-noted.

Hoey\nSupt of Welfare & Training\n\nUcluelet, B.C.\nApril 10, 1943\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have written today to the Indian Agent, Mr. Ashbridge in Port Alberni, B.C., also to our General Secretary Dr. G. Dorey, on the Easter School Vacation, as the date date brings it so near our Annual Conference, I thought perhaps the Department would be kind enough to allow me to teach all through April and close the school early May 10th to 17th inclusive. This would be six of the seven days allowed for Easter Vacation.\n\nIf this can be granted please let me know as early as possible. I would not have written direct, but I thought the local Agent had power to grant this request. He informs me it must pass at Headquarters, so to save time I am writing to you.\n\nPlease forgive me if this is out of order.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nBishop Black\nMcMast B.C.\nApril 5, 1943\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nRe my recent leave of absence to attend the Victoria Preaching, I wish to state I am very sorry I was absent when the Provincial Inspector came to examine my school. It was very unfortunate and I sincerely hope you will not regard Mr. Ashbridge to blame for the event, or if you criticize my actions also you have a right to criticize my actions also.\n\nFirst I asked the Agent for two days intending to board the Head Boat at 3 p.m. or 3-30 p.m. or may be as late as 4 p.m. Having an arrangement with an Indian to take me over. You cannot I have found rely upon the Indian they do not even notify you when they cannot fulfill a contract, I was left on the float alone.\n\nI had a serious epidemic of the on the Reserve with the result on Wednes. our four children came, whole families were stricken. At noon one of the four went home sick and the others seemed ready to follow.\nSo when I saw the Mail Boat arriving early and knowing I had to walk two miles to Albion Bay to board it, I did not call the school but gave the three children credit for attendance. If I have done wrong, I ask forgiveness, I am sorry.\n\nThen I was told the Speedboat came every Sunday, it had done so for two previous Sundays and it was not until I arrived in Port Alberni that I discovered it only came when chartered. To be sure of returning Sunday, I had to place $40 in the hands of Mr. Riley. I was in a predicament. I called at the Agency to ask for another day under the circumstances in Monday. Mr. Ashbridge was in Victoria, the secretary told me he would be there until Friday. I went to Victoria hoping to get the Agent's permission to close the school on Monday, with the \"flu\" so bad I thought another day would be worse rather than a loss. I may conscientiously say that had I been at the Reserve I doubt whether there would have been more than three children present at school on the Thursday morning.\n\nHaving found myself compelled to break the school law, I thought I would teach on Saturday. I found myself with the \"flu\" in bed all Sat and most of Sunday. I had it all that week and the following Saturday was completely...\nexhausted and unable to teach. I spent that Saturday in bed. Well I yet had hopes of getting that extra day's teaching in during March. I didn't want to say anything about the matter to the Agent who had so kindly given me the two days. But it seems the devil will out. I find he has heard through some means or other of my action.\n\nWell allow me to state that I believe in justice and I will be as fair as I can. I took the liberty of giving the children credit for a day's schooling they have not yet had but (D.V.) and health permitting I am planning to teach an extra day during the Easter vacation. I realize this does not exempt me from breaking the letter of the school law but it does fulfill the spirit.\n\nWill you kindly forgive me, and allow me to make this amends? If my actions are too bad for this, all I can say is, I am sorry and I will have to face the consequences. Please understand I did not know the Inspector was coming or was already in Ucluelet, if he had phoned on arrival I would gladly have cancelled a trip on which I had set my heart.\n\nHoping this will explain my part in this case\u2014\nYours respectfully,\nBishop Black.\nPlease excuse the paper I have just run out of writing paper and it is two miles to the store.\n\nBB.\nAttention of Mr. R. A. Hoey\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMay 3rd,\n1945.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe: Ucluelet Indian Day School\n\nI have a long letter from Rev. Bishop Black, who tells me that he has got into serious trouble by absenting himself from his school. I heard about it when I was in Vancouver and I rather expected to hear from you in the meantime. Mr. Black was very anxious to attend the Victoria Presbytery, in order to hear the Moderator, Dr. Sclater. I gather that he had asked Mr. Ashbridge for a two days' leave of absence, but, through a combination of circumstances, he was not able to return for Monday. I think he did everything he could, but he did not get back in time to teach on the day when the Inspector had gone to inspect the school.\n\nI shall be very glad if you will let me know what action the Department contemplates. I should like to have the opportunity of discussing the matter with you when I am in Ottawa before anything definite is done. I think Mr. Black is doing a reasonably good piece of work as a teacher, and I am sure that he had no intention of breaking a rule when he started out. I have had no copies of letters which you have sent him, and consequently can only write from what Mr. Black tells me.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MLT\n\nP.S. Mr. Black says in his letter that when the Agent wrote to say that the Provincial Inspector would examine the School, he said, \"I think the Inspector will write you and fix the date of his coming.\" Without in any way condoning Mr. Black's going away, I think it would be well for the Inspector to let the teachers know when he is coming, because in some of these remote places anything can happen to close the school.\nOttawa,\nMay 6, 1943.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to Rev. Bishop Black, teacher of the Ucluelet Indian Day School. We received a report regarding this occurrence from the Indian Agent. We also received a rather long letter from Rev.

Owing to the majority of the parents being\nemployed by the cannery, one mile distant, children are\neither left home with little or no care, or are taken to\nthe cannery with them, hence the absence from school.\nThe present teacher, Reverend Bishop Black, apparently\nlacks initiative and experience in dealing with Indians,\nand is essentially a missionary, inclined to placate the\nparents and allow the children to dominate the school,\nrather than insist in attendance and use kindly firmness\nin his dealings with the pupils.\n\nIn view of the unfortunate record of this school\nover the past few years and the poor prospects of instit-\nuting a worthwhile day school, also in the interests of\nthe neglected children, I would respectfully recommend that\nthis school be closed and the remaining eligible pupils be\nabsorbed by the Alberni Residential School.

Present indications are, however, that there will be approximately thirty children of the Ucluelet Band who could attend the day school if a teacher can be secured, in addition to which there may be a few children available from the Toquart Reserve, a short distance away.\n\nIt is recommended that the Department authorize the opening of this school and if such action is approved an attempt will be made to secure a teacher.\n\nD.

This was partly due to families being away at the Canneries. On the whole this school was very disappointing, and I feel that the teacher is wasting her time.\n\nDay schools is emphasized. The school at Ucluelet should be re-opened if a teacher can be found. Season day schools also should be conducted at Nootka, Kildonan, and Ceepeecoo, as the parents cannot leave their children behind when employed at the Canneries; and the Residential schools cannot accommodate them.

Miss Ryckman has been in a very difficult and isolated place and is leaving the service of the Board of Home Missions and the Department permanently.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB.MLT\nOttawa, July 10, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, relative to the request which you received from Miss Ryckman, teacher of the Ucluelet Indian Day School, who is retiring from the position, to be granted one month's salary in lieu of holidays.\n\nIn reply I regret that there are no funds provided for an additional one month's salary for the academic year 1932-33. Miss Ryckman's services terminated as from June 30th, last and she received ten months' salary during the teaching year ending that date. Besides, the regulations of the Auditor General and the Treasury Board prohibit the granting of any gratuity for service less than ten years.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

I would therefore appreciate it if you would consult the Reverend Mr. Bunt with reference to making arrangements to have the children from Ucluelet placed in the Alberni Residential School for September first, provided there is accommodation for them within the number of regular grant-earning pupils.\n\nR.

It is apparent, therefore, that the two-room school with teacher's quarters will be necessary to meet our requirements at that point. Mr. Davey also ascertained that erection of a one-room school at Olahoose was unnecessary and consequently, it is recommended that the appropriation for schools at these two points be combined, thus making available a total of $28,000.00 for the erection of the required two-room school at Ucluelet. Subsequently Mr. Davey visited Ucluelet with a representative of National All-Steel Buildings Limited, who have now submitted the attached tender in the amount of $23,700.00, for the erection of a Quonset building in accordance with the plan attached.\n\nQuestionnaire completed by Superintendent Garrard with regard to this school building, is also enclosed, but I gather from Mr. Neary's various letters that we are not in a position to consider the erection of precut, prefabricated or Quonset buildings until we have investigated the possibilities of securing firm tenders on the erection of the Department's standard school building. If this is correct, have you sufficient information to proceed with the advertisement immediately, or if not, will you please let me know what additional information is required.\n\nW.S.

These changes which are outlined in his letter have been discussed with National All-Steel Buildings Limited, who are prepared to supply the materials and do the work additional to their contract. They have offered to -\n\n1. Install eight larger sash in the front basement wall for ........................................ $280.00\n\n2. Replace the window in the rear cloak room with one Mono door for ........................................ $75.00\n\n3. Install a 4' x 4' \"Alsynite\" panel above the front door for ........................................ $66.50\n\n4. Fit and install 1\u00bd\" galvanized pipe posts and railing on both sides of the concrete steps for ........ $150.00\n\n5. Install an additional window in the upstairs living quarters similar to the one in the living room for $189.00\n\n6. Provide supervision, transportation, freight, etc., in connection with the above-mentioned changes at a cost of ........................................ $100.00\n\nTOTAL ........................................ $860.00\nIt is regretted that these improvements were not apparent to us at the time the plan of the building was approved but the fact remains that all of the above listed items, with the possible exception of No.5, are matters which should be attended to before the structure is completed and I would suggest that if authority for the expenditure required cannot be expeditiously secured, I be authorized to enter into a separate agreement with National All-Steel Buildings for each of these improvements.\n\nIn a separate letter enclosing a Progress Payment to the Company, I intimated that the building would be completed before December 1st and as the Company's offer is based on acceptance prior to completion of the building, a reply by Army Signals would be appreciated.\n\nW.S.

Arneil Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nBox 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Ucluelet Indian Day School\n\nOn my recent visit to the above School it was noted that:\n\n1. The lighting in the basement of this building is inadequate. The windows which are to be installed 30\" x 18\" being too small to admit sufficient light and it is recommended that the eight openings in the front of the School be increased from 30\" x 18\" to 30\" x 36\".\n\n2. This building has only one exit on the ground floor the only other exit from the building being through the furnace room, the approach to which comes within a few feet of the main exit. It is suggested that an additional exit be made where the present plans call for a window at the back of the left end of the building looking at it from the front. A sketch enclosed. This would also decrease the distance to be travelled to get to the upper floor when approaching from the rear where a well will be situated. I believe, this will be a necessity if this building is inspected by a fire Marshall.\n\n3. The front hall has insufficient light. Namely a glass panel in a door which will be approximately 2' x 2' at the most. It is suggested that a 4' x 4' opaque fluted panel be fitted immediately above the door. This can be made out of one panel similar to the one above the landing on the upper floor.\n\n4. That a guard or rail be fitted on both sides of the front steps as the height from the door level to the ground when filled in will be about 6 feet, at present nearly eight.\n\n5. That an additional window similar to the one in the living room be installed in the front of the building opening out of the Lounge? The present windows open on the eastern end and look out on to trees only whereas the one on the front will look seaward and give additional light making this a most pleasant room with a splendid view.\n\nN.W.

Arneil Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nBox 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Sidewalk - Ucluelet School\n\nWould you kindly grant authority for the expenditure of $290.00 for the construction of a plank walk from the present village walk to the new Ucluelet School. This is required as at present it is necessary to walk through a heavy black mud which is from 5 to 12 inches in depth. There is at present a few planks or boards on the ground but these only serve to stop one from going too deep into the mud.\n\nThis walk will require to be approximately 320 feet long and raised off the ground. It is proposed to have this three plants wide the same as the walk which the band have constructed from their Band Funds and which goes through the Village.\n\nThe requirements will be 60 pieces of 2 x 12 x 16, 20 pieces 4 x 4 x 16, 400 feet of shiplap is also required for lining the sides of the store-room in the basement as this was not included in the contract.\n\nThe cost of this material as obtained from the Alberni Pacific Lumber is $164.82 plus freight and nails which is estimated at $35.00.\n\nLabour in this construction and delivery from the wharf at Ucluelet West to the Reserve is estimated at $90.00 making a total of $289.82.\n\nN.W.

Mines and Resources,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nRe: Ucluelet Mission Property\n\nRev. W.P. Bunt, Superintendent of the United Church Board of Home Missions, has approached this Department for compensation for use of the church buildings at Ucluelet and has suggested that inasmuch as the Department did not pay rental for use of the buildings over a period of years the buildings should be repaired before we turn them back to the church.\n\nSupt. Garrard's letter of December 23rd in this connection is enclosed wherein he outlines the expenditures made by the Department on these buildings and suggests that in lieu of rental or further repairs the Department pay the outstanding accounts in connection with the buildings to the amount of $79.65 and give to the church the oil heater presently used to heat one of the buildings. I doubt whether such a settlement would be entirely satisfactory to Mr. Bunt nor do I feel that it would be reasonable having in mind our use of both buildings over several years, apparently dating back prior to 1934.\n\nI would recommend that in addition to the settlement suggested by Mr. Garrard the Department pay rental for use of the buildings from September 1st, 1949 to December 31st at the rate of $25.00 per month which will enable the church to carry out without expense to themselves the minor repairs necessary.\n\n-W.S. Arneil\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nWest Coast Agency,\n114th Avenue South,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\n23 December 1949.\n\nW.S. Arnell Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nBox 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nIn reply to your letter of December 19, File 16-11-3 regarding the Ucluelet Mission buildings I would advise that the accounts referred to in Mr. Bunt's letter were handed to Mr. Caldwell to be forwarded to Rev. Bunt, as it was arranged at that time, that the Department would repair and renovate the Mission house to the extent of $350.00 and that the United Church would look after the balance. The balance being $70.00 for the linoleum and the other small expenses, which Mr. Bunt refers to in his letter being $7.70 and $1.95 for a door and lock for the School. I might mention that repairs to the steps were included in the $350.00 also an additional amount of $8.80 was later spent by the Department for repairs to the steeple, stopping leaks and to prevent the bell from falling into and through the classroom floor.\n\nRegarding the Mission dwelling the amount expended in the repairs and renovating of this building would more than cover any rentage which might reasonably be expected to be paid. The building is now in a far better shape that it was when the Department took over.\n\nWith reference to the School. If this building had not had the small repairs and had a fire kept in it it is doubtful if the building would now be worth making repairs to as the floor of the building was, at that time, covered with mould. However, in view of the fact that the United Church has co-operated to the extent of letting the Department have the use of this building I believe that it would not be amiss for the Department to cover the Accounts which the Rev. Bunt now has in his possession.\n\nIn addition the Department has an Oil Heater valued at $95.00 at present in the building and I would suggest that this might remain there in lieu of making repairs to the Mission Church.\n\nN.W.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nMarch 15, 1950\n\nMemorandum to Mr. Robinson:\n\nRe: Ucluelet Indian School\nAlberni Agency, B.C.\n\nOn February 28 I inspected the school building recently erected by the National All-Steel Buildings Ltd. On this trip I was accompanied by Mr. Garrard, Superintendent, West Coast Agency.\n\nThe contract for this structure was awarded on August 18, 1949 and the school was opened January 9, 1950. The contract was let on the contractor's plans dated March 24, 1949 and their letter dated July 5, 1949. The Contractor has not completed his contract in respect to the following items:\n\n(1) Leaks from the Roof\n\nThere is definitely at least two leaks from the roof as water runs in at every rainfall into the front bedroom and down the partition between the kitchen and bathroom. I noticed that some of the washers under the screws holding down the corrugated iron are turned upward. This might be the cause of the leaks.\n\nThe leaks have existed all winter.\n\n(2) Leaks from End Windows\n\nOn both end walls of the concrete basement at the ground floor joists there is indication that water comes down the inside of the end walls of the building. Water also comes in through the classroom ceilings. In my opinion, this water comes from the end walls and enters the walls at the second story windows. At these windows the corrugated iron sheathing butts against the window jamb with no further protection to keep the water out. The plan shows a window trim on the outside and this is not on. I suggest that metal be applied to the junction of the corrugated iron and the window jamb and that it be covered with the window trim.\n\n(3) Floors\n\nThe floors consist of asphalt tile on 3/8\" plywood laid on building paper over shiplap. In both classrooms in the hall between them and on the landing of the second floor much of the tile is broken up. This is caused by warping of the plywood. It is evident that the plywood was laid when the shiplap was wet.\n\nThe tile on the top tread of the stairs was left protruding over the tread one-half inch, causing it to break off unevenly. This tile should have been set back\nfrom the edge of the tread with a protective strip of metal or hardwood.\n\n(4) Sags in Floor\n\nThe floor in Classroom No. 2 drops noticeably between the supporting partition in the basement and the stair well. I understand that the post at the stairway in the basement was put in after the sag took place. An attempt should have been made to jack this section of floor back into place before the finishing work was done.\n\n(5) Sags in Donnacona\n\nSome sheets of donnacona on the ceiling are sagging. There are no headers at end of sheets and not sufficient nails in the sheets.\n\n(6) Staircase\n\nThe type of treads used was for placing between two walls. The exposed end of the treads should be trimmed to make a finished job. The rail and post have not been painted.\n\n(7) Basement Floor\n\nThe basement floors, except for the furnace rooms, are an extra to the contract. These floors were badly finished in that sags in the surface allow one-half inch of water to lie in places on the floor. No floor drains were put in the play rooms but a drain was put through the end wall at floor level in the store rooms. Water only runs out this drain when it becomes deep on the floor.\n\n(8) Leveling Grounds\n\nThere are felled trees on the grounds around the building not yet limbed. The backfilling of the building has not been completed. In places water has been lying two feet deep in pot holes against the wall. Much of the water in the basement came from this source.\n\n(9) No heating was supplied to the single teacher's room on the second storey.\n\n(10) The interior painting is very poor for a two coat job.\n\nThere has no doubt been condensation in the building, particularly in the basement, from the green concrete.

A meeting with Mr. DeWolf, General Manager of All-Steel Buildings, and his Construction Supervisor, was subsequently arranged and the defects in the structure were discussed in some detail. We found it difficult, however, to place responsibility for all these defects entirely on the contractor for the reason that no detailed specifications accompanied the contractor's tender and his responsibilities with regard to heating the building during construction, etc., were not clearly defined.\n\nNational All-Steel Buildings Ltd., is presently in the process of liquidation and actually they do not now have the facilities for remedying the defects in the structure and to insist on their doing so would inevitably result in considerable delay. Under these circumstances it is considered advisable to have our engineering staff assess the cost of\ncompleting the work and to relieve the contractor of further responsibility by reducing the amount due him under the contract by this cost. Mr. Martin and Mr. Robinson of the engineering staff feel the work could be completed for $1200.00 and the Company, reference their letter of March 28th attached, is satisfied to have payment due them reduced by this amount in order to quickly conclude the matter. This is desirable from their point of view as they wish to have liquidation of the Company concluded as soon as possible and it is desirable from our point of view because it will enable us to complete payment under the contract from this year's funds.\n\nMr. DeWolf, in his letter of March 28th attached sets out the amount due the Company under the contract, less the $1200 deduction. This amount, plus the Company's 10% deposit, totals $7,786 and payment of this amount to the Company is recommended.\n\nIt will be necessary for us to have $1200 encumbered in the new fiscal year to complete the building but it is unlikely that weather conditions will permit of the necessary work to the playground being carried out until mid-summer.\n\nW.

The matter has been brought to my attention again, as the amounts of $19.30 and $27.20 referred to in the item marked \"Cash Reconciliation\" on Page 1 of the report have just been refunded to the Treasury Office connected with Indian Affairs.\n\nI suppose by this time you are familiar with what happened concerning the two cheques which were made payable to Charlie McCarthy and Wilson Robert, for $27.20 and $19.30, respectively. The Auditor was wrong in regard to the names and amounts. The report should have read, Charlie McCarthy, $27.20, and Wilson Robert, $19.30. The second amount was in connection with a sidewalk to be constructed at the Ucluelet Indian Day School. The Superintendent made out a return of labour for the week ending March 31st, 1950, and indicated that Wilson Robert worked 8 hours on the first three days of the week and 3\u00bd hours on Thursday. There is no labour return here for the work which was supposed to have been done by Charlie McCarthy, but Agency cheque No. 88596 for the sum of $27.20 was issued.\n\nYou will realize that the whole procedure in these two cases was very irregular and before making any further comment on the work of this Agency, I would like to have a reply from you as to the question I raised in my letter of April 5th, last, concerning the inspection of the work of this Agency.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.

Rev. Mr. Thorman, who was previously engaged as Missionary at this point, is to return and is to be assisted in the Mission and school work by his son.\n\nYour suggestion that all religious teaching should be eliminated does not altogether meet with the approval of the Department. In Indian work it has been found that the school and Mission work go hand in hand to a large extent. Secular education should, however, have precedence in the class-room and Mr. Thorman will be asked to pay particular attention to it.\n\nThe Bishop will be asked to have the building put in repair in order that the work may be properly conducted. The Department hopes that you will give Mr. Thorman and his son every assistance in your power as it wishes to efficiently provide for the education of the Indian\n\nGeo. D. Cox, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nchildren of this Band and you will be good enough to visit the school upon each occasion on which you go to the reserve and report fully upon the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. ROLEAN\n\nSecretary.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to refer to your letter No. 367576 of Feb. 24 last in regard to the advisability of establishing a school on the Shetler reserve and replying beg to say that I believe that if there was a school properly conducted that it would be a great benefit to the Indians as most of them are anxious to have their children learn to read and write but I would not be in favor of a school conducted as the missionaries did when they were here before what little they learn under such system is of little use to them. I have come to the conclusion that missionary work amongst the Indians does not have a very good influence over them and I beg to suggest that if the Department does establish a school that religion would be omitted and in its stead the Teacher conduct regular courses of lectures on honest principles.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nSecy. Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nthat is to say teach them to be honest for honesty sake instead of using religion as a cloke and Indian is naturally superstitious and the further his ideas are drawn from belief the better for him.\n\nNow I believe that if a proper school would be well attended there are at present 45 children of school age in the band a few of them attend school at Telegraph Creek and would attend if there was a school on the reserve for the reason that they live and have their homes there and I feel satisfied that a school such as mention would soon show encouraging results not only with the children but the older ones and great care should be taken in choosing a teacher.\n\nThe Mission Building is not completed it is about 20 x 30 feet or possibly a little larger School was held in a room in Mr. Shormans house where he was there it is I would judge about 12 x 12 ft. either building would want repairing I have not been able to go to Saltan to get the exact measurements a school at Saltan would not materially affect the attendance.\nat Telegraph Creek School\nas most of the children live there\nin fact all that attend regularly\nhave their homes there\nmy idea may seem strange\nbut if the Department would\nsee fit to get on them I will\ndo all I can to make the attempt\na success\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\nyour obedient servant\nG.

The steamboat season this summer will only last a month so that it will be desirable to arrange for the school supplies to go up in July. I hope to hear soon from Mr. Thorman.\n\nAllow me to thank the Department for the increased Grant to our faithful\nOttawa, March 21st, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 7th instant in further reference to the establishment of a school on the Tahltan Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the necessity for immediately accepting or rejecting the offer of Rev. Mr. Thorman and his son to return to this field and resume the work left off some time ago, the Department begs to submit the following offer. A salary of $500.00 will be paid the teacher and, in view of the fact that the school-house was erected by the Church authorities, an annual rental of $250.00 will be allowed therefor. Your Lordship will, therefore, receive in salary and rent the amount asked for, but the Department is not prepared to contribute towards the travelling expenses.\n\nAt the present time $500.00 is the maximum salary paid day school teachers in British Columbia, even in the outlying districts, and it is not thought well to make an exception in the case of the Tahltan school; but this proposed arrangement will, it is considered, meet the requirements as stated in Your Lordship's letter.\n\nThe Department will also pay for the material necessary to make desks, etc., and will supply books and stationery for the school.\n\nRight Rev. F. H. Juv\u00e9nal, D.D.,\nBishop of Caledonia,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nThe question of the dispensing of medicines may be left in abeyance. Should Dr. Inglis leave Telegraph Creek arrangements might be made to have a stock of medicines left in Mr. Thorman's possession, and, in any event, the Doctor might be glad to avail himself of the services offered, as it would then be necessary for him to attend to only the more urgent cases.\n\nI trust that this offer will be satisfactory to Your Lordship and that you will be able to make final arrangements for Mr. Thorman's return.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nMar. 7, 1910\n\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter No. 357576, dated Feb. 24, in which you say that you will be pleased to hear again from me upon receipt of a reply to my letter to Mr. Cox, Indian Agent, at Telegraph Creek, in regard to the establishing of a school at Tahltan.\n\nI wrote to Mr. Cox Nov. 5th, before I had Rev. Mr. Thorman's heroic offer to return from England with his son, who is of age, to take up the school and mission work at Tahltan if I could provide a salary. My letter of Jan. 18th, would explain that I had these two men who had lived there before and knew the language ready to go back and rally the Indians round them.\n\nTo this second letter I have not had time to get a reply but to my first letter which simply asked if he approved of reopening the school at Tahltan, if he thought a grant could be secured for this, and also another for the Liard Indians 250 miles in the interior &c. To this he has replied as follows:\n\n\"I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st of Nov. last regarding the Indians of this agency and in reply beg to say that I am very anxious that the Indians should have schools established among them wherever it is practical and think that a school at Tahltan should be fairly well attended especially if it was kept open during the summer when the Indians are there, but there is little use in having the children attend only a few weeks when the Indians are in to do their trading and then be taken out in the woods to soon forget what little they...\"\nhad learned which I fear would be the case with the Liard Band\". Please note that this last clause refers to the Liard Indians whom our missionary Rev. Frank Palgrave visited last summer at Liard Post 250 miles beyond Telegraph Creek. The old chief there made a most urgent appeal for a school teacher. Mr. Palgrave laid this before me on his return here. I cannot press for this grant because I know of no one willing to go so far into the Interior away from every remnant of civilization, but the case of Tahltan is different.\n\nWill you allow me to present the urgency of this case as briefly as possible.\n\n1. Rev. Frank Palgrave began and Rev. T.P. Thorman carried on work here under the auspices of the Church of England some years ago. Mr. Thorman reduced the language to writing and translated portions of the Bible, hymns, prayers, readers, teaching school faithfully among young and old without a Government grant. Erecting mission buildings there &c. His wife dying he resigned and owing to expense our Church was unable to send in a missionary to take his place.\n\n2. Last summer as a holiday trip Rev. Mr. Palgrave revisited his old field. The Indians welcomed him most warmly. He taught school for about two months in the summer. They implored him to either come back or send them a teacher. Mr. Cox helped him and the Indians to put a new foundation under the Mission house which is used also as a school. Mr. Palgrave on his way back to England laid the responsibility upon me not to disappoint these Indians.\n\n3. I at once took the matter up, wrote to Mr. Vowel, Mr. Cox, and at a venture to Rev. Mr. Thorman in England. Mr. Thorman responded by offering to come ba\nwith his son if I would pay their travelling expenses from England to Tahltan and give them an adequate salary, pointing out that it is not a \"one man mission\". I must let them know so that they can be here in June ready to take the first steamer up the Stickine.\n\nTo put the case in a nut-shell - The Church is not responsible for the school. The Government is not responsible for the Mission, but owing to the extreme isolation and the excessive cost the only practicable plan is to work the two together. The Government could not get a teacher to live there on a small grant. The Church will have to decline to reopen the mission and school without an adequate Government grant to the school.\n\nFor the proposed grant of $750 (or say $700) the Government will secure the services of two men for the school who both understand the language, one with a knowledge of medicine.\n\n\u2014 Mr. Cox, the Indian Agent favours the reopening of the school at Tahltan.\n\n\u2014 Mr. Vowell, the superintendent of I.A., recommends it.\n\n\u2014 Mr. Palgrave, the pioneer missionary of the Stickine, urges it with all his power.\n\n\u2014 Dr. Inglis of Telegraph Creek admits that it is impossible for him, twelve miles away, to look after these Indians.\n\n\u2014 Many of the Indians say that if there were a school at Tahltan they would keep away more from Telegraph Creek where they meet with more temptation than in their own village.\n\nAs for travelling expenses, though it seems only reasonable that the Government should make some allowance, say from Vancouver to Tahltan, yet I do not press this in the same way.\n\nI earnestly trust that the Government will give me an answer soon.\nas Mr. Norman will have to give due notice before he will be allowed to leave his parish in England and he must be on hand for the steamer up the Stickine. I am informed that the season will be very short this summer for the steamer. One month most likely.\n\nAs soon as I hear that a grant has been made I can complete arrangements.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nF. H. Du Vernet\nBishop of Caledonia\nOttawa, February 24th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nHis Lordship Bishop DuVernet has applied to the Department for the establishment of a school on the Tahltan Reserve, and asked a grant for a teacher's salary and for the necessary equipment.\n\nThe Department would like to have a report from you, in which you should deal fully with all the phases of the question. You should state the number of children of school age; the distance they reside from the school; the character and habits of the parents; the size, condition, etc., of the building formerly used as a mission house, in which it is proposed to conduct the school. You should also state the probabilities there would be of obtaining and maintaining a full and regular attendance.\n\nThe Department will be glad to receive any other information that will enable it to deal intelligently with the Bishop's request.\n\nIf a school were erected on the reserve would it be necessary to continue the grant to the white school at Telegraph Creek?\n\nAn early reply will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nGeo. D. Cox, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nOttawa, February 24th, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nMr. A. W. Vowell, Indian Superintendent, has forwarded the Department a copy of a letter addressed by Your Lordship to him in connection with the establishment of a school on the Tahltan Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as no provision for a grant to a school at this point has been made, the Department is not prepared to accede to Your Lordship's request for a grant for salary at the rate of $750.00 per annum, for $100 travelling expenses, and for equipment.\n\nThe Department will, however, make further enquiries into this matter and will be pleased to hear again from Your Lordship upon receipt of a reply to your letter to Mr. Cox, the Indian Agent, at Telegraph Creek.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. F. H. DuVernet, B.D.,\nBishop of Caledonia,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nIndian Office, Victoria, B.C.\nJanuary 26th, 1910.\n\nFile No. 118532/1 (Sept. 30th, 1909)\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to my letter to the Department of the 13th of November last, No. 662 R-5, with which was enclosed a copy of a letter of the 5th of the same month received at this office from the Rt. Rev. Du Vernet, Bishop of Caledonia, Prince Rupert, B.C., dealing with the urgency of the question of making what is considered adequate provision for the payment of salaries of certain of the teachers of Indian Day Schools in his Diocese, I have the honour to enclose herewith in regard thereto a copy of a communication of the 18th instant recently received from His Lordship dealing with the matter of the desirability of the establishment of a Day School at Tahltan Reserve.\n\nWhen the reply to the communication addressed by the Bishop to Mr. Agent Cox is received the same will be transmitted to the Department for its information and consideration.\n\nIn the meantime it may be pointed out to the Department that the grant of $750.00 per annum with a special provision\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nfor travelling expenses in the sum of $100.00 is not, considering the locality and cost of living, at all unreasonable. For a large portion of the year communication with the outside world is practically cut off and it is only during the summer months that ingress and egress to Tahltan and surrounding country can be readily had. As further pointed out by His Lordship it is hardly to be expected that a man can be found who will go to Tahltan at the small stipend paid by the Department to school teachers throughout the Superintendency.\n\nI therefore trust to hear in due course that provision to the extent specified by His Lordship will have been made and that proper accommodation for the number of pupils mentioned will likewise be secured.\n\nThe climate on the whole for a large part of the year is most inclement and the country inhospitable thus making the matter of the retention of the services of an efficient teacher a more than ordinary difficulty.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSupt. of Indian Affairs, B.C.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nJan. 15, 1910.\n\nTo A. W. Vowell, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Affairs, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of Nov. 12th regarding the establishment of a school at the Tahl-Tan Indian Reserve replying to my letter on the subject. You asked me for more definite particulars, to get which I had to communicate with Rev. T.P. Thorman, now living in England, who built the Mission Buildings at Tahl-Tarn, who knows the language of the Indians there well, who buried his wife and child there, a sacrifice to the cause of the uplifting of the natives. He was heartbroken when we closed the Mission because of the enormous expense. He and his son, who is of full age, are willing to return and take up the work of Mission and School, provided I can finance the work. Formerly the Government rendered no assistance and I did not think the Church could stand the great cost as prices there are so high. In regard to the needs of the Indians, and the importance of the work he writes: \"It is quite a mistake to suppose that they (i.e. the Tahl-Tarn Indians) are but a short time in their village during the year, in my time when they knew their children would be taught many remained the whole year except for a few short 'hunts'. If they are rallied again they would do the same. I had in my school some 35 to 40 of all ages. With regard to schoolhouse the Mission house built by myself will suffice for a long time but a grant is needed for school furniture, i.e. forms, school materials and medicines as I can do much in that way to aid them.\"\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6417, file 851-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nAs I have already said to keep this school and Mission work is a costly matter, there is the expense of getting there, the cost of provisions, fuel, &c. Mr. Thorman says: \"It is not a one man place, on account of the great difficulty of getting fuel. In winter the glass often falls to 65\u00b0 below zero.\"\n\nIt would scarcely be right to send a young man to live there alone. Hence the advantage of having the two, father and son, for the Mission and School. I am most thankful for this offer and I am writing to Mr. Thorman that I shall accept his offer provided the Indian Department will give a grant of $750. per annum i.e about half the sum required. And a special grant of $100. towards travelling expenses.\n\nI now apply definitely for this. Also for the grant for school furniture &c. as specified in the letter.\n\nI shall mail a duplicate of this letter to Mr. Cox, Indian Agent on the Stickine, who cannot now be reached by letter.\n\nAs you were formerly in charge of the Cassiar District I can appeal to you on behalf of these Indians. Hoping that I may have some assurance soon to warrant me going ahead in the matter of securing Mr. Thorman for the work, who has already done so much for these Indians and sacrificed so much on their behalf,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sig) F.H. Du Vernet.\n\nBishop of Caledonia.\nOttawa, June 9, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Mr. Cox, Indian Agent at Telegraph Creek, in which he deals with the proposal to re-open the school on the Tahltan Reserve. Mr. Cox has been advised of the action taken by the Department in official letter to you of March 21st, last.\n\nMr. Cox states that the Mission building, for which the Department has agreed to pay an annual rental of $250.00, is not completed and I have to ask Your Lordship to be good enough to take the necessary steps to have the work done in order that Mr. Thorman and his son may not be handicapped in this respect.\n\nKindly advise the Department when Mr. Thorman proceeds to Tahltan.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev.

All the Indians are here now in their spring season, but the land agitation among the B.C. Indians had reached here and does much harm partly in our efforts for their good.\nThe Indian Agent Mr. Cox has resigned. (He expressed himself much pleased several times on his visits here at the office.) Mr. Cox has been appointed to whom do I send my quarterly School Attendance Report etc.?\n\nWill you kindly cause some Quarterly School Patterns to be sent to me? I have none.\n\nI do call attention, although I have written once before and received no reply to the following:\n\nWhen I left England to come here, the Rt. Hon. of California said the Department had allowed $500 per ann. for the Teacher and $250 per ann. for the Assistant. This building fund has only been paid for the first quarter and not since.\n\nThe building is the property of the Church of England and paid for at such cost, and I presume that Assistant's part includes warmth and light.\n\nFor seven months in the year (the winter is between seven and eight months here) it costs $1 per day for wood for School, only\u2014waps are common labourers $4.25 per day; this sum is paid by B.C. Govt.\n\nYou will kindly note $200 for building warmth and light is not an excessive allowance. The house falls in winter & so does the snow.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. R.

Mr. Thorman will see at once for necessary repairs of building. I saw Dr. Kergin who said he was instructed to send some medicine. I am thankful for this as there is no Doctor now on the Stickine, and Mr. Thorman has had much experience in such work.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nF.H. Du Vernet,\nBishop of Caledonia.\nSir,\n\nIt was my privilege to visit the Indian Village of Tahltan 172 miles up the Stikine River and to spend a week there about the first of June last. I spent a whole morning inspecting the school taught by Rev. T.P. Sherman. There were about a dozen children present. These children had only been under Mr. Sherman's care for two years and knew nothing in the way of education before this. I cannot speak too highly of the progress they have made in reading, writing, spelling, arithmetic, geography &c., also from being wild untamed children they showed in their respectful manners the wonderful influence Mr. Sherman has had over them. There is no doubt in my mind that both from the standpoint of the school and the church it is when the Indians are in their own village twelve miles from the contaminating influence of Telegraph Creek the most effective work can be done.\n\nI have just received a letter from Mr. Sherman stating that acting upon the new regulation he has been keeping the school open in July with an attendance of between 16 and 20. Later the Indians will be away for the Fall Hunt when the attendance at school will be small.\n\nOn June 6th, I visited the Public School at Telegraph Creek and found five children present, one an Indian child.\n\nI had a long talk with the Indian Agent, Mr. Simpson. He expressed himself as much pleased with the Tahltan Indian Day School, which he visits about once a month, and unlike Mr. Symon, strengthens instead of weakens the hands of the missionary and teacher.\n\nI have had to pay Mr. Sherman\nI have had to pay Mr. Sherman $1,200 a year. The cost of living up in this isolated region is excessive. Without the Government grant of $300 towards salary and $250 rental for school building I should have to close the Mission. No teacher could live on the Government grant alone.\n\nI have reported my visit to the Department and given my testimony to the good work being done in the school because in a recent letter the Department spoke of closing the school if the attendance did not keep up, and further owing to the migratory habits of the Indians it may be difficult to put in the full number of school days and so under the new rule the salary grant may be reduced. I consider that no school in the Diocese has for the limited period of operation done better work.\n\nIt is a difficult problem\u2014the teaching of school when the Indians wander. The former government did not favour increasing the number of Boarding Schools. For the immense outlay the returns are very slight. Children are removed from their parents whose authority is destroyed, and are unfitted for the ordinary life that awaits them when they return after six years absence. I do not know what the present policy of the Department is. I think both Mr. Beasy and Mr. Simpson favour the Boarding School plan, but they have not had the experience I have had in the difficulties in the way.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. H. Tun Turner\nBishop of Caledonia\nOttawa, July 30, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department is very pleased to learn of the progress that is being made at the day school on the Tahltan Reserve.\n\nYour action in allowing the holidays to be taken in the fall is approved and the usual two months will be allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. Scott Simpson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nStikine Agency, B.C.\n\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nJuly 2nd, 1912.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg leave to submit herewith Duplicate copies of Quarterly School Returns, from Mr. Thorman on the Tahltan School on the Tahltan Reserve. Mr. Thorman has requested permission to keep the School open during the Months of July and August in order to take advantage of the opportunity afforded him by the gathering if the Indians who will be resident there during the Salmon Gathering season. I have granted his request, knowing that these Indians will probably move off to their Hunting grounds in September, when their Children will have Holidays, and lose the opportunity that others will have of attending School. You will notice that he has called attention to these facts in his Marginal notes. The Bishop of Caledonia has expressed much surprise at the wonderful progress attained, and will no doubt mention the matter in his Report to the Department. It is Gratifying to know that one so capable of judging the case is highly impressed with the good results attained, and can testify to the good resulting from Mr. Thorman's efforts.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent for Stikine Division.\nOttawa, April 17, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from His Lordship the Bishop of Caledonia in reference to the poor attendance of late at the Tahl Tan Indian School. His Lordship is being informed that the Department will not take any action to close the school until such time as a fair opportunity has been given the teacher to secure a better attendance and I have to ask you to be good enough to give him all the assistance you can in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. S. Simpson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nOttawa, April 17, 1912.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's communication of the 1st instant in reference to attendance at the Indian day school on the Tahltan Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department regrets to learn the conditions and it is hoped that Mr. Thorman will be able to effect an improvement. Your Lordship will, however, readily understand that if it is not possible to do this it will be useless to continue the day school. However, every chance will be given before definite action is taken. In the meantime the Agent will be written to and asked to co-operate with Mr. Thorman.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\n\nRight Rev. F. H. DuVernet,\nBishop of Caledonia,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nApr. 1, 1912.\n\nTo the Secretary of\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, OTTAWA,\n\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of a long letter from Rev. T.P. Thorman of Tahltan, Stickine River explaining the causes of a decrease in the average attendance at the Day School during the past year.\n\nIt is best for the Indians that they should remain as much as possible on their Reserve so that their children may go to school and young and old may be away from the temptations to drink and immorality which proximity to a white village brings.\n\nThe Tahltan Indians receive many inducements to move their families to Telegraph Creek, the white settlement twelve miles away. Indirectly the Government encourages this by providing that the Indian children may attend the Public School for White children in this village. According to Mr. Thorman's letter, when Mr. Tyson, Indian Agencies Inspector, visited Tahltan Reserve last August the Indians put to him the question\u2014 \"May we live where we like?\". Mr. Tyson replied \"Yes you may\". On hearing this many went off with their families to live at the white village of Telegraph Creek. In three weeks time the attendance at the Indian Day School dropped from 27 to 5. While Mr. Thorman has not seen a case of drunkenness at Tahltan among the Indians it is very different at Telegraph Creek. There the work of the missionary for the\nIndian seems to be almost undone. There is also a white-man who keeps agitating the Indians over the land question, and the sad unrest which is such an obstacle to our missionary work in these parts has spread up the Stickine. Many of our missionaries are now utterly disheartened because of this \"land agitation\" and Mr. Thorman says this is another cause of lack of attendance.\n\nWhile Mr. Tyson may have been strictly speaking correct in what he said yet as the Indians would regard him as higher than the Indian Agent the effect of his words has been most disastrous. Most of our Indian Agents have said\u2014If you want to live off the Reserve, then you must renounce the privileges of the Reserve\" but in this case the Department offers school and medical attendance to induce the Indians to live in a village where through drink and vice they will soon be exterminated.\n\nI understand that the new Indian Agent on the Stickine is alive to this situation, and is rather inclined to recommend a Boarding School at Tahltan, but after my financial experience with Boarding Schools I should hesitate to involve the Church in such.\n\nI think we should give the Day School at Tahltan a fair chance, and an other trial. I sympathize deeply with Mr. Thorman in his most isolated post with the thermometer often down to 60 below, and think that he deserves every encouragement both from the Government and the Church.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nF.H. Du Vernet\nBishop of Caledonia\nOttawa, August 31st., 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 3rd. instant and in reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased to know that your work at the Tahltan School is progressing favorably. Some Quarterly School Return forms will be sent you.\n\nIn regard to the rent I beg to inform you that this has been paid to March the end of the quarter to His Lordship the Bishop of Caledonia.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. P. Thomas,\nTeacher,\nTahltan Indian Reserve,\nVia Telegraph Creek, B.C.\nOttawa, June 9, 1914.\n\nRight Rev. Sir,-\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 30th ultimo enclosing a copy of a letter addressed to this Department by the Rev. F. P. Thorman, Missionary at Telegraph Creek, B.C., asking for the reasons stated therein that a boarding school be established at Tahltan.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the original letter from Mr. Thorman was received in March, last, and that gentleman was informed that the Department regretted that it could not comply with this request. I may add that there are no funds at the disposal of the Department this year which would permit of the establishment of a boarding school there.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. F. H. DuVernet,\nBishop of Caledonia,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nMay 30, 1914\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA\n\nSir,\n\nSome time ago our clergyman at Tahltan, Upper Stikine River, sent me a copy of his letter to you urging the establishment of a Boarding School for Indian children at Tahltan. In case the original went astray in the winter mail I forward you this copy.\n\nI think the argument for a Boarding School at Tahltan is a very strong one and I shall do all in my power to assist the Government to make such a school, if established, a success, but after my experience with Boarding Schools in the past I could not agree to the Anglican Church being in any way responsible financially for the upkeep of such a school.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nF. H. Du Temple\nBishop of Coledonia\nThe Fatek Van Mission\nTelegraph Creek\nStikine River\nB.C.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIt is a common report that the Indian Land Question is receiving the attention of the Government at this time; and that a Commission has been appointed to inquire into debate upon the requirements of the different tribes in these parts. Until a movement had been made in this direction it was of little use making mention of educational progress among these people on account of their boycotting all concerned with the Government; a sad state of affairs brought about by a travelling agitator. Now that the Indian mind is pacified to a great extent I will ask the Government to give its accustomed consideration to remarks of a like nature.\n\nFor many years the Anglican Mission has been established among this tribe of Indians, who, for the most part, are members of the Church.\n\nIt was as far back as the year 1897 that the first school was opened; but this only continued for a space of 6 years. The Government\nat some time made no great. The Mission was helped by a supply of drugs. I believe there was an Indian Agent. However, through lack of support from outside, and the then indifference of the Indians to education, the School was forced to be closed.\n\nIn 1910 the School was again opened and was received very favourably by the parents of school children, who lent their utmost support in keeping their children for a time at School. Nevertheless the problem of continuing this School as an educational enterprise is by no means solved yet. There is the eternal drawback of the precarious existence of a nomadic people which allows no long stay in any one place; the Indian spend thrift manner of living & his loss of liquid gold the children of their right in their parents as soon as they have run through the cash in hand are forced to return to the hunting grounds. These two drawbacks alone mean the ever-lasting repetition of the premises & slackness of any true discipline.\n\nThen there is the question of morals. I have never seen these lower in standard among any people. True not entirely due to themselves but rather to the cosmopolitan influx during the gold rush of '95. & the want of law order.\nat the present time. It is no uncommon thing, in fact, the general rule, for little girls of 13 to be open prostitutes; some even younger than the above age are known to be of doubtful chastity. Telegraph Creek, some 12 miles away, harbours mischief. The evil, whiskey may be obtained for the asking; there is profanity, of living between whites & Indians; little boys & girls swear all the filth of camp followers before they can even speak their own tongue decently; mankind is laid waste on all sides; motherhood is shunned at & influences frequent childbirths are encouraged. Morals cannot attain a very high standard in such an environment. I appeal now for a school that will give these children an ordinary chance of being brought up in a \"human way.\" Such a school would be welcomed by quite a few families. The parents at Pahli can take a keen delight in seeing their children neat tidy & in setting them to attend regularly at school. A school that would contain all practical virtues combined with some arts of hand crafts would be one of the greatest blessings the Government could bestow upon this tribe. And yet it is not desirable to educate the youth here beyond themselves so as to bring discontent among them & make the girls too proud to marry their own kind. A Boarding & Industrial...\nSchool is what is really needed. The children from adjacent hills might be brought to this school. Sable Fan is distant from the liquor traffic\u2014no good habits could be kept off. The town is the home of the people who could see their children as frequently as convenient. The cost need not be very great. A wagon road passes just below the village making transportation of material & foods will with a moment's notice.\n\nI am writing to Bishop Ro Vernet asking him what extent the Church could help; but he is failing much support in that quarter. I feel confident the Department will put some little consideration to my remarks.\n\nI have the honor,\n\nTo be your faithful & obedient servant,\n\nF. P.

The school board then communicated with the member for this electoral district, urging him to have the grant from the Department continued, and arrangements were made with the Rev. T.P. Thorman, former school master for the Tahltan school who was then on his way to England, to send his son out to fill the position. Meanwhile as the provincial law called for an attendance of eight pupils before the grant from the local government could be claimed, and there were only two white children of school age, every effort was made to have the Indians with children send their boys to the Telegraph Creek school to make up the required number. Mr. W. Thorman the new master arrived on the 1st of November and immediately opened school with an attendance of 14, Indian children and two whites. Most of these children were formerly on the roll at the Tahltan Mission school but their parents were staying here for the winter, as they can secure steady employment, consequently there are no children at the Tahltan village and there is very little hope of conditions changing later on.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nW. Scott Simpson,\n\nIndian Agent for Stikine Division, B.C.\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg leave to report that no children have attended the Indian School at Tahltan since it was closed for the Summer Holidays, in August, as three of the families have moved to Telegraph Creek and are sending their children to the assisted School in this place. After Newyear there will be a few Indians at the Village on the Reserve and these will be urged to send their children to the School.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nW. Scott Simpson\nIndian Agent for Stikine Division.\nOttawa, September 4, 1912.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's communication of the 23rd ultimo in reference to the Tahltan School.\n\nSome few days ago a communication was received from Rev. T. P. Thorman and the Department was aware that he was leaving the school and was to be succeeded by his son, Rev. F. P. Thorman.\n\nThe Department regrets that Mr. Thorman has severed his connection with this work and the appointment of his son is approved. The salary allowed will be at the same rate. As the Department is not aware of Rev. T. P. Thorman's address I should be glad if Your Lordship would convey to him the Department's appreciation of his services while at this school.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. F. H. DuVernet, D.D.,\nBishop of Caledonia,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nTo the Secretary of the\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that Rev.T.P.W.Thorman is here on his way back to England and that his son, Rev.Frederick P.Thorman, B.A., of Cambridge arrived at Tahltan the 20th. of this month to relieve his father as missionary, also if acceptable to the Department as teacher of the Indian Bay School. Mr. Simpson met him at Telegraph Creek. He is familiar with the Tahltan language, having lived as a boy at Tahltan years ago.\n\nOur Diocesan Mission Fund has had to pay $250. for his travelling expenses. He had to wait ten days at Wrangell, and was ten days getting\nup the Stikine River. As it would be impossible for a young man to live alone in an isolated Indian village with the thermometer sometimes 60\u00b0 below zero, we are paying his brother Robert to remain and keep house, and assist in the work. The grant from the Department $500. towards teacher's salary, and $250. for rent for school building only covers about half the cost. I hope that there will be no diminution in the grant.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nF. H.

H. Dewar)\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nHas appointed one of my sons a young Priest a \"BA\" of Exeter College Cambridge England who knows the language of these Indians to succeed me; he will receive the Mission at Tahltan in a few days.\n\nThe School has wonderfully prospered during the time I have been here, but it should always be remembered at Ottawa Rules and Regulations that apply elsewhere in Canada are not (or are not) to be put in force here.\n\nAugt 7th 1912.\nThe Indian Agent says there are not \"treat Indians\" consequently no pressure is brought to bear upon them to attend School.\n\nAlso this is a most expensive place to reside in, far away in the wilderness and prices on all goods food included range 300 to 400 per cent higher than Vancouver or Victoria which are both 750 to 800 miles to the South.\n\nIf there be many or few children attending School expenses remain the same. Moreover it should be remembered after Oct. 1st no one can possibly feel the Country (only under exceptional circumstances) until May of following year.\n\nOne is glad ice 10 to 15 feet of snow falls, glass drops to 50 to 60 below zero in this mountain region.

Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 5th instant reporting the result of your inspection of the Tahltan School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is much pleased to learn that you found conditions so satisfactory on this reserve. The drawbacks which Mr Thorman has to contend with are appreciated, but it is hoped that with the combined interests of himself and the agent the usefulness of the school will be still increased.\n\nNo reduction will be made in the grant, should there be a few days in which the school will have to be closed owing to the absence of the Indians. Arrangements have been made to take the annual holidays in the fall instead of during July and August which will be a help in so far as the attendance is concerned.\n\nI have the honour to be Sir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nRight Rev. F.H. DuVernet, D.D.,\nBishop of Caledonia,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nOttawa, June 14, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that T. P. Thorman, Teacher of the Tsiltnan Indian Day School, in his quarterly return of attendance for the quarter ended March 31st, last, which has just reached the Department, states that there has been a great decrease in the attendance at that school and that there is no likelihood of any better attendance for some months, and, therefore, he suggests that the school had better be closed until a better attendance is assured.\n\nActing on the teacher's report, the Department considers that, as there is not enough Indian children to warrant the continuance of this school, it should be closed for a time at least. You can, therefore, inform Mr. Thorman to discontinue the teaching of this school at the end of the current quarter, June 30th, next. When, however, you are satisfied that a sufficient number of Indian families have returned to that place, you can so inform the Department, when the re-opening of this school will be considered. The teacher should forward a return showing the attendance for the current quarter, when the amount of salary and rent due for that period will be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D.

Original on File 357576-2.\n\nREMARKS.\n\nThe report for this quarter shows a great decrease in the attendance. The war has killed all educational enterprises in this vicinity and there is no likelihood on any better attendance for some few months, may be years, to come. Most of the Indians never had more money in hand than would serve to keep them for a few days they saw ahead and now they have nothing at all. They can, however, quite easily keep themselves in the woods on the wild game but the school had better be postponed until better times are in sight. I could not promise any better result than this during the meantime.\n\nSgd. T. P.

At present there are a few of the old people in the village some of whom are sick and under Mr. Thorman's care, and those with families will probably remain on their winter hunting grounds where game can be readily procured until Christmas or New Year.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 26, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of a report on your inspection of the Tahltan and Telegraph Creek Indian schools, dated September 29th, last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say with reference to the school at Tahltan, that the Department agrees with you that there is no necessity for re-opening this school at the present time.\n\nYou will be good enough to advise the authorities of the Church of England, under whose auspices this school is conducted, accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary\n\nA.

September 29th, 1916.\n\nSTICKINE AGENCY.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith the following report on the schools of the Stickine Agency recently visited.\n\nSCHOOL AT THALTAN - English Church.\n\nThe Indian School at Thaltan has been closed down, owing to the Reverend Mr. Thorman having enlisted. The people of Thaltan have stayed in the Mountains this year more than formerly, for the reason that they can thus get their food supplies more easily. On this account I believe that there is no necessity for having this school open at the present time.\n\nSCHOOL AT TELEGRAPH CREEK - Undenominational.\n\nThe Indian School at Telegraph Creek is under the British Columbia Government, and the teacher's name is \"Robert Fournier\". This school is attended by the Indian children of Dry Town, and there were 12 there on the day I visited the school, accompanied by the Indian Agent. The teacher reports that the children are doing very well, and the building is a good substantial one with good ventilation and very satisfactory sanitary conditions.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nDUNCAN C. SCOTT, ESQ.,\nDEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL,\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nOTTAWA, CANADA.\nTelegraph Creek,\nJuly, 10th, 1915,\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of June 14th, #375576\u2014I with reference to the closing of the Tahltan School, I will be leaving on 12th, to inspect the reserve and will notify Mr. Thorman of this matter.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nA. Scott Simpson\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.,\nJune 15th, 1934.\n\nSir:-\n\nReport covering May, 1934.\n\nDuring the month, the local Thaltan Band of Indians expressed the desire to Mr. Will Thorman of the Anglican Mission, which recently has been doing some very good work, that a summer school should be opened up at the Thaltan Fish Camp, to serve the many children residing there at this time of the year.\n\n(sgd) Harper Reed\nIndian Agent.\nThe Minister of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOntario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThere is, as you know, a tribe of Indians on the Stikine River above Telegraph Creek. A number of them live in \"The Creek\" but many of them wish to be again settled at their old village of Tahl-Tan, where it would be much better if they were all living. Your Department evidently has realized this as you made a small grant recently to assist in obtaining a better water supply for the old village. These natives when at Tahl-tan are in touch with both their fishing and hunting and the mothers and children can stay at home while the men are away.\n\nThe establishment of a small school there for about five or six months in the summer would be of great value. Mr. Harper Reid, the Indian Agent in that area, also recommends this.\n\nThere is a first class man there who could take charge of this school. He is a son of an early missionary there and talks the language of the people, but was educated in England and had taken two years at Oxford before the Great War broke out. He was a tutor for some time in an English family.\n\nI will be glad to hear from you re this matter and trust you will give it favourable consideration. If you place this school under my supervision I shall do all I can to make it as useful as possible. I may say that nearly all the natives who will live at Tahl-tan will be Church of England.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd.) G. A. Rix.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMinister's Office\n\nOct. 25th, 1934.\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nI am sending you, herewith, a letter addressed to the Minister by the Right Reverend G.A. Rix, Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Caledonia.\n\nWill you please return this and at the same time furnish the Minister with a draft reply.\n\nEnd.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nOctober 29, 1934.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BUSKARD,\n\nI have your memorandum of the 25th instant, forwarding a communication addressed to the Honourable the Minister from Right Reverend G. A. Rix, D.D., Bishop of the Diocese of Caledonia, requesting that a grant be provided towards the conducting of a summer school for the benefit of the Indian children at Tahltan, in the Stikine agency, northern British Columbia.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that a day school was in operation at this point for a number of years previous to 1916 - when it was closed for lack of attendance. No school facilities have been provided since that time.\n\nIf the church authorities can provide a building for classroom purposes, I would be pleased to recommend that a grant be authorized to pay teacher's salary for, approximately, a five month period during the summer of 1935 and that His Lordship be informed accordingly. In the meantime, the Department can communicate with the local Indian agent, ascertain the number of children that would be available and complete arrangements for the conduct of the school during the summer months. The Bishop requests that this school be placed under his supervision, and he could be requested to nominate a teacher, to begin duties on or about May first, 1935, and teach until the end of September following - a five month period. As requested, I am returning the Bishop's letter.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, October 30, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nHis Lordship the Bishop of the Diocese of Caledonia has requested the establishment of a school, for a period of about five or six months in the summer, for the benefit of the Indian children in the village of Tahltan.\n\nIn this connection I would refer to your letter of the 30th ultimo to Mr. Perry, Assistant Indian Commissioner, Victoria, B. C. It is noted that, during the past summer, a school was conducted by Mr. Will Thorman, assisted by his wife, as a voluntary work.\n\nThe Department will be pleased to provide a grant towards salary of teacher for approximately a five month period during the summer of 1935. We will also supply any text books and classroom material required. It is presumed that there is a suitable building for carrying on classroom work. We will have no funds to provide or fit up a building, but, it is hoped that, with the present arrangements, suitable accommodation can be provided.\n\nI would request that, in due time, you forward a requisition for the classroom materials required and also forward a nomination from His Lordship Bishop Rix of a suitable teacher. It is considered that, if a school was in operation from, approximately, May first to September 30th, this would meet the needs at this point. You might state the number of children who could attend.\n\nIt is to be understood that the summer school at Tahltan will be under the auspices and supervision of Bishop Rix.\n\nYou will be written, in a separate communication, regarding school facilities for the Bear Lake or Klappan Indian children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nHarper Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B. C.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM HARPER REED, INDIAN AGENT, TELEGRAPH CREEK, B. C., dated September 30, 1934\n\nOriginal on 77-158\n\nTherefore, as reported, this Spring, at the request of Chief Charlie Quash, a summer school was started out on the Thaltan Reserve, by Mr. Will Thorman, helped by his wife, which was voluntary mission work. It has worked very well and is certainly approved of, by this Office. An Indian Agent could not do otherwise than be thankful, as it kept all these youngsters out of this very dirty little town. Enclosed please find a letter that Mr. Thorman has directed to this office, covering his work, with also an attached Photo, showing some of his children. He intends to \"carry-on\" and of course hopes that the Department will see the matter in the right light, and perhaps later on supply some books, etc., for his summer's work. As his children nearly all go out to the woods in the winter with their families, to their registered trap-grounds, of course this school closes during the winter months.\nMr. Harper Reed,\nIndian Office T/C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThis report of the Summer School at Tahltan is somewhat belated as I've been busy moving, i.e., walking, back and forth from Telegraph Creek to Tahltan which has taken up considerable of my time, in consequence I find myself behind in much of my work.\n\nI opened a day school at Tahltan on June 25th and closed after 36 school days on the 23rd day of August having taught school on 3, 4 and sometimes 5 days a week as I was able to fit in the days with any other work.\n\nTen pupils attended, the names are as follows: Andrew Dick, James Dick, Mona Etzerza, Charles Etzerza, Mable Henry, Lawrence Henry, Leonard Henry, Fansy Quash, Matilda Quash, Lennox Quash, the first six have at broken intervals attended the school in Telegraph Creek but the last four have not previously attended any school. None of these children had attended any school since prior to Easter. These children were in the vicinity of Tahltan since Mid-March when the men folk left their families to go Spring Beaver hunting.\n\nThe school closing was made to facilitate the families fall excursion to the mountains for \"grease.\"\n\nThere were other children who would have attended school but arrived too late in the season, also the severe summer colds prevalent this year were a drawback.\n\nI have omitted to add that the above mentioned children came from four families and averaged an attendance of 7.9.\n\nThe idea of the Mission summer school was not to run in opposition to the Provincial School at Telegraph Creek but to give those children in the vicinity of Tahltan an opportunity to continue their studies, or start them as the case might be without going into the undesirable atmosphere of Telegraph Creek. In addition the spring and summer months are devoted to tanning hides for mocassins and clothing and for drying fish which occupations are not so readily accomplished in Telegraph Creek.\n\nWhile not wishing to minimise the work of the school in Telegraph Creek, Emphatically this is not the place to further their welfare\u2014the tone is far from high\u2014which statement you will agree is correct when you consider the class of homes from which so many of the Provincial Pupils come. These pupils, about 20 in number, are with the exception of two white boys all half breeds, quarter breeds, etc. Indeed, from many years of observation, I consider many of the Indian encampments as being a far more suitable place in which to rear children than in Telegraph Creek.\n\nThe school at Telegraph Creek is crowded and if the Provincial Pupils receive their measure of tuition, how can an Indian child unless he be unduly bright keep abreast of the Provincial Pupils?\n\nWithout wishing to stretch this report to undue length, as you are already aware of all of the above stated facts I would add that the summer school was received well, well attended and with better luck will be more successful next summer when we hope to have...\nmore equipment. I was late in getting the news around that a school would be held. There was a little background of opposition also as it was thought that it might interfere with the Provincial School. I studiously avoided any friction with the Provincial programme.\n\nThere is little likelihood of any of the children, whom I taught this summer, attending Telegraph Creek school or being in the vicinity of Telegraph Creek or Tahltan until next March.\n\nThis should have been May. Indian families simply cannot afford to come to town until after the Beated Hunt is finished & the Beated Hunt will be \"Feet\" Beated all gone. H.R. J.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"W. P.

The building is a new one and the school roll shows nineteen pupils. It has, I understand, a grant for five months of the year. A good start seems to have been made, and the probability is that as time goes on and more Indians erect houses, the attendance will be bigger.

BOX 656\nVICTORIA, B.C.\n\nFebruary 4, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge, with thanks, receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, file 158-2-1, re the opening of a summer school for the Indian children at Tahltan, in the Stikine Agency, during the coming summer months, with Mr. W. Thorman as teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C. Perry.\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 27, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department is approving of the opening of a summer school for the Indian children at Tahltan, in the Stikine agency, during the coming summer months. The school will likely be in operation from May first, 1936, for a period of approximately five months. We are informed, by Mr. Harper Reed, the Indian Agent, that Mr. W. Thorman, who taught this school last year, will carry out teaching duties during the coming summer. The salary allowed will be at the same rate as previously paid, viz.: $90.00 per teaching month. Mr. Agent Reed is being informed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner,\nBox 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nMay I, therefore, urge your department to take this matter under advisement and I trust, you will find it advisable to provide a good school for this somewhat important village in the near future.\n\nIn the village of Kitwanga there never has been any school, either building or teacher. There must be at least a score of children there of school age who are getting no education. Your agent in that district, Captain Mortimer, has discussed this with me and it may be that he has already brought this need to your attention. These people have had a turbulent history, but are now quite ready to work in harmony with the state and a great help to establishing this condition would be in placing a school there.\n\nAt Kiksgas, a very small native village without any school is anxious for a teacher, they would be satisfied with just the most elementary teaching. Your Agent will probably write re these people and I beg to urge a sympathetic treatment of their case.\n\nAsking for consideration of the above, I am\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop of Caledonia.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am, as you will see by the letterhead, in Montreal a long way from my western Diocese and as mails are very uncertain to and from the Telegraph Creek region so that I can not well communicate with you through your agent there. I am therefore bringing the following matters directly to your attention.\n\n1. It is our desire to continue the school for natives at Tahltan this coming summer as we have in the past and solicit the usual co-operation of your department in this matter. Mr. W. Thorman is our efficient teacher there.\n\n2. I have been informed that it is the purpose of the department to build a school at Dease Lake this spring. There are a number of our Anglican natives there and I believe some Roman Catholics and that the department wishes the school to be run along non-denomination lines. Would your department give me the particulars re this enterprise?\n\n(a) Is the school to be built, and when ready for use?\n(b) How long a time in the summer will it be expected to be carried on?\n(c) What salary will be paid to a teacher in this very difficult place?\n(d) Will the government pay travelling expenses of a teacher going in for the short time the school is to be in operation? I would be glad to get this information as early as possible so that if necessary I could set about the task of getting a suitable man.\n\n3. In the village of Aiyansh, or sometimes called Gitlakdamics, there never has been a building for an Indian day school. A large room in the Mission House being used for this purpose. This is not as suitable as it should be, by any means, which fact is agreed to both by the Inspector of Indian Schools, the Church and the natives themselves. The Indian Agent, Mr. W. E. Collison agrees with this also.\nTelegraph Creek, B.C., June 17, 1937.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith a report covering the month of May 1937.\n\nThe Anglican school of the Thaltan Reserve has already started and was inspected the other day, when it was found very good work was in progress.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated March 12th in regard to the Anglican Mission Summer Day School, conducted on The Tahltan Indian Reserve; which same is under the care of Mr W. Thorman.\n\nEvery thing is now in order and the school will open up on the first of next month.\n\nHis Lordship Rt. Rev. G.A. Rix, D.D. has been so advised.

However, in view of representations that have been made the Department is prepared to allow salary for a six month period.\n\nYou should advise me later the exact date on which this school opened and also the date on which it closes.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nHarper Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.

Rix, D.D. of Prince Rupert B.C., has been respectfully written to requesting that the name of the school teacher be submitted by him, to the Department - for next summer's work on the above Reserve.\n\nThere is little doubt but that it will be again Mr. W. F. Thorman, and therefore with his help a list of supplies has been made up and submitted.\n\nThis summer school has been opened as from May 1st until the end of September, but after going into the matter most carefully it is certainly thought that this school should open as at April 1st and close down at the end of September. The reason for this being that all the families move out there at the end of March, and then the men go away for their Beaver Hunt. The Salary paid Mr Thorman as Teacher for this school is at $90-00 per month.\n\nMay the necessary Authority be allowed to again place this very good school into action, once more.\n\nI am.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept.

Thorman as teacher at Tahl-Tan Indian Day School between the arranged times of April 1st and end of September.\n\nI have had it suggested to me by Mr. Thorman that a somewhat longer time would be advisable, but this request should come to you through Mr. Reed. He may not think this is necessary.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nG. A. Rix.\nOttawa,\nMarch 15, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn a letter just received from His Lordship Right Reverend G. A.

W. Thorman as teacher of the Tahltan Reserve\nSummer Day School for 1940.\n\nSometime ago I interviewed the B.C. Indian Commissioner\nin relation to Mr. J. Hayhurst of Kitwanga. Mrs. Hayhurst\nis a qualified teacher at that place and he among other\nduties is on constant call by the natives for First Aid\nwork and the dispensing of medicines. In visiting him a\nshort time ago, he had three most serious accidents to attend\nto in one day. It has been customary that a person doing\nsuch work receives some remuneration for it. In fact,\nwhen he was at the village of Greenville last year he\nreceived $25.00 per month. He is very efficient in this\nsort of thing and I have written the Babine Agent on his\nbehalf, but as I was writing about the first mentioned\nmatter to you, I venture to bring this urgent matter to\nyour attention.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nGeorge Caledonia.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 8, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 10th ultimo with reference to the Tahltan Seasonal School.\n\nThe Department can allow the teacher of this school a salary of $90.00 a month for a period of 5 months only. This will involve a total expenditure of $450.00 for salary and is the total amount that can be provided in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1940-41.\n\nIt is noted that you will advise me later regarding the name and qualifications of the teacher nominated for this school by Rt.

(summer)\nAnglican Mission.\n\nI beg to submit a Report on the above Indian Seasonal Day School, situated in the Tahltan Village and on that Reserve.\n\nUnder Authority 158-2-1, February 20th 1940, permission was granted to operate this school over the summer, for a period of 5 months. Mr (Rev) W.P. Thorman was appointed the Teacher, as in years gone by, and the Salary allowed was at the rate of $90-00 per month. Replacement of school materials was granted with also some few extras all of which were obtained and forwarded to this school.\n\nUpon going over the Records of School Reports, it is seen that this school has operated for a period of 6 months, and not as originally arranged. As your Agent was on duty in the south part of B.C., during the month of September, it is not known as to if the Department allowed this extra period, or not. Returning after the visit to the South, the September School Report was received from Teacher Thorman without comment, and with pressure of work in this Office was forwarded to the Department; and the extra month not mentioned.\n\nThe School has been doing good work, and the attendance fair, but without doubt were the Rev Thorman to insist that other indian children, belonging to his Mission\u2014that could and should attend this excellent school\u2014were induced to do so\u2014much extra good work would be accomplished. This would also, perhaps, go away with the attendance of indian children to the Provincial Day School in Telegraph Creek; during the winter months. Several children spending the summers at the near-by Fish Camp, and on this Reserve, should be made to attend this school.\n\nHere again is a matter for the inspection of Inspector Coleman during his visit to these parts; next summer. It is considered that this school should be reopened next summer as at April First, and that the usual supplies be allowed, with the Salary the same as in past times. It is expected that Mr Thorman will again be nominated as the Teacher, by his Bishop, but this question will be settled at a later date.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept.

They think that it would be advisable to have it longer but if it could be extended to six months for 1940 it may be satisfactory to them.\n\nTrusting that you will have this matter looked into and awaiting your comment, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nOlof Hanson.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated February 20th with regard to the Tahltan Day School, located on that reserve.\n\nMr. W.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Harper Reed,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nbut the schools were not in session, consequently no examination could be made of the children in their work. These are reported on as follows:\n\nTAHLTON (Anglican)\n\nThis school 19x23 9'6\" wall, was erected in 1936 at a cost of about $300.00 to the Department, some labour or supervision apparently being given by Mr. Thomas. It is well constructed of logs with ample lighting from one side, the floor being covered with roofing material and painted, a common practice in this district. It is equipped of eleven double homemade desks and a drum heater. There is only one latrine for both sexes and another should be constructed, the cost being about $15.00. Regular school desks, fastened on battens would well be provided for this school when funds are available. There is no blackboard, apart from a piece of black oil cloth about 4 yard square. I would recommend the supply of two sections of regular blackboard material and chalk rail.\n\nIt is noted that the school has an extension at the rear about 12' square, fitted out with stained glass window altar, etc. and that the school is used for Church services. This appears to be the general practice in this agency and I very much question the practice as there are, in my opinion, serious objections to the use of a school room for religious gatherings of adults owing to the increased risk of infection besides the disorganization of the school set up. The children's desks could hardly be considered satisfactory pews for adults. In addition, the presence of so much religion paraphernalia is somewhat out of colour in a class room. If it must remain, I would recommend that it be screened off by suitable doors when school is in session. These remarks apply to the other schools visited, Dease Lake, McAdam, although the Rev. Father Carpentier has screened off the altar. The Indians should be induced by the Missionaries to erect separate buildings for church purposes.\n\nThe average monthly attendance at Tahltan school varied between 13 and 18. The village is quite small. Grades are as follows: Grade 1 -- 4 pupils, average age 7\u00bd\n\" 2 -- 11 pupils \" 10\n\" 3 -- 3 \" 12\n\" 4 -- 2 \" 12\u00bd\n\" 5 -- 2 \" 15\n\nSchools. Stikine.\n\nBoys. 13 Girls 10. Total 23.\n\nWhile I did not have an opportunity of checking the school work owing to it being closed for the winter, I am dubious of our getting the best results from the tuition given. The teacher is unmarried and did not appear to me to have any particular qualifications for the work. He is a lay missionary and anything else that he can stick on. His duties as Coroner and Magistrate is also apt to interfere with his school duties, at that, he probably has the most efficient Indian school in the district. He is at least English speaking, in contrast to the other Indian school teachers.\n\nI made some suggestions to him in respect to school work, but I doubt whether he was appreciative of them.\n\nThis school, with proper supervision, should fill the local need.\n\nFollowing is a list of the texts in use:\n- Highschool Reader for all grades.\n- Quebec Speller\n- Smith, Luse & Addison Arithmetic for all Grades.\n- Bailey Writing for all grades.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Bishop Rix D.D. has already written to the Department submitting the name of Mr W.F. Thorman for a Teacher, as in years past.\n\nAs the season has opened, permission was given Mr Thorman to start teaching, as usual, commencing on the first of this month. Herewith submitted is a Requisition covering the present season, for School Supplies. The Material Brooms - Lysol - Bucket & Brush could be supplied from this point, if allowed.\n\nIt is a pleasure to state that one or two families have mentioned their intentions of moving out from this crowded Townsite to the Tahltan Reserve and will send their children to this school. This will relieve the present over-crowding of the local Provincial Day-school, and be better in every respect.\n\nThis matter will be placed in front of Inspector Coleman upon his visitation to the Reserve, for now the present school building is not too large, and certainly will be too small when all these extra children; expected to attend do arrive there.\n\nIt is hoped from a health point of view alone, to say nothing about the local Town Troubles that crop up regarding all our children, that many Indian families again reside at Tahltan Reserve, as of old.\n\nA movement is on foot to create a Winter School at this Reserve, which is not quite favoured by Mr Thorman, but as the Indians say, if a winter camp is made here, in every way the Indians would reap a benefit.\n\nI am.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept.

The two boys mentioned are sons of Mr. Day and Amy Jackson.\n\nOwing to the distance which Mr. Day lives from Telegraph Creek it is impossible for him to send his children in here for schooling and he states he is not able to board them out. The Tahltan School is about five miles from Mr. Day's Ranch and the children could travel to school by horse. The school teacher has no objection to teaching these two boys and as the school is not crowded just now I would respectfully recommend that permission be granted to Mr. Day to allow the children to attend provided of course that their attendance does not in any way interfere with the schooling of the Indian Children.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.H.S.

The attendance was not as good as it could be and steps were taken to improve same. Progress is generally good at this school. An application has been made to the Provincial Public Works Department to authorize the erection of warning signs in the vicinity of the school on the highway requesting drivers of vehicles to watch for school children.\n\nR.H.S. Sampson.\nActg. Indian Agent.\nAGENT'S REPORT ON STIKINE AGENCY FOR MONTH OF AUGUST 1942.\n\nTAHLTAN SEASONAL SCHOOL. This school was inspected during the month. Attendance was only fair and it is felt that sterner methods will have to be employed next year if attendance is to be improved. The feeblest excuse is enough to keep children away and parents show very little co-operation. The school teacher who is also the Anglican Missionary, has little, if any control over the situation. The progress is good at this school and it is a pity that attendance is not better.\n\nR. H. S Sampson.\nActg. Indian Agent.\nOttawa, November 9, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER.\n\nRe: - Mr. W. P. Thorman.\n\nThe records here indicate that W. P. Thorman has been employed by this Branch as teacher of a seasonal Indian day school in the Stikine agency. This school, which is known as the Tahltan Seasonal School, is a comparatively small building and had at the date of the last inspection - April, 1942 - an enrolment of 11 pupils.\n\nMr. Thorman was nominated for this school by the Right Reverend G. A. Rix, Anglican Bishop of the diocese of Caledonia. The Bishop, in a letter dated October 15, 1934, states:\n\n\"There is a first class man there who could take charge of this school. He is a son of an early missionary there and talks the language of the people. He was educated in England and took two years at Oxford before the Great War broke out. He was a tutor for some time in an English family.\"\n\nThe acting Indian agent, Mr. R.H.S. Sampson, in his last report on the school, states:\n\n\"The general progress at this school is better than at other seasonal schools in the agency, although even here there appears to be room for much improvement. The schoolroom is small and when attendance increases there will be crowding, as the home-made double desks in use are bulky.\"\n\nThere is very little on file here with respect to the work undertaken and accomplished by Mr. Thorman. The few reports we have, however, would indicate that his work at the school has been satisfactory.\n\nDirector.\nThis memorandum was prepared in response to a telephone message of November 7, 1942 from Mr. Jackson in the Deputy Minister's Office to Mr. Hors.\n\n[Signature]\n\nOffice Director\nDOMINION OF CANADA\nDEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL REVENUE\nINCOME TAX DIVISION\n\nName of Employee: THORMAN\nSurname or Family Name: William\nChristian or Given Names: William\nAddress: Telegraph Creek\nCity or Town: Telegraph Creek\nProvince: B.C.\n\nName and Address of Employer:\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch\nAlice Thorman, Telegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nFull Name and present address of Wife (or Husband):\nI hereby certify that I am a married person \u2612; a widow \u2610; an unmarried or divorced person \u2610.\n\n1.

The other copy of Form N.D.T.1 is to be retained on file by the employer where it will be available at any time for inspection by officers of the Inspector of Income Tax.\n\nIn cases where Form N.D.T.1 is incomplete and filed, the employee is to be regarded for purposes of taxation as a single person without dependents. It will accordingly be apparent that it is unnecessary for single persons claiming widow or widower status or a tax credit in respect of dependents, engaged by more than one employer during the year, to file separate declarations for each employer.\n\nMoreover, if during the year any change occurs in the status of an employee, the employee must complete and file with his employer an amended Form N.D.T.1 in duplicate.\n\nForm N.D.T.1 may be obtained from local banks, post offices or from the office of any District Inspector of Income Tax.\n\nFurther information with respect to operation of the tax on and after 1st July, 1941, may be obtained from any District Inspector of Income Tax.\n\n(SEE REVERSE SIDE)\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6417, file 851-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSECTION 91 OF THE INCOME WAR TAX ACT\n\n(Being Section 26, 4 Geo.

In the past it was presumed that where a teacher had been nominated for a particular school, he would continue at that post each season unless other arrangements were made in which case the Department would be notified beforehand.

Salary is available for a five-month period at the rate of $60.00 a teaching month, plus bonus. As you are aware, the school is usually operated from April 1 to August 31. I presume that Mr. W.P. Thorman will resume duties, but, if his services are not available, you should communicate with Rt. Rev. Bishop Rix immediately and have him nominate a teacher. Please let me hear from you as soon as possible. In the event of a new teacher being appointed, new forms will be required. I enclose these.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSir:\n\nDepartment File 158-2-1.\n\nAs instructed in Department letter of March 20th last Mr. W.P. Thorman, teacher at Tahltan Seasonal School, was asked to complete a National Defence Tax form and cost-of-living bonus form. Mr. Thorman completed the enclosed National Defence Tax form last May and turned it into the office and at that time was asked for the cost-of-living bonus form. He stated he would submit it as soon as possible. The National Defence Tax form was held pending receipt of the bonus form. Recently I again enquired regarding the cost-of-living form and Mr. Thorman stated he did not intend submitting another form as he had sent one in last year.\n\nIf another cost-of-living bonus form is required please advise me and I will have Mr. Thorman forward same.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.H.S.

The health of the children was fair but attendance is low so far.\n\nKlappan Seasonal Indian School closed at the end of the month and the teacher, Rev. B. Arsenault, O.M.I. walked into town over 60 miles of trail. Good work has been done this season but attendance has not been good due to so much sickness.\n\nR.H.S. Sampson,\nIndian Agent.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI have been asked by the Indian Agent at Telegraph Creek, B.C. to send direct to you my nomination of a teacher for the Tahltan Indian School, and to send him a carbon copy of my letter to you.\n\nI hereby nominate the Rev. W. Thorman for that position again for the coming year. He has been a satisfactory teacher for that school for several years.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nG.A.

Rix, Bishop of Caledonia, nominating Reverend W. Thomas as teacher of the Tahltan Seasonal School for the period April 1 to August 31, 1944. His appointment is approved and he will be allowed salary at the same rate as previously; namely, $90.00 a teaching month, plus bonus.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 11, 1944.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 4th instant, nominating Reverend W.

Salary will be allowed him as previously; namely, at the rate of $90.00 a teaching month, plus bonus.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRt. Rev. G.A. Rix,\nBishop of Caledonia,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nMarch 15, 1944.\n\nDear Bishop Rix:\n\nI have your letter of February 25th forwarding Mr. Thorman's letter to you of February 1st resigning as teacher of the Tahltan Indian summer school. Mr. Thorman appears very definite in his desire to resign and I have, therefore, recommended to the Department that his resignation be accepted.\n\nInspector Coleman reported that the lands of the Reserve in use by Mr. Thorman were needed by the Indians for the production of garden produce and the action of the Department in requesting Mr. Thorman to discontinue his use of these lands for this reason has, no doubt, been largely responsible for his resignation. I may say that the Department has for some time emphasized the importance of Indians being encouraged to the fullest possible extent in developing gardens and Mr. Coleman had this in mind in making the recommendation referred to.\n\nIt is my intention to visit Prince Rupert in connection with Departmental matters within the next few weeks and should be glad to arrange to call to see you regarding the schools in your diocese and other matters. Mr. Thorman's letter is being returned herewith.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Rt. Rev. G.A. Rix,\nBishop of Caledonia,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nThe Bishop of Caledonia,\nThe Close,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nMy dear Bishop Rix:\n\nI thank you for your letter of January 10th, in which you mentioned the matter of a School Teacher for Tahl-Tan Summer School for 1944.\n\nWith your consent and approval I should wish to be relieved of what has, since April 1943, become a distasteful duty. I have no assurance that the Indian Department will not visit upon me additional indignities. I have suffered an injustice amounting to a persecution at their hands. The Inspector of Indian Agencies Coleman has already written into a document charges of hypocrisy in that I had ulterior motives as a teacher, for gardening was a part of that teaching. I can allow him no further opportunity to exploit his imagination at the expense of what has always been a sincere undertaking. You are aware that the work at Tahl-Tan was first of all devotional and was recognised as such by the previous Agent H. Reed.\n\nIsolated for between five and six months each year, from companionship, regular mail, conveniences of a home, and providing for a separate establishment under a salary never commensurate with the duties. These were never unbearable with a certain appreciation from the Indian Department and fortified by the spirit in which such duties are accepted. When I lack the confidence of the Indian Department I lack the essential that could make me a successful teacher in their employ.\n\nFor them to arbitrarily withdraw a privilege which privilege I produced from nothing, is a form of persecution I am unable to accept.\n\nI dutifully request that you favourably consider my most earnest desire to decline any further duties under the Indian Department.\n\nI am,\nYour Lordship,\nYours faithfully,\n\nW.P. Thorman.\nCopy sent to Mr. Sampson\n\nOttawa,\nMarch 20, 1944.\n\nEX'D A.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant,\nin which you advise that Reverend W.P. Thomas\nwill not be in charge of the Tahltan Seasonal\nSchool during the coming summer. I presume\nthat Bishop Rix will nominate someone else.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI have been advised by the Rt. Rev. G. A. Rix, D.D.,\nBishop of Caledonia, that Mr. W. P. Thorman, teacher of the\nsummer Indian school at Tahltan, has resigned. A copy of\nMr. Thorman's letter to Bishop Rix setting forth the reasons\nfor his decision, together with copies of related correspondence,\nare enclosed. I would recommend that Mr. Thorman's resignation\nbe accepted.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncls.\nStikine Agency,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.,\nApril 28, 1944.\n\nJames Coleman, Esq., Inspector of Indian Agencies for B.C.\n\nYour 1941 inspection report on this agency requested that the ownership of the mission schools be cleared up and the following data is submitted in that respect:\n\n**Caribou Hide Seasonal School:** As reported in June 15, 1942, report on this school the building was constructed by Mr. Jim Anglin, a school teacher, assisted by the Indians who cut and skidded logs as well as assisting in the erection of the building. The Department supplied some roofing to the value of about $100.00 including transportation from Telegraph Creek. The Roman Mission considers the Indians' help as donated and therefore claim complete ownership of the building; the Department's assistance being counted as a grant and not necessarily giving them part ownership. The value of the building is estimated at about $800.00.\n\n**Dease Lake Seasonal School:** The Department supplied about $225.00 worth of material and the Roman Catholic Mission paid the Indians for their labour getting logs and erecting the building. A good deal of the work was done by the missionary himself. This building is fairly well finished and is now valued at $1500.00.\n\n**Klappan Seasonal School:** The Department supplied $300.00 for material and equipment and the school was mostly built by the Indians under the supervision of a R.C. priest. The Indians donated their labour and the Mission considers the building is theirs, the Department's assistance being a grant. The value of the building is estimated at $1200.00.\n\n**Lower Post Seasonal School:** A room in the Roman Catholic Mission building at Lower Post is used for school purposes and the Department has no interest in this school.\n\n**McDame Creek Seasonal School:** Apart from about $30.00 worth of lumber for rough desks the Department did not assist in the construction of this school. It was built by the Roman Catholic Mission and the ground floor has been used as a school and church for ten years.\n\n**Tahltan Seasonal School:** The building was constructed by the local Anglican Mission with Indian labour, mostly paid. The Department supplied about $150.00 for material but the Mission considers the building belongs to them. It is valued at about $1000.00.\n\n**Teslin Lake Seasonal Schools:** The two schools here, one Roman Catholic and the other Anglican, are owned by the respective Missions.\n\nNone of the buildings for which the Department granted material or equipment would approach the requirements of a modern day school and as the expenditures made by the Department in each case are relatively small compared to the total value of the buildings I would recommend that their interest in each school be turned over to the respective missions to give the missions full ownership. Considering that the buildings have been used several years as\n\np.t.o.\nschools without any rental being charged by the Missions, the Department would probably still not object to paying rent as authorized for the Dease Lake and Klappan schools.\n\nThe alternative to this suggestion would be to endeavour to purchase the Missions' share in the schools but I would definitely not recommend this course as I believe that it would be far less expensive, even over a period of years, to pay an annual rental of $75.00 in the case of the Dease Lake and Klappan schools and possibly Lower Post or Morice Creek if either operates, than to purchase these crude log buildings and try to improve them. From past experience it seems that the operation of these bush schools is quite problematic depending as it does upon whether or not the Indians camp at the location of the school during the usual term. At the present time it seems that any extensive outlay for establishing day school buildings would be unwise, especially in the more remote locations because it is evident that the Indians in this area as a whole are still not inclined to settle permanently in one location. Their houses in and near Telegraph Creek for the most part are used only as stopping over places between their trapping and fishing camps. This has been more evident during the past fall and winter when these people have had to earn their living from the country, as they did prior to the mining boom from 1941 to 1943 when supplies were going in by this route to Watson Lake Airport. It seems that the life-long habits of the Indians will not easily be changed, even to ensure the education of their children and the more or less temporary bush schools will probably have to serve, at least for the present.\n\nR.H.S. Sampson,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI would refer to the Inspector of Indian Agencies report of 1941 covering the Stikine Agency in which it was stated that there was some question as to the ownership of various Indian seasonal schools in that district and that the Agent had been requested to clear up the matter. Mr. Indian Agent Sampson's letter of the 28th ultimo is enclosed herewith which gives a brief report covering each building.\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. Sampson recommends that the title to these buildings remain with the Roman Catholic and the Anglican Church with which I concur.\n\nD.M.

In this connection it is noted that Mr. Thorman, who conducted the school last summer, will again act as its teacher during the coming summer.\n\nThe Department will approve of this school being carried on and will allow salary at the same rate as was paid during the summer of 1935, viz.: $90.00 per teaching month. It is understood that the school will be opened on or about May first, next, and will continue for a period of approximately 5 months. It is noted that this school, during the period it was in operation last summer, did a lot of good work.\n\nThe supply of school material considered necessary will be forwarded, addressed to you, Telegraph Creek, B. C., in time to reach Vancouver before April 15th, next. This school is to be conducted under the auspices of the Bishop of Caledonia, and I would request that, when the school opens, you will give the teacher every assistance you can in his work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nHarper Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek,\nB. C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit, herewith Schoolmaster W.P. Thorman's Day School Return, for the Tahltan Anglican Mission School, situated out on that Reserve.\n\nMr Thorman has continued the school into the month of October, so that his duties for a full month may be completed.\n\nThe School is now closed for the winter, most of the Indians having gone to their Trap Grounds, those that have not, and are able to live in the Townsite of Telegraph Creek, will send their children to the local Provincial Assisted Day School. They will be few.\n\nThe local Community, with also your Agent consider that the Tahltan Mission School has accomplished much good this summer, and it is known that better results can be expected for next summer's operations. Much credit is due to Mr Thorman.\n\nI am.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Dept.

At present, there is only one of these toilets in existence for the use of pupils of both sexes, and I would recommend approval of the application.\n\nIt is hardly likely that authority for this could be secured and reach Telegraph Creek in time to secure the account before the close of the fiscal year.

P. Thorman is the Teacher.\n\nThis school came in for an inspection by Dr Meyer with your Agent recently, and the school was found to be in excellent shape and the children well advanced in their work. Mr Thorman was even giving attention to very young children who reside on that Reserve, thereby keeping the Reserve in good order etc.\n\nHowever it was found that the Indian Family of Freddy Loodecker had moved up to that location, and two of his children were attending the school, a fact that had come about without this Office having received notice. As these children are undoubtedly belonging to the R.C. Missions, the matter is hereunder outlined.\n\nFreddy Loodecker age 38, who belongs to the Loodecker Telegraph Creek Family, and who are considered to be Anglicans - went out to Dease Lake to live some 8 years ago, and took to wife, one Fanny CHIEF, but up to date they have never married. However during that time the R.C. Mission's Record shows the following children born and christened by them:\n\nLorna - Born Oct-7-30 Baptised Father Allard June-10-31\nAlma - Jan-15-32 - - - June-28-32\nWalter - Nov-14-34 - - - June-11-35\nChera - May-2-37 - - - Poulet June-6-37.\n\nThe wife Fanny is a real nomadic, and so in a way is Freddy and so they wander from place to place, and are always leaving a \"dirty\" camp behind them. Last Fall they moved in from Dease Lake and during the Fall Lorna attended the local Provincial School, which seemed quite all right, and continued to do so up till until the end of last March. Then the family moved outto the Tahltan Reserve, no doubt because of illness in this Townsite and the overcrowded condition of the local school. Other reasons there may be but if so, same are not known.\n\nMr Thorman was seen, and stated that Inspector Pragnell when last here said that in some cases, such events could not be helped. This is thought correct in cases that come about in the Interior, but so near civilization as this is; at any rate the Indian Office should have been consulted. Mr Thorman did not even know that the pair were not married, but promised to look into the matter and find out what the intentions of Freddy Loodecker really were.\n\nThe R. C. Missions have not a school in this district directly around here; and therefore the children were left where they were; but they are aware of the incident.\n\nMay advice be allowed as to if these children should remain at this school, or attend some other.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nJune 9, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment a report submitted by you immediately following your visit to the Tahltan Reserve day school.\n\nI must state that I find it exceedingly difficult to grasp the exact meaning of the problems discussed by you in this report. The recommendation you make in the last paragraph is particularly difficult to understand. You state - \"May advice be allowed as to if these children should remain at this school or attend some other\". You will readily see how difficult it is for the Department to discover what your recommendation actually is.\n\nI am anxious to know if you sought to emphasize the fact that Freddy Loedecker was living with Fanny Chief and that the pair were unmarried or if it was your intention to emphasize the fact that a number of children who are nominally Catholics were in attendance at a school conducted under non-Catholic auspices.\n\nIt is the policy of the Department, in so far as it is humanly possible, to provide distinct and separate schools for Catholic and non-Catholic children. It is not always possible, however, to provide these facilities, particularly in the outlying districts of the Dominion. If there is no Roman Catholic day school in the district it is better to have these children attend a school conducted under the auspices of the Anglican Church than no school at all, particularly in view of the fact that the father himself appears to be an Anglican.\n\nHarper Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B. C.\nAn attempt should be made by you, in the interest of the children, to persuade this pair to get married. If they seek relief or assistance from you at any time you would be justified in refusing assistance until they promised you that they would get married. It is somewhat regrettable that certain Indians behave in this way and the Department is dependent almost wholly upon the recommendation of the Agent as to what steps should be taken in an attempt to remedy such conditions.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI beg to submit herewith a requisition for manual training tools and supplies for the Tahltan Seasonal Indian School.\n\nThe teacher, Mr. W.P. Thorman, has agreed to teach the boys manual training in an old Mission building which he uses for a work shop.\n\nMany of the Indians in this area are naturally skillful with wood-working tools and I believe quite satisfying results will be obtained from the boys if they are instructed in the proper use of tools.\n\nThe local stores do not carry a complete stock of tools so it would be appreciated if tenders could be obtained in Vancouver. Pine lumber can be procured locally but it is not very good quality material. It was not possible to obtain a tender from the mill operator as he is out of town just at present.\n\nR.H.S. Sampson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nend.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith application of Mr. Indian Agent Sampson, of Stikine Agency, to purchase manual training tools for the Tahltan Seasonal Ind. School, the cost of which will amount to $29.15, f.o.b. Vancouver, according to a quotation from Gordon & Belyea Ltd., who appear to be the only firm in Vancouver who can supply these articles without very high priorities.\n\nIt will also be noted that Mr. Sampson wishes to purchase lumber for manual training work at a cost of $7.50.\n\nI would recommend that this application be approved. It would be appreciated if you will kindly advise me in this connection by airmail, due to the uncertainty of the firm quoting on tools being able to maintain their stock.\n\nfor D. M. MacKay.\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\nOttawa,\nMay 20, 1943.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 18th instant, you may purchase manual training tools for the Tahltan Seasonal School at a cost of $29.15, f.o.b. Vancouver. You may also authorize an expenditure of $7.50 for lumber for manual training purposes. It would be appreciated if you would request the Indian Agent to have Mr. Thorman prepare a statement at the end of the current season regarding the work done in manual training. It should be forwarded for our consideration. When the school closes the Principal should take charge of the tools and any lumber left on hand in order that it may be available for 1944.\n\nR.A.

D. McLean\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. S. Simpson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nTelegraph Creek B.C.\nJuly 31st 1912\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your correspondence of June 27th, ref. #311385, #411419, in reply to request of Liard Post Indians and Fort Graham Nomads that schools be established at Liard Post and Mc'Dames Creek, and will notify them at my earliest opportunity, as to the decision of the Department.\n\nI am sir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nAgent for Stikine division.\nOttawa, May 4, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th ultimo, regarding the establishment of a summer school for the benefit of the Indian children at Fort Grahame and enclosing the applications which you received for the position as teacher.\n\nIn reply I have to say the Department will approve of this school being conducted for a three month period during the coming summer, from, approximately, June 15th to September 15th, next.\n\nApproval is also granted for the appointment of Mr. Gerard Beauregard, B.A., of St. Joseph's Seminary, Edmonton, as teacher. He was nominated by the Roman Catholic Church authorities. The salary allowed him during the period the school is in operation will be at the rate of $90 per teaching month.\n\nA requisition has been forwarded to the Government Stationary Office to forward, addressed to you, the supply of classroom material considered necessary. You should arrange to have this forwarded to Fort Grahame, in due time.\n\nWith reference to the request that the Department make an advance of $25 towards the cost of supplies while the teacher makes the journey in to the school and a like amount on his return, I have to say that the amount provided for salary is all we can allow. Present regulations do not permit making advances or payment of any part of the cost of transportation of teachers to and from a school.\n\nPlease advise the church authorities and Mr. Beauregard of his appointment and arrange that he arrive at Fort Grahame in time to commence duties on the date above mentioned. The teacher should prepare and forward a return, showing attendance, days taught, etc., at the end of each month, when cheque in payment of salary due will be sent. It is hoped that this school will meet with success during this summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof,\nB. C.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,-\n\nFunds are provided in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year to complete a building for summer day school purposes at Fort Grahame, (Finley Forks Reserve, No. 1 - Federal District of Cariboo) Stuart Lake Agency, B. C.\n\nIt is proposed to conduct a school during the coming summer months - June 15th to September 15th. There are 47 children of school age at this point. A few have attended the Lejac Indian Residential School, but the majority have never attended school.\n\nThese Indians are all Catholic. The Roman Catholic Church authorities have nominated the services of Gerard Beauregard, B.A., of St. Joseph's Seminary, Edmonton, for the position as teacher. Mr. Beauregard possesses a B. A. certificate and two years' teaching experience.\n\nI would request your approval for the establishment of this school and the appointment of Mr. Beauregard. The salary allowed will be at the rate of $90.00 per teaching month.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nSir:\u2014\n\nI would respectfully refer you to official letter dated February 20th last, File No.163-12-5, relative to the proposed summer school at Fort McLeod. Also your letter on the same subject in connection with Fort Grahame, File No. 163-13-5.\n\nIn the above connection I wish to attach hereto copies of three applications I have received for the position of teacher at these points. You will note that those two received from St. Joseph's Seminary were nominated by the Church authorities, and the other application is from Mrs. Usterstrom, wife of the Manager of the Hudson's Bay Company's post at Fort McLeod. I might say that the reason this application was received was on account of me discussing the question with her last Summer while at Fort McLeod, as I found out while there that she had been a School teacher before she was married. At that time I asked her if she would consider putting in an application for the position should one be available this year, and she said that she would consider the matter and let me know definitely this year, hence the application. That of course was prior to the time that it was thought that it might be advisable to allow the Church authorities to nominate the teachers.\n\nYou will please note that the salary expected by these applicants is not mentioned and I would therefore suggest that you allow them the same salary as the Department usually pays to a first year teacher under the same conditions. If it is decided to appoint the two male teachers, I feel that the Church authorities will make arrangements for their transportation up there, but would like to recommend that a grant of $25-00 be made to each one to cover the cost of supplies while making the journey in, and a like amount for the same purpose on their returning to the line of Railway at Prince George. I mean by that, that the supplies would not be bought for them until they are ready to leave Prince George en route North.\n\nBoth these schools should be ready to open by June 15th, and the teachers will be on the ground four or five days before that. That would allow them to run until August 15th, to make up the three months. I trust this will be satisfactory to the Department.\n\nIt seems hard for me to get a list of just what articles of school equipment is required for each of these schools, and I feel as if it would be better to leave the matter in the hands of the Department entirely, with the request that you please send me here a shipment of supplies necessary for the Fort Grahame School with approximately 50 pupils, and for the School at Fort McLeod with approximately 30 or 35 pupils. These two shipments should be entirely separate and clearly marked. In making them up please understand that practically all the pupils in each place will be beginners and consequently will not require any advanced books etc. I would suggest that slates and pencils be sent if possible, as well as scribblers etc. Pens and ink will not be required for this year at least. If you could attend to this part of it for me at Ottawa, I would appreciate a list of what you do send.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H.Moore,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSt. Joseph's Seminary,\n9948 110 Street\nEdmonton, Alberta, Canada.\nMarch 16th, 1935.\n\nMr. R.H. Moore, Indian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to apply for the position of School Teacher at Fort Grahame, B.C., for this summer. Here are my qualifications, which I submit to you:\n\n1- I hold a B.A. certificate from Ottawa University.\n\n2- Two years teaching in this Seminary.\n\n3- I have given some private tuition in English besides.\n\nHoping these will prove to be satisfactory, I am\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned:- Gerard Beauregard, B.A.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, in further reference to the proposed establishment of Summer Schools at Fort Graham and Fort McLeod. The information contained in your letter has been carefully noted and will be further considered when the Estimates for the academic year 1935-36 are being prepared. You might write the Department early next year, in order to ascertain if we were able to provide the funds that would be required to conduct summer schools at these points next year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof,\nB. C.\nSir:-\n\nIn acknowledging receipt of your letter of the 13th inst., file No. 163-12-1, regarding the establishing of proposed day schools at fort Grahame and fort MacLeod, I beg to say that in my report of the 30th ultimo I stated the number of pupils available at each of the above points, viz., 47 at fort Grahame and 25 at fort MacLeod.\n\nRegarding the approximate expenditure necessary for the completion of a suitable building at fort MacLeod for a school, I think that $200.00 would be the maximum required and should cover the cost of the floor, shingles and lumber for the roof, windows and doors, and might allow something for stove, stovepipe and roof jack. If the Department would send in suitable desks of course it would be much better, otherwise we will have to buy material and have some of the old fashioned kind made, with seats attached and the full width of the building, which will cost another $75.00.\n\nRegarding fort Grahame, I feel that we might be well advised to buy a few windows for the church building there, improve the roof a little and put some repairs on the floor, as it would be much cheaper than completing the building the Indians are going to put up, and will answer the purpose efficiently well for three or four years at least until we can see with what degree of success our efforts in this connection are met, by the Indians. Consequently, I would say that I could get along with $100.00 for fort Grahame.

There are so many demands on our Appropriation, that it is not possible to consider establishing schools at these points this year.\n\nIt is noted that the Indians are prepared to get out logs and put up a building, both at Fort Grahame and McLeod, provided the Department assists in supplying some of the material required. You might let me know exactly what expenditure would be required in this regard at each place. You should also state the number of children of school age on each of these reserves. When your reply is received, the Department will have complete information available and the question of establishing schools will receive careful consideration when we are preparing our Estimates for the fiscal year 1935-36.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

C.\nVanderhoof, B.C.,\nJuly 30th, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith a special report covering my recent visit to the Northern Indians at Fort Grahame and Fort McLeod Reserves, and accompanies by Dr. E.J. Lyon of Prince George.\n\nReferring to Departmental letter 163-12-1 of June 8th last regarding the possibility of establishing summer schools at Fort Grahame (and Fort McLeod), I wish to report that at the former place there are 47 children of school age, none of whom have ever attended any school. No building is available, except the Church, and it is not very suitable owing to the fact that it is quite dark. However, when I discussed the matter with the Indians they were quite prepared to put up a suitable log building providing the Department would assist them by supplying shingles for the roof, windows and door. There is no one available at this point who would be able to conduct the School, but the Principal of the Lejac Indian Residential School told me that if the Department would establish a school there he would get qualified teachers and the salary would be very reasonable, he did not say the amount but I am sure that any figure the Department would set would be agreeable.\n\nRegarding the possibility of establishing a summer school as this point, I wish to report that there are 28 children of school age in this reserve, some of whom have attended the Lejac Indian Residential School. Here again there is not a building available for a school but the Indians agreed to get logs out and put up the building if the Department would assist with the roof, windows and door. There is a woman at Fort McLeod who used to be a school teacher before she married the Factor of the H.B.Co's. post at this point, I know that she would take over the job of teaching but plans to go outside this Fall herself with her own family so that they can attend school, and therefore doubtful whether she would be available next year or not. However, the same arrangements can be made there as at Fort Grahame, leave the matter of teacher up to the Church who has agreed to supply one. At all events you can instruct me on this point later.\n\n(sgd) R.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs.

Lyon of Prince George.\n\nWe finished at Fort McLeod shortly after 4 P.M. and left immediately for Stuart Lake arriving about an hour later. Dr. Lyon returning to Prince George the following morning. Unless something unforeseen happens it should not be necessary to pay a visit to these reserves for at least two years. Kindly advise me further regarding the school problem.\n\n(sgd) R.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 8, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo, suggesting the establishment of summer schools at Fort Grahame and Fort McLeod.\n\nIt is noted from the last paragraph of your letter that you expect to visit these points during the coming summer. At that time, you should ascertain if buildings are available for school purposes. You should also make enquiries with a view to finding out if there is anyone in the vicinity of these places who would be able to conduct school. The number of children of school age should also be ascertained. When you return you should forward the above information to the Department for our consideration. If it is found that you can make suitable arrangements, the Department will be inclined to give favourable consideration to the establishment of summer schools.\n\nIn the event of it being impossible to secure teachers locally, you should state what salary would have to be paid a teacher sent in from outside. For your information, I may add that it is usual in the case of summer schools to have them opened from about June first to August thirty-first of each year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\nSir:\u2014\n\nDuring my last visit to Fort Grahame and Fort McLeod during June 1932 I had several requests at meetings held at Fort Grahame and Fort McLeod that the Department establish a day school at Fort Grahame during the summer months instead of taking the children to the Residential School at Lejac as has been and still is the method used. At those meetings I did not make any definite promises although I saw the reasonableness of most of the recommendations brought up by the Indians, however I postponed the matter for the time being by telling them that owing to hard times generally it would not be possible for the Department to assume any further obligations in the matter of educational facilities. As I will be going into that Reserve again in a month I deem it advisable at this time to submit the whole proposition to the Department with a request that I receive a reply to this letter before I leave so that I can convey the contents of it to the Indians when I go North.\n\nAt present we are not getting any of the Fort Grahame children at the School at Lejac on account of the cost of transportation from there to the School, furthermore they are of a different tribe and different traits entirely than the other Indians in the Agency and those who have been in the School have either died or have returned to the Reserve in a sick condition. The same applies to Fort McLeod only of course in a lesser degree as the distance is not quite so great and the children do not pine for their homes to the same extent as their more Northerly friends do, however even at that we do not begin to get a fraction of the number of available children at Fort McLeod and if we ever propose to give them an education I think that something should be done if at all possible.\n\nAt the present time the manager of the Hudson's Bay at Fort McLeod is married to a woman who used to be a school teacher and I understand that she is prepared to take charge of the school for the Indians at Fort McLeod for three months in the summer when they are at the camp along with their parents, the rest of the year they are out on their hunting grounds and trap lines and do not spend any time on the Reserve. Would it be possible for the Department to consider establishing a day school at Fort McLeod for three months in the summer when these children could attend providing I can get this ex teacher to consider taking on the job and that we could get a suitable building on the reserve without any expense to the Department which could be used as a school? As I have not got any day schools in this Agency I am of course entirely at a loss to know just how they are operated but if some arrangements could be arrived at which would not entail the expenditure of too much money, I think that it would be a good thing.\n\nIn closing allow me to say that while I have not got a great deal of hope of getting anything this year or maybe next, still I would like to be advised on the question as fully as possible so that I might convey the definite information to the Indians as I know that they will be asking me if I ever did anything about submitting their former request to the Department. Kindly reply to this letter as soon as possible so that I may have it about the middle of June when I expect to leave for the North.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 20, 1935.\n\nSir,-\n\nWith reference to your N-3-S-1 of the 10th instant, I beg to say that cheques covering the period July 10th to August 10th for the two teachers mentioned in your letter will go forward to you in the near future.\n\nIt will not be possible to issue the cheque in payment of their services for the remaining time they are employed until their employment ceases. You should, therefore, advise me about a week before they close the schools, stating the exact date to which you consider they should be paid. Arrangements will then be made to forward their cheques as soon as regulations will permit.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. H.

Lambert in his place and that he has taken up duties.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that, while the appointment of Mr. Lambert is approved, considerable inconvenience has been caused in view of the fact that the change was made without first notifying the Department. All appointments have to be approved by the Honourable the Minister and the Treasury Board notified of the names of the persons appointed. You can, therefore, understand that when a change is made in the person officially appointed it causes considerable inconvenience and difficulty in having the appointment of the successor approved.\n\nCheques for one month's salary for the teachers of the Fort Grahame and Fort McLeod Indian Summer Schools for the period June 10th to July 10th will be sent in your care at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Lambert in his place and he duly arrived here at the same time as his application. I had no alternative but to send him to Fort Grahame then and there as it was time he was leaving and I could not refer the matter to the Department for approval. However, Mr. Phelan arrived here shortly afterwards and met both Mr. Lambert and Mr. Cormack before they left for their respective destinations.\n\nPlease refer to the last paragraph of your letter which says in part, \"The teachers should prepare and forward a return, showing attendance, days taught, etc., at the end of each month, when cheque in payment of salary due will be sent.\" This arrangement is not practicable owing to the fact that mails do not arrive from or go to Fort Grahame every month, in fact it usually takes about ten weeks. I explained this to Mr. Phelan and he instructed that I should inform the Department and ask that the cheques be mailed to me here each month and then I can send them on, the attendance report will be submitted for the three months at the end of the term.\n\nI would, therefore, request that the salary cheques for these two teachers be sent in my care upon receipt of this letter and I will have them sent in to Fort McLeod and Fort Grahame first chance. The time of commencement was June 10th, so payment for the month will be up to July 10th. Kindly arrange to have these cheques sent as soon as possible.

The Department proposes to conduct a Roman Catholic Indian Summer Day School at Fort Grahame Stuart Lake Agency, B.C., from June 15th to September 15th, there being 47 Indian children of school age at this point who should be receiving education. Funds have been provided in the appropriation for Indian education. It is proposed to pay a salary to the Teacher of $90.00 per month.\n\n2. The Department proposes to conduct a Roman Catholic Indian Summer Day School at Fort McLeod (McLeod Lake Reserve No.5 Federal District of Cariboo) B.C., from June 15th to September 15th, to provide for the education of 26 Indian children at McLeod Lake Reserve. Funds have been provided in the appropriation and it is proposed to pay the Teacher at the rate of $90.00 per month.\n\nThe classification provides for a salary of from $300 to $1320 for the academic year; the amount in each case to be determined by the Department and the Civil Service Commission.\n\nIt is to be noted that the total amount to be paid these Teachers is less than the amount provided for the academic year under classification, but in view of the short school season such departure from provisions of the Civil Service Act may be deemed permissible and equitable.\nIt is recommended that the Department's request for authority to employ be submitted to Treasury Board for favourable consideration up to the 30th September, 1935, preferably within six months in order to avoid duplication of effort in the matter of reporting and certification for the period of fifteen days in addition to the customary period.\n\nWBG/DH\nMay 30, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am enclosing, herewith, copy of a memorandum from the Honourable the Superintendent General to the Treasury Board, requesting the authorization of an additional position of Teacher, Indian School, for an Indian Summer Day School at Fort Graham, Stuart Lake Agency, B.C., and have to request that you will make the necessary report thereon to the Board.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nEnc.\n\nW.

There are forty-seven Indian children of school age at the above mentioned point who should be receiving an education. A few have attended the Lejac Indian Residential School, but the majority have never attended school. Funds have been provided in the appropriation for Indian Education to conduct the above mentioned school and to pay the salary of a Teacher at the rate of $90.00 per month. The undersigned, therefore, begs to request the authorization of a position of Teacher, Indian School.\n\n(Sgd) T. J. Murphy\n\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to submit herewith the attendance report from the Fort Grahame Summer School from June the 11th, to September the 11th, together with monthly reports from the teacher in charge. These reports were submitted by the teacher at the end of each month but were held by me here until the close of the school when they, with the attendance report, could be sent the Department at the same time.\n\nI have just got back from Prince George where I interviewed the teacher when he got out from Fort Grahame and gave him his salary cheque up to August 11th, ultimo. His final cheque for the last month of teaching which finished September 11th, instant should be sent direct to him at the address given below.\n\nE.J. Lambert, Esq.,\n9262 - 110 A. Avenue,\nEdmonton, Alta.\n\nApparently this young man got along quite well and had a very satisfactory attendance up until near the end of August when some of the Indians and their families had to go out hunting for food. He suggests however that next year the school could open earlier, and in view of information received, I am prepared to recommend that the school open the last week in May and close the last week in August. So far as is known now the same teacher will be available.\n\nSome more equipment should be provided next year for the class room and also soft balls and bats, and a football, for recreation hours. Fuller information on this will be given at a later date. I asked the teacher before he left if he would let me have a copy of his daily curriculum at the school and he said he would send it to me, when he does I will send it to the Department for approval.\n\nPlease mail the cheque at your early convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H.

Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI kindly accept the following as the monthly report of Fort Grahame Day School, for the period of June the 11th to July the 11th, 1935. Desks and seats were constructed from material which you kindly sent.\n\nThe number of children attending school is twenty-nine. They are all from Fort Grahame.\n\nThe children with the exception of one boy, have not previously attended school. However, five of them know the alphabet and were able to read from almost nothing, to fifty % of the material in the primer, \"Two Little Indians\".\n\nAt the beginning, all of the children were given the same lessons, and the individuals were permitted to advance to their past knowledge and learning ability. This was followed by the formation of five groups.\n\nThe progress has been very good. Groups, 3, 4, and 5 have mastered the alphabet. Group 5 has completed the primer, \"Two Little Indians\", and the first twenty pages of the reader, \"Corona Readers, Primer 1\".\n\nGroup 4 has covered the first twenty pages of \"Two Little Indians\", and Group 3 has the first twelve pages of \"Two Little Indians\" to its credit. Groups 1 and 2, consisting mostly of six year old children, are still working with the alphabet.\n\nFive children were strapped; since then, the discipline has been perfect.\n\nYour faithful servant,\n\nSigned:- E.J. Lambert.\nFort Grahame, B.C.,\nAugust 11th, 1935.\n\nR.H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nKindly accept this as the second monthly report of the Fort Grahame Day School, for the period of July 11th to August 11th, 1935.\n\nI am again pleased to report favourable progress. Group 5 has the following to its credit:\u2014 the first seventy-five pages of the Corona Reader, Primer I, the first forty-five pages of Friends, spelling tests and contests on the above material and Two Little Indians. In arithmetic, this group and also Group 5, has become quite proficient in addition and subtraction; the writing is fairly good in most cases.\n\nGroup 4 has completed Two Little Indians, the first twenty pages of Friends and ten miscellaneous pages of the Corona Reader. The writing of this group varies from ability to write the letters of the alphabet to rapid writing of about half of the words covered in their reading.\n\nGroup 3 has completed two Little Indians and the first twelve pages of Friends. Addition had been mastered by all and two of them are able to subtract. In writing, the progress varies from ability to write the greater part of the letters of the alphabet to the writing of the word-list in Two Little Indians.\n\nOf Groups 2 and 1, two children have completed the alphabet and can read the first nine pages of Two Little Indians. The remainder of these groups have learned an average of half of the alphabet.\n\nDuring the month, the number of strappings was three, and the behaviour has greatly improved.\n\nI am sorry to report a large decrease in attendance, which is due to the annual mid-summer game shortage in the vicinity of Fort Grahame. This occurs every year, and it forces the Indians, and their families, to leave the settlement for the bush, where game is more plentiful.\n\nTherefore, I strongly recommend that, henceforth, the Fort Grahame Day School be opened on the first day of May. By adopting this policy, the greater part of the Indians children, of this district, would be able to get the full advantage of three months of school, per year, instead of one, or two months, as it is the case for many this year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned:\u2014 E.J.

This is due to the fact that this immediate region does not contain sufficient game to last the bulk of the Indians much past the first of August. This does not harmonize with the present school term. But it would, if the school term were advanced so that actual teaching could commence by the third week in May.\n\nDuring this last part of the term the school work has continued its fine progress.\n\nGroup five has completed the first ninety pages of \"Friends\", the first fifty-five pages of the \"Corona Reader\", and has had considerable review work and drills in spelling and arithmetic.\n\nGroup four has seen changes, effected by allowing some members to proceed with group five; the remainder has covered some forty-two pages of \"Friends\", and twenty pages of the \"Corona Reader\".\n\nGroup three likewise has been split, so that some of its members are with the remainder of group four in progress (which see).\n\nOf the two lower groups, two and one, three children have now completed the alphabet, and are being introduced to arithmetic as well as their studies in \"Two Little Indians\", advanced to a dozen pages, (at time of leaving).\n\nI have had an examination of the children's school progress by Mr. L.T. Kemppyle, Justice of Peace. If you would be interested in having this, I will gladly have a statement under oath by Mr. Kemppyle, J.P., sent to you, at my expense.\n\nWith the hope that the good progress which you initiated this summer may continue,\n\nI remain,\n\nYour faithful servant,\n\nSigned: E.J.

He stresses cleanliness all the time and even makes some of them leave the class room to wash, should they come to school in a dirty condition. His discipline is also excellent and he has the children interested in games, principally softball, which they play during recess and in the evenings almost continually. The result of the school is also very evident in the fact that the health of the children here is much better than I have ever found it before and I put this down to the result of more regular habits and hours, as well as them being much cleaner. As it rained all day the flying weather was Nil. we had to stay at Fort Grahame all night, but finally got away from there the next morning and went another 90 miles North to the settlement of nomade Indians at Whitewater where they are living.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H.

It would appear as if this boy might be alright although he has not had any actual experience in teaching. After reviewing his letters of recommendation and qualification, I would esteem it a favour if you would please advise me if I may engage him as from May the 20th next.\n\nAs mentioned in my last letter, Mr. Cormack who taught last year at Fort McLeod, is available again this year and I presume that I am safe in engaging him again this season? At all events I am not doing anything definitely until I hear from the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nEnclosures.\nSmithers, B.C.,\nMarch 13th., 1936.\n\nMr. R.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRev. Father Ouellet has just informed me that you need further information about me before sending in my application to the Indian Department.\n\nI am twenty years of age. I have finished my High School education which at Smithers goes as far as the Fourth year inclusive. I am enclosing a letter of reference from the Principal of the High School.\n\nI am planning to continue my studies at the University of British Columbia and it is with this in mind that I am anxious to obtain the position of teacher at Fort Grahame. Without the financial aid that this position will give me, I would be unable to continue my studies.\n\nWhile I have not made a Normal School Course, I feel that I would be able under your direction, to give satisfaction both to yourself and the Dept. My plan is to continue teaching each summer until I finish my University studies. My parents have lived in Smithers since 1913 and are well known in the District.\n\nI enclose a letter of reference from the Parish Priest of Smithers.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSigned: P.J. Downey.\nTo whom it may concern:\n\nThis is to certify that Mr. Patrick Downey completed his Junior Matriculation at Smithers High School, June 1935.\n\nPat was a good student interested in his work and regular and punctual in his attendance.\n\nIn addition to his school activities he takes an active interest in sport. He has considerable dramatic talent and takes an active interest in the social life of the community.\n\nIn work as an elementary teacher I think he would be particularly successful. For the work he will be called upon to do for the Indian Department I have no hesitation in recommending him.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSigned:- Vernon Crockett,\nPrincipal.\nSmithers High School.\nSmithers, B.C.,\n\nMarch 13th, 1936.\n\nMr. R.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have no hesitation in recommending Mr. J.P. Downey to the position of teacher at the summer school at Fort Grahame.\n\nMr. Downey is a member of parish and I have had an opportunity of knowing him. You will find him industrious and conscientious and you will find also that he will put all his heart in the work. He has shown a certain aptitude in dealing with boys specially in connection with sports of various kinds and he is fond of working with them and helping them.\n\nThe fact that he is anxious to earn money during several years in order to be able to complete his studies will make him all the more anxious to succeed.\n\nPersonally I shall be very pleased if the Department see fit to give him this opportunity of going ahead.\n\nVery sincerely,\n\nSigned: W. Byrne Grant, O.M.I.\nCOPY.\n\nSmithers, B.C.,\nMarch 13th, 1936.\n\nMr. R.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn answer to your esteemed of late March 11th., I would say that I know the boy who has made his application for the Fort Grahame Summer School and I have no hesitation to say that he is fully equipped for the position that he applies for.\n\nWith Best Wishes,\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned:- L.Ouellet, O.M.I.,\nMissionary at Fort McLeod and Fort Grahame.\nFort Grahame, B.C.\nJuly 15th, 1936.\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe following is a report on the progress of the different groups:\n\nGROUP 1. These pupils are still on the alphabet and numbers. They are learning these quite good and are just about through with them. They are also learning the phonetic tables given in the back of the Catholic Corona readers.\n\nGROUP 2. These pupils are still reading the readers, \"Two Little Indians\". They are almost through with this but will have to go over it for the second time next month. In arithmetic they are being taught addition and are at present taking addition of single digit numbers. They have completed the phonetic tables and have a good knowledge of them.\n\nGROUP 3. This class has completed the reader, \"Two Little Indians\" and have started the Catholic Corona reader and \"Friends\". They are working the workbook in connection with \"Two Little Indians\". They are working book A of the individual arithmetics.\n\nGROUP 4. This group is advancing quite rapidly. They have completed, \"Friends\" for the first time and we are reviewing it at present. They have started the workbook in connection with \"Friends\" and are progressing but slowly as this book is quite difficult. They have completed books A & B of the Individual Arithmetics and are ready to begin with book C. These pupils are also quite good writers. We are using the spellers in connection with Group 3 and 4 and we have gone as far as the sixth week.\n\nAll of the pupils have shown signs of being cleaner and there has been quite a few washings in the last month. The school is swept every day, scrubbed once a week and the children are quite anxious to do this.\n\nHoping this meets with your approval, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned: - P.J. Downey.\nR.H. Moore\nIndian Agent.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI am enclosing with the report form this letter in coalition with the report as the space provided for remarks isn't large enough.\n\nI have segregated the pupils into four groups in accordance with their reading. I have gone by the reading in their grouping because I find that they are very poor in arithmetic and numbers as they never had either to any great extent last year. The arithmetic books sent up this year are very useful in teaching the fundamentals of that subject and they have taken a firm interest in them and are progressing rapidly.\n\n**GROUP 1.**\n\nThese pupils are the younger and smaller ones and have been spending most of the time on the alphabet and figures up to ten. They are learning to count and read the alphabet but are progressing at a slow rate as it is extremely difficult to hold their undivided attention for any length of time.\n\n**GROUP 2.**\n\nThis group has completely mastered all the letters in the alphabet and all the numbers to 15. They are being drilled upon sounds of letters and formation of simple words. They are also being taught the formation of letters as a course preceding writing and use of the readers. They might start writing at any time but we have not desks for them to place their exercise books on so they will be taught reading when they are ready for that stage. A few of them are writing.\n\n**GROUP 3.**\n\nThis group is well advanced into the readers. They are reviewing \"Two Little Indians\" at present. Along with them a few of the more advanced in group 2 are taking the reader but for the first time only. This group is quite good in colouring and in the other work set out in the work book, to accompany \"Two Little Indians\". In arithmetic they are taking addition of numbers and are using the assigned arithmetic work books. They have also mastered the spellers up to grade 3 work.\n\n**GROUP 4.**\n\nThis group is showing rapid progress in arithmetic and are through with the first stage of addition and are starting subtraction. They have completed the readers, \"Two Little Indians\" and are half way through \"Friends\". Their writing in most cases is very good. Much stress is being laid upon the formation of sentences and the sounds of various words which they have some difficulty in pronouncing correctly. They are familiar with the spellers up to Grade 4, but now their progress in this will be slower as the words become more difficult.\n\nThese Indians here are quite ignorant of any form of discipline in or out of school but are not really bad at any time but just mischievous. I have them now so they march out of school and are quite orderly around their desks.\n\nThey are very dirty but I have them wash themselves if they come to school dirty. They wash right in front of the school under my supervision. No strappings have been administered as yet. The school is swept.\nswept out every day and is thoroughly scrubbed every week.\n\nIf there are any further instructions please advise.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned:- P.J. Downey.\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nVanderhoof, B.C., July 20th., 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to attach hereto the reports of Mr. P.J. Downey, teacher of the Fort Grahame Day School for the months ending June 15th, and July 15th., 1936 and also the report of G.N. Cormack, teacher of the McLeod Day School for the month ending June the 15th. 1936.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H.

H. Macdonald\nIndian Agent\nWaskesiu O.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe following is a detailed report of the progress of the Fort Graham O.C. School for the month ending August 15th.\n\nGroup 1:\n\nThese pupils are reviewing the alphabet and numbers up to thirty and are being given writing exercises which they do on the blackboard. As yet they have not been given books or pencils. They are also being taught the first part of the phonetic table and much stress has been put upon the correct pronunciation of words which they use in everyday life. This last being done to call the groups from one to four.\n\nGroup 2:\n\nThey have completed the number...\nup to one hundred and all of them can count this far, and several much farther. They are still reading \"Two Little Indians\" for the second time and are being drilled on the spelling exercises given in the back of this reader. They are just beginning to work the word book in connection with \"Two Little Indians\" and are able to distinguish colours quite well. In arithmetic other than counting they are learning to add the numbers up to ten and to subtract them.\n\nGroup 3.\n\nIn arithmetic they are advancing very well; they have completed books A and B of the Individual Arithmetics and have a good knowledge of them. They are going over \"Two Little Indians\" for the third time and have almost completed the work book in connection with it. They are also taking the Arithmetic\nup to one hundred and all of them can count this far and several much farther. They are still reading \"Two Little Indians\" for the second time and are being drilled on the spelling exercises given in the book of this reader. They are just beginning to work the word book in connection with \"Two Little Indians\" and are able to distinguish colours quite well. In arithmetic other than counting they are learning to add the numbers up to ten and to subtract them.\n\nGroup 3.\n\nIn arithmetic they are advancing very well; they have completed books A and B of the Individual Arithmetics and have a good knowledge of these. They are going over \"Two Little Indians\" for the third time and have almost completed the work book in connection with it. They are also taking the Catholic Grade Reader. They are spell advanced in spelling having completed\nin the spellers to the end of the 10th week.\n\nJanuary 4.\n\nThese pupils' work in arithmetic has been advancing quite slowly as Book C of the Individual arithmetics is quite hard. They are about two thirds of the way through it and as far as they have gone have a thorough knowledge of it. They are reviewing the reader \"Friends,\" again as there are no other readers to give them. Their work in the work book in connection with \"Friends\" is advancing slowly as they find this book extremely difficult. In the spellers they have completed to the end of the 80th week and can spell the words very well.\n\nGeneral\n\nThroughout the term they have been given physical exercises whenever the weather permitted them to take them outside as the school is too small for any indoor exercises. They have taken\na great liking for the game of softball and we played almost every evening. Having them work at softball has certainly had its effect and for the last month they have all come to school clean and tidy. There have only been two pupils made to work Saturdays since July 30th.\n\nThe main thing that has been taught them is discipline. This is very difficult as their parents have no control over them but they are improving gradually.\n\nAll of the school supplies have been crated up and left in the school house nothing will touch them and the Quiter's supplies have been left in the warehouse of the Hudson's Bay Co.\n\nPlease address any future correspondence to me at Smithers B.C.\n\nYours Truly\n\nP.J. Clancy\nVanderhoof, B.C., April 5th, 1937.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to advise that His Excellency, Bishop E.

Cormack for Fort McLeod.\n3. Mr. John McKenzie for Fort Grahame.\n\nThe two former boys taught last year, except that Mr. Downey taught at Fort Grahame but this year I thought of moving him to Takla Lake and having his place at Fort Grahame taken by Mr. McKenzie. I have not yet received a formal application from Mr. McKenzie but as soon as it comes I will send it on to the Department.\n\nPlease advise at your convenience if it will be in order to engage these three young men for the positions above mentioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H.

G. Cormack has applied to return to McLeod, his application has been accepted by the ecclesiastical authority of the diocese.\n\n2. Paul Edward Delcourt Parent, son of the Station Agent at New Hazelton has applied for the position of School Teacher at Tackla. Delcourt Parent is 25 years of age; he has completed his 4th year High School in B.C. and has spent most of his time since his early youth in Northern B.C.; His application is strongly endorsed by the ecclesiastical authority of the diocese.\n\n3. Dick (Richard) MacDonald from Smithers, has applied for the position of School Teacher at Fort Grahame. Dick MacDonald is 24 years of age; he has gone thru. the 9th Grade; he is used to the life in the bush during the summer months; we have also endorsed his application.\n\nThe respective addresses of the last two applicants are:\n\nPaul Edward Parent,\nNew Hazelton, B.C.\n\nand\n\nDick MacDonald,\nSmithers, B.C.\n\nKindly see that your Department advise them as soon as possible that their application had been accepted so that they may take the proper disposition for the coming summer.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd.) J. L. Coudert, O.M.I.,\nCoadj. Bishop of the Yukon and Prince Rupert,\nOttawa,\nMarch 31, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith regard to that portion of your letter of the 15th instant which refers to the Fort Grahame Seasonal School the Department does not consider that Mr. Richard MacDonald is sufficiently qualified to take charge of this school.\n\nI understand that the majority of the Indians do not return to Fort Grahame until early in June and there is therefore not much necessity for a teacher proceeding to Fort Grahame before that time. If it is possible to secure the services of Mr. John McKenzie who taught at the school last year the Department will approve of your taking such action. If, however, the Church authorities do not wish to approve Mr. McKenzie's re-appointment you should again consult Right Reverend J. L. Coudert, O.M.I., with a view to having him nominate someone other than Mr. MacDonald or Mr. McKenzie for this school.\n\nIn the event of the Church authorities sanctioning the appointment of Mr. McKenzie he will be allowed salary at the rate of $90.00 a teaching month and you should advise me the exact date on which he begins duties.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B. C.\nVanderhoof, B.C., March 18, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith for your consideration and approval a copy of a letter received from His Honour Bishop Coudert, O.M.I., in connection with teachers for Takla Lake, Fort McLeod and Fort Grahame summer schools.\n\nRegarding Richard MacDonald from Smithers I would respectfully point out that this boy has not advanced past the 9th Grade and I would respectfully request information advising me regarding his application. Mr. McKenzie who taught at Fort Grahame last year is at present attending Normal School in Vancouver prior to getting his teachers' certificate but it will not be possible for him to reach Fort Grahame before the 12th of June next. This date is about two weeks later than usual although in so far as Fort Grahame is concerned the Indians do not return to their camp very much sooner than the second week in June so that in reality the teacher coming in on or about the 15th of May would really have two or three weeks when not much work could be accomplished. Mr. McKenzie has also applied tome for the school, explaining the situation and advising that by teaching on the Saturdays that he would still be able to get three month's teaching in before the Indians would want to leave for their hunting grounds again about the end of August.\n\nPlease understand that Fort Grahame is approximately 350 miles by air from here and it means a great deal of inconvenience and extra expense to the Department in having a new teacher go into that outlying point each year because he neither knows the pupils nor the parents as well as being handicapped in opening the school himself without assistance on the ground. However, the principal drawback to McDonald's application, as I see it, is his own educational standing. Please advise fully regarding these various points.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nVanderhoof, B.C., June 30th, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith a general report of affairs in this agency during the month of June 1938.\n\nFORT GRAHAME BAND.\n\nThe school was closed when I got there as it was after 3 o'clock, but I examined the register, books and other equipment. I also saw the children outside and spoke to most of them. The attendance this year is not so good as formerly, but there will be many more next year as there are a lot of young ones who will be old enough to start. The teacher this year seems to be quite good, in fact I would say he is much better qualified than any teachers we have ever had in this agency before.\n\nR. H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nVanderhoof, B.C., June 3rd, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit below a general report covering the affairs of this agency for May 1938.\n\nThe school teachers for the summer schools at Fort McLeod, Fort Grahame and Tackla Landing were sent in to their respective schools during the month. So far I have not visited any of these but hope to do so during this month.\n\nR. H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, file No. 163-13-1 authorising the appointment of W.R. Fitzgerald as school teacher for the Fort Grahame Summer School this year.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your letter I beg to enclose herewith staff questionnaire duly completed by Mr. Fitzgerald. The exact date of commencement will be forwarded later.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nK.H.

Fitzgerald be taken into consideration for the school at Fort Graham rather than Dick McDonald's application. Walter Fitzgerald, seems, indeed, better, qualified for the position in every respect.\"\n\nI might say that Mr. Fitzgerald has been a school teacher in white schools for five or six years and seems to be quite well qualified.

Since there were no beginners this year, the fourth grade has remained the highest.\n\nThe use of text books has been reduced to a minimum. Much time has been spent on vocabulary building in preparation for the use of texts. Two fifteen-minute periods each day have been devoted to language lessons for the class as a whole. In this way sentence structure and pronunciation have been improved. Lip and tongue formation and coordination have been stressed for the purpose of securing an improved articulation. I am convinced that we could absolutely necessary as a preparation for reading.\n\nPhonetics has been taught in all the grades.\n\nAn attempt has been made to make the arithmetic lessons as practical as possible by applying them to the calculation of the value of fur catches, counting change etc.\n\nAttention and discipline have been given special attention and religious instruction has been given daily. The Lord's Prayer and the Angelic Salutation have been learned by all.\n\nThe school supplies have been listed and packed. The donation for 1939 will be forwarded under separate cover.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWalter Fitzgerald\n\nIndian Affairs.

He was nominated by the Roman Catholic Church authorities. The salary allowed him during the period the school is in operation will be at the rate of $90 per teaching month.\n\nA requisition has been forwarded to the Government Stationery Office to forward, addressed to you, the supply of classroom material considered necessary. You should arrange to have this forwarded to Fort Grahame, in due time.\n\nWith reference to the request that the Department make an advance of $25 towards the cost of supplies while the teacher makes the journey in to the school and a like amount on his return, I have to say that the amount provided for salary is all we can allow. Present regulations do not permit making advances or payment of any part of the cost of transportation of teachers to and from a school.\n\nPlease advise the church authorities and Mr. Beauregard of his appointment and arrange that he arrive at Fort Grahame in time to commence duties on the date above mentioned. The teacher should prepare and forward a return, showing attendance, days taught, etc., at the end of each month, when cheque in payment of salary due will be sent. It is hoped that this school will meet with success during this summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof,\nB.

H. Moore, Esq., Indian Agent, Vanderhoof,\nB. C., re Fort Grahame and Fort McLeod Schools.\n\nOriginal on File 163.-12-1.\n\nIt seems hard for me to get a list of just what articles of school equipment is required for each of these schools, and I feel as if it would be better to leave the matter in the hands of the Department entirely, with the request that you please send me here a shipment of supplies necessary for the Fort Grahame School with approximately 50 pupils, and for the School at Fort McLeod with approximately 30 or 35 pupils. These two shipments should be entirely separate and clearly marked. In making them up, please understand that practically all the pupils in each place will be beginners and consequently will not require any advanced books, etc. I would suggest that slates and pencils be sent if possible, as well as scribblers, etc. Pens and ink will not be required for this year at least. If you could attend to this part of it for me at Ottawa, I would appreciate a list of what you do send.\n**Requisition for School Material**\n\n**Date:** April 18th, 1935.\n\n**For:** FORT GRAHAME DAY\n\n**School:**\n\n**Agency:**\n\n**NOTE:** Teachers should secure from the Department of Education, of the Province in which the Indian School is located, a list of the text books authorized for use in the white schools.

(RG 10, Volume 6415, file 852-5, part 1)\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM R. H. Moore, INDIAN AGENT, Vanderhoof, B. C., dated May 28th, 1935.\n\nDuring my last visit to Fort Grahame and Fort McLeod during June, 1932, I had several requests at meetings held at Fort Grahame and Fort McLeod that the Department establish a day school at Fort Grahame during the summer months instead of taking the children to the residential school at Lejac, as has been and still is the method used. At those meetings, I did not make any definite promises, although I saw the reasonableness of most of the recommendations brought up by the Indians. However, I postponed the matter for the time being by telling them that, owing to hard times generally, it would not be possible for the Department to assume any further obligations in the matter of educational facilities. As I will be going into that reserve again in a month, I deem it advisable at this time to submit the whole proposition to the Department with a request that I receive a reply to this letter before I leave so that I can convey the contents of it to the Indians when I go north.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM R. H. Moore, Indian Agent, Vanderhoof, B. C., dated August 18, 1934.\n\nRegarding Fort Grahame, I feel that we might be well advised to buy a few windows for the church building there, improve the roof a little and put some repairs on the floor, as it would be much cheaper than completing the building the Indians are going to put up, and will answer the purpose sufficiently well for three or four years at least until we can see with what degree of success our efforts in this connection are met by the Indians. Consequently, I would say that I could get along with $100.00 for Fort Grahame. If the desks have got to be made you can figure on an equal amount to Fort MacLeod.\nReferring to departmental letter 163-12-1 of June 8th, last, regarding the possibility of establishing summer schools at Fort Grahame and Fort McLeod, I wish to report that at the former place there are 47 children of school age, none of whom have ever attended any school. No building is available, except the church, and it is not very suitable, owing to the fact that it is quite dark. However, when I discussed the matter with the Indians, they were quite prepared to put up a suitable log building providing the Department would assist them by supplying shingles for the roof, windows and door. There is no one available at this point who would be able to conduct the school, but the Principal of the Lejac Indian Residential School told me that if the Department would establish a school there, he would get qualified teachers and the salary would be very reasonable. He did not say the amount but I am sure that any figure the Department would set would be agreeable.\nFebruary 13, 1935.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nFort Grahame: - To complete building for summer day school purposes - $100.00\n\nFort Grahame is located in the northern part of the Stuart Lake agency. Agent Moore reports there are 47 children of school age at this point, the majority of whom have never attended school. A request has been made by the Roman Catholic missionary and the Agent, that a summer school be conducted. There is a church building at this point, which, the Agent states, could be improved at much lower cost than erecting a new building. He estimates that, for the sum of $100, building material could be supplied to fit up the church building - which would provide suitable accommodation for school purposes for a number of years.\n\nI would suggest that, when funds are available, the Agent be authorized to purchase building material, at a cost not exceeding the above amount, forwarding detailed accounts, in triplicate. It is understood that the labour will be performed by the Indians, without cost to the Department.\nOttawa, February 20, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th instant, regarding the proposed establishment of a summer school at Fort Graham, I have to inform you that the sum of $100 is provided in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the coming fiscal year, to complete a building for school purposes. In your letter dated August 18th, last, you stated that it would be advisable to buy a few windows for the church building, carry out certain improvements to the roof and also some repairs to the floor. You indicated that this arrangement would be much cheaper than erecting a log building and would answer the purpose sufficiently well for three or four years, until it is ascertained what degree of success will result in the operation of the school. It is noted, also, that it would cost approximately $75 to make the desks required.\n\nThe Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase of the building materials required to fit up the church building, to an amount not to exceed $100. Purchase should be made from firms on the approved list. Further, you are authorized to incur an expenditure not exceeding $75.00 in the purchase of the material required in building the desks. Please obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, stating in detail the materials purchased. These accounts, you should attach proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. It should be understood, however, that, as our appropriation will not be available until the first of April, next, payment of accounts cannot be made before that date. I would request that you take any action in having the improvements carried out to the church building.\n\nIf the building is in readiness to start classroom work early next summer, you should take up with the church authorities the question of nominating a suitable teacher. The name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated should be forwarded for the approval of the Department.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear from you, in due time, regarding the progress being made in completing the buildings for classroom purposes at both Fort Graham and Fort McLeod. If possible, you should supervise the work at both points and see that no waste is made of the materials supplied. When informing the Department of the teacher nominated, you should forward a requisition, setting forth the classroom supplies, such as blackboard, text books, scribblers, etc., required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B. C.\nVanderhoof, B.C., October 11th, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to attach hereto the attendance report of the Fort McLeod Summer school, along with a report from the teacher, which I trust you will find satisfactory.\n\nWhile on the subject of schools I wish to say that the total expenditure for school buildings both at Fort McLeod and Fort Grahame this year amounted to approximately $120.00 out of the amount of $450.00 authorized by the Department. The new school at Fort McLeod was not completed last spring in time to hold school in, so that the church was used. However, now it is ready except for the roof, windows and other material which will have to be shipped in and which will cost approximately $185.00 landed at the head of the waterways so that the Indians can get it. I would suggest that we allow the Indians sufficient gasoline to take the material down the river and lakes by boats and which should cost about $30.00 so that the $185.00 for material plus $30.00 for gasoline would be $215.00 and if agreeable to the Department I propose to make this purchase now of the money that is available and have it ready to go in first thing next May. This will make the total expenditure of $335.00 and the balance of $115.00 could be returned to the Treasury. Please advise me in this connection at your convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR. H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nVanderhoof, B.C., July 20, 1937.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith a special report covering my recent visit to the Indians of Fort Grahame and Whitewater,\n\nFORT GRAHAME RESERVE\n\nThis reserve was visited in the afternoon, some sickness of a mild nature was also found here and treatment and medicine given by the doctor. The school was inspected by me and found to be operating quite successfully. Mr. McKenzie the teacher, is doing good work and the children looked quite happy and making progress. The Indians have cut logs for a new school building but at the time of my visit these logs were still in the bush and the Indians said they would haul them out and put them up as soon as they could get a set of harness for their horses. (The only use they put horses to up there is packing consequently they have not got harness for any other work.)\n\nR. H.

C., dated July 30, 1934.\n\nOriginal on 163-12-1.\n\nFort McLeod: Regarding the possibility of establishing a summer school at this point, I wish to report that there are 28 children of school age in this reserve, some of whom have attended the Lejac Indian Residential School. Here again there is not a building available for a school, but the Indians agreed to get logs out and put up the building if the Department would assist with the roof, windows and door. There is a woman at Fort McLeod who used to be a school teacher before she married the Factor of the H. B. Co.'s post at this point. I know that she would take over the job of teaching but plans to go outside this Fall herself with her own family so that they can attend school, it is therefore doubtful whether she would be available next year or not. However, the same arrangements can be made there as at Fort Grahame, leave the matter of teacher up to the Church, who has agreed to supply one. At all events, you can instruct me on this point later.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM R. H. MOORE,\nINDIAN AGENT, VANDERHOOF, B. C., dated\nAugust 18, 1934.\n\nOrig. on 163-12-1\n\nIn acknowledging receipt of your letter\nof the 13th instant, File No. 163-12-1, regarding the\nestablishing of proposed day schools at Fort Grahame\nand Fort MacLeod, I beg to say that in my report of\nthe 30th ultimo I stated the number of pupils available\nat each of the above points, viz. 47 at Fort Grahame\nand 28 at Fort MacLeod.\n\nRegarding the approximate expenditure neces-\nsary for the completion of a suitable building at Fort\nMacLeod for a school, I think that $200.00 would be the\nmaximum required and should cover the cost of the floor,\nshingles and lumber for the roof, windows and doors,\nand might allow something for stove, stovpipe, and roof\njack. If the Department would send in suitable desks\nof course it would be much better; otherwise we will\nhave to buy material and have some of the old fashioned\nkind made, with seats attached and the full width of\nthe building, which will cost another $75.00.\nDear Sir:\n\nI understand that during the coming summer, a school, which will be in session during June, July and August, will be opened, for the Indian children at McLeod's Lake. I hereby make application for the position of teacher of this school.\n\nI am the holder of a First Class B.C. Teacher's Certificate; Strathcona Trust Diploma; and certificates from the Provincial Summer School, in English, Literature, Expression, and Choral Singing. I have six years' experience as a teacher in rural schools in British Columbia. I am privileged to refer you to Mr. G.H. Gower, Dept. of Education, Victoria, who was the Inspector of Schools who visited the schools I taught, during the greater part of the time I was teaching. Mr. Gower is well known in educational circles for the high standard he sets his teachers, both as regards achievement and discipline. I have no hesitation in referring you to him for an estimate of my ability. He would know me only as \"Miss Connellan\".\n\nI realize that this type of school would differ considerably from the ordinary public schools. No doubt the ordinary curriculum subjects would be taught, with particular stress upon oral language? The children at McLeod, as you doubtless know, speak English - but very badly. I would suggest particular stress upon cleanliness, and the common rules of health, as with all beginners, and children unaccustomed to school discipline, considerable time would have to be devoted to handwork.\n\nTo give effective instruction, in addition to ordinary school supplies, at least the following would be required: for hand work - crayons; paints; coloured folding papers; outline pictures to colour; sewing cards; kindergarten scissors; paste - preferably individual jars; and, of course, an adequate supply of drawing paper - which, one pre-supposes, would be included in \"ordinary school supplies\". For instance along the line of cleanliness and health - which instruction would, of necessity, take the form, to a considerable extent, of example, plus daily practice - I consider the following to be highly advisable - (and, for effective instruction, imperative): a minimum of four wash basins; paper towels; an abundance of soap; individual paper drinking cups; a goodly supply of kleenex (paper handkerchiefs) for daily \"handkerchief drill\"; a tooth brush for each pupil, together with several shakers of common salt. While not urgently required, a supply of some antiseptic mouth wash would be used to great advantage, in the inoculation of good habits. In addition to these requisites, I would suggest that gold and coloured \"stars\" and \"dots\" be supplied. These items are invaluable in any school room where the mentality of a small child prevails. With these children, particularly, every means of encouragement should be employed. Of particular value also, would be coloured chalks, counting blocks, and sticks, of varied lengths.\n\nThere is, in addition, a particularly valuable book published, entitled, I think, \"Reading Lessons for Beginners\", by Miss J.M. Fisher. This book is used now in many beginners' classes. It retails at 75\u00a2 a copy, and a copy is required by each child.\n\nI presume that there is a standard salary paid to the teachers of these outlying Indian schools? It is possible that transportation is allowed, from Prince George, or some given point which would vary with the geographical location of the school? This would not be necessary in my case, as my husband is in charge of the Hudson's Bay Company's store at McLeod's Lake, and I should be there, in any event, during the summer months.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6418, file 853-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nI might add that I have spent two winters there, so that I already know the residents of the village - both parents and children. Should you see fit to appoint me to the position in question, the children would not have to overcome their natural shyness with an utter stranger, at the outset.\n\nAlthough I know Capt. Barrie, Inspector of Indian Schools, I cannot refer you to him as regards school work. He has never had experience of me as a teacher. The fact, however, that Mr. Gower suggested to me that I take the position (frequently held by Capt. Barrie) of teacher of one of the rural classes in the Demonstration School, attached to the Provincial Normal School in Victoria, should convey to you some impression of the standard of my teaching.\n\nShould you see fit to appoint me teacher on this school, I shall conscientiously endeavour to do all in my power for the mental, and physical advancement of the children. To such work I should bring, not only technical experience, but a not inconsiderable knowledge of the Indian mind and character, gained during six years' association with them in Kitwanga, and at McLeod's Lake.\n\nI shall be at the above address until navigation opens on the Crooked River, in May. Thenceforth, letters should be addressed to me at McLeod, Via. Prince George.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSigned:- Sheila Utterstrom.\n\nR.H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\nOttawa, May 4, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th ultimo, regarding the establishment of a summer school for the benefit of the Indian children at Fort McLeod and enclosing the applications which you received for the position as teacher.\n\nIn reply I have to say the Department will approve of this school being conducted for a three month period during the coming summer, from, approximately, June 16th to September 15th, next.\n\nApproval is also granted for the appointment of Mr. George N. Cormack, St. Joseph's Seminary, Edmonton, as teacher. He was nominated by the Roman Catholic Church authorities. The salary allowed him during the period the school is in operation will be at the rate of $90 per teaching month.\n\nA requisition has been forwarded to the Government Stationery Office to forward, addressed to you, the supply of classroom material considered necessary. You should arrange to have this forwarded to Fort McLeod, in due time.\n\nWith reference to the request that the Department make an advance of $25 towards the cost of supplies while the teacher makes the journey in to the school and a like amount on his return, I have to say that the amount provided for salary is all we can allow. Present regulations do not permit making advances or payment of any part of the cost of transportation of teachers to and from a school.\n\nPlease advise the church authorities and Mr. Cormack of his appointment and arrange that he arrive at Fort McLeod in time to commence duties on the date above mentioned. The teacher should prepare and forward a return, showing attendance, days taught, etc., at the end of each month, when cheque in payment of salary due will be sent. It is hoped this school will meet with success.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B. C.\nApril 29, 1935.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nFunds are provided in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year to fit up a building for summer day school purposes at Fort McLeod (McLeod Lake Reserve, No. 5 - Federal District of Cariboo), B.C.\n\nMr. R. H. Moore, Indian Agent, is arranging to have the building ready for classroom purposes, and the school will be conducted for a three months period this coming summer - June 15th to September 15th, next.\n\nThere are 28 Indian children on this reserve, who have never attended any school, and they are all Roman Catholic. The Roman Catholic Church authorities have nominated the services of Mr. George N. Cormack, St. Joseph's Seminary, Edmonton, Alberta. Mr. Cormack has first class general standing in both Junior and Senior Matriculation and is at present enrolled at the above named Seminary, taking Philosophy in conjunction with courses in Arts at the University of Alberta.\n\nI should be pleased to have your approval for the conducting of classroom activities during the coming summer months and also for the appointment of Mr. Cormack as teacher. The salary provided is at the rate of $90.00 per teaching month.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nSir:\n\nI would respectfully refer you to official letter dated February 20th last, File No.163-12-5, relative to the proposed summer school at Fort McLeod. Also your letter on the same subject in connection with Fort Graham, File No. 163-13-5.\n\nIn the above connection I wish to attach hereto copies of three applications I have received for the position of teacher at these points. You will note that those two received from St. Joseph's Seminary were nominated by the Church authorities, and the other application is from Mrs. Vetterstrom, wife of the Manager of the Hudson's Bay Company's post at Fort McLeod. I might say that the reason this application was received was on account of me discussing the question with her last Summer while at Fort McLeod, as I found out while there that she had been a School teacher before she was married. At that time I asked her if she would consider putting in an application for the position should one be available this year, and she said that she would consider the matter and let me know definitely this year, hence the application. That of course was prior to the time that it was thought that it might be advisable to allow the Church authorities to nominate the teachers.\n\nYou will please note that the salary expected by these applicants is not mentioned and I would therefore suggest that you allow them the same salary as the Department usually pays to a first year teacher under the same conditions. If it is decided to appoint the two male teachers, I feel that the Church authorities will make arrangements for their transportation up there, but would like to recommend that a grant of $25-00 be made to each one to cover the cost of supplies while making the journey in, and a like amount for the same purpose on their returning to the line of Railway at Prince George. I mean by that, that the supplies would not be bought for them until they are ready to leave Prince George en route North.\n\nBoth these schools should be ready to open by June 15th, and the teachers will be on the ground four or five days before that. That would allow them to run until August 15th to make up the three months. I trust this will be satisfactory to the Department.\n\nIt seems hard for me to get a list of just what articles of school equipment is required for each of these schools, and I feel as if it would be better to leave the matter in the hands of the Department entirely, with the request that you please send me here a shipment of supplies necessary for the Fort Graham School with approximately 50 pupils, and for the School at Fort McLeod with approximately 30 or 35 pupils. These two shipments should be entered separately and clearly marked. In making them up please understand that practically all the pupils in each place will be beginners, and consequently will not require any advanced books etc. I would suggest that slates and pencils be sent if possible, as well as scribblers etc. Pens and ink will not be required for this year at least. If you could attend to this part of it for me at Ottawa, I would appreciate a list of what you do send.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H.

Here are my qualifications, which I submit to you:\n\n1- I hold a B.A. certificate from Ottawa University.\n\n2- Two years teaching in this Seminary.\n\n3- I have given some private tuition in English besides.\n\nHoping these will prove to be satisfactory, I am\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned: Gerard Beauregard, B.A.\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI understand that during the coming summer, a school will be in session during June, July and August, will be opened, for the Indian children at McLeod's Lake. I hereby make application for the position of teacher of this school.\n\nI am the holder of a First Class B.C. Teacher's Certificate; Strathcona Trust Diploma; and certificates from the Provincial Summer School, in English, Literature, Expression, and Choral Singing. I have six years' experience as a teacher in rural schools, in British Columbia. I am privileged to refer you to Mr. G.H. Gower, Dept. of Education, Victoria, who was the Inspector of Schools who visited the schools I taught, during the greater part of the time I was teaching. Mr. Gower is well known in educational circles for the high standard he sets his teachers, both as regards achievement and discipline. I have no hesitation in referring you to him for an estimate of my ability. He would know me only as \"Miss Connellan\".\n\nI realize that this type of school would differ considerably from the ordinary public schools. No doubt the ordinary curriculum subjects would be taught, with particular stress upon oral language? The children at McLeod, as you doubtless know, speak English - but very badly. I would suggest particular stress upon cleanliness, and the common rules of health, as with all beginners and children unaccustomed to school discipline, considerable time would have to be devoted to handwork.\n\nTo give effective instruction, in addition to ordinary school supplies, at least the following would be required: for hand work: crayons; paints; coloured folding papers; outline pictures to colour; sewing cards; kindergarten scissors; paste - preferably individual jars; and, of course, an adequate supply of drawing paper - which, one pre-supposes, would be included in \"ordinary school supplies\". For instance along the line of cleanliness and health - which instruction would, of necessity, take the form, to a considerable extent, of example plus daily practice, - I consider the following to be highly advisable: (and, for effective instruction, imperative): a minimum of four wash basins; paper towels; an abundance of soap; individual paper drinking cups; a goodly supply of kleenex (paper handkerchiefs) for daily \"handkerchief drill\"; a tooth brush for each child, together with several shakers of common salt. While not urgently required, a supply of some antiseptic mouth wash would be of great advantage, in the inculcation of good habits. In addition to these requisites, I would suggest that gold and coloured \"stars\" and \"dots\" be supplied. These items are invaluable in any school-room where the mentality of a small child prevails. With these children, particularly, every means of encouragement should be employed. Of particular value, also, would be coloured chalks, counting blocks, and sticks, of varied lengths.\n\nThere is, in addition, a particularly valuable book published, entitled, I think, \"Reading Lessons for Beginners\", by Miss J.E.R. Fisher. This book is used now in many 'beginners' classes. It retails at 75\u00a2 a copy, and a copy is required by each child.\n\nI presume that there is a standard salary paid to the teachers of these outlying Indian schools? It is possible that transportation is allowed, from Prince George, or some given point which would vary with the geographical location of the School? This would not be necessary in my case, as my husband is in charge of the Hudson's Bay Company's store at McLeod's Lake, and I should be there, in any event, during the summer months.\n\nI\n## Supplementary List of Temporary Positions Authorized by Treasury Board\n\n| Position                                      | Number | Period Required                  |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|----------------------------------|\n| Teacher, Indian School, Fort McLeod, B.C.     | 1      | 15th June to 15th September, 1935 |\n| Teacher, Indian School, Fort Grahame, B.C.    | 1      | \"                                |\n| Teacher, Indian School, Martin Falls, Ont.    | 1      | To 30th Sept., 1935.              |\n| Teacher, Indian School, Campbell River, B.C.  | 1      | \"                                |\n| Indian Farming Instructor, Portage la Prairie, Man. | 1      | Not exceeding 30th Sept., 1935.   |\n\n**Total:** 5\nCIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION\n\nOttawa, June 1, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed please find a copy of a report approved by the Commission in respect to the temporary employment of two Teachers, Indian School, one at Fort Grahame, Stuart Lake Agency, B.C., and one at Fort McLeod, B.C.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) W.

The Department proposes to conduct a Roman Catholic Indian Summer Day School at Fort Grahame Stuart Lake Agency, B.C., from June 15th to September 15th, there being 47 Indian children of school age at this point who should be receiving education. Funds have been provided in the appropriation for Indian education. It is proposed to pay a salary to the Teacher of $90.00 per month.\n\n2. The Department proposes to conduct a Roman Catholic Indian Summer Day School at Fort McLeod (McLeod Lake Reserve No.5 Federal District of Cariboo) B.C., from June 15th to September 15th, to provide for the education of 28 Indian children at McLeod Lake Reserve. Funds have been provided in the appropriation and it is proposed to pay the Teacher at the rate of $90.00 per month.\n\nThe classification provides for a salary of from $300 to $1320 for the academic year, the amount in each case to be determined by the Department and the Civil Service Commission.\n\nIt is to be noted that the total amount to be paid these Teachers is less than the amount provided for the academic year under classification, but in view of the short school season such departure from provisions of the Civil Service Act may be deemed permissible and equitable.\n\nIt is recommended that the Department's request for authority to employ be submitted to Treasury Board for favourable consideration up to the 30th September, 1935.\n\nWBC/DH\n\nENTERED IN MINUTES.\n\nE.S.\nMay 30, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am enclosing, herewith, copy of a memorandum from the Honourable the Superintendent General to the Treasury Board requesting the authorization of an additional position of Teacher, Indian School, for an Indian Summer Day School at Fort McLeod, B.C., and have to request that you will make the necessary report thereon to the Board.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. Foran, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nCivil Service Commission,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 7, 1935.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nThe Honourable the Treasury Board,\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report that the Department of Indian Affairs proposes to conduct a Roman Catholic Indian Summer Day School at Fort McLeod (McLeod Lake Reserve, No. 5 - Federal District of Cariboo), B.C., in the present fiscal year from June 15th to September 15th. There are twenty-eight Indian children on the McLeod Lake Reserve who should be receiving an education and who have never attended any school. Funds have been provided in the appropriation for Indian Education to conduct the above mentioned school and to pay the salary of a Teacher at the rate of $90.00 per month. The undersigned, therefore, begs to request the authorization of a position of Teacher, Indian School.\n\n(Sgd) T. J. Murphy\n\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nVanderhoof, B.C., October 11th, 1935.\n\nSir:-\n\nI beg to attach hereto the attendance report of the Fort McLeod Summer School, along with a report from the teacher, which I trust you will find satisfactory.\n\nYou will please note that the school closed September 9th, and it took the teacher two days to get out to Prince George so that September the 11th would be the end of the third month. Please arrange to mail the salary cheque to Mr. G.H. Cormack to his present address at 11007 - 99th Avenue, Edmonton, Alberta.\n\nThat would be final payment as from August 11th to September 11th ultimo.\n\nWhile on the subject of Schools I wish to say that the total expenditure for school buildings both at Fort McLeod and Fort Grahame this year amounted to approximately $120-00 out of the amount of $450-00 authorised by the Department. The new school at Fort McLeod was not completed last spring in time to hold school in, so that the church was used. However, now it is ready, except for the roof, windows and other material which will have to be shipped in and which will cost approximately $185-00 landed at the head of the waterways so that the Indians can get it. I would suggest that we allow the Indians sufficient gasoline to take the material down the river and lakes by boats and which should cost about $30-00 so that the $185-00 for material plus $30-00 for gasoline would be $215-00 and if agreeable to the Department I propose to make this purchase now of the money that is available and have it ready to go in first thing next May. This will make the total expenditure of $335-00 and the balance of $115-00 could be returned to the Treasury. Please advise me in this connection at your convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.M. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclosures.\nThe school was opened on June 21st after spending some time on making up forms from the lumber supplied. Due to the lack of a school-building at present, the classes were held in the Church Building except when the priest was staying at Ft. McLeod, during which time the building could be used for no other purposes than as a church. The days on which the school was open are indicated by the register, June 21st-Aug. 21st.\n\nFive Saturdays were taught on to make the requisite number of days, i.e., to and including Sept. 9th.\n\nAt the opening of the school there were about 30 in attendance although there are 19 only registered as of school age. Older boys to about 20 years of age came to school and seemed quite anxious to learn. Later in the summer, the attendance of these older boys declined since, in the fall there is hunting and berrying to be done and they were unable to attend regularly. But the spirit of the whole village seemed to be ambitious in the matter of learning. Many of the boys and girls are self-educated, of course to a very limited extent, but they indicate the general attitude towards education. Thus the school is greatly appreciated by the village as a whole.\n\nDiscipline was quite good and there was very little trouble of this sort with either the children or the parents.\n\nSchool hours were about four hours a day. For the first year, at least, on a new untried project with children unused to anything of this sort, I did not feel that a longer day was necessary, and indeed a longer day for the children would do more harm than good, at least until they are more used to school.\n\nProgress Report.\n\nThere was no definite grading of the pupils although there was a classification into groups according to their advancement. Three boys Robert Harrisson Yalie?, Harry Chingee, Andrew Solanas had been to\nLejac, the first two for 1 year and the latter for 3 years. These of course were much advanced but could not very well be graded much beyond grade one. In some respects especially the latter were much beyond the first grade but in other respects were far behind. Although able to read very well for the length of time they were at school, yet they understood little of what they read. Their vocabularies both in speaking and reading are very limited and are confined to words with which they have daily contact. Then they do not understand anything written in a grammatical style for they understand only what is presented to them in the type of English which they use in speaking to white people. Thus, although advanced in the phonics of reading, they are retarded in its understanding, and in their speaking far below grade one. Likewise although they have been practiced, through necessity, in the art of composition and writing (of letters), their knowledge of grammatical structure is completely nil. In number work the first two advanced this year to subtraction and the latter has been working on multiplication tables. In pencilled art work they are very good for low grade pupils.\n\nWriting.\n\nThe rest of the pupils advanced to a varying degree of knowledge in forming individual letters in chalk but not using pencils yet until they are quite familiar with the formation of all the letters. Only one boy, Achille Chingee writes all the letters and some words using pencil and paper. There are of course, older boys who are learning to write also with pencil and paper.\n\nPhonics.\n\nAll advanced to varying stages in the recognition of individual letters and sounds and simple words (based on the phonics table at the back of the Corona Primer)\nNumber-work.\n\nAll know the formation of the numbers and are in varying stages of counting except Achille Chingee who had advanced quite far into addition.\n\nVocabulary.\n\nAll the children except the very young ones have a knowledge of the simple concrete and action words and further training in this line was very handicapped and almost impossible without further facilities.\n\nReligion.\n\nDue to their simplicity of language and difficulty in understanding the abstract or any type of logical English sequence of language it is almost impossible to give these children any kind of religious instruction by one who does not know their language without it going completely over their heads. This problem is one which would require very careful thought and a very definite plan of action before even attempting anything in this line.\n\nArt.\n\nThe older pupils who can manage pencils easily are very good considering their former complete lack of art training. Further facilities such as art manuals and elementary art courses should be supplied for this part of the course.\n\nRecommendations for further school supplies.\n\n1. Phonic charts and flash cards are almost essential for any progress in phonics.\n2. Number-work flash cards.\n3. Blunt pointed scissors for cut outs in the work-books. These are necessary for fixing a vocabulary in the mind of the child.\n4. Elementary Art manuals and courses for art training.\n\nGeorge A. Connaught\nH. McLeod Indian School Teacher\nOttawa, October 19, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, enclosing a report from Mr. G. N. Cermack, teacher of the Indian Day School conducted at Fort McLeod during the summer months. A cheque for the balance of salary due him to the period the school closed, on September 11th, last, will be sent to his present address in Edmonton.\n\nIt is noted that the building at this point was not completed in time to carry on the school work and that the church was used for the purpose. You may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the materials required to complete the school building. It is noted that the cost, together with supplying the Indians with gasoline to take the material down the river and lakes by boat, will amount to approximately $30.00, and this, in addition to the cost of the material - approximately $185.00 - will cover the balance of the expenditure to complete the building. You should forward itemized accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the materials and for the gasoline.\n\nIt is hoped that the building will be completed and ready for next summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Cormack has applied to return to McLeod, his application has been accepted by the ecclesiastical authority of the diocese.\n\n2.-Paul Edward Delcourt Parent, son of the Station Agent at New Hazelton has applied for the position of School Teacher at Tackla. Delcourt Parent is 25 years of age; he has completed his 4th year High School in B.C. and has spent most of his time since his early youth in Northern B.C.- His application is strongly endorsed by the ecclesiastical authority of the diocese.\n\n3.-Dick (Richard) MacDonald from Smithers, has applied for the position of School Teacher at Fort Grahame. Dick MacDonald is 24 years of age; he has gone thru the 9th Grade; he is used to the life in the bush during the summer months; we have also endorsed his application.\n\nThe respective addresses of the last two applicants are:\nPaul Edward Parent,\nNew Hazelton, B.C.\n\nand:-Dick MacDonald,\nSmithers, B.C.\n\nKindly see that your Department advise them as soon as possible that their application had been accepted so that they may take the proper disposition for the coming summer.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSigned:- J.L.

The Fort Grahame and Fort McLeod Schools commenced about May the 15th. I am not quite sure yet of the exact date, that the teachers were on the ground before that date and it depended on whether or not the Indians got into camp with their children by the 15th. Takla Landing was a little later in starting on account of desks etc having to be made and the building got in readiness.\n\nThe teachers' names are as follows:\n\nGeorge N. Cormack, Teacher, Fort McLeod, B.C.\nJohn McKenzie, Teacher, Fort Grahame, B.C. and\nP.J.

C.\n\nSent:\n8/4/36\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nVanderhoof, B.C., April 1st., 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of official letters of March the 26th, ultimo File No. 163-12-1 regarding the Day Schools at Fort Grahame and Fort Moleod. As mentioned in these letters a return has got to be prepared by the teacher and submitted monthly. Before this can be done I would respectfully request that you send me some of these forms for returns of Day Schools as I have not got any on hand.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 26, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to the last paragraph of your letter of the 17th instant, in which you recommend the re-engagement of Mr. George N. Cormack for the position as teacher of the Indian Summer School at Fort McLeod during the coming summer, I would say that the Department will approve of his re-engagement. The salary allowed him during the period the school is in operation will be at the rate of $90 per teaching month - this being the same rate as paid last year.\n\nPlease advise the church authorities and Mr. Cormack of his appointment. He should arrange to be at Fort McLeod in time to re-open the school on or about June first, next. It is understood that the school will be in operation during the coming summer for a period of approximately three months.\n\nMr. Cormack should prepare and forward a return, showing attendance, days taught, etc., at the end of each month, when cheque in payment of salary due will be sent. Please request him to state definitely the date the school reopened and the address to which the cheque should be sent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B. C.\nVanderhoof, B.C., March 17th, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI would respectfully direct your attention to my letter of March the 11th inst. File No. M-3-S-583 relative to the Indian Day Schools at Fort McLeod and Fort Grahame Indian Reserves.\n\nRegarding the second paragraph of my letter, I beg to enclose herewith an application to teach at Fort Grahame, from Mr. P.J. Downey of Smithers, B.C., accompanied by recommendations from his Parish Priest, School Principal and Missionary of the Fort McLeod and Fort Grahame Indian Missions. It would appear as if this boy might be alright although he has not had any actual experience in teaching. After reviewing his letters of recommendation and qualification, I would esteem it a favour if you would please advise me if I may engage him as from May the 20th next.\n\nAs mentioned in my last letter, Mr. Cormack who taught last year at Fort McLeod, is available again this year and I presume that I am safe in engaging him again this season? At all events I am not doing anything definitely until I hear from the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclosures.\nVanderhoof, B.C., March 18th., 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith for your consideration and approval a copy of a letter received from his Honour, Bishop Coudert, O.M.I. in connection with teachers for Takla Lake, Fort McLeod and Fort Grahame summer schools.\n\nIn connection with Cormack who has applied again this year for Fort McLeod School I wish to advise that this is satisfactory. In reference to Mr. Parent who has now been the Bishop's nominee for Takla Lake, I wish to advise that this is also satisfactory although Mr. Downey who has taught for us for the past two years did a particularly good job of teaching both years but according to the Bishop his actions outside of the school work and especially in connection with the church was not all that could be desired. So far as I am personally concerned no complaint was ever made regarding the conduct or Mr. Downey although Bishop Coudert told me verbally a few days ago that he had had complaints about him drinking last year at Takla.\n\nRegarding Richard MacDonald from Smithers I would respectfully point out that this boy has not advanced past the 9th Grade and I would respectfully request information advising me regarding his application. Mr. McKenzie who taught at Fort Grahame last year is at present attending Normal School in Vancouver prior to getting his teachers' certificate but will not be possible for him to reach Fort Grahame before the 12th of June next. This date is about two weeks later than usual although in the past Fort Grahame is concerned the Indians do not return to their camp very much sooner than the second week in June so that in reality the teacher coming in on or about the 15th of May would really have two or three weeks when not much work could be accomplished. Mr. McKenzie has also applied to me for the school, explaining the situation and advising that by teaching on the Saturdays that he would still be able to get three months' teaching in before the Indians would want to leave for their hunting grounds again about the end of August.\n\nPlease understand that Fort Grahame is approximately 350 miles by air from here and it means a great deal of inconvenience and extra expense to the Department in having a new teacher go into that outlying line each year because he neither knows the pupils nor the parents as well as being handicapped in opening the school himself without assistance on the ground. However, the principal drawback to McDonald's application as I see it is his own educational standing. Please advise fully regarding these various points.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H.

Cormack, the teacher re-appointed for the McLeod Lake seasonal school, left Prince George for Fort McLeod on the 20th instant and his duties will commence on the 22nd instant.

Cormack as teacher of the Fort McLeod seasonal school for the period the school is open during the coming summer. He will be allowed salary at the rate of $90.00 a teaching month. It is noted that he will reach the school about May 20 and the school should be kept open for approximately three months. As he was in charge of this school last year it will not be necessary to secure another staff questionnaire. You should, however, advise me later regarding the exact date on which he begins duties at Fort McLeod.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nR. Howe, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B. C.\nVanderhoof, B.C., June 30th, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith a general report of affairs in this agency during the month of June 1938.\n\nEX'D.\n\nFRRT MAGLEOD BAND\n\nI visited the school and found good progress being made, the building was clean and so were the children. The same teacher is there again this year and he has the work well in hand and keeps good discipline. Some of the articles asked for in the requisition for school supplies were not sent by the department and of course I had no way of finding out until I got in there. I am sure it was merely an oversight on the part of someone, as no mention of the shortages had been made in any of the correspondence in connection therewith which would lead me to believe that the articles in question were disallowed. I have sent a separate letter in this connection.\n\nR. H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nSir:\u2014\n\nAs in previous years I would respectfully request that you send me the salary cheques for the teachers at Fort McLeod, Fort Grahame and Takla Landing and I will have them sent in as soon as the monthly reports reach me. The Fort Grahame and Fort McLeod schools commenced May 21st. The Takla Landing school commenced May 25th. I would like to have the cheques sent to me in the usual way for delivery to avoid delay.\n\nThe teachers' names are as follows:\n\nGeorge N. Cormack, teacher, Fort McLeod, B.C.\nWalter P. Fitzgerald, teacher, Fort Grahame, B.C.\nD. Parent, teacher, Takla Landing, B.C.\n\nTrusting that you can give this matter prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\n\nRHM/L.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nVanderhoof, B.C., June 3rd, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit below a general report covering the affairs of this agency for May 1938.\n\nThe school teachers for the summer schools at Fort McLeod, Fort Grahame and Tackla Landing were sent in to their respective schools during the month. So far I have not visited any of these but hope to do so during this month.\n\nR. H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nVanderhoof, B.C., April 1st, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nPlease refer to my letter of March the 18th ultimo, File No. N-3-546 with reference to nominations of teachers for summer schools by His Honour, Bishop Couder, O.M.I., With particular reference to the third paragraph of my letter I wish to advise that I have since received another letter from His Honour which says in part, \"Reference to my letter of March the 16th regarding the teachers for Indian Summer schools at Fort Grahame, McLeod etc. I beg to suggest that the application of Walter L. Fitzgerald be taken into consideration for the School at Fort Grahame rather than Dick McDonald's application. Walter Fitzgerald, seems, indeed, better qualified for the position in every respect.\"\n\nSince my last letter to the Department I have been advised by Mr. John McKenzie that it will be impossible for him to teach this year at Fort Grahame, Normal entrance examinations will not be until towards the end of June, which means that McKenzie's name can be forgotten in so far as Fort Grahame is concerned. I might say that Mr. Fitzgerald has been a school teacher in white schools for five or six years and seems to be quite well qualified. He has got a first class teachers' certificate and at the present time is studying philosophy at St. Joseph's Seminary in Edmonton. I would, therefore, recommend that Mr. Fitzgerald's application be approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H.

Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B. C.\nProgress Report - McLeod's Lake\n\nGroup 1\nThree of this group are progressing satisfactorily in reading writing and arithmetic. One of these, in particular, is advancing very rapidly in all branches. Leon Neville has at last shown signs of a glimmering of understanding. After an intensive campaign of a couple of months he is becoming a little more sure of himself in telling the difference between 1, 2, 3, although less sure of 4 & 5. His writing of individual letters is good, and although he seems to be able to distinguish letters better than numbers, still he becomes confused very easily. I am convinced he has a good deal of intelligence but, although he seems not to be bothered with such things as inhibitions (a more cheerful happy-go-lucky sort never existed), it would seem to require a psychologist to bring out that intelligence.\n\nThe fifth member of the group is about seven years old, has just started school and was away for the most of the term, so that his progress has been negligible.\n\nGroup 2\nThe three boys in this group are very satisfactory. One of them in particular, very slow in getting started, has in the last two years become really interested and has made good progress. These three are in the Corona Primer, are doing various degrees of addition and subtraction and are all good in writing although not in sentence composition.\n\nThe two girls in the group have had, in one case three, and in the other two, weeks of school this term. In addition to this handicap the girls just do not pick up English as well as the boys. This and their natural shyness retards their progress, particularly in reading. But their arithmetic is on a level with that of the rest of the group.\n\nGroup 3\nOne of this group (on the basis of his former work) has been away for the whole term, but since he has been to Lejac for three years he is still ahead of the others although Harry Chingee is advanced now almost as far. One of this group, Charlie Isidore, is not up to the level of the rest - but of the others two are reading the 1st Reader and two have finished it. Three of them are doing simple problems (one of these is the one who never attended - but he is graded on the basis of last summer) and the other two addition and subtraction. Four of them are advancing very well in the art of making sentences and the other one rather badly in this line.\n\nIn general - Their musical education has been directed along the line of Church music which is of course their chief contact with that art. I have even been able in the last summer to teach six or seven to read music in at least one key.\n\nTheir cleanliness is problematical. During the summer they can be kept in a reasonable state. But after a long winter a certain carelessness may be detected. However I notice that as they grow older their lessons in cleanliness seem to stick better, so that in general as they grow older they become much more careful in this matter.\n\nPractical religious knowledge is satisfactory especially since they have the added advantage of a permanent mission.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The school at Fort McLeod was closed this year at approximately the same date as it has been for the past four years.

Howe, Indian Agent, Vanderhoof, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th ultimo, regarding the appointment of teachers for the Fort McLeod and Takla Seasonal Schools, present regulations do not permit our paying the transportation expenses of teachers to and from schools. It has therefore been decided to allow a salary of $110.00 a teaching month for each of these schools for the period they are in operation during the coming summer.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, January 25, 1945.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Indian Agent Howe, suggesting that the salary of $90.00 a month for the seasonal schools at Fort McLeod and Takla is too low. He points out that the teachers are usually secured in Edmonton and transportation from Edmonton to the points mentioned is approximately $75.00. He suggests that we pay the travelling expenses.\n\nOwing to present regulations, it is impossible for the Department to consider payment of travelling expenses of teachers. However, before replying to Indian Agent Howe, I would like to hear from you regarding what amount you consider would be reasonable for these teachers. I was thinking possibly a salary of $100.00 or $110.00 a month, plus bonus, would provide most of the funds, at least, that a teacher would require for the payment of travelling expenses. An early reply would be appreciated.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF December 31, 1944, from\nE. M. Hamilton, Part Time Field Matron, WARE, B.C.\naddressed to R. HOWE, Indian Agent, Vanderhoof, B.C.\n(December report of Field Matron)\n\nOriginal on File 109-163.\n\nIs the Mission School at McLeod's Lake large enough to accommodate ten or twelve children from here for the summer? Could it be arranged to send them to school in the summer? The families are all related at Ware and there is a lot of dissatisfied young men and women. If a few of the older girls were sent with the younger ones, it is possible they would marry into that band. Hoping I have not asked for the impossible.\nStuart Lake Agency,\nVanderhoof, B.C.,\nJanuary 15th, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nWith reference to the appointment of teachers for the Fort McLeod and Takla Seasonal Schools for the 1945 school season. It is extremely difficult to secure teachers at the salary rate of $90.00 per month.\n\nIn the past, some teachers have been obtained from Edmonton. Transportation costs from this point to Takla and Fort McLeod are in the neighborhood of $75.00 return. By the time the teachers pay board and lodging which is extremely higher in these remote areas there is very little of their salary left.\n\nI would recommend that transportation costs to and from the schools be paid by the Department. May I be advised if this meets with approval so that I may be in a position to quote the exact salary to prospective candidates.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I do not understand the statement in Indian Agent Howe's letter that the teacher has not received any increase. We have no record on our file of an increase having been requested for him. On June 8, 1944, Indian Agent Howe wrote to us stating that Father Doherty's services were again available for the summer of 1944, but made no mention of any increase in salary. In a letter of June 15, a copy of which was sent to you, we advised that we would allow $90 a teaching month and no exception was taken to this decision. When the returns are received from Father Doherty showing the period he operated the school during the summer of 1944 salary will be paid to him at the rate stated.\n\nR.A.

Jordon, O.M.I., D.D., that the Seasonal School at Fort McLeod, B.C., might be operated on a full time basis in future.\n\nOwing to the fact that this Band primarily derive their living from trapping and their more or less Nomadic habits, I was skeptical about a full time School at this Reserve. However, the parents have been consulted, and they are all in favour of the proposal. Therefore, I would recommend that the suggestion of the Right Reverend Bishop Jordon be carried out.\n\nI would suggest that the 3 months Seasonal School term commencing about May 15th operate as usual, and if we are able to locate a full time teacher, the new full term could open Sept. 1st. In event that the Department approves, may I be advised at the earliest convenience so that we have ample time to locate a teacher, also, will the department advise as to salary and allowances for a full time teacher.\n\nThe present School building is inadequate and unsuitable for a permanent full time purpose. I would suggest that consideration be given to building a new School during the next fiscal year. An item of $2,200.00 was included in the 1947-48 estimates for this purpose. There are some good axemen amongst this Band capable of constructing a suitable log building.

I did not receive any pay for the fare which is estimated to $5.00 and neither did receive the cheque for the last teaching month which was broken off on the advice of Mr. Howe.\n\nAs my financial status is very low and expenses are high, funds are tremendously dear.

M.\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of d.d. Oct 24, 1949.\n\nI can inform you that the main point in doubt in my mind with regard to the last cheque of your list. I am sorry to say that I did not receive $127.25 in the amount of $83.60.\n\nReceived the following cheques:\n\nJuly 18, 1949 - J027798 - Amount $137.75 - Tax Deduction - Balance $109.75\n\nJuly 30, 1949 - J027799 - $82.25 - $9.25 - $73.75\n\nAug 15, 1949 - J023079 - $72.25 - $72.25\n\nThe cheque $127.25 of Aug 31 mentioned in your letter was not received.\n\nTo clear up a few things,\n\nI presume it has gone lost in the mail. It would not be the first time that a letter destined for Mr. Lord was lost. Last year I got two letters from home (Holland) and the first letter ever lost was one destined for Mr. Lord.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6418, file 853-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nI am not the first and only one complaining about the U.S. Post mail. For that reason also I wrote my cheque mailed to Judge George M. Harris today. But this was not done for one or other reason.\n\nIt may be that this mail business sorter also the question about the difficulties which sprung from the school-date closing last year. To tell you the truth, Mr. Henry, I don't see why I had to mail those monthly returns, on which was stated every exact date and address, etc. I am surprised and disappointed because I had lots of trouble to get rid of the extra charge $2.00 each year, so it took me 3 times to write about it and finally I was told that it was my fault. Further I did not receive any acknowledgment this last sum.\n\nAnother point is: how can Mr. Howe say that my way up would be paid. I am not looking for favors which are not kept. I call a grade a grade if I do not get it. I'll do without it and I'll give up more. I gave up home and country and life is but a load and I'll fight my way through. Well Mr. Henry, this is not meant for you, I know and realize that you cannot do everything what an old fellow asks.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6418, file 853-1, part 1)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, OTTAWA\n\nYour File 853-1 (E)\n\nRe: Fort McLeod Seasonal School\n\nI have your letter of October 19, 1949 enclosing a letter from Mr. I. Bruinsma, formerly teacher at the above mentioned school, having reference to his salary and transportation costs.\n\nIt was made very clear to Mr. Bruinsma by myself and apparently by Mr. Indian Superintendent Robertson that the Department would not pay travelling expenses of teachers, and I cannot understand why he indicates in his letter that I mentioned his transportation would be paid by the Department.\n\nI would point out, however, that Mr. Bruinsma was retained for three teaching months and that due to extremely poor attendance caused by the necessity of the Indian families to migrate to Prince George to secure work, the school was closed at the end of the second month. If it is possible, I would recommend that Mr. Bruinsma be paid for the full three months, particularly in view of his heavy travelling costs.\n\nWith regard to the future operation of this seasonal school, 14 of the children were enrolled in the Lagun Residential School last September, and in view of the nomadic tendencies of these Indians and the poor attendance, I can see no good purpose in keeping it open and would recommend the school be closed permanently.\n\nPlease advise if this meets with the Department's approval, so that the building used for school purposes may be turned over to a member of the Band for living quarters.\n\nI am returning Mr. Bruinsma's letter herewith.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Jordan, O.M.I., D.D.\nVicar Apostolic of Prince Rupert,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nDear Bishop Jordan:\n\nRe: Fort McLeod Seasonal School\n\nYou will recall our conversation of November 18th, 1946, in which you pointed out the need for an Indian school on a permanent basis at Fort McLeod.\n\nUnfortunately, the Indians, this summer, attended the seasonal school very poorly. In fact, most of the Indian families migrated to Prince George and it was necessary to close the school at the end of the second month.\n\nWe have now received a recommendation that this school be closed permanently, and I would appreciate hearing from you concerning this recommendation.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nNovember 9th, 1949.\n\nMr. I. Bruinsma,\n9948 - 110th Street,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Fort McLeod Seasonal School\n\nI have now received a report from Mr. Howe at Vancouver, concerning your claim in regard to the payment of travelling expenses. He confirms that he made it very clear to you that the Department could not pay the travelling expenses of teachers. He cannot understand why you have claimed that he told you that his transportation would be paid by the Department.\n\nHowever, he has also recommended that payment be made to you to the end of August, and as indicated in my previous letter of October 31st, an adjusted cheque will be sent to you.\n\nI believe that this will clarify the entire situation at this seasonal school, and believe that you have now been paid in full so far as our regulations permit.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Nezzy,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nDear Mr. May:\n\nThank you very much for your letter of the 2nd inst.\n\nI am awfully sorry that I cannot do much trouble and admire your and my patience. Honestly, it's very painful for me to write again and again.\n\nFirst of all, I do not worry about the income tax. I hope to get the back sometime next year. Neither have I any complaint about the cheques no 27798 (July 18) no 27444 (July 31), no 25079 (Aug 15). But I have a lost cheque no 91271 ($83.00 Aug 31), which was lost and was not substituted. If it was substituted by the law of Nov 12 ($75.00), then I wonder where the other $10.00 are. If it was not substituted by no 95111 of Nov 12 ($500), then I wonder where the substitute cheque is.\n\nI complete as follows:\n\n1 teaching month June 18 - July 12 = $155.00\n   July 12 - Aug 5 = $65.00\n   Aug 5 - Aug 29 = $155.00\n\n3 teaching months = $485.00\n\nNow I agree on 1 teaching month equivalent to $455.00. Please I claim (with interest) another cheque:\n\nAs I am entitled by law to the payment of my salary\nbecause $75.00 is not the payment till Aug 29.\nPlease! Please! Please! send me resting money $53.00. If I had known before that this would cause so much trouble I would not have accepted this teaching job. I do not want that you have any burdens, but I do not wish any body to have such a teaching job as I had last summer, but I have done it with love and done my duty as I had accepted it. But I assure you Mr. Henry it's no fun and I am quite well off, though not approve what Indian Affairs pays so little attention to Indians. I regret that I did not stay in Edmonton I could have made the money necessary for this study year but now I am broke. But Providence will provide I hope.\n\nNow it has no sense to write more. I think that you will see that this is unbearable for me. I do not ask for an unjust payment. I'll fight my way through life. I am sure that you will reply to my cry of distress in a favorable way.\n\nI wish you a very happy and holy Christmas and prosperous New Year.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nJ. B.

A teaching month consists of twenty-one days only because you are expected to teach twenty-one days (more or less) of the thirty or thirty-one days in a calendar month.\n\nThis means that you are free from teaching duties or responsibilities for the Saturday and Sunday of each week.\n\nYour salary, however, covers the period from the first day of each month up to the thirty-first day of each month and was at the rate previously specified, namely, $155.00 a teaching month. In other words, your salary covers thirty-one days, but you are only required to teach for twenty-one days (more or less - depending on the number of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays in the month).\n\nThis misunderstanding has arisen with you because of the vocabulary in common use in all schools. If you had taken any Normal School training, the matter would be quite clear as we follow what is common practice in all provincial Departments of Education.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6418, file 853-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nYou are the first seasonal school teacher to whom this matter has not been clear, and I regret that this misunderstanding has arisen.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard M. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nJanuary 26, 1950.\n\nMr. Ignatius Bruinsma,\n9948 110th Street,\nEdmonton, Alta.\n\nFort McLeod Indian Seasonal School\n\nDear Mr. Bruinsma:\n\nWe have received your letter of January 20 and regret your misunderstanding of the proper method of computing the number of teaching days in a given calendar month.\n\nWe have on file your Monthly Day School Returns for the Fort McLeod Indian Seasonal School. The first one is dated July 12, 1949, and it states that school was in session for twenty-one days. The second one is dated August 5, 1949, and it indicates that school was in session for twenty-one days. No other forms have been received. Even when including the extra days from August 5 to 11, you can not claim to have taught for sixty-three days.\n\nMay we again point out that, regardless of the number of teaching days in a calendar month, your salary covers the period from the first day of each month up to the thirty-first day of the same calendar month. You have, therefore, been paid in full for the period June 18 to August 31, 1949, as follows:\n\nJune 18 - June 30 inclusive ..... $ 67.17 (13/30 x $155.00)\nJuly 1 - July 31 inclusive ..... $ 155.00\nAugust 1 - August 31 inclusive ..... $ 155.00\n\nTotal ..... $ 377.17.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBernard F. Heary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMr. E. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nThanks for your letter of January 7th. I agree with you, but I sincerely think that I am fooled by this whole Indian business. I'll explain how what I mean. I know very well that a teaching month consists of 21 days, only because I was expected to teach 21 days. But in a calendar month. But Mr. R. Harte told me (in 1948) to teach on Saturdays and complete a teaching month as soon as possible i.e., make 21 days, and then start counting for a new month. This was the practice of all the teachers at Ft. McLeod which appeared and seemed from the reports. The reason was because the Indians were only for a short time at Ft. McLeod. They stay only (as a rule) till round about Aug 15th. Therefore Mr. Harte said: \"In order to make 63 days at least, teach as often as possible.\" Thus he did not keep any holidays and taught on Saturdays as far as possible. I cannot see...\nIf it does not work during the summer of 1948, as I did during the summer of 1947. If you read the monthly returns you will notice that in 1948 I purchased the same. As Mr. Howe told me to act as described I trusted he. This was conformity with the rules and laws of your department. Now again I am faced, but I do not want to be the victim of somebody else's tricks and therefore I claim the rest of the salary. You know as well as I do that I was pretty late at Mr. Howe's. But I informed Mr. Howe for wire that I couldn't come earlier but he agreed that it was all right and you yourself answered the same in your letter of March 29, 1949. Otherwise I would not have been late. I know that Mr. Howe cannot help that his all goes like hotcakes, but I cannot help it either. You understand, I am sure, that this is not pleasant for me and I hope and trust that I will be reinstated.\n\nI wrote Mr. Howe long ago about the travel expenses, but I think because he sees that he was wrong he did not answer. I do not want to talk behind anyone's back, and I will neither to hurt a man that I fight for my rights. Not only England but everyman (may) expects everybody to do his duty and to be just. Well I must close now. Thanking you for all your kindness.\n\nSincerely yours,\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The two boys, more recent comers, are rather slow on reading but one of them is making good progress in addition and subtraction while the other has so.\n\n- **Group 3**: One boy, David Chingee who started with the three boys previously mentioned but who is making excellent progress in reading and in the understanding of his reading and satisfactory progress in Arithmetic. Also two other boys one of whom, William Solonas, is very intelligent but has been held up by many absences from school with his father. The other is now doing very well although he was slow disposition, since he finally seemed to take hold at the beginning of last summer.\n\n- **Group 4**: Mack Taylie, although at school only for a few days as yet, still shows an excellent comprehension and is far advanced both in reading and Arithmetic to which he is making splendid progress. His problems Allen n'Yelle is as far advanced in the mechanics of the subject but not quite so quick in solution. His Arithmetic, addition and subtraction is satisfactory but not brilliant.

However, judging from their appearance in the early spring as they arrive from the traplines, this would seem to be principally a summer failing. Nevertheless the bigger boys and the girls do seem to be permanently affected in the right direction although there are three families whose members it seems quite impossible to change. The smaller boys are not affected in the least - it is only as they grow older that they take kindly to washing. As long as they come to school or are under the teacher eye they of course have to make an attempt at it. But left alone a few hours, it is remarkable what grime appears on faces and hands - perhaps only a common failing of small boys who lack the advantage of watchful parents. Baths, however, do not enter into the life of any of them, young or old, until the water becomes warm enough for swimming.\n\nAbsentees - Mary Ann Todick - ill.\nSabina Todick - ill.\nMarie n'Yelle - simple minded.\n\nThese cases of illness are chronic so that the girls are not included on the register at all.\nDAY SCHOOL RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the McLeod's Lake Summer School for the ended July 16, 1940.\n\nTeacher: George R.

The boys in Group 3 and the girl (even though she still does not read as well as the boys) are showing much more intelligence in this line. This is reflected also in a better grasp of phonetic values (something which has generally been very very hazy heretofore) and in an ability to do simple arithmetic problems, and in a better attempt at sentence construction. Group 2 is also showing a greater enthusiasm and a better grasp of the subject, although not so far advanced as the other group.\n\nAs to texts, I mentioned last year my conviction as to the need for texts more adapted to their primitive life in order that they might gain the necessary facility in reading which they need to read more advanced material. I am still convinced of this, but nevertheless, the new Primer \"Happy Days\" is, in my opinion, a vast improvement over either of the former Corona Primers I or II, and I have experienced much less difficulty in getting them to understand this Primer.\n\nSpelling and sentence construction are improving gradually with the older children (the spelling of these Indian is generally atrocious since they spell, naturally, by ear - and the sounds in their own language are very different from those of English, which latter language they speak as if it were Sekenais - and the sentence construction tends to be even worse, for the same reason).\n\nArithmetic, as usual, is quite satisfactory except in the case of one boy in Group 2 who is still floundering quite hopelessly. But the others, both Group 2 and 3 are very good. And this year 7 of them are doing simple problems very well. The Arithmetic involved in these problems is, of course, very simple, but I use them rather as an exercise in understanding and sentence construction - and I think it has been quite successful. Group 1 is just beginning, and next summer some of them will be doing simple Arithmetic - and the others will still be beginning.\n\nAll of the foregoing still excludes the perennial Group 1er Leon n'Yallie who is still as much a problem as ever. After 5 summers or so of schooling he is very little, if any, ahead of two of the children who started this summer - even his knowledge of English still is exceedingly sketchy. He needs, I suppose, a psychologist to teach him. His physical development, however, parallels his mental development - so I gather that there must be some constitutional defect.\n\nWriting is never much of a problem since they love to write and scribble all over everything. They thus develop a remarkably good hand in comparison with white children who would be ahead of them in other lines.\nMcLeod's Lake July 19 - Aug.18, 1941\n\nCleanliness - in general has certainly greatly improved since the school was opened. Some of the younger children are still hard to convince - but on the other hand two of the new children (only 6 years old) have been remarkably clean right from the first day of school. It is noticeable that some of the families in the village look upon 'reasonable' cleanliness as a virtue. And then of course there are others. And with all the young children the case for cleanliness is not quite hopeless since they all love to swim - even the little girls.\n\nThis summer a school garden was attempted. And, consider the fact that everything was planted in almost pure dry sand, it has been remarkably successful. We planted flowers around the school building and a vegetable garden a few yards away. The planting was late since the school starts after the 15th of May but, for purposes of experience in gardening for the children, this made no difference at all. We also attempted a little beautifying with some rock-bordered paths down to the lake shore, and with ploughing the reclaimed wilderness that served as a playground for planting to grass. The results of this schooling in practical and not so practical gardening are still in the future - and time alone will tell if they have learned these lessons well enough to put them into practice. I think, though, that if this angle is followed up and emphasized sufficiently, the time and effort will not be wasted. At any rate this summer they have learned how to spade (and even plough), prepare the ground for planting, plant, weed, transplant, and keep the garden watered. With sufficient repetition and more practice - who knows - perhaps they might absorb some enthusiasm.\n\nGeorge Connach\nimprovement along this line. In general however their knowledge of English has improved greatly since the school was opened. I have noticed too that the younger children of a family know a certain amount of English when they start to school, indicating that the children who do go to school speak more English in the home than was formerly the case. This was especially so in the case of Pat n'Yallie who quite surprised me by the amount of English that she knew when she arrived at school for the first time - and when she had recovered from her first shyness.\n\nCleanliness is still the problem it has always been, the older boys being quite used to the idea, the younger children requiring the threat of sanctions. In this connection though, a great deal depends upon 'which side of the tracks' they come from - so that I have noticed in the case of several families, even the youngsters of pre-school age are kept remarkably neat and tidy, while with other families it is completely the opposite.\nREMARKS (cont.)\n\nReading is improving generally, especially when a little more emphasis is placed on phonics. The pupils in Groups 2 and 3 are all improving, except Walter Solonas who is lacking somewhat in ambition in this field, and those in Group 1 who have just started school will, I have no doubt, advance very quickly next summer.\n\nTheir comprehension of what they read is improving also since I have been insisting on this before they go on to read further. This has, perhaps, the effect of slowing them down but I think that they are now grasping the idea that reading is more than just saying the words. In this connection however, they are up against great obstacles because of the matter to be read. The experience of these people in northern B.C. is very limited - and what they have learned about white customs and life has come mostly from trappers, prospectors and traders. Thus when they must learn to read from books which, in content, style and thought, are meant for white children, they are handicapped tremendously. A beginning at overcoming this has been made with the Pre-Primer \"Two Little Indians\", but apparently there are no other books so designed especially for Indian children. It seems to me that if these northern Indians are ever to take the intelligent interest in affairs which is to be desired, then the children should be taught that reading is one of the main keys to this active interest. The danger, at present, is that they might very easily learn to read and write without in the least realizing that these arts are of any value beyond the perennial writing of letters. In reading such books as deal with things familiar to every white child but almost incomprehensible to the Indian, it is very hard to make them realize that the story is telling them something, and that there is anything on the page beyond a mere jungle of words. I believe that these children should learn to read intelligently from books designed in every way solely for them.\n\nArithmetic is in every stage, from two of the new pupils who are still learning counting and simple addition to those who are doing multiplication and division and simple problems. Here again problem work is hampered by a lack of understanding.\n\nWriting is generally very good under the circumstances but anything in the way of composition or sentence structure is very primitive. Several of the boys, however, are improving along this line. Here too, readers constructed with the Indian children in mind would aid in giving them models to imitate so that they would have a better chance of escaping from their very primitive idiom in which they express themselves.\n\nReligious knowledge has been fairly well absorbed and prayers learned well.\n\nCleanliness - as usual - not very permanent in the younger children, but apparently appreciated and adhered to by the girls and the older boys.\nDAY SCHOOL RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the McLeod Lake Summer School for the Month ended June 18, 1941.\n\nTeacher: George Cornwall\n\nP.O.

Of the latter, Edward Schmitt made last year signs of absorbing a little knowledge and may be presumed to advance more quickly than heretofore, while n'Yallie (Benoit) Lena has not yet seen a slight awakening of intelligence, but very slight.\n\nGroup 2 - The two girls who have been at school since it started and whose reading facility is improving but slowly, but whose ability in Arithmetic is unsatisfactory. One of them also started last year and whose chief difficulty is in learning what she learned before coming to school, but who is making satisfactory progress especially in Reading. Also two of the younger boys, Mack Taylie and Maurice n'Yallie who are doing much better than last year in every way.\n\nGroup 3 - Consisting of the older boys and one of the younger ones. This last one, although beginning School after the Others, reads and writes letters remarkably well but is not so remarkable, although not satisfactory, in Arithmetic. Allen n'Yallie reads with great ease but is very slow in Arithmetic. The other three are very good at numbers but just plod along in their reading.\n\nMost of the children write very well, but any composition attempted is necessarily primitive in thought and phrasing.

They liked it very much and I laid special stress on these two branches. Some of them are really artistic in drawing and it would be fine that they get an opportunity to develop this ability. I notice a drawing made by Paul Holmes. He first drew his own idea and have no example they can copy from. The parents make me the whole too many excuses to keep them at home. I enjoyed school very much and I only had three ch. go only for such a short time & lot there was lost also in meetings.\n\nNo. of pupils on Register 19 (20)\nAggregate attendance during Quarter 1197\nNo. of school days in Quarter 63\nNo. of days in Quarter school was open 63\nNo. of holidays in Quarter\nAverage attendance during Quarter 16.60\n\n**NOTE\u2014Marks for conduct: A, good; B, fair; C, bad.

Cormack, St. Joseph's Seminary, Edmonton, as teacher. He was nominated by the Roman Catholic Church authorities. The salary allowed him during the period the school is in operation will be at the rate of $90 per teaching month.\n\nA requisition has been forwarded to the Government Stationery Office to forward, addressed to you, the supply of classroom material considered necessary. You should arrange to have this forwarded to Fort McLeod, in due time.\n\nWith reference to the request that the Department make an advance of $25 towards the cost of supplies while the teacher makes the journey into the school and a like amount on his return, I have to say that the amount provided for salary is all we can allow. Present regulations do not permit making advances or payment of any part of the cost of transportation of teachers to and from a school.\n\nPlease advise the church authorities and Mr. Cormack of his appointment and arrange that he arrive at Fort McLeod in time to commence duties on the date above mentioned. The teacher should prepare and forward a return, showing attendance, days taught, etc., at the end of each month, when cheque in payment of salary due will be sent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Cormack for the position as teacher of the Indian Summer School at Fort McLeod during the coming summer, I would say that the Department will approve of his re-engagement. The salary allowed him during the period the school is in operation will be at the rate of $90 per teaching month - this being the same rate as paid last year.\n\nPlease advise the church authorities and Mr. Cormack of his appointment. He should arrange to be at Fort McLeod in time to re-open the school on or about June first, next. It is understood that the school will be in operation during the coming summer for a period of approximately three months.\n\nMr. Cormack should prepare and forward a return, showing attendance, days taught, etc., at the end of each month, when cheque in payment of salary due will be sent. Please request him to state definitely the date the school reopened and the address to which the cheque should be sent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. P. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B. C.\n\nS. Questionnaire sent to Agt.\n5/5/36\nVanderhoof, B.C., June 8th, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nIn view of the fact that it is impossible to get the report from the schools at Fort McLeod and Fort Grahame regularly and every month, on account of their being no regular mail service either to or from these points, I would respectfully request that you forward the salary cheques to the teachers, direct and before the monthly reports reach you. I will see that these are sent on as soon as they are received by me. Mr. Cormack is teaching at Fort McLeod and Mr. Downey at Fort Grahame.\n\nWhile teaching did not start until May the 16th, the teachers were on the ground from May the 14th, getting the supplies unpacked and the buildings ready, so that their time should really commence May 15th.\n\nPlease advise if you will send the cheques direct or if it will be necessary to have the reports first.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 18, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant, the Department will forward to you, at the end of this month, salary cheques of Mr. Cormack and Mr. Downey for the period May 15th to June 30th. Cheques will also be issued in favour of these men at the end of July and August. These cheques will be forwarded to you, in order that you may send them to the teachers.\n\nA supply of quarterly return forms is enclosed, which you should also forward to the teachers, in order that they may prepare their returns on the proper forms. Last year they used improvised forms, which were difficult to check.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nR. H.

These two shipments should be entirely separate and clearly marked. In making them up, please understand that practically all the pupils in each place will be beginners and consequently will not require any advanced books, etc. I would suggest that slates and pencils be sent if possible, as well as scribblers, etc. Pens and ink will not be required for this year at least. If you could attend to this part of it for me at Ottawa, I would appreciate a list of what you do send.\n**Requisition for School Material**\n\n*Date*: April 18, 1935\n\n*For*: FORT McLEOD DAY\n\n*School*:\n\n*Agency*:\n\n**NOTE**: Teachers should secure from the Department of Education, of the Province in which the Indian School is located, a list of the text books authorized for use in the white schools.

I am of the opinion that everything else that is required is already on the ground.\n\nI would suggest that you send a duplicate order of this list which I can send to Fort Grahame, they should be in separate boxes. I would like to have this as soon as possible. You might please advise regarding the janitor supplies which he mentions near the end of his letter. May I have the necessary authority to purchase these at Prince George for both schools?\n\nKindly return the letter when you are finished with it. The reason I didn't make a copy of it is because it is so chopped up and I thought it would be more understandable to you than to me.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 15, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 11th instant, the supplies required for the Fort Grahame and Fort McLeod Indian Day Schools are being ordered from the Government Stationery Office. We are giving directions to have these shipped by express at the earliest possible date addressed to you at Prince George, B.C. You might get in touch with the express agent at that point and have him notify you when the goods arrive, in order that you may accept delivery.\n\nYou will be forwarded from the Department two school registers - one for each school.\n\nWe have not supplied all the articles requested by Mr. Cormack, but I think the supplies that we are forwarding should be sufficient.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase of whatever janitor supplies you consider are necessary. When forwarding accounts covering the cost of these, a separate account should be sent for each of the two schools.\n\nAs requested in your letter, I return Mr. Cormack's letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nFor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nENC.\n\nR.

C.\nVanderhoof, B.C., June 27th, 1938.\n\nSir:-\n\nUnder date of April the 5th last I submitted a requisition for school supplies for the Fort McLeod Indian Summer School and on April the 19th I received a letter from the Department File No. 163-12-4 authorising me to purchase certain articles locally which were included on that requisition. These were eventually got and shipped to McLeod Summer School but upon my arrival there recently on an inspection trip to the school I found that one bale of oakum, eight window locks and six pairs of hinges were missing. As it is imperative that these articles be sent in this summer so that the school can be properly sealed up at the end of the term, I would respectfully request that I be granted authority to purchase these articles locally and have them sent in.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H.

Perry, Esq.,\nAssistant Indian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honour to forward my report on an Educational Survey of the situation at Quatsino, Kwawkewlth Agency.\n\nYou will see from my report that I did not consider it necessary to go to Quatsino, as I had suggested to you I might do, it being very difficult to arrange for such a trip owing to the break down of the engine of the Department's launch, \"Oikumi\". It was easy to obtain all the necessary details from the Agency records, and I had the help of the Indian Agent, Mr. M.S.Todd. Mr Todd would have found it difficult to arrange to be with me had I decided to go to Quatsino, as he was engaged on other Departmental business.\n\nA copy of my survey report is being sent to Mr. Indian Agent Todd, MARKED CONFIDENTIAL, as he was so closely identified with me in making this investigation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H. Perry,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nInvestigation:\n\nThe facts brought out in this Survey Report were obtained while at Alert Bay on other Departmental business. No expense of any sort was incurred in carrying out this brief survey of conditions and needs at Quatsino. My investigation took the form of a conference with the Indian Agent, Mr. M.S. Todd, who was able to supply the required information from his records.\n\nI did not consider that it was necessary to proceed to Quatsino as this trip would have cost more in time and money than it could possibly be worth. Other factors also had to be taken into consideration, such as the break down in the engine of the Department's launch \"Gikumii\", and the fact that the Indian Agent was very busy. I came to the conclusion that it would be better to visit the school when this had been established.\n\nThis survey was undertaken with reference to the facts reported by Mr. Indian Agent Todd in his letter of October 30th 1924, the last paragraph in particular, and the second paragraph of your letter 3/78462 addressed to Mr. Todd on February 6th 1925.\n\nGeneral:\n\nThe Anglican Church has lately erected a Church at the village of KOKKEMO, and it is proposed to establish an Indian Day School in this building.\n\nI understand from Mr. Indian Agent Todd that the Department of Indian Affairs has sanctioned the establishment of such a school, and that an item has been inserted in the 1925-26 Estimates of the Department to cover the salary of a teacher here as well as the provision of the necessary school desks, blackboards, text books and other necessary requirements.\n\nI am assured by Mr. Indian Agent Todd that this Quatsino area is an Anglican Mission and not as I had believed a United Church territory.\n\nChildren:\n\nThe list of Indian children for whom a school is desired is given on the next page of this survey. It will be seen from this list of thirteen boys and five girls, who would in the ordinary course of things attend school if one were established at Kokkemo, three boys and two girls are now attending the St. Michael's Indian Residential School, Alert Bay. It will be seen from my recommendation that only two of the five children now attending the Residential School be permitted to remain there after the Day School is established, these two being the sons of the two Chiefs. We would have to recommendations are carried out at least sixteen children to start this new Day School and as I understand that the Indians are anxious for education, it may be that we could get an average attendance of nearly fifteen. This would seem to me to be sufficient in this case as the Anglican Church is available for school purposes.\n\nThe question of a teacher is taken up in a later paragraph of this report.\n| Name of Father | Child's Age | Child's Name If Known | Remarks |\n|---------------|-------------|----------------------|---------|\n| Chief Johnny  | Boy         | Moses Johnny         | At St. Michael's now. |\n| Chief Nelson  | Girl        | Phillip Nelson       | At St. Michael's now. |\n| G. Nelson     | Boy         | Mary Clair           | At St. Michael's now. |\n| G. Nelson     | Boy         | John Charlie         | At St. Michael's now. |\n| G. Nelson     | Boy         | Margaret George      | At St. Michael's now. |\n\nNewltire Band:\n\n| Name          | Age | Remarks |\n|---------------|-----|---------|\n| Wilson Walker | 11  |         |\n| Wilson Walker | 13  |         |\n| This man married a Quatsino girl and lives most of the time at Quatsino. |   |         |\n| At Quatsino two thirds of the time. |   |         |\n| Newltire one third of the time. |   |         |\n\nThere are shown above thirteen boys and six girls, but of these there are at present three boys and two girls attending the St. Michael's Indian Residential School. I would recommend that Moses Johnny and John Charlie be permitted to continue their education at St. Michael's as they may be Chiefs' Later but that the three other children present at St. Michael's (two girls and a boy) attend the Day School when this is established.\n\nThis is also the wish of the Indian Agent.\nIt is very necessary that a well qualified and experienced teacher be chosen to open this school should it be decided to establish one at Koskemo.\n\nIt would be possible for a teacher to live in Quatsino, just half a mile away from the location of the school. There would be no difficulty, I understand, in finding a suitable boarding place.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Todd and I agree that it would be much better to obtain the services of a married teacher if this were possible. I hope that it may be possible for the Department to authorize the purchase of the necessary lumber locally so that a small teacher's residence, quite a small one is all that is necessary, could be erected near the proposed school and on the Indian Reserve. The Indian Agent and I agree after a discussion on the matter that it would be far better to have such a married couple amongst the Indians rather than living away from the Reserve, so that one could help in the case of the ordinary illness of any of the Indians and could dispense the simple drugs as a rule supplied to out of the way schools by the Department.\n\nSuch a small teacher's residence might be constructed by the Indians under supervision.\n\nI should like to suggest that if this school is authorized, and the other recommendations of the Indian Agent and myself meet with the approval of the Department, the present teachers at the Lakelsap Indian Day School, Skeena River Agency, Mr. and Mrs. John Heyhurst be given the opportunity to transfer to the proposed Koskemo Indian Day School.\n\nMrs. Heyhurst has I understand proved a great success as a teacher at the Lakelsap Day School, I am to inspect this school in May, and Mr. J. Heyhurst has also been a success with the boys and young men of the village. They also have been able to dispense the ordinary simple drugs supplied to them.\n\nWhile Mr. and Mrs. Heyhurst do not wish to resign their positions at the Lakelsap School or to sever their connection with the educational work of the Department of Indian Affairs, they have asked me to consider them as applicants for a transfer to another Indian Day School working under Anglican auspices should such a school become vacant.\n\nMr. John Heyhurst being by profession a Contractor and Builder, would be well suited to supervise the construction of a small teacher's cottage, should this be decided on at Koskemo. Their only reason for wishing for a transfer is that the Nass River climate does not suit their little five year old daughter.\n\nI should be very glad to see the above transfer made though the salary paid at the proposed Koskemo Indian Day School would of course be less than that now paid to the Heyhursts.\n\nThe whole of the above is submitted with respect for the information of the Department.\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nVictoria, B.C.\nApril 13, 1925.\nOttawa, May 1st, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your 15/6/39353 of the 13th ultimo, enclosing a report from Inspector Barry with reference to the request he has received for the establishment of a day school at Quatsino.\n\nNo provision was made in our appropriation for the current fiscal year for the establishment of a day school at this point and, consequently, the Department is unable to consider the matter at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

BOX 666\nVICTORIA, B.C., April 13, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith letter of the 13th instant, received from Capt. G.H. Barry, District Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C., covering his report on an Educational Survey of the situation at Quatsino, Kwawkewlth Agency.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 4, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, relative to the establishment of a day school at Quatsino. In this connection I have to say that the report of Mr. Inspector Barry, regarding the matter, was received. During a recent visit of the Assistant Indian Commissioner, this matter was discussed with him.\n\nNo provision was made in our Appropriation for the current fiscal year for the establishment of a school at this point, and I regret, therefore, that the Department will be unable to consider providing the classroom equipment and teacher's salary during the present fiscal year. A note of this requirement has been made for inclusion in our Estimates for the next fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKensie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. S. Todd, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay,\nB. C.\nSir,\n\nInspector Barry has forwarded me copy of his report to the Department on the proposed school at Quatsino, and I am in accord with his views on this matter.\n\nAs the Department has been offered the use of the new Church building for school purposes, I would like to be advised whether it will be possible to establish a Day School at Quatsino after the summer holidays and provide the necessary equipment and supplies. The Indians are very anxious that they have a school on their reserve, and I feel certain the incentive of education for the children will go a long way towards raising the standard of living of this Band, which at the present time leaves much to be desired.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S. Tedd)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 23, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, in further reference to the establishment of a day school at Quatsino.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, in view of your report, the Department has given favourable consideration to providing the funds required to fit up a classroom and to pay the salary of a teacher. It is noted, from your letter, that a teacher's salary and classroom equipment would not cost more than $1,100. It is noted, further, from the report on the survey made by Mr. Inspector Barry of the situation at Quatsino, that the Anglican Church, who lately erected a church building in the village of Kasikemo, would allow this building to be used for classroom purposes. The Department is informed that there would be at least 16 children who could attend when the school is opened.\n\nI have to request, therefore, that you will state what equipment is necessary to fit up the classroom in the church building, giving particulars regarding any desks required, the size of same and the number of each size, also dimensions - length and width - of any blackboard required.\n\nThe Department will provide salary for a teacher as from September first, next, the beginning of the new school year. I may add that, while no appropriation was specially provided to meet the expense in establishing the school and for teacher's salary, it has been found possible to arrange for the funds from our general appropriation for Indian Education.\n\nAt a later date, you might take up with the authorities of the Anglican Church, under whose auspices the school will be conducted, the matter of nominating a qualified teacher; and, in due time, you should forward the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated. If a fully qualified teacher is obtained, we would be prepared to allow salary at the rate of $90 per teaching month.\n\nYour reply, giving full information as to the desks and other equipment required, will be appreciated, in order that the classroom will be ready by the date above mentioned. It is noted that the teacher could obtain living accommodation in the white village at Quatsino.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nM. S. Todd, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nSir,\n\nYour letter dated May 4th, No.156-36-1 in reference to the proposed Indian Day School being established at Quatsino has been received, and I am sorry to learn the Department feel nothing can be done this year. It might be as well for me to review the circumstances leading up to this request for a school.\n\nOn my first visit to Quatsino after taking over the Agency I discovered very little had been done for the Indians of this place. Their living conditions were deplorable and practically none of the children had ever been to school, with the result they were growing up uneducated and living in an unfortunate state. I undertook to help these particular Indians but felt before the Department could do much to assist them the first step would be the amalgamation of the bands in order that we could establish them in one village. This matter was discussed with them and explained thoroughly, after which the Indians responded to my wishes and the amalgamation took place, and was approved by the Department.\n\nAt that time I promised to undertake to get a Day School established at their village providing they would amalgamate as there were not sufficient children to warrant it otherwise. The amalgamation took place and with a building now provided which could be used for that purpose, I feel an effort should be made if at all possible to open a school there this year. A teacher's salary and classroom equipment should not cost more than $100.00. If necessary we could get a local teacher who could live at the white village at Quatsino for this year. It is my plan to eventually have a teacherage erected there where we could employ a married man who would live right on the reserve; his presence I am sure would be the means of improving conditions in this village.\n\nWhen the 1935 Estimates were being prepared the Department stated it was not necessary to include educational requirements for the year, but Supplementary List showing school requirements was forwarded to Mr. G.O. Perry, Assistant Commissioner at Victoria, and I was under the impression he had forwarded the same to Ottawa, but evidently this was not done. I do not want the Indians to feel we are letting them down, and if the Department could reconsider their decision it would be appreciated very much.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6418, file 854-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, May 26, 1935.\n\nHis Excellency\n\nThe Governor General in Council:\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to recommend the establishment of an Indian Day School, under Section 9 (a) of the Indian Act, to provide educational facilities for the benefit of the Indian children at Quatsino, Kwawkewlth Agency, British Columbia. There are twenty children of school age on the reserve, for whom at present no school facilities are provided.\n\nFunds have been included in the Main Estimates for Indian Education for the current fiscal year, 1935-36, to provide the cost in the establishment of a school at Quatsino.\n\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nSynopsis of Memorandum to Council of May 25th, 1935.\n\nA number of small Bands of Indians were recently amalgamated at Quatsino, Kwawkewlth Agency, B.C. There are 20 Indian children of school age, the majority of whom have never attended school and for whom no educational facilities are provided. It is intended to fit up a classroom in the Anglican Church building and engage a teacher's services. The local Indian Agent, the Inspector of Indian Schools and the authorities of the Church of England in Canada, under whose auspices the school will be conducted, have strongly urged the establishment of day school facilities. Funds to provide for the fitting up of the classroom and for the payment of teacher's salary are available in our Estimates for the current fiscal year.\nSir,\n\nHis Lordship Bishop Schofield has recommended Mr. Edward A. Hill-Tout of 1115 Collinson Street, Victoria, B.C., for the position of Indian Day School teacher in our new school at Quatsino which is to be opened on September 1st. While in Victoria recently Bishop Schofield discussed with Mr. Hill-Tout's application, and requested me to forward it to the Department for their approval. I am therefore enclosing herewith copy of this application for the Department's consideration, and would request you to advise me if it is approved.\n\nI think I should inform the Department in my opinion it is necessary to appoint a man teacher to this position for the present, as it will be necessary for him to board at the white village of Quatsino, some half mile distant which will necessitate rowing back and forth from his boarding house to the school.\n\nPersonally I would prefer to have a married man and his wife living on the reserve, but as we have no teacherage there at present this will be impossible for the time being.\n\nThe Indians have presented me with the enclosed picture of their new Church at Quatsino which we are going to use for a school and which was built entirely by Indian labour. As this is the only picture I have, could you be good enough to return it to me at your convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n1115 Collinson Street,\nVictoria, B.C.,\nJune 11th, 1935.\n\nMr. M.S.

I am a graduate of the Victoria Normal School, holding a first-class interim certificate, with the additional credit of the second year at the Victoria College.

During the last year and a half I have been doing tutoring of public and high school subjects, and have been teaching Sunday School to Grade 5 boys.\n\nMy interests in sports lie along the line of tennis, baseball, basketball and football. I am interested in music, both vocal and instrumental, and in amateur dramatics.\n\nI have seen Captain Barry at his office here and he mentioned that it would be advantageous to have a teacher's residence on the reserve, and that the pupils might help in its construction. I feel capable to supervise the building of such a residence; and I have had training with my father, who is an interior decorator and painter, besides a technical course at the Victoria High School.\n\nI will be twenty years old in September of this year, and stand about five feet six inches tall, and weigh 132 lbs.\n\nI have had an interview with the Bishop of Columbia on this matter, and lacking his recommendation which I had hoped to get, he said that he would be quite willing for me to have the position.\n\nIf I am appointed to the position, I shall give you my very best services.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(Sgd) \"Edward A.

There are twenty children of school age on the reserve for whom at the present time no school facilities are provided, and the majority of the children have never attended school. Funds have been included in the Main Estimates for Indian Education for the current fiscal year 1935-36, to provide for the salary of a Teacher at the rate of $90.00 per teaching month. It is the intention to fit up a classroom and to open the school on September 1st, next. The undersigned, therefore, begs to request the authorization of a position of Teacher, Indian School.\n\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General on the 1st June 1935.\n\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 25th May, 1935, from the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, recommending the establishment of an Indian Day School, under Section 9 (a) of the Indian Act, to provide educational facilities for the benefit of the Indian children at Quatsino, Kwawkewlth Agency, British Columbia.\n\nThe Minister states that there are twenty children of school age on the reserve, for whom at present no school facilities are provided, and\n\nThat funds have been included in the Main Estimates for Indian Education for the current fiscal year 1935-36, to provide the cost in the establishment of a school at Quatsino.\n\nThe Committee concur in the foregoing recommendation and submit the same for approval.\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\n\nThe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nCOPY\n\nHOUSE OF COMMONS\nCanada\n\nAlberni, B.C.

I might add I have included in my Estimates for 1935 a request for teacher's salary and necessary funds to operate the school during that year, but of course I cannot say whether the Department will agree to it or not.\n\nThe selection of a teacher is generally made by the Church, then approved by myself and forwarded to the Department for final approval.

I may add that, while no appropriation was specially provided to meet the expense in establishing the school and for teacher's salary, it has been found possible to arrange for the funds from our general appropriation for Indian Education.\n\n\"At a later date, you might take up with the authorities of the Anglican Church, under whose auspices the school will be conducted, the matter of nominating a qualified teacher, and, in due time, you should forward the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated. If a fully qualified teacher is obtained, we would be prepared to allow salary at the rate of $90 per teaching month.\n\nOur reason for directing the Agent to consult the Anglican Bishop was that the Indians of this Band\n\nA. W. Neill, Esq., M. P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6418, file 854-1, part 1)\nBand are members of the Anglican Church and it has always been the practice in such cases to allow the Church to nominate the teacher. On August 8th, 1935, Right Rev. Charles D. Schofield, D.D., Bishop of Columbia, wired the Department nominating Mr. Edward Hill-Tout. He was stated to be a graduate of the Victoria Normal School holding a first class interim certificate, with the additional credit of the second year at Victoria College. He had, also, taken a special summer course in primary work and rural school problems.\n\nIn view of the Bishop's nomination, the Department approved the appointment of Mr. Hill-Tout in official letter of August 16th, 1935. He was the only one nominated by the Bishop.\n\nWith regard to that part of your letter which refers to Mr. Todd, I may say that, yesterday, the Department received a communication from him enclosing copy of your letter to him of April 14th, last, and his reply of April 27th.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nA.

A local man thinks he was unfairly treated in the matter. Would you please advise me what the regular procedure is as to appointing these teachers and how it was carried out in this case as well as the respective dates concerned. Also if you have any correspondence from Mr. Todd on the subject I would like a copy of it and if you have anything to show that Mr. George Nordstrom applied for the position and why he did not get it. I applied to Mr. Todd for this information but he passed the buck to you. I mention this so that you will not be referring me back to him. Here again I have the same thing I complained of before. He apparently is going to give as little information as possible. I have not the slightest reason to suggest that Todd or any other Indian Department officer did anything improper in this matter, but I am entitled and want the full information so that I can convince this man who is complaining, or if I cannot convince him at least answer him.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA.

Neill, M.P., dated April 14th, copy of which I am enclosing, requesting information and copies of correspondence in connection with Mr. Nordstrom's application for the position of Indian Day School teacher at Quatsino. I wish to be very frank in this matter, as I do not feel correspondence in this connection should be directed to myself.\n\nWhen it was first learned that a Day School might be established at Quatsino in the Church building which was then under construction, Mr. Nordstrom apparently wrote to Mr. Neill asking him to assist him in getting this position. Mr. Neill wrote to me under date of October 26th requesting particulars regarding the opening of this school, and I replied to his subsequent letters but as it was not a matter for me to deal with, very little information could be given him.\n\nWhen it was finally decided that a school would be established, Mr. Nordstrom's application I understand was put in along with others to the Church. I was further informed, more or less confidentially, Mr. Nordstrom's qualifications were not sufficient for him to be nominated. I understand the only qualification he had was a Permit or third class Certificate issued in 1901 as shown on the record of the Department of Education, although Mr. Nordstrom claims to have taught school two or three years after this.\n\nMr. Nordstrom claims to be fifty-five years of age, has a grown-up family, and lives at Quatsino village.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of my reply to Mr. Neill's letter, and would kindly ask the Department to deal with the matter if approached by Mr. Neill at Ottawa, as I do not consider correspondence of this nature should be directed to this office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nIndian Affairs.

His Lordship advised me the Rev. Mr. Govier of Port Alice had been in communication with him in reference to Mr. Nordstrom's application and stated he was in favour of a local man being employed, however when he had learned of Mr. Nordstrom's qualifications he hardly felt Mr. Nordstrom was the man for the position.\n\nLater His Lordship recommended our present teacher for the position, which recommendation was forwarded the Department for their approval and under date of August 16th the Department advised me they had approved of Mr. Hill-Tout's nomination by the Bishop, at which time this office notified Mr. Hill-Tout to report for duty on September 3rd.\n\nIn my reply to Mr. Neill's letter dated August 10th written on August 14th, I mentioned Mr. Nordstrom's application was not found to have sufficient qualifications to warrant our School Inspector and the Church to recommend his appointment to the position. For the Department's confidential information, I quote from a letter received from Inspector Barry regarding the appointment of a teacher for the Quatsino Indian Day School as follows:\n\n\"With regard to a teacher, I may say that I have made the usual confidential investigation with regard to the candidate you mention, Mr. George Nordstrom. In confidence for your information and if necessary for the information of the Department of Indian Affairs in Ottawa, I may say that I could not possibly recommend that he be engaged even for one year as teacher at Quatsino. The only record that we could discover was that he had been granted a THIRD CLASS CERTIFICATE or PERMIT in 1901. This was before there was a Normal School in B.C. There is no record, as far as I could find that he has ever had any professional training either at a Normal School or at a Provincial Summer School. As his Permit does not appear to have ever been made permanent, I do not understand how he can have any certificate at the present time.\"\nIn addition I would draw your attention to the fact that this man was given his Temporary (?) Permit or Third Class Certificate in the year 1901 as shown on the records in the Department of Education. Even if he were only just out of High School then and there is nothing to show his age, he would be well over fifty now. I expect that you will find that he is older than this. Now, as you of course know quite well, a man of this age who has not been teaching for many years and whose original training is to say the least of it quite doubtful, would be quite useless to us in establishing a modern Indian Day School.\n\n\"There are a large number of teachers with First Class B.C. Certificates out of work and many of them are Anglicans with good Church recommendations. I would be most careful in making a recommendation to the Department that a teacher be appointed to your new school.\n\n\"I hope that you will consider this letter CONFIDENTIAL. I do not believe that it is any use whatever starting an Indian Day School at Utsalino if we are to appoint untrained and obviously quite unsuitable people to teach it.\"\n\nI am presuming in view of the above, that His Lordship Bishop Schofield could not conscientiously entertain Mr. Nordstrom's application, and it was through this that Mr. Nordstrom's application was not successful.\n\nThis is all the information which I have, and I would appreciate, if Mr. Neill calls upon the Department, that they endeavour to explain the matter satisfactorily to him. As far as this office was concerned it was a matter entirely in the Bishop's hands as far as the appointment was concerned, and I might add I did not know the present teacher until after the nomination was made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. S. (signature)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nMay 16th, 1936.\n\nDear Mr. Neill,\n\nTeacher Quatsino Indian School.\n\nIn compliance with your request I am enclosing herewith the copies of correspondence relating to this matter which you desired. The information contained in the copy of Mr. Todd's letter of May 11th is for whatever purpose you may require it. The Department has no objection to your using it for furnishing extracts for quotations in your correspondence with Mr. Nordstrom, but I would prefer that you do not furnish Mr. Nordstrom with the complete copy.\n\nRegarding the certificate held by Mr. Hill-Tout, the present teacher, I would say that he holds an interim first-class certificate, which means a certificate that will become permanent so soon as he completes the necessary period of teaching.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nA. W. Neill, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nTwo years ago the Department opened a new Day School at Quatsino for the Quatsino Band of Indians, and at that time I recommended and included in my Estimates sufficient funds to build a teacherage on this reserve, having in mind that a married man would be most suitable for this particular school and location. However this matter was left in abeyance as a single teacher was appointed and he was able to board in the white village of Quatsino.\n\nSince that time we have come to the conclusion it is very essential in the interests of this school and the Indians on this reserve that a married man be employed as teacher, and live on the reserve. I have recently been advised by our present teacher that he intends to resign at the end of the present school term, and I am herewith recommending to the Department that sufficient funds be provided in the 1937-38 Estimates for the purpose of building a teacherage on this reserve. There are no buildings available within reach of the school that could be used, and as the weather is very bad there it is impossible for the teacher to live any distance from the school.\n\nWe also feel the teacher's presence on the reserve is very desirable for many reasons, and I would appreciate if you would give this matter your consideration and approve of the recommendation.\n\nI would suggest that you discuss the matter with Mr. School Inspector Barry, as he is familiar with our difficulty there and can give you first-hand information as to our problems in that connection.\n\nI would request that fifteen hundred dollars be included in the Estimates for the erection of a teacherage, and would ask that it be included in the 1937-38 Estimates so that it may be built and ready for occupancy when the new school term opens on September 1st, 1937, and a new teacher is appointed to this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n(Ms. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nD.M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nVictoria, B.C.\nAlert Bay, B.C., December 10, 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nRecently we have experienced some difficulty with our Day School at Quatsino, and it was necessary for me to make a hurried trip there to have the matter straightened out, which I am pleased to advise the Department was cleared up satisfactorily.\n\nWhile there, the teacher informed me he intends to resign at the end of the present school year, and in view of his pending resignation and the difficulties we have experienced during the past two years through a teacher not living on the reserve, we are now making a report to the Department together with recommendations.\n\nThe Quatsino Band has never had very much done for them towards improving conditions at their village and when the Department established a school on this reserve it was my opinion if a married man could be employed to live on the reserve and make his home there, it would be a solution to our difficulty, and would do a great deal towards helping the Indians, not only from the school point of view but for other reasons as well. This tribe is very keen to respond to assistance, but although I have done everything I can during the past three years to assist them and encourage them, nevertheless it is very evident until they have someone to live on the reserve and set the example, we shall never get conditions on this reserve improved as they should be. I feel the only solution is to have a married man employed as teacher of the Day School to live on the reserve.\n\nI had hoped this could be done when the school was first established, and that the Department would build a teacherage on the reserve at that time, but as a single man was appointed who was able to obtain board at the white village about a mile distant, the matter of the teacherage was left in abeyance. However, now that the present teacher is resigning, and a new one will have to be appointed, I am bringing this matter to the Department's attention.\n\nI am therefore requesting the Department to include in my 1937-38 Estimates sufficient funds to build a small teacherage on this reserve, which could be built and ready for occupancy by September 1st next when the new school term opens. I feel fifteen hundred dollars would be sufficient although as this is an isolated location it will cost more to erect the building than it would elsewhere. It would be my intention to erect a small building of four rooms sufficiently large to accommodate a married man and his wife, and would be pleased to submit suitable plans if the Department so desired.\nI can see no other way out than to build a teacherage if we are to carry on at Quatsino satisfactorily and at the same time clear up our other problems which we are faced with, and I would appreciate if the Department would kindly include this in our Estimates.\n\nI have today taken the matter up with Mr. D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C. at Victoria, and enclose herewith copy of my letter to him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nKwawkewlth Agency,\n\nMonthly Report of M. S. Todd, Indian Agent,\nfor the month of December, 1936.\n\nOn December 3rd I received a wire from Mr. E. Hill-tout, teacher of the Quatsino Indian Day School, submitting his resignation, requesting that it take effect immediately. Upon receipt of this wire I communicated with him by long-distance telephone and advised him I would proceed there immediately to look into his difficulties. Upon arrival I discussed the matter with him and then held a meeting of all the Indians with their teacher present and it was found that one of the Chief's sons was giving considerable trouble to the teacher in school and when he was corrected by the teacher the Indians interfered. I was able to get their difficulties straightened out, the teacher withdrew his resignation, and school reopened the following morning. I do not think there will be any further trouble at this school from now on. I might add, however, the teacher advised me he intended to resign at the end of the present term and this matter has already been referred to the Department with a request that funds be provided for the erection of a teacherage in order that a married man and his family may be located on the reserve rather than have to depend on transportation to get to the school from the adjacent village some distance away.\n\nM. S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 23, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to the necessity for erecting a residence for the teacher of the Quatsino Indian Day School.\n\nOur Estimates for the next fiscal year have already been forwarded to the Treasury Board and it is not possible to include an item for this residence. At the present time, I cannot make any definite promise that funds can be secured from our appropriation for the next fiscal year.

A. Hill-Tout as teacher of the Quatsino Indian Day School to be effective on June 30, 1938.\n\nYou may communicate with Right Reverend H. E.

A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 5,\nVancouver, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am forwarding herewith copies of correspondence forwarded by Mr. Indian Agent Todd, Kwawkewlth Agency, in regard to the resignation of Mr. Edward A. Hill-Tout, at present teacher of the Quatsino Indian Day School.\n\nIt is assumed that Mr. Indian Agent Todd has already informed you of the resignation of this teacher, to take effect as from June 30th, 1938.\n\nWith regard to Mr. Todd's recommendations, as contained in his letter of February 19th, I may say that this matter has been discussed with Inspector Barry. He informs me that the Quatsino Indian Day School is administered under the auspices of the Anglican Church, Diocese of British Columbia, and that school is held in the Anglican Church building located on Quattishe Reserve No. 1. The teacher lives in Quatsino, which is a scattered village not far from the Indian Reserve, from which it is separated by a short stretch of water having strong tidal currents. The present Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of British Columbia is the Right Rev. H. E. Sexton, Victoria, B.C.\n\nI am further informed by Inspector Barry that, while it would no doubt be better to have a married and well-qualified man as teacher of the Quatsino Indian Day School, particularly if his wife were also qualified to give a certain amount of medical attention to the Indians of the Quattishe Reserve, the appointment of such persons would involve the erection of a suitable teacherage.\n\nWith reference to your letter No. 156-36-1, dated 29th January, 1937, I may say that a sum of $1500.00 was included by Mr. Indian Agent Todd in the Estimates for the fiscal year commencing April, 1938, to cover the cost\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nof the erection of such teacherage. Inspector Barry however points out that in a number of places in British Columbia, Indian Day Schools are far more urgently required either as replacements or to accommodate Indian children at present without education. He feels that, as the Quatsino Indian Day School is conducted in an Anglican Church building, which for the time being is satisfactory, the building of a teacherage at this point where we have no Departmentally-owned School would hardly be justified.\n\nI should like to have instructions from the Department with reference to the selection of a suitable teacher to succeed Mr. Edward A. Hill-Tout. In this connection, would suggest that it might possibly be best if the Rt. Rev. Bishop Sexton were requested to submit to this Office the names of one or two well-qualified teachers. After consultation with our Inspector of Indian Schools, I should then be in a position to recommend the appointment of a suitable person for the Quatsino Indian Day School, effective from 1st September, 1938.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

This location is somewhat isolated and I feel if it were possible to make such an arrangement it would be in the best interests of all concerned.\n\nWe have in this year's Estimates an amount of $1500.00 to build a teacherage and if you could find your way clear to appoint a married man and undertake to build this teacherage, I would be very glad to assist in any way I can.\n\nWould you please advise me your views and decision in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"M.S.

While the Missionary schools at Village Island, Kingcome Inlet, Quatsino and Smiths Inlet which were built by various Missions with assistance from the Department are in fair state of repair, they are difficult to administrate. I feel the Department should own these schools and have full administrative powers as the buildings are on reserves. I would recommend if and when funds are available the Department should purchase any equity the Missions may have in these buildings to avoid any future complications which may arise between the Indians and interested parties.\n\nM.S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nThe Quatsino Day School is being held in the Anglican Church built on the reserve in 1935, through arrangements made with the Church authorities.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI am just in receipt of Inspector Barry's reports on his recent inspection of several Indian Schools in this Agency, and it is regrettable that I find it necessary to correct misstatements he has made in his reports in respect to one or two schools.\n\nIt is noted in his report on the Quatsino Indian Day School on Page 2, second to the last paragraph, he states as follows:\n\n\"I am very sorry to learn from the teacher that two boys whose ages are a little over 15 years were expelled from the school on January 27th 1938 by the Indian Agent without any reference to me and without any report on the matter. These boys apparently refused to do their school work. These boys were Moses Johnny and Phil Johnson. The fact that boys can get out of going to school by refusing to either behave themselves or do their work is a very bad precedent here. I could have suggested a very different solution had I been consulted before definite action was taken.\"\n\nFirst let me say I did not expel these boys from school nor did I instruct the teacher to do so. On April 29th last I visited this school and asked the teacher if he made this statement to Captain Barry, and he told me he had not. I asked him what he did tell the Inspector, and he informed me he advised Inspector Barry he was having trouble with these two boys not attending school regularly and that when I had visited the school on or about January 27th last he had mentioned it to me that they were absent from school at that time but no action had been taken owing to the boys continually giving trouble in the school and that they were nearing the age of graduation.\n\nThe teacher also informed me he had mentioned to Captain Barry having similar trouble with the boys when the Inspector had made his previous inspection, but at that time the Inspector had offered no solution to the difficulty.\n\nInspector Barry's remarks are also noted in reference to accommodation for the new teacher. He states in the second paragraph of Page 3 that the teacher does not live in the village but has rooms in Quatsino and comes to the school daily in a small boat and also there would be no difficulty in finding a suitable place for a married man and his wife to live in Quatsino.\nFor the Department's information, the present teacher found it very difficult in going from the Quatsino white village to the reserve each day to hold school on account of the rough waters in that particular place, and later in order to be closer to the school has lived in a tent for over two years about half a mile from the school.\n\nIt is my contention and honest belief that the Department should erect a small teacherage on the reserve as the present teacher has found it impossible through storms to get to the school and some time has been lost through this.\n\nI agree with Captain Barry that a married man and his wife is what is needed at Quatsino. This village is one of the dirtiest and unkept in my whole Agency, and as these Indians have considerable money in their Capital and Interest Account which they intend to use for the improvement of the village, they need someone living there continuously to assist them and bring about better living and moral conditions. This is a great opportunity for the Department to help these Indians by putting a married man and his wife there in a small teacherage.\n\nI have asked in my Estimates for funds for three years to build a small teacherage, and while I am aware the Department do not own the school building nevertheless if a suitable married man was living in the village it would go a long way towards cleaning up the problem we have on our hands. Even if the school were closed in years to come, which I do not anticipate, it would pay the Department to build a teacherage there now and then give the building to the Indians if it was of no further use to us.\n\nI hope the Department will see their way clear to build this teacherage this year if a married man is appointed to this position. I can understand Captain Barry's views are only from an educational point of view and that he does not understand the many other angles which enter into recommendations I make in the matter of spending public funds.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.

To succeed her we have decided to appoint Mrs. Eileen Lillian McCorryston at a salary of $90.00 a teaching month. This school will only be in operation for an eight-month period; namely, from October 1, 1940, to May 31, 1941.\n\nCopy of letter of appointment is attached and staff questionnaire will be forwarded to you when received.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter 156-36-1 of the 25th of July in connection with the nomination of a teacher to succeed Mrs. H.M. Cuttle as teacher of the Quatsino Indian Day School, Rt. Rev. Bishop H. Sexton, D.D., Bishop of British Columbia, has nominated Mrs. Eileen Lillian McCorriston as teacher of the Quatsino School for the coming term, October 1, 1940, to May 31, 1941. Mrs. McCorriston, whose address is 268 East 5th St., North Vancouver, B.C., is a young married woman. Her husband is serving with the Canadian Active Service Force. She received her professional training at the Victoria Normal School, 1931-32, and has a First Class Interim Teachers Certificate in B.C.\n\nThere is, as the Department is no doubt aware, a very great shortage of qualified teachers in B.C. and it is almost impossible to find candidates for the vacancies still existing in the Indian Day Schools. Mrs. McCorriston is the daughter of Dr. Dunn of Massett and is a well-educated girl, having passed her Senior Matriculation in Prince Rupert in 1931. Her influence in the Quatsino Reserve would no doubt be extremely good. She wishes to teach as a war time activity during her husband's absence overseas.\n\nMrs. McCorriston is well known to Inspector Barry who considers that although she has not had much actual teaching experience in Provincial schools, she is the type of girl who ought to be quite successful at Quatsino. He suggests that the Departmental regulations with regard to the employment of married women be waived in this case under present war time conditions and lack of teachers but that the appointment, if made, be of a temporary nature.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nI would recommend that the nomination of the Rt. Rev. Bishop of British Columbia be accepted and that Mrs. E.L. McCorriston be given a temporary appointment as teacher of the Quatsino Indian Day School for the term October 1, 1940, to May 31, 1941. The Department has previously notified me that a salary of $90 per teaching month would be allowed at this school. I should be glad, however, to receive, by airmail, approval of the appointment of Mrs. McCorriston as recommended above and confirmation of the salary to be allowed her at the rate of $90.00 per teaching month.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nVancouver, B.C.,\nSept. 12, 1940.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nFederal Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI have pleasure in nominating Mrs. Eileen L. McCorriston of 268 East 5th St., North Vancouver, as the teacher for the Quatsino Indian Day School. Her qualifications for this position are already well-known to Captain Barry the Inspector of Indian Schools.\n\nAs Mrs. McCorriston is a married woman the nomination might not be regarded as being in order. Her husband is serving in the Canadian Active Service Force and in view of the dearth of teachers, I would strongly recommend that this nomination be accepted, it being understood that the appointment, if made, be of a temporary character.\n\nI am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHarold R.

Mrs. McCorriston is now teaching each Saturday and will continue to hold school on Saturday until the full number of days have been made up with the hope that the Department will approve of her request.\n\nI realize this is unusual procedure, but in view of the circumstances, which may be the last opportunity she will have to see her husband before he proceeds overseas, I would strongly recommend that the Department grant this request so that her holiday could start on December 13th next.\n\nI might add Mrs. McCorriston has so far been very successful in her work at Quatsino, and I would appreciate very much if the Department would do this for her as I am anxious to cooperate with her in every way possible.\n\nWould the Department kindly wire me advising if her request may be granted, as mail service to Quatsino is rather intermittent and she would like to make her plans in advance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S.

A report by myself to the Department on the Summer School will be made shortly as requested by Major Bell, MacKay Indian Commissioner.\n\nAs the Cape Mudge and Campbell River Day Schools are supposed to open on October 1st, I regret I cannot make any comment on these schools to date I have not been notified that teachers have been appointed. It is hoped the Department will do everything possible to get these particular schools opened as the children are in the villages and ready to attend. In respect to the Quatsino Indian Day School the same situation exists there as I have not been notified of any teacher being appointed; however in this particular school it is not quite so important as the pupils have not all returned to the village as yet.\n\nI am feeling rather upset in respect to Miss Uphill, teacher of the Campbell River School. In her case she was quite willing to remain there provided the Department gave her an increase in salary to cover her increased cost of accommodation, and personally I think she was entitled to it, but instead of giving her the increase, she was permitted to be transferred to the Namalno Day School at an increased salary, which resulted in the Campbell River School being left without a teacher and the necessity of breaking in a new one.\n\nM.S.

Sexton, D.D., Bishop of British Columbia, Victoria, B.C., has been asked to nominate a teacher to fill this vacancy, as stated in paragraph 2 of my letter 15/6/3802 of August 22, 1941.\n\nThere has been such a shortage of qualified teachers in British Columbia this year that so far the Rt.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa, August 22, 1944.\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE.\n\nRe: Quatsino Indian Day School,\nNo. 854.\n\nCommissioner MacKay has recommended\nthat the salary of the teacher be increased from\n$900.00 to $1,000.00 per annum, plus bonus, when\nan appointment is made. Major MacKay's letter\nis on FILE I-I-3 and is dated August 9, 1944.\nJune 25, 1949.\n\nMr. W.S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nQuatsino Indian Day School\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter, we are prepared to re-open this school. As you are probably aware, this school was closed in 1942 after operating for some seven years. At that time we were unable to secure a teacher.\n\nThe school desks and blackboards were provided in 1935 and should be in fairly good condition. We will anticipate receiving a school supply requisition for this school and would request that a priority slip be attached to the front so that we can rush it through the Printing Bureau.\n\nI would also suggest that Mr. Todd prepare a requisition for janitor supplies so that the school will be fully equipped by 1 September, 1949. We are requisitioning for a new register, report cards and a Monthly Day School Return pad. The Department is prepared to approve the appointment of Mrs. Mary Hawkes as teacher at this school on a temporary basis for the 1949-50 academic year. Would you please arrange to have her forward the usual documents. I am sending Employee Questionnaire forms and Oath of Allegiance and Oath of Office and Secrecy forms under separate cover for completion by this and other teachers as required. She would be classified as a Grade III teacher at a salary of $1,800.00 an academic year.\n\nBernard F.

The teacher, Mrs. Mary Hawkes, who has recently been appointed, is buying a small boat to enable her to travel back and forth daily. It is felt therefore that an allowance should be made to Mrs. Hawkes towards the rental of a teacherage, plus fuel allowance. It is recommended that a grant of \u00a325.00 a month be approved for this. The building will be furnished by the teacher.\n\nAn item will be included in the 1930-31 estimates for a teacherage on the reservation and should the attendance warrant the school's continued operation we will recommend the construction of this building.\n\nW.S.

Miss Earl has had long experience as a teacher, under the direction of the Department and the Church. The school will be conducted under the auspices of the United Church of Canada, who nominated the services of Miss Earl.\n\nAt the present time, the Department is not aware when the school will be completed and ready for occupation, but Miss Earl will take charge when the classroom is ready. I would request that you give her every assistance you can in her work at this school. The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $85.00 per teaching month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Yeatman as teacher of this school, at a salary of $100.00 a teaching month, plus bonus, effective January 1, 1945. I attach copy of letter to Indian Commissioner MacKay, approving her appointment.\n\nI also attach Cost-of-Living Bonus Form, T.D.l Form and War Savings Pledge, all completed by Mrs. Yeatman,\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\nOttawa, August 22, 1946.\n\nMemorandum\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Campbell River Indian Day School, No. 855.\n\nThis memorandum will cancel our memorandum of similar file dated June 6, 1946.

C.\n\nAttached please find tender received from Mr. Robert E. Yeatman of Campbell River, B. C., in connection with Campbell River Indian Day School Teachorage amounting to $237.60. It was the Department's intention to have the teachorage site cleared of stumps and second growth last year but due to our inability to obtain any one to do the work it was not done. The location was not cleared at the time the teachorage was built other than the needed spot where the building was located. I am recommending that this work be approved and Mr. Yeatman's tender of $84.00 be accepted.\n\nOn my last visit to Campbell River Mr. Yeatman informed me the teachorage was so cold last winter it was almost impossible to live in the building. Last year we insulated the ceiling of the teachorage, the front room and kitchen, but the walls of the bedroom, bathroom, front and hall were not undertaken. It is these rooms that is making the teachorage so cold. In addition to this it is necessary to build some cupboards which should have been provided when the teachorage was built. The painting of these rooms is also necessary.\n\nMr. Yeatman has offered to provide all the materials, paint and labour and complete this work for $153.60 and I am recommending that the work be approved and Mr. Yeatman's tender accepted.\n\nWhen this work is completed it will not be necessary to spend any more money on the interior of this teachorage for sometime as it should then be comfortable to live in. If funds are not available the amount of this tender $237.60 could be transferred from the Gilford Island Indian Day School appropriations.\n\n(M. S.

This decorating was to have been done last year but due to our inability to obtain labour the work was not done. As I am anxious that this decorating be done during the summer holidays I am recommending that approval be received so that we can get the work under way at an early date. Mr. Yeatman has informed me if his tender is accepted he can start immediately and have the work done and the school all in order before September 1st.\n\n(M.S.

(RG 1C, Volume 6418, file 855-5, part 2)\nTo Dr. Duncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt General of Indian Affairs, OTTAWA\n\nSir,- We, the undersigned chief and head men of the Wewiakim Band of Indians located at Campbell River B.C. beg respectfully to ask that your Dept establish an Indian day school at Campbell River for the education of our children.\n\nThere are 18 children of school age now either on the reserve or at a boarding school and there will be several more eligible next fall.\n\nOur reason for this request is that at present we have to send them to a boarding school at Chilliwack which is two days journey from here and a rather expensive trip. If our children get sick or die at school we have no chance to see them until it is too late. We do not know what goes on at a school so far away and have no chance to see our children except once or twice a year and after ten years our children are almost strangers to us.\n\nThe education of our children was guaranteed to us by the white Man's Govt. and we were not told that we had to lose our children during almost all their youth as they marry soon after leaving school. We were promised day schools adjacent to our reserves.\n\nIt is said that there is a day school at Cape Mudge which is only a few miles away but it is across water which is often dangerous for adults to cross let alone children.\n\nIt is said that day schools are not useful because the Indians move about so much. This is often the case but our women live here all the time and would keep up the home.\n\nThere are 80 of us all told in the band and a population of eighty white people always have a school and we have the same rights, have we not?\n\nPlease help us, Dr Scott.-\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\nPay to Gustav Miller, Esq.,\n\nAddress: General Blacksmithing, Etc.,\n\nCampbell River, B.C.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n|      | Emergency Expenditure |        |\n| 1942 Oct. 4 | To repairs to stove at the Campbell River | $8.00 |\n| Indian Day School |        |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 506\n\nVoucher No.: 168\n\nDate: 26th October 1942\n\nIndian Affairs.

I also arranged with the Chief to supply all the Indian labour they could in order that the erection of the school will be rushed and if possible, completed by November 1st next.\n\nI might add I purchased the lumber and building material from the Courtenay Builders Supply Company at Courtenay, B.C., and am arranging to purchase the hardware from McLennan, McFeeley & Prior, Ltd., at Vancouver, B.C. I bought the lumber personally and was able to use No.2 material for most of the dimensions, sheeting and roof boards as the No.2 grades of the people supplying this material are equal to No.1 grades elsewhere.\n\nIt was found necessary, owing to the necessity of having the building located in a certain position, to make a few alterations in the plan submitted by the Department. These changes however do not affect the size of the building, but rather re-arrange the plan a little.\n\nWe are doing our best to keep the cost of the building as low as possible and hope to have it completed by November 1st.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nSir,\n\nI am just in receipt of a letter from our Assistant Commissioner, Mr. C.C. Perry at Victoria, enclosing copy of a letter dated Ottawa, July 3rd, No. 156-7-8 in connection with the proposed Indian Day School at Campbell River, B.C.\n\nIt is noted the Department are requesting the Indians to donate a site of approximately one acre, and also request me to locate this site.\n\nIt appears to me we are not getting on very fast with the final arrangements for the erection of this school. A lot of correspondence and delay is taking place through matters being referred from this office to Mr. Perry, and from him back here again; I think either one of us should be appointed to look after the building of this school, it does not matter who, but the main thing is to get started on the building. Half of July is gone already and we only have six weeks left to complete the school if it is to be ready for the opening of the fall term, and unless we put it into one person's hands I cannot see how it is going to be ready for occupancy by September.\n\nA few days ago I visited the reserve and located a site but owing to the Indians all being away fishing it was impossible to get enough together to hold a meeting to get a resolution passed for them to donate this land for school purposes. I have, however, seen most of the Indians and they have agreed to do this and as soon as I can get them together a meeting will be called and a resolution taken to this effect. It will not be necessary to compensate anyone for the location which we decided upon.\n\nIf the Department will advise me when they have decided to let the contract to start the building, I will proceed to Campbell River and show the contractor the exact location and position where the school is to be erected. I will look after and arrange to have the land set aside for school purposes but this cannot be done until the Indians return from their fishing grounds. I would suggest the Department immediately decide on the school they intend to build, let it by contract, to be completed by the end of August at the latest. If there is anything I can do to assist the Department in hurrying it along, I will be pleased to do so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, July 9, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 15/6/40272 of the 25th ultimo, enclosing copy of a communication which you received from Mr. Agent Todd regarding a site for the proposed Indian day school at Campbell River, B.C.\n\nIn this connection it is noted that the Agent and the Indians chose a site about seven or eight hundred feet along the Spit road from the main entrance. It is considered that the Indians, by a resolution of their Council, should agree to set aside, without cost, approximately one acre as a site for the new school building. As the school will be in the interests of their children, they should consent to set aside the site. Mr. Todd should take this matter up with the Indians, and, if possible, obtain a resolution. It should be stated therein, as definitely as possible, the boundaries of the site set aside. If, however, there is an Indian located on the proposed site, it might be necessary to compensate him for his improvements, obtaining a Quit Claim Deed. It is considered that the Agent should be able to give a description of the site, i.e., width and depth, beginning at a well defined point. If it is necessary to pay for Indian improvements, the name of the locatee should be stated and a sufficient description of the boundaries of the land given. I shall be pleased if you will take this matter up with the Agent at once, as it is proposed to proceed with the building at an early date.\n\nThis school will be conducted under the auspices of the United Church of Canada, as the Department understands that this Bank are members of that Church. The Church authorities are considering the transfer of Miss Earl from her present position as teacher of the Kispiox Indian Day School to take charge of the Campbell River School when it is ready for occupation.\n\nRegarding plans and specifications for the new school building, you will be later advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary\n\nC. C. Ferry, Esq.,\nAssistant Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to refer to Departmental letter No. 156-7-5, dated May 20th, ultimo, in regard to the proposed Indian Day School building and site at Campbell River, B.C.\n\nI now beg to report that owing to the remoteness of this village from a convenient centre for obtaining supplies, I would recommend that the School be erected by contract.\n\nIn regard to the site, this has been tentatively chosen by arrangement between Agent Todd and the Indians. A copy of a letter dated June 21st received from the Agent is sent herewith and I would be glad to have the Department kindly refer to the concluding paragraph of my letter of 5th September, 1933, in which the matter of a site was referred to. I am anxious to avoid, if possible, the purchase of a site if we can get the Indians to allot a site for school purposes. A play-ground is not considered necessary as the area around the site is considerable. At the same time it is considered that some definite understanding should be had with the Indians and the Department's policy as to a School site of this kind determined so that no question may later arise either from Church or Indians as to the ownership of the site. Since the Department has not mentioned in its letter what are its wishes in regard to the method of acquiring the site, I consider it advisable to ascertain the views of the Department so that I may make suitable reply to the Agent's inquiries.\n\nThe blue-print mentioned by Agent Todd was not enclosed with his letter. In any event, those plans were for a school to accommodate a maximum of 20 children, while in the school to be erected accommodation for 25 children has been previously recommended. There is no specification on file here in connection with any plan. May I further ask if it is the intention of the Department to have its Architect prepare a plan and specification, or if not, am I authorized to obtain a suitable plan locally?\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, ONTARIO.\nI shall appreciate having the Department's further instructions.\n\nIt is presumed that the question of the denomination under which the proposed school is expected to function has been already decided upon by the Department and that a denominational teacher will likely be sought for the conduct of the School, which is the usual practice. No doubt, Departmental instructions will issue in due course on these matters.\n\nIt is deemed of importance to suggest that if this School is erected, the available children in the Village should not be drawn upon for any of the Residential Schools. This is mentioned since some recruiting has been previously done in this Village by the Office of Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, B. C.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C. Perry.\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B. C.\nDear Sir,\n\nAs requested in your letter No. 15/6/39867 dated May 29th, I have been to Campbell River and accompanied by the Indians, decided on the location for the new Indian Day School.\n\nThere were two sites available, in my opinion the one out on the Spit a short distance from their cemetery was the more suitable, but the Indians felt they wanted it centrally located so that the children would not have so far to go to school, and we finally compromised and chose a site about seven or eight hundred feet along the Spit Road from the main entrance. There is a well close by which could be used, and I feel this site will be quite satisfactory.\n\nYou state in your letter, \"With reference to the site, it is considered that the Indians should donate a site free of cost.\" We are not quite clear in regard to this and would appreciate if you would kindly advise the procedure to be followed in erecting a school on a reserve, whether it is necessary to have the site surveyed and a Surrender taken from the Indians so that the ownership of the property will remain with the Department and not with the Band concerned.\n\nYou requested to know my views as to whether the building should be erected by day labour or by contract; in view of the Indians now being away to the fishing grounds, and the necessity of having the school completed in time to start the new term on September 1st, I feel there is only one way to build the school and that is by contract. I am therefore enclosing the blueprint which Captain Barry very kindly gave me the last time I was in Victoria, and which I believe was used for the Indian Day School recently built near Victoria. I gather from the Department's letter you will be looking after this entirely, so I am enclosing these papers for your files.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"M.S.Todd.\"\nIndian Agent\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst. Commissioner for B.C.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nVictoria, B. C.\nMay 1st, 1935.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDR. MCGILL,\n\nThe Estimates for the current fiscal year provide the sum of $1,600 to erect a new school building on the Campbell River Indian Reserve, (No. II, Kwawkewlth Agency - Electoral District of Nanaimo) B.C.\n\nThe United Church authorities, under whose auspices the school will be conducted, as the Indians of the Band are members of that church, have been pressing for the erection of the school. It will be necessary to provide classroom accommodation for 24 children. This reserve is in a more or less organized centre, so that it would be unnecessary to provide living quarters for a teacher.\n\nI discussed this matter with Mr. C. C. Perry, Assistant Indian Commissioner, and he advised that the work in erecting the building be carried out by contract. It will be necessary to furnish a plan of the building. Mr. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools, states that he could obtain from the Provincial Department of Public Works plans and specifications of a one-roomed school, designed to accommodate the children on the reserve. I understand that the Architect prepared plans for a day school which was built on the Tsartlip reserve a few years ago, and these would be satisfactory for the school at Campbell River.\n\nIf a school is to be ready for classroom purposes at the beginning of the next school year, it will be necessary to have the contract for its erection let as soon as possible. I understand from Mr. Perry that the nearest firms who would be likely to tender for the erection of the building are at Nanaimo or Cumberland, the latter point being the nearest large centre to the proposed school.\n\nMight I suggest that Mr. Orr be requested to give early attention to the matter of the erection of the building.\nVictoria, B.C., Dec. 15, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith the report (No.3) of inspection of Kwawkewlth agency by Inspector Pragnell.\n\nCampbell River Reserve\n\nThe Department is considering the erection of an Indian Day school at Campbell River as recommended by the School Inspector and myself. See file No.156-7-1 in this connection.\n\nG. G. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nAs it is understood that Mr. E.G. Newnham, Acting Indian Agent at Alert Bay, Kwawkewlth Indian Agency, B.C., has recently written to the Department as well as having discussed with Doctor McGill the proposal to repair and put into use an old Indian house at Campbell River Reserve for Indian Day School purposes, I have the honor to transmit herewith a letter dated July 27th, 1931, addressed to the late Commissioner Ditchburn by Captain G. W. Barry, District Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia, in which he advocated the construction of a small building for which he had obtained plans and specifications. Such a building would cost in the neighborhood of one thousand dollars.\n\nA school of this type was constructed by the Department on the Tsartlip Reserve, Cowichan Agency, at a cost of about $1300.00 and is most satisfactory in every way in meeting the needs of a small community having approximately twenty pupils.\n\nI would recommend that the Department erect a slightly larger substantial new school on the Campbell River Reserve at a cost of about $1500.00 for the accommodation of approximately twenty-five (25) children. This Inspector Barry and I consider preferable to spending money on the repair of an old Indian house which we do not own and which might easily become a bone of contention later on through some whim or fancy of the Indian owner.\n\nI would advocate the acquisition also of a suitable site from the Band, if possible, for the purposes of the school. It may be possible, by negotiation, to acquire such a site at a reasonable price. If not, the Department could either expropriate a suitable site in the reserve or have the children sent to a residential school as an alternative in the event of any difficulty arising which is not at present foreseen.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nAugust 13, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Ditchburn:\n\nI have your 15/6/21888 of the 30th ultimo, with reference to a day school for the Campbell River Indian Band. There are no funds for the establishment of a school this year, but a note has been taken for next year's Estimates. I am so informing Mr. A. W. Neill, M. P., who is interested. You might let me know if a teacher's residence will be required at this point, so that the exact amount needed can be determined.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. S. Williams,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nBox 666,\nVictoria,\nB. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe-Indian Day School - Campbell River Band.\n\nFurther to my letter to you of the 21st instant referring to a petition received from A.W. Neill, Esq., M.P., from the Campbell River Indians asking that a Day School be built on their reserve, I beg to say I am now in receipt of a communication from Mr. Indian Agent Halliday pointing out that as a result of the census recently taken by him of the Indians of the Campbell River Band, it is shown that while there are 35 children on this reserve, 16 of this number are of ages ranging from 6 to 14 years of age. There are also a few children of 15 years and over who at present are attending the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School at Chilliwack. Agent Halliday and School Inspector Barry are both in favor of a Day School being established and in view of the fact that there is a sufficient number of children of school age to warrant a fair degree of attendance and also a considerable number coming up, I feel disposed to recommend that a school be established about the same size as that intended for the South Saanich Indians of the Cowichan Agency, the dimensions being 16' x 24'. The Architect of the Provincial Public Works Department has kindly furnished me with a stock plan used by the Educational Department in the construction of rural schools which cost in the vicinity of $1,000.00, and this would suit our purpose admirably for the future in cases of this kind. The dimensions can be increased according to the number of pupils to be taken care of.\n\nA copy of the Petition referred to by Mr. Neill is attached hereto for your information. Upon perusal of the signatories to this petition it was found that besides those from Campbell River there were names of a number of Indians from Cape Mudge, Comox and Salmon River but this point is not important, the main point being that there are sufficient children on Campbell River Indian Reserve to warrant the construction of a Day School for them as set out in the petition. It may not be possible to obtain funds for the construction of this school during the present fiscal year, but I am of the opinion that the matter should not be lost sight of in order that the needs of the Indians may be satisfied during the next fiscal year.\n\nI am also forwarding a copy of Agent Halliday's list of children on the Campbell River Reserve who are not at present being educated.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nW.B. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nOn a recent visit to Campbell River, the teacher of the Indian Day School on that Reserve pointed out to me the unsafe condition of the school stove. Upon examination it was found that the lining was completely gone, and unless immediate repairs were affected a fire hazard would be created and further use of the stove would result in irreparable damage.\n\nI therefore instructed Mrs. Yeatman to make arrangements to have the stove repaired and eliminate if possible the necessity of the purchase of a new stove this year. She has now had the work done, and reports that the stove is in first-class condition.\n\nVoucher No.165 is herewith enclosed covering the cost of this work at a price of $8.00, which I consider is reasonable, and would recommend that the same be paid by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.

Greatman\nTeacher\nAlert Bay, B.C., June 8th, 1944.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Canada.\n\nFor two (2) years I have made provision in my estimates for the re-decorating of the Campbell River Indian Day School, but owing to the shortage of labour and our inability to get someone to do this work, it was not possible to have it done. The labour situation is still acute.\n\nLast winter while visiting the Campbell River school, Miss Hill, teacher, informed me she thought that she could get an Indian lady to wash the ceiling and walls; in fact, everything in the building, and if this were done it would make it possible for us to carry on for another year without having the building painted.\n\nThe building was built in 1935 and there has never been any decorating done since, with the result that it was filthy and not healthy for the children. When Miss Hill informed me of the availability of an Indian lady, I examined the walls and found the paint was in good shape, and that if we could wash the interior thoroughly, the school would be nice and clean.\n\nI, therefore, took it upon myself and instructed Miss Hill to obtain the services of an Indian lady to have this work done and asked her to supervise the job. This was a large undertaking and meant scaffolding in order to reach the high ceiling. I told Miss Hill that the department would pay Twenty-Five Dollars ($25.00) to any Indian lady who would make a good job of it.\n\np.t.o.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**TREASURY ONLY**\n\nPay to: **Mrs. Tommy Price, Jr.**\n\nAddress: **Campbell River, B.C.**\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| 1944 | May 31 | To contract washing interior walls and ceiling Campbell River Indian Day School | $25.00 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

C., Department of Mines and Resources, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nThis is to acknowledge receipt of your letter of April 14th last, file #215-6-109, enclosing Inspector Morrison's Report on Campbell River Indian Day School.\n\nFor your information, requisition covering the supplies recommended by Inspector G. H. Gower was forwarded Ottawa, and a portion of the requisition was authorized by Ottawa for local purchase and was supplied so far as it was possible to obtain. There were some items which could not be purchased as they were not available. Just what Ottawa shipped direct, if any, this office is not aware of, as we are never advised. Notice of Shipment is sent direct to the teacher for her signature, and she in turn mails it direct to Ottawa, and we never get to know just what has been supplied on the requisition until I visit the school and check up with the teacher. In my opinion, a copy of the Notice of Shipment should be forwarded to this office so that we could have a record of what has been supplied direct from Ottawa.\n\nUpon checking up our file I find, due to the change of teachers at the end of November, 1944, Mrs. Waywell did not purchase locally some articles authorized by the Department, and due to this office being so busy, it escaped our notice that this was not done. However, I am writing to Mrs. Yeatman today and requesting her to forward a further requisition covering the supplies she needs, and at the same time requesting a list of the goods which have already been received.\n\nThis office has done everything possible to supply the materials recommended by the School Inspector. Requisitions were forwarded Ottawa and I am sure Ottawa approved of everything they felt was necessary.

Yeatman of Quathiaski Cove, B.C., which will be self-explanatory.\n\nAs the interior and exterior of this building require decorating and as we have at last found someone who will do the work, I would recommend that the Department approve of this at an early date, as Mr. Yeatman informs me he must take advantage of dry weather and wishes to have it finished shortly after July 15th, as he has other work to do after that date. It will, therefore, be necessary to have the Department wire me at once if they approve, so that I can instruct him to proceed with the work, otherwise he will not be able to do it.\n\nI consider the price asked is exceptionally good when the building is to receive two coats inside and out.\n\nIf we miss this opportunity to have it done now, I can give no assurance when I will be able to find anyone else to undertake the work.

Yeatman covering the supply of materials and labour required to paint the interior and exterior of the Campbell River Indian Day School building and the outbuildings at a cost of $214.00. It will be noted that Mr. Yeatman, if given the contract, is anxious to proceed with the work at once as he has other employment in view after July 15th, in view of which it is recommended that the Department advise Mr. Todd by airmail if funds are available for painting this school. An amount of $100.00 is provided in the estimates for this particular project, and as the question of painting this building has been the subject of comment by the School Inspector it is recommended that Mr. Todd be authorized to have the work done.\n\nI may say that I am writing to the Agent pointing out to him that he has given us very little time to deal with this matter as his letter was not received at this office until July 3rd.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\nIndian Commissioner for B. C., Department of Mines and Resources, Vancouver, B.

Yeatman of Quathiaski Cove, B. C., which will be self-explanatory.\n\nAs the interior and exterior of this building require decorating and as we have at last found someone who will do the work, I would recommend that the Department approve of this at an early date, as Mr. Yeatman informs me he must take advantage of dry weather and wishes to have it finished shortly after July 15th, as he has other work to do after that date. It will, therefore, be necessary to have the Department wire me at once if they approve, so that I can instruct him to proceed with the work, otherwise he will not be able to do it.\n\nI consider the price asked is exceptionally good when the building is to receive two coats inside and out.\n\nIf we miss this opportunity to have it done now, I can give no assurance when I will be able to find anyone else to undertake the work. I, therefore, again request the Department to communicate with me by wire, as I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to get this work done.\n\n(M. S.

(RG 10, Volume 6418, file 855-5, part 2)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nEarly this year/office advised the Department it was necessary to install a circulating oil heater in the Campbell River Indian Day School due to the fact that we were unable to get wood, and that the wood-burning heater was no longer safe.\n\nIn the Department's letter dated July 4th last, file #156-7-5 (WT1), they requested information regarding type required and its approximate cost. Following this, Commissioner MacKey in his letter dated July 25th last, file #6-11-4, requested to know if we could buy a suitable heater locally, and if so, to forward quotations so that the necessary Purchasing Order could be issued. The Commissioner further stated that if we were unable to buy one locally to advise him and they would endeavour to secure one in Vancouver.\n\nRecently while in Vancouver I was informed that they were unable to buy one in Vancouver. At that time the B.C. Packers Ltd., Quathiaski Cove, wired me they could supply a stove but required immediate reply. As we had made arrangements with the oil company to obtain necessary stove oil, and as it was necessary to give them an immediate reply without forwarding it to Ottawa or the Commissioner's Office, I instructed them to supply this stove and have it installed in the Campbell River Indian Day School; as they were without heat due to the old stove having collapsed.\n\nI attach hereto voucher #553 covering this purchase and recommend that it be paid. I might add this stove is of the larger type required for a school and is giving perfect satisfaction.\n\nEncs.\n\nIndian Agent.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, November 29, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M.

Last year we purchased an HH-50 Norge Oil Heater for the Cape Mudge School at an approximate price of $125.00. This heater is proving very satisfactory and has overcome our difficulty with fuel.\n\nI should like to supply the same type of stove for Campbell River School. It is very difficult for teachers to have a fuel problem when they live so far from the Agency, and I would like to install an oil burner here. If you would please advise me I will arrange to purchase a circulating oil heater at an approximate cost of $125.00.\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 4th, 1947.\n\nMr. M.S.

On the basis of enrolment, the contribution required from the Department towards the capital cost of buildings and equipment will be $18,700.00.\n\nIn the case of the Provincial school being erected on Quadra Island, twenty-three Indian children can be enrolled and on the basis of enrolment, the contribution required from the Department towards the capital cost of buildings and equipment will be approximately $30,000.00.\n\nMr. Davey has covered the matter fully in his memorandum and there would appear to be no need to enlarge on the subject at this time.\n\nIn a letter to you of even date with regard to our school building program, I have suggested that some priority should be given in the allotment of available funds to\ncontributions towards the capital cost of Provincial schools, particularly Campbell River and Quadra Island.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\n- WW\nEncl.\nOttawa, July 12, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nCampbell River Indian Day School.\nCape Mudge Indian Day School.\n\nIn accordance with the recommendation of the Joint Parliamentary Committee that Indian children, wherever possible, be educated in association with other children, our field officials have been carrying on negotiations with various provincial departments of education.\n\nThese talks have been particularly successful in British Columbia where we have our own School Inspector. Mr. Davey, a former provincial department of education official, has been able to make considerable progress in having Indian children admitted to provincial schools. The total of such children now enrolled in these schools has risen to 456.\n\nFor some time Inspector Davey has been in discussion with the Campbell River School District concerning the two new provincial schools being erected at Campbell River and on Quadra Island (near the Cape Mudge Reserve). Please find attached a complete memorandum from him, clearly outlining the situation at each of these schools insofar as it concerns the Indian children who might be educated in them. As these are children of the United Church faith, there will be no objection from local missionaries to the proposals outlined by Inspector Davey. A summary of his suggestions is as follows:\n\n(a) Campbell River - size of school 21 rooms including library, home economics and industrial arts.\n\nCost of school - $485,599 plus 6% architect's fees and $61,961 equipment.\nWhite enrolment - 489\nIndian enrolment - 17\n\nEstimated contribution from Indian Affairs\nBased on basis of enrolment - $16,700.\n\n(b) Cape Mudge (Quadra Island Provincial School) -\n\nSize of school & rooms (Superior)\n\nCost of school, anticipated $26,310\nand equipment at $11,834.\n\nTransportation - one mile walk to bus and\n5 mile trip by bus.\n\nWhite enrolment - 72\nIndian enrolment - 23\n\nEstimated contribution from Indian Affairs\nBased on basis of enrolment - $30,000.\n\nYou will note Inspector Davy recommends that we\ncontinue both our small one-room schools as primary and kindergarten\nrooms. I concur in his recommendation as too often the first two\nyears of school are taken up with teaching these Indian children\nto speak English. Mr. Indian Commissioner Arnell has recommended\nthat the Department make a contribution towards the capital costs\nof provincial schools at both Campbell River and Quadra Island.\nI concur in his recommendation and would request that we be\nauthorized to prepare an agreement to be entered into with the\nCampbell River School District, along similar lines to the draft\nagreement attached hereto.\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Director.\nJuly 19, 1949.\n\nMr. W.S.
