E. Feeney of Montreal. It is an able and excellent exposition of the feelings of Canadians with respect to annexation or commercial union, and a severe rebuke to a certain class of Canadian and American politicians and abolitionists by the \"Liberals\" there he boldly asserted his loyalty to his country and characterized with the most profound contempt... The \"professors who claim his patriotism in the North or South as a \"political privilege who would make him a change of card, and all these who would get their political crimes at starvation; endure him whose fingers are touched at the mouth and power by a shower of their existence.\" Let those who are disposed to sneer at loyalty to Canadian institutions be silent. Heir speech will mark him utterly useless and undermine the best power.\n\nThe interesting part of Prince Albert will be very soon called upon to select a mayor and council to look after their interests during the new year, and it is but natural to suppose that some at least of those who may sit in the council a body will offer themselves for election. Now that their term of office is drawing to a close it would be well for them to give an account of their stewardship before again asking for the confidence of the people. We hereby take up three prominent members of the town council into our columns by pledging their votes. The councils of 1883 may have been as good as any others we have had, but can we not evolve something better? If so we shall vote there ourselves. We do not wish to criticize the actions of any of the members at present but will do so when the proper time arrives. There is a possibility now that we shall be called upon to elect a municipal body to take up some military company and an such an event it would be well for the town to have its best men looking after the interests of the municipality.\n\nWe have received from Mr. John Lovell who celebrated Montreal publisher's first paper his \"Ch\u00e2teau Park and Hudson Bay Company's In course of publication. The book will be published in 19 volumes and will give a complete history of each of the Provinces and the North West Territories, giving an accurate list of facts, statistics with regard to population, education, industries and manufacturers: there will also be issued a separate top of each Part which will be sold. It will be in publication during 1885 and will contribute the outside world to be aware of the wealth and importance of our Dominion. Mr. Lovell is a man eminently qualified for the task he has undertaken, and we have much pleasure in recommending his enterprise to the favorable consideration of our own readers. The work will cost $15 per volume, the contents may be had for from $250 to $50 per volume: the volumes treating of Manitoba and the North-West will cost $50 each. Read in your clubs and to others who want to read. That work is the publication of the volume, which will have relations for sale. We wish Mr. Lovell every success in his gigantic enterprise.\n\nMr. Plaxton voted against minor exactions required by law allowing the benefit fees for billiard licenses within the limits of the province. This Assembly offers very promising things over the morning of the session, \"Legislature,\" General Court of Council\u2014where they appear to be wasting a good deal of time over it and to me it was as it had been when such things had better been considered, and that the Ordinances will not be left in the moulded up state in which some of them hitherto have been.\n\nOn the liquor question Mr. Betts and Capt. Haye voted for high license, while the other members from the town voted against it. The result of the debate on the subject appeared to be that the Assembly will request the Dominion Government to take a vote of the provincial divisions for and against the traffic in spirituous liquors. So far as we understand it appeared will indicate now that all parties will submit to the results of public vote by districts, but not a vote of the Territorials as a whole.\n\nGO TO\n\nAGNEWS FOR\n\nStoves\nStoves\nHeating Drums\nStovepipe\nCoal Oil\nT.J.AGNEW\nW.STOBART & Co\nIndian Traders\nGeneral Merchants\n\nCampbell's Cathartic Compound\n\nNEW\n\nJ.McDOUGALLS\n\nBAKERY\n\nH.MACDOUGALL\n\nCONFECTIONERY\n\nAny MAN\n\nWEAR, SERVICES, RELIABILITY,\nNEW SELECTION OF FLANNEL AND SUSPENDERS\nSIZZLING AND REPELS COLD WEATHER, KEEPING\nHEADACHE BACK ACE, WARMER, BASEBALL SUITS\nLEATHER INSULATED SOLES TOE, HHITTON'S FOR DRESS AND WORKBOOTS\nBERLINER'S FOR EVERY OCCASION\nDELICIOUS DISPLAY ON PLACE\n\nREMIDUARY GROWTH OF WHAT\nPARTS! \n\nPLINTHED FROM LEGENDARY DOORSTEP REJECTIONS\n\nDUNN'S BAKING POWDER\n\nTHE BEST Friend\n\nCAMPBELL'S\n\nTOBIC EXOR\n\nElvis\n\nCampbell's Cathartic Compound Every man should provide himself with a bottle of Campbell's Cathartic Compound for the use of colds and stomach trouble.

ANDREWS' DAY.\n\nThe 3rd November being the day appointed by Scripture in honor of its patron saint, was celebrated by a grand ball under the auspices of St. Andrew's Society. The ball took place Friday night at the fourth annual assembly of the society and was most successfully attended by a large number of guests. The trustees of the Nobel Academy very kindly placed the new academy building at their disposal for the occasion, and that, in a great measure, contributed to the success of the entertainments held in both hall and the concert-room. Great regret has been expressed that the hall has been deprived of the equipment afforded by the ball, there not being any other suitable hall in town fitted out to hold a public entertainment of the kind. As it was there was ample accommodation for the guests present, but owing to the absence of the hall room, very few were present; the hall room was very tastefully decorated and all arrangements were conducted to the greatest satisfaction.\n\nA Dead Drop!\n\nPRICES\n\nJ.

The attendance was not so large as that last year, but there was plenty of room for improvement. It is very surprising that an institution like this, which is entirely devoted to farming interests and gives the farmers a chance to see what is being done at home and abroad, should be paid altogether on the same basis as most fairs. The farmers who attend these meetings are doing their best to improve their farms, and they should be encouraged to do so.\n\nThe secretary read the minutes of the last meeting of the directors which were approved of.\n\nThe report of the auditor was next called for and a verbal report was given.\n\nAs the prizes and other accounts for 1888 had not all been paid the treasurer could not give a full report. However, it was ordered that a full report be given at the next general meeting.\n\nThe next order of business was the election of officers for the coming year. The Rev. Dr. Jackson and W. H. Miller were appointed secretaries.\n\nFor president, Mr. James McKay, Col. Spratt, Capt. Wm. Miller were nominated and on the ballot being taken and counted Col. Spratt was found to have the most votes and he was elected president.\n\nThere were four nominations for vice-president and the choice fell on Mr. A. Spencer. For 2nd vice-president there were three nominations but Mr. E. Pritchard had the most votes.\n\nThe choice of Sec. Treasurer fell on the Rev. John H. Howard.\n\nThe new executive officers were:\n\nPresident\u2014Col. Spratt\nVice-President\u2014Mr. Spencer\nTreasurer\u2014Rev. H.

The game was presented by Mr. Macdonald, M.P., brother of our members, which resulted in a victory for the Old Countrymen by two points.\n\nThe weather was promising three years ago and had to be won three years in succession before obtaining the coveted cup.\n\nThe Curling Club had won several times and were almost sure of doing so again this year, but yesterday was a bad day for curling as the snow was very deep.\n\nThe following are the scores:\n\nOld Countrymen\u2014Canada\u201413\nBaker\u2014Glen\u201412\nStewart\u2014Sutherland\u201411\nMcTaggart\u2014MacKay\u201410\nCampbell\u2014Sutherland\u20149\nMajority for Old Countrymen\u201413\n\nT.T.T.
