R.A. Lett of St. George's Industrial School, Lytton, B.C., on a net cash basis, we were advised some time ago that this account had been approved for payment, and that we should receive a cheque in the near future.\n\nWhen we were requested to quote prices on a net cash basis, we presumed that the party from whom we received the order would pay for these goods on the cash basis. Later we were asked to send our account to the Government for settlement. Therefore, instead of purchasing the goods on a cash basis, the terms basis should have applied, which is a higher price.\n\nInasmuch as there has been this misunderstanding through no fault of ours, we specially request that you give this matter your attention upon receipt of this letter.\n\nThanking you, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nKYDD BROS.\n\n[Signature]\n\nHPK/DB\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6464, file 888-5, part 1)\nSt. George's Indian Residential School\nSupported by the New England Company\n(The oldest English Missionary Society, founded 1649)\n\nMr. Graham\nIndian Agent\nLyton.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nI have been leaving off our Ice proposition as long I fear as I dare, in hopes that the weather might turn somewhat colder and we would be able to harvest our ice on the river as we have heretofore been able to do.\n\nThis has thus far been a very mild winter having had a maximum of only fourteen or fifteen degrees of frost, and we cannot get Ice within five hundred miles, and to pay for the cutting and freight on fifty tons would run us into a bill of approximately four hundred dollars. This is rather a heavy bill for us to handle with our finances at such a low ebb and must ask you to approach the Dept. to see if they would undertake this expenditure for us as we cannot do without some means of keeping our meat and other perishable foods.\n\nI would like to suggest an alternative, which is that the Dept. add to the above amt. four hundred dollars with which to install a Celco Freezing system. These I believe are giving satisfaction and can be run at a maximum cost of seven and one half dollars per month. This would not only do away with the worry of waiting on the weather but would also save us a round sum even though we were able to harvest our ice at the greatest possible convenience. The plant could also be transferred to the new school when built at a very small cost.\n\nI hesitate to go to you at this time but it is a necessity that we cannot very well avoid.\n\nYours very sincerely\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nSir,\u2014 \n\nI herewith beg to enclose financial report for January, 1926, from St. George's Industrial School, which I trust will be found in order.\n\nI am also enclosing a letter from the principal concerning ice. This is a very important matter, and there seems to be no prospect of cutting any ice anywhere round this neighborhood this winter.\n\nTrusting the Department will give its early attention to this matter,\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6464, file 888-5, part 1)\nOttawa, February 12, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 3-06 of the 5th instant, enclosing a communication from the Rev.

One Half-Horsepower Compressor with two of the V.P. L Coils may be used to refrigerate a big unit up to 150 cubic feet, while combinations of this compressor and smaller coils may be used to refrigerate even smaller units.\n\nThe Line of Frigidaire Ice Cream Cabinets\n\nFrigidaire Ice Cream Cabinets are equipped with either the four-hole or six-hole ice cream compressor, meeting all requirements of city, suburban or rural installations.\n\nWhere more than one cabinet is required, the four-hole or six-hole cabinets may be used with a single Half-Horsepower Compressor.\nComplete Frigidaire Units\u2014Cabinet and Mechanism Combined\n\nModel B-5-2 Frigidaire\n\nThis is a complete cabinet model Frigidaire, in which a single cylinder air-cooled mechanism is built into the cabinet.

This institution has to generate its own electric current, and I am not satisfied that such equipment would be suitable. The matter, however, is now under consideration, and your quotation will not be overlooked.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nBruce Robinson Electric,\n544 Howe St.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa, March 26, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to my letter of the 12th ultimo, I have to inform you that the Department has received literature from the Bruce Robinson Electric Co., of Vancouver. It is extremely doubtful whether any type of electric refrigeration is suitable when the school has to generate its own current. I am writing to suggest that you enquire concerning the possibility of securing a carload of ice, which should be stored in the school. If this commends itself to you, please let me have a recommendation, with an estimate of the cost, by telegram, if dispatch is necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

D. McLean\nYour #165-0-5 March 26/25\nRe Frigidaire Iceless Refrigeration Lytton Industrial School.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nBefore recommending this equipment to Mr. Lett, the Superintendent of your school, we very carefully considered the question of your supply of Electrical Current. In a few words, Mr. McLean, here is the situation.\n\nYour Delco-Light plant has a generating capacity of from 2\u00bd to 3 kw, in addition to a heavy duty Storage Battery, which forms part of this equipment. In all, you have an equipment capable of handling an active load of 4000 watts during the average twenty-four hours.\n\nThe Frigidaire equipment proposed requires a 1/2 HP Motor. This motor in turn requires some 375 watts only of current on its starting torc, using considerably less current to carry the load of the compressor to which it is connected.\n\nWe do not hesitate in recommending this equipment for another reason, namely your Frigidaire equipment would be most active during the day, at which time very little current is being used from your plant.\n\nAfter again considering this equipment from every angle we still feel justified in recommending Frigidaire for the Lytton school, believing it will be a very satisfactory and efficient means of saving food supplies and also in protecting the health of the children.\n\nWe trust the points on which we have touched but lightly in this letter will induce you to accept our recommendation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBRUCE ROBINSON ELECTRIC\nManager\n\nTHERE'S A SATISFIED USER NEAR YOU\nSir,\n\nI have departmental letter dated March 26, re the proposed refrigerating plant for St. George's Industrial School.\n\nI wrote to the Delco Light Company, as this company is the Agent for the Bruce Robinson Electric Company, and am just in receipt of a reply, together with a copy of one sent to you, which will explain itself.\n\nI have talked the matter over with the Rev. Mr. Lett, principal of the school, and he states that he has made enquiries for ice and there is none to be had inside the Province, excepting artificially made ice, which would amount to as much as the plant would by the time we got it here.\n\nI might state that the same refrigerating plant is being installed in this town for the butcher shop, and in other small towns in the interior, and is proving a great success, so we can see no reason at all why it should not be successful at the school. This plant can be moved into the new school when it is erected, so it will not be lost.\n\nTrusting the Department will give this favorable consideration,\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssist. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 13, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your l-06 of the 5th instant, concerning a refrigerating plant for the Lytton Indian Residential School. The Department has examined this and similar schemes on several occasions, and I regret that we cannot favourably consider the installation of an electric refrigerating system at a school which has to generate its own power.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\nDear Mr. Scott;\n\nRe The possible numbers we would be able to secure for the New School. I am confident I should be able in the two agencies Lytton & Kamloops, without taking into consideration the north where we should be able to recruit a number, one hundred & fifty children. I have talked this matter over with Mr. Indian Agent Graham & he is of the same opinion regarding the above mentioned Agencies. Mr. Inspector Cairns in stating his opinion said that the building should be built to accommodate two hundred. I am writing Mr. Cairns & will ask him to give you his viewpoint.\n\nAccommodation for the following members of staff would have to be provided:\n\n- Three Teachers possibly four\n- Five Matrons\n- Caretaker & Farm hand\n\nIt would be well to take into consideration two or three extra rooms for additional staff if circumstances arose warranting same. These rooms would have to be placed in positions where supervision could be easily given. The numbers would be divided about evenly between boys & girls.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL\nOttawa, January 10, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 2nd instant, with reference to the accommodation that will be required in the new Indian residential school at Lytton.

I note that you recommend two plants, one a three K. W. and one six K. W., both automatic.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a blue print copy of the basement of the building, and you will note that I have left unfinished on my tracing the portion to be occupied by the electric lighting plant, and I can, therefore, arrange it to the size required. I may say that I believe that the only way to get the best results is by close co-operation with the manufacturers of the equipment used. I would be grateful if you would mark to a scale on the enclosed blue print, and return it to me, all of the equipment required, including the generators, switch board, tanks, etc. I would like this information as accurate as possible, in order that I can plot same on my tracings.\n\nI agree with you that it is much better to operate the laundry machinery direct from the engine and not by means of motors. You might also indicate in the room to be used for the lighting plant the best location for the windows, also if you wish any ventilation installed.\nYou will note that I have outlined this room in pencil 20 x14. If possible to make it smaller it would be advisable, but I do not wish to cramp the machinery. There will be no pump required in this school, and this room will be used entirely to house the electric lighting equipment. I would also be obliged if you would furnish me with a full detailed specification for the entire lighting plant, in order that I may include same in my specification for the building.\n\nYou will notice by the blue print that it is intended to construct only a portion of the building this year, and the three K. W. generator will be more than ample to provide all the lighting required. I wish, however, to show and include both generators complete, but I will make a note in my specifications that only the three K. W. generator is to be installed at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. GURNEY ORR,\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nR. A. LISTER & CO.,\nWALL ST.,\nWINNIPEG, Man.\nR. A.

Guerney Orr,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nWe have your esteemed letter to hand of the 5th, with a rough plan attached for an Indian Residential School in B.C., stating that your building will require an 8K.W. plant. We believe, in buildings that would require a plant of this size that the parallel lighting equipment which we supplied for Cardston and Edmonton, is the best thing which we can offer you as these plants are working out very satisfactory.\n\nA detailed description of these plants, we believe, might be in order and might say they consist of the following;-\n\nTwo plants, one a 3K.W. and one a 6K.W. both automatic in starting and stopping, working as follows;-\n\nWhen the small lighting load first comes on the 3K.W. plant starts up and carries the load up to 90% of its capacity. At this point the 6K.W. plant starts up and takes over the load and the 3K.W. stops when the 6K.W. plant has reached full load. The 3K.W. starts up again and they both work in parallel, carrying their load to the maximum limit. When the load is decreased to the point where the 6K.W. can handle it, the 3K.W. stops and when the load is further reduced to the point where the 3K.W. can handle it, it starts up and takes over the load, allowing the 6K.W. to stop and it continues to carry the load until it is reduced to minimum when it also stops. This feature is very economical as the small plant only runs a large portion of the time.\n\nFurther automatic features is incorporated in this system, that if at any time the small plant ceases to function, the larger one automatically starts and takes over the load, thereby safe-guarding the batteries.\n\nThis plant is equipped with a battery of 54 cells of 85 A.H. capacity on the 8 hour rating which is of adequate size to carry the required number of lights up to a point where it will be more economical for the plant to start up and take over the load.\n\nWe wish to point out that these features are absolutely automatic, requiring no manual attention in transferring the load from one plant to the other in any way. All the attendant has to do is to look after his lubricating oil, fuel and cooling water.\nMr. R. Guerney Orr, (continued) --- 2 ---\n\nYou ask what our recommendation is in the driving of a Laundry and might say we will not consider putting our plants up against a motor driven load for this work. We have found in every instance where we have done your work that the handling of a laundry machine is in the hand of inexperienced persons and if an electric motor were used for this work there would be times when the motor would be driven off the battery instead of having the plant running to supply the necessary current. This discharge for a 3H.P. motor taken from the battery until the plants got started, would eventually ruin the battery and on every laundry drive which we have hooked our engines up to, 3H.P. has not been adequate to drive them.\n\nWe might say the Edmonton Laundry, when in operation, takes from 5 to 5\u00bdH.P. Our other reason for preferring mechanical drive from the engine is that when the laundry is running, the engine can be used at the same time to give the required overcharge to the battery, thereby doing both these jobs at one time and safeguarding your battery instead of taking the discharge from it.\n\nWe have been handicapped on the most of our jobs by making our machines fit the room and the line shaft drive and the opportunity which you are now giving us to place our space requirements before you is very acceptable. In the engine room shown on the plan which you sent us a line shaft will be running parallel with the long way of the laundry and will be running parallel with the short way of the engine room. This means that we have to place our plants then one behind the other which makes a more expensive installation and consequently is more costly to the department as it takes more piping and fittings, etc. If the engine room were placed the long way the same as the laundry, then our plants would be put end to end, making a cheaper method of installation and a belt would go from the pulley on the engine straight up to the pulley on the line shaft, instead of on the slant, thereby obstructing the movements of the operator around the machine. To make this a little clearer, we are making a drawing showing what we consider an ideal arrangement for this type of plant. However, on the other hand this might not suit your building requirements and we want to co-operate with you making any alterations which you would prefer and any suggestions we can offer we will be glad to do so and trust to hear from you further in reference to this. The dimensions of the engine room especially if a pump is to be located in the engine room requires to be 20 feet long by 14 or 15 feet wide.\n\nTrusting that we have made this matter clear to you, we are,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nR.A.

I would greatly appreciate it if you would instruct one of your officers in this locality to visit the site of the proposed new building, and furnish me with a report and plan for a septic tank and drainage system.\n\nRegarding the water supply system for the building there is located to the rear of the proposed site, at a considerable elevation, a running spring, and it is proposed to use the water from this spring to supply the building. Two years ago when we were erecting a new barn at this point a six inch pipe was laid from the spring to the barn, and it is thought that this pipe can be tapped in order to provide water for the building. It will be necessary to construct a concrete reservoir at the source of supply, and I would be glad if your engineer would furnish a plan of the reservoir, and advise me the elevation of the spring above the level of the building site.\n\nThe principal of the Lytton School is the Rev. Mr. Lett, and he will be glad to co-operate with your officers in giving them any information that will assist them. There is an old school at this point at present. I am enclosing herewith a blue print of the basement plan of the building intended to be erected this year, and also a rough sketch showing the size of the building. It would be of great assistance if your officer would include a block plan showing the location of the proposed building, the existing barn and the spring, septic tank, etc.\n\nAs it is the intention of the Department to invite tenders early in the spring, I will be glad to have this information at your earliest convenience.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6464, file 838-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI have received your letter of the 26th instant, with enclosures, in reference to water supply and drainage system for the proposed Indian Residential School at Lytton B.C.\n\nThe plans and a copy of your letter are being sent to our District Chief Engineer at Vancouver, with instructions to have a report prepared on this matter as soon as possible in accordance with your request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

I would like two hundred dollars with which to pay the Indians now working there.\n\nIf the Dept. cannot see their way clear to do so I will have to ask for an additional advance grant to cover this amt.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nSir,\u2014\nEnclosed please find voucher No. 501 K, together with a letter from the principal of St. George's School, in which he asks that the Department take this off his hands, and pay for it from the New England grant.\n\nTrusting the Department will give this matter favorable consideration,\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssist. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6464, file 888-5, part 1)\nApril 21, 1926.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nThe Rev. Principal of the Lytton Indian Residential School has ordered fencing for Lot 47, the property on the hill. The cost is $385.40. He asks the Department to pay this account from the New England Company grant and to allow him $200 for Indian labour for the erection of the fence.\n\nAll future payments from the New England Company should be held in trust for an indefinite period. At present, there is in the account (No. 460) $2900. Approximately $1,000 of this will be required to pay veterinary charges (File 165-0-14). Some $1900.00 is available for other purposes.\n\nI wish to recommend that this account and the labour for the erection of the fence be allowed and that the Rev. Principal be informed of our plans in connection with the New England Company payments, so that in future he will understand that he is to get along practically entirely on the per capita grant.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, April 22, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Lett:\n\nI have directed that the account for wire fencing for Lot 47, Lytton Indian Residential School, be paid and that $200 be advanced for labour. The funds will be taken from the New England Company grant. The payments to the Veterinary who is attending the milch herd will also be taken from this source.\n\nI am writing to inform you that these grants will be the last that can be allowed the school from the New England Company funds. It is necessary that the quarterly payments from London be held in the Department in future and I am asking that you will from this date finance the institution on the per capita grant. Your reports from time to time are very encouraging; the latest fiscal report shows marked improvement since you took charge and I am hopeful that, financially and otherwise, the school will continue to make progress.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. A. R. Lett,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nLytton, B. C.\nSir,\n\nI wish to thank you for yours of April 22nd Numbering 165-0-5 allowing the use of the N.E.C.Grant for the fencing of Lot 47 which work has been finished, and also for the expenses entailed in the needed looking after of our Dairy Herd, good results have already been realised and we are now feeling that we shall have our Herd back into shape. We shall I hope have 25 cows milking next winter.\n\nAs you are no doubt by this time aware of the fact that water is very short in this district, and due to this fact our upper Lot is idle. Last year we were able to feed our Range Stock here besides baling some 50 tons for sale. Having no production at Lot 47 our source of revenue is not going to be as great as was contemplated and with the withdrawal of the New England Co's Grant I shall be obliged to look for some source of financial aid in order to make ends meet. I therefore must ask if you would agree to provision being made in the way of erecting temporary dormitory room in which I could handle ten or fifteen boys who are now on the waiting list. The staff at present in the school could handle this extra number and outside of the expense of building the necessary housing I would not be at any further expenditure excepting of course the feeding and clothing.\n\nBesides the financial aid to the school I am sure you will agree with me when I say that every care should be taken in not letting these children get too advanced in age before entering school and as the majority of some thirty applications on file are voluntary it is I should think the more necessary.\n\nIt is my intention to do this building during the coming vacation so that at the re-opening of school I shall begin the new year with about 118 children. With your consent I shall begin immediately to make this provision.\n\nAgain thanking you for past favors and trust the above will receive your close and sympathetic hearing.\n\nI beg to remain Sir\n\nYours very obediently\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL\nJune 17, 1926.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to refer you to my letter of the 26th of March, with reference to the proposed new Indian Residential School at Lytton, B.C., and would ask you to please let me know if you have had a reply from your District Chief Engineer at Vancouver, regarding this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.

A building 25x40 would be sufficient to cover our needs. Material used to cost approximately \u00a3225.00 including brick flue and making provision for windows doors and etc., with a total cost equipped with beds and bedding of not more than \u00a3600.00 which amount would be only \u00a350.00 in excess of one quarter PER Capita earnings which amount I would be willing to be held by the Dept if you should see fit to be unable to make the expenditure outside of Per Capita earnings.\n\nThere are three outstanding reasons why I am again approaching you re this matter,\n\n1. The children are available and should be in school.\n2. By being able to remove ten boys from the present dormitory would relieve over-capacitation insuring better health and less worry. In fact we are at the present time occupying dormitory room which is not at all sanitary and is ill ventilated.\n3. The additional Per Capita Grant will greatly relieve present financial difficulty.\n\nYou might think that I am asking for too much temporary room when I ask for temporary housing of 20 or 25 yet it means that by making room for this number and only taking in an extra ten the present dormitory relief would be an asset to the children and the school on the whole.\n\nIt also will be some time before we shall be able to occupy the proposed New Buildings and same being built in units it will prolong occupancy and a temporary of this type this nature could be utilized to advantage for some time.\n\nI shall enclose a rough sketch of the building.\n\nYours very obediently\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL\nA.

Graham,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nIn view of the fact that a blood test of the dairy herd at the St. George's School, Lytton, for abortion disease, shows that fifty percent of the herd is infected, and that owing to lack of sufficient building it is impossible to segregate the healthy from the diseased animals, I wish to bring to your notice that in order to raise a healthy herd it will be necessary to build more dairy barn accommodation; also an isolation stable to take proper care of discharging cows.\n\nIn order to raise a healthy herd it is necessary to keep the non-reacting portion of the herd entirely separate from the diseased animals, and with heifers just coming to breeding age, this is an opportune time to segregate these animals.\n\nHoping this suggestion will meet with your approval, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) T.H. Jagger,\nVeterinarian.\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed please find a copy of a letter received from Dr. T.H. Jagger, veterinary surgeon, who is treating the dairy herd at St. George's Residential School here at Lytton.\n\nIn regard to this I might state that the school is working up an excellent herd, and I would like to recommend that if it is at all possible, assistance be given towards an extra building, as asked for in Dr. Jagger's letter.\n\nThe present building could be altered by extending the cow portion so as to take in the horse stable. This would give accommodation for about ten or twelve more cows and an isolation and horse stable could be built separately.\n\nIt is certainly too bad that when the school is working up a nice herd, that they should be handicapped, by not having an isolation stable in which to treat cattle that should be taken away from healthy animals.\n\nTrusting the Department will give this matter its favorable consideration,\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n(H. Graham)\nAssist. Deputy & Secretary, Indian Agent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHC/MD\nMr. Graham\nIndian Agent\nLyton.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nIn connection with the condition of our Dairy Herd I would like to point out that Dr. Jagger has lately had a blood test taken through Dr. Bruce of Agassiz in the Dominion Lab., the result finds that fourteen out of twenty-nine head have reacted to the test for abortion, resulting in the fact that we are in a rather precarious position, having no isolation facilities wherein to put these cows. Under these conditions there is not much hope of ever getting the herd cleaned up.\n\nBy this time you may perhaps have a letter from Dr. Jagger suggesting that an Isolation Barn be erected which is a necessity, not only at the present time, but also would take care of other sickness in the herd, and in many other ways could be used to great advantage even when the herd is in normal health conditions.\n\nYou have been through the barn when Dr. Jagger was working and have, for yourself seen, the difficulties under which we are obliged to work. Our abortion cases are now kept in the Hog Barn where they must stay for a period of from four to eight weeks until all discharges have ceased before transferring to the main barn, thus entailing an endless amount of work in carrying food and water, cleaning, milking, etc., besides running the risk of our brood Sows contracting the disease, as the Dr. has stated that there is grave danger of this latter happening.\n\nTogether with this there is the fact that our herd is growing and shortly we will be pressed for room. Again it is our intention to have the Govt. Milk Tester visit the herd beginning the New Year and shall have to have conveniences for this and would suggest that the Horse Barn be utilised for this purpose. Very little expense would be entailed in taking out the present horse stalls and putting in pens.\n\nThis latter would of course call for a new horse barn, but if we are going to develop the farm on the whole, we must develop the dairy which is the greatest asset the school has, and which is now the only department that is giving us a cash dividend. Here we have something that not only gives an income of cash but also caters to the health of the children.\n\nI trust you will give the above your immediate and sympathetic attention. Thanking you for considering as you have our needs in this matter,\n\nYours very sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMR. SCOTT.\n\nReports have been submitted by the Dominion Water Power Branch on the proposed sewage disposal plant and water supply system for the Lytton Industrial School, Lytton, B.C., which will mainly consist of the following units.\n\nSEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEM.\n\nThe sewage from the new school buildings will be treated through a concrete septic tank which will be located on the left bank of the Fraser River a distance of about 250 feet from the school, and will subsequently discharge into the Fraser River. The cost of the system will amount to $3,000.00.\n\nWATER SUPPLY SYSTEM.\n\nThe source of water for the proposed water supply system will be derived from springs located on the reserve at an altitude of 250 feet above the main highway, where a concrete dam will be constructed. From this point it will be conveyed a distance of 600 feet to a concrete reservoir, having a capacity of 25,000 U.S. gallons. This reservoir will be located on the high ground in the vicinity of the new school. From the above mentioned reservoir the water will be carried a distance of 1700 feet through a 6\" wood stave pipe to the school building to be used for both domestic supply and for fire protection.\n\nIn view of the height of 160 feet between the storage tank and the ground floor of the proposed building a static pressure of 70 pounds will be ensured at any of the hydrants which are to be installed near the building. The estimated cost of the above mentioned work will amount to about $6,000.00. After examining both reports I beg to recommend that the necessary funds be made available when the Department undertakes the construction of the new building.\nand that separate prices be obtained in the tender form for these two systems.\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nAt Lytton, B.C.,\n\nNovember 26, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI wrote to you yesterday enclosing a copy of a letter from Dr. Jagger, V.S., in connection with the necessity for an isolation barn for St. George's Indian Industrial School dairy herd.\n\nI have just received a letter from the principal of the school on the same subject which I am enclosing.\n\nTrusting that the Department will give this matter its favorable consideration,\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

I am hopeful that funds will be available next year for the erection of a new horse barn and, at that time, the isolation for the cows can be arranged. If more immediate action is urgent, you might let me have a report with a recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH.

Graham\nIndian Agent\nLytton,\n\nDear Mr. Graham\u2014\n\nI might say that this is very urgent. A separate barn should be erected for this purpose. Dr. Jagger in handling to do justice to his work without isolation as we are unable to separate the cows affected hence the constant spread of the disease. If this had not been urgent we naturally would not have made application for the improvements asked for. Unless we can properly combat this affection we shall from time to have cows which will not breed and as a result some of our very best cows must go to the butchers block. The best Dairy period of the cow is from six to eight months after freshening and it is necessary for maximum production that together with Govt test that she should freshen possible within the twelve months period. As you are aware we are now carrying cows that have not freshened since April 1925. This is not conducive to ideal production resulting in the herd becoming boarders instead of payers. Three or four cows not breeding in the herd takes away the profit and no business head can carry on a dairy in this manner. It is true excepting for two cows the remainder of the herd is pregnant, but with cows standing side by side in the barn with no opportunity to isolate the cows reacting are liable to slip their calves which has lately happened resulting in the fact that our whole herd will become sterile. Until we are equipped with the additions asked for we will always be cumbered with this difficulty. I sincerely trust that the Dept. will as soon as possible allow the erection of this needed requirement.\n\nYours very sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nSir:\n\nI have yours of the 6th inst., which I showed to the Rev. A.R. Lett, and am now enclosing his reply.\n\nI might add that I talked this matter over with Dr. Jagger, on the ground, when he was up testing the cattle, and he pointed out the very urgent need for the isolation building, explaining that abortion was so contagious, that it was next to impossible for him to clean up the herd whilst he had apparers standing next to pregnant cows.\n\nMr. Lett had got his herd up to a paying basis, but if he is to be handicapped, with the state of things as they exist at present, he would soon have it on the downward grade.\n\nUnder these circumstances I would like to strongly recommend that the Department build an isolation building with as little delay as possible.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6464, file 888-5, part 1)\nOttawa, December 22, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your l-06 of the 15th instant, with reference to the advisability of providing isolation for certain cows of the milch herd at the Lytton Indian Residential School. The old horse barn will be available when a new one can be erected, but funds for this purpose cannot be found until the next fiscal year. Further, it might be inadvisable to proceed with the erection of a horse barn during the winter months. In any case, if there is any inexpensive practical scheme which will remedy the present situation, you might let me have a recommendation by night letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Your suggestion seems practicable, but the barn, although not very much, would be eventually lost, as the building you suggest would be of very little value, principally on account of having to put in either an earthen or wooden floor which would not allow the sanitary arrangements necessary in using it for an isolation building as is needed. The present barn as it exists will have to be altered considerably to accommodate the growing herd, as this part of the farm is the paying end, and it is absolutely necessary to enlarge it to accommodate more milk cows. To do this will eventually mean either the present horse stalls or the calf pens being turned in as stanchions for extra milk cows, and the present pens are not sufficient as it is.\n\nAt the present time there is no storeroom and feed is now stored in different parts, such as at the pig pen, which is badly needed now for the growing number of pigs. The present root cellar is far too small, and if we are to increase the herd, which is absolutely essential for the growing school, we must have both cellar space and a storeroom.\n\nThe temporary building which I proposed in my telegram, to cost about $1000.00, can be added to the present mixingroom, shown on the plan. This would allow the present cellar to be extended out, and a loft put overhead for a storeroom, with a small chain elevator for carrying the stores to the loft. This could be fitted with a concrete floor, and eventually used for calves, and a portion added to the present mixingroom to enlarge same.\n\nThese would have to be added eventually, if we are to go ahead, as we hope to, in the dairy business, and it is the only solution we can see, that would take care of the isolation that is badly needed at present. This building would be used for the temporary isolation building as long as needed, and could at any time be used for this purpose when required. We thought it better to write these particulars more fully rather than wire them, and have a misunderstanding.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6464, file 888-5, part 1)\nJan. 5, 1927.\n\nH.

In reply I wish to confirm the Deputy Superintendent General's night letter of the 5th instant as follows:-\n\n\"Authorize Reverend Principal to proceed with addition to mixing room, Lytton school stock barn, as explained your letter thirty-first ultimo. Present expenditure must not exceed estimate. Get competitive prices for materials and keep time sheets for labour.\"\n\nI should be grateful for a rough sketch showing the work that is to be undertaken immediately and a detailed estimate of the cost. You should purchase the materials, after securing competitive prices, and keep time sheets in duplicate for any expert labour it is necessary to engage. These time sheets should show receipts of the man and the number of hours.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nJanuary 7, 1927.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nI wish to draw to your attention a request of our representative at Lytton - that a small classroom for employees' children be provided in the new Indian residential school building. Generally, I could not recommend this course; but, in view of the representations of the Rev. Mr. Lett, I consider it would be advisable to give favourable consideration. To my own knowledge, the road from the school to the town of Lytton is too dangerous for any but expert drivers.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nJanuary 12, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Lett,\n\nYou remember last year we had some correspondence with reference to the plans for the new Lytton School. I am sorry, but I seem to have mislaid the blue prints of the St. Paul's School with your changes marked thereon. As I wish to start these plans immediately I am sending you today, under separate cover, blue print copies of the floor plans of the St. Paul's School, and would be very glad if you would indicate on them any changes you wish in the new building.\n\nI am also sending you blue print copies of the plans I made last year for the rear portion. This I presume is to remain as it is as far as the layout is concerned. Of course I will have to redraw it when making the plans for the entire building, so if you desire any changes in the layout of the rear portion you might indicate same on the plan.\n\nIt is the intention to provide a small classroom for the employees' children in the building. Please indicate approximately where you wish this classroom located.\n\nI would like to get the copy of the plans back as soon as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. Gurney Orr,\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nRev. A. R. Lett,\nPrincipal, Lytton Indian Residential School,\nLytton, B. C.\nMr. Graham  \nIndian Agent  \nLytton.\n\nDear Mr. Graham\u2014\n\nI must again approach you concerning more room in the barn. It is evident that the Dept. does not see our real need in regard to isolation and extension. While we shall in the new building have some relief in isolation it will not by any means take care of it all nor will it take care of development. The present barn room is all taken up and we do not now know what to do with the calves which are now arriving. The present stalls are all taken up with fresh cows and only this morning a cow freshened and should be for atime in isolation but she has to be kept in the stantions in the main barn.\n\nTo offset this condition I have already advocated the conversion of the horse-barn into pens to be used as freshening stalls and also to be used for milk testing purposes. If we are going to make anything of the dairy we must be in a position to properly test in order that our cows may go on record and also to be in a position to weed out individual boarders. We are just in the position now where a little additional expenditure will place us in a state of advance whereas if we are to be tied up for some time it will be a heart rending standstill. We have never used the horse-barn and it does seem as though it is still to remain so, when it could be utilized to such great advantage at the present time.\n\nAs you know I have spent no end of time and energy to place the dairy on the present footing and I do not want to see things go to the wall. The cost of these stalls and the conversion of the horse barn would entail an expenditure of four hundred dollars together with the present proposed building which I think can be erected for about eight hundred dollars instead of one thousand, as I intend doing a great deal of the work with our own help.\n\nTo say the least there is no encouragement in having a forced tie-up but if the above arrangement is not allowed I can only say that I shall be at a loss to know what to do.\n\nThere is also another item which would be well considered at this time. The present pipe line to the barn is in bad shape owing to the fact that the pipe put in was not of high enough pressure. This line should either be lifted and replaced with seventy pound pressure pipe at an approximate cost of $600.00 or a reservoir tank built to reduce the pressure to fifty pounds at a cost of about $75.00. This would still leave us ample pressure and while the concrete mixer is here it could be installed and with a few extra lengths of pipe the line could be made right.\nThis would also take care of the surplus water now running away and which could be utilised to great advantage during the summer months for irrigation purposes.\n\nI am as you see out to save the unnecessary expense. I do not know who was at fault in the beginning nevertheless the line must now be repaired and could now be done at a very reduced cost.\n\nRegarding the former let me ask that there be no tie up if at all possible. The extra room will mean so much and it undoubtedly will save the Dept. money in six months time. With cows freshening the dairy herd should be kept up to its greatest capacity. This can only be done by giving us the added room, which will allow scientific handling, and at no cost to the School or Dept.\n\nYours very sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL\nI have your letter of January 7th, confirming your nightletter of the 5th inst., authorizing the Reverend Principal of St. George's School to go ahead with the isolation barn in connection with the present building, and asking for prices on materials, and for timesheets to be kept.\n\nYour letter goes on to explain that you want a rough sketch showing the work that it is to be undertaken immediately, and a detailed estimate of the cost.\n\nI might say that I showed the Reverend Principal this letter, and he has written a letter which I am enclosing explaining his views on the whole matter. I am also enclosing a rough sketch showing the new addition that he proposes to build. The Reverend Principal points out in his letter that he wanted to change things around generally, so as to make the barn efficient for future use, and also to have the new addition used as an isolation building when there is need of it. His application for $1000.00, he figured, would cover all the alterations and improvements which he sees as follows:\n\nThe present horse portion of the barn to be turned into calf and breeding pens, and the present calf pens to be used for eight stanchions; the new addition to be used for isolation at the present time, and eventually to be turned into calf pens which will be available for isolation at any future date if needed, and a storage loft to be put in the upper part of the new addition, as they have no storeroom at present, and are using a portion of the pig pen for this, which is badly needed now for the increasing number of pigs.\n\nThe Reverend Principal also points out that the water pressure on the existing pipes is too great, and suggests building a reservoir at a lower level to take away the high pressure, which could be done for about $75.00, whilst the mixer was on the ground.\n\nThe new stanchions and pens will cost approximately $250.00, alterations in present barn $150.00, new addition about $355.00. These, of course, do not include considerable labor that the school will provide, but for material and experienced labor.\n\nIf the Reverend principal is given authority to spend $1000.00, I think he can put the barn into good shape to handle the requirements. As we have no time sheets please forward a supply.\n\nTrusting the Department will give this matter favorable consideration and will authorize me by wire whether we are to go ahead on these lines,\n\nAssist. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham), Indian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6464, File 888-5, part 1)\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nUnder separate cover I am returning plans forwarded by you for my criticism. You will find the several changes marked in red ink.\n\nThe unit proposed for last year is O.K., as it is now excepting that there should be a door on the boys side for entrance with milk, meat, vegetables, etc.\n\nIt is my aim to keep the two play grounds as separate as it is possible hence my reason for asking for the changes. As you stated when I saw you in Ottawa, it is easier to alter the plans than to alter the building. With the changes marked if satisfactory to you I feel sure that the first set of plans you get out will stand.\n\nI am also enclosing with plans comments on changes asked for, and reasons.\n\nI feel that it will reduce supervision to a minimum and make work easier on the whole.\n\nI trust that you will have patience with me in what I have asked for and all of it will meet with your approval.\n\nYours very sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nMr. R. Gurney Orr,\nArchitect Dept of Indian Affairs\nCOMMENTS ON CHANGES ASKED FOR AND MARKED IN RED INK\n\nAction proposed last year is O.K. as it stands with door marked. Entrance on boys side for bringing in supplies as roothouses meat-shop, Dairy act is on this side of the school building.\n\nGROUND FLOOR:\nOne office only, enlarged two feet. Matrons office not required. Matrons bedroom and remaining part of Matrons office made into Class room for white children. As we wish to change sexes to opposite side of building Change classroom as indicated, sewing-room on girls side and equipped with cupboards extending to ceiling large enough to hold weekly change of clothing and surplus stock. All Class rooms equipped with cupboards to hold school supplies. Boys study room changed to opposite side, staff bedroom and bath-room in its place. Residence as it stands in present plan. Do not change to boys side.\n\nBASEMENT PLAN:\nDoor from passage to staff dining room. Built in buffet in staff dining-room. Position left to your discretion. Girls dressing-room between recreation-room and lavatory. This room to be used as dressing room night and morning and wherein can be hung up night clothes in the daytime and day clothes in the night. This applies on both boys and girls sides. Partition may be half high with wire netting to ceiling. One Matron could with this arrangement supervise the washing, dressing, and playroom. Drinking fountains as indicated on both sides. More bathtubs and showers on both sides. Garage in residence basement if possible. This would be most convenient, and we do not need the full basement for other purposes. Residence ground floor with no hall. Folding doors in partition between living room and dining room so that if necessary both can be used for reception room. Small vestibule at entrance. Extra window in dining room as this window would look out onto the Fraser and the mountains. Double veranda upper part to be used as sleeping porch with door from upstairs onto same.\n\nI am returning as you sent them critising and marking only one sheet as I have a full set of plans which you forwarded me one year and a half ago.\n\nThe changes asked for are to reduce supervision. By having the girls and boys absolutely separate I feel that it will take away great difficulties of discipline.\n\nI have not touched the plans of the unit got out by you last year on these main plans but on the plans of the one unit marked the necessary door. The remainder to stand as it is.\n\nPlease do not forget to reverse the building boys side to girls side. School rooms to with residence as it is on girls side.\nOttawa, January 24, 1927.\n\nH.

Box 752\nKAMLOOPS, B.C.\n\nFebruary 14, 1927.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou will doubtless hear of the following, but in case you do not, I think it is my duty in the interests of the Indian Residential School at Lytton, to report the following:\n\nOn Wednesday, the 9th inst., the boiler at the School burst, and the entire school was without any heat. This was a very bad state of affairs right in the middle of the cold weather and meant great discomfort to all. No school rooms could be opened and there was no water for the toilets, and the children were shivering around a few stoves, which said stoves, to my mind, are dangerous to use in such an awful, old building.\n\nI sent down some fire clay from here for repairs, and temporary repairs have been made. Rev. Mr. Lett informs me he does not know how they will get the boiler repaired. It is out of date anyway, but something will have to be done to it if they have to stay in the old building for another winter.\n\nI hope, therefore, that the Department will be able to get the money to start part of the new school anyway, as you know it is most urgently needed.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Geo. S. Pragnell)\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, February 24, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant and I regret to learn that a boiler burst at the Indian residential school at Lytton and that there was a consequent serious inconvenience. I have to inform you that Parliament at this session is being asked to provide funds for the new main building and I am hopeful that a start will be made in the spring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

H. R. Lett as an advance to cover the cost of erecting a fence at the Lytton Industrial School. Up to the present this office has received no accounts to support this advance.\n\nThe School referred to above is supported by grants from the New England Co., and for that reason the impression seems to prevail in your department that the expenditures from the grants should not be subject to government audit.\n\nIt appears to me that as soon as this money is paid into the Trust Fund it becomes part of that Fund, bearing interest as such, and therefore payments made from this account must be treated the same as all expenditures made from the Indian Trust Fund.\n\nVouchers in connection with the Lytton Industrial School have been received in this office covering all payments with the exception of the advance to Mr. Lett. I can see no reason why the advance should not be accounted for, and I should like to have your opinion on this point.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP. H.

This advance to the Rev. Principal of the Lytton Indian Residential School was inadvertently unaccounted for. I am today writing to Mr. Lett regarding the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. H.

This cheque was issued as an advance to cover the cost of erecting a fence at the Lytton Indian Residential School and the Auditor General has now requested that the advance be accounted for. I should be grateful if you would let me have time sheets, in duplicate, showing the receipts of the men in this connection. If, for any reason, this is impossible, you should prepare a formal affidavit showing how this money was expended and, after attesting to the same, forward it to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

This building was not built last year, but it is proposed to erect it this year. Will you please advise me if this schedule already furnished will be satisfactory to be used, and if not will you please submit a new one.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

I wish to say in the most emphatic way that school\nbuilding should be condemned. It is not a fit place to house\nboys and girls.\n\n\"During a cold snap recently, the Principal says the\nconditions were deplorable. The younger pupils were suffering\nfrom cold. It was utterly impossible to keep them warm. A new\nbuilding should be erected at once or the pupils should be sent\nhome.\n\nWater Supply:-\n\nFor some time the past Winter water had to be hauled.\nHowever, at the time of my visit, there was enough water for\ndomestic purposes.\n\nHeating:-\n\nHot water is used. One of the tubes burst while I\nwas there. The Engineer was able to fix it so that it worked.\nThe whole heating apparatus is liable to go to pieces at any\ntime.\n\nGeneral Remarks:-\n\nThere are twelve acres that divide the school lands.\nThis should be bought and added to the present school property.\nI would respectfully recommend that the Department look into\nthis matter before the erection of the new building.\"\nOttawa,\nMarch 15, 1927.\n\nRef. No. I.A.41.\n\nDear Mr. Orr,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 4th instant in which you ask for any necessary revision of the fair wages schedule which was prepared for use in connection with the proposed erection of the Indian Residential School at Lutton, B.C., I would state that in view of the fact that negotiations are under way at present for certain wages changes in this district, it would be better to use the General Fair Wages Clause in the terms herewith.\n\nIf your specification is not used by the first of May, however, we should be pleased if you would let us know and in that event it will probably be possible to use a fair wages schedule, as wages rates for the season are ordinarily settled by that date.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nAssistant Deputy Minister of Labour.\n\nP.

I have this year had added expense in ditch cleaning and through sickness have incurred the expense of one burial and feel unable to handle the enclosed.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nLytton, B.C.,\nMay 12th, 1927.\n\nSir:-\n\nReferring to departmental letter dated January 7, 1927, and also telegram dated January 24th, I beg to enclose herewith voucher No. 27 M., in favor of Wm. M. Orr, in connection with the building of the isolation addition to the cow barn at St. George's School. I am also enclosing a letter from the Rev. Mr. Lett, which will speak for itself.\n\nYou will see that I have subtracted from this account, $12.50 for return freight on equipment, and also return fares for two men amounting to $7.50. The reason for this is that neither the equipment nor the two men have returned to Chilliwack, but have been and still are employed on other work in Lytton, where they will probably be for sometime yet as Mr. Orr has still another job to do before he returns them to his place of business. Mr. Orr objects to this being deducted from his account, saying it was part of the contract that this should be paid, but we think that as he is using this equipment and these men on other work than Indian Department work, we should not be expected to pay the return freight and fares for them.\n\nTrusting the Department will approve of my action in this matter,\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

Gurney Orr,\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nCanadian Fairbanks Morse Co.,\nMontreal, Que.\nJune 14, 1927.\n\nMemorandum:\nHonourable Charles Stewart.\n\nRE: PURCHASE OF PROPERTY\nLYTTON INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nRelative to the proposal that the Department purchase the property at the Lytton Indian Residential School from the New England Company, for a consideration of $6,000, I wish to point out that the independent valuator you appointed made the following appraisal:\n\n| Item               | Value   |\n|--------------------|---------|\n| Land               | $26,080 |\n| Buildings          | $13,450 |\n| Furnishings        | $2,380  |\n| Stock              | $6,265  |\n| Implements         | $2,785  |\n| Other Equipment    | $3,540  |\n| **Total**          | **$64,810** |\n\nNot included in the appraiser's figures, are the barn and two cottages, which have been lately erected at a cost of $19,265, approximately $15,000 of which was from Parliamentary Appropriation.\n\nI have reviewed the capital expenditure from 1920-21 to 1926-27, inclusive. And I find that from Parliamentary Appropriation the following improvements, other than the three outbuildings mentioned, have been made:\n\n| Item                  | Value   |\n|-----------------------|---------|\n| Livestock             | $6,465  |\n| Mechanical Plant      | $6,047  |\n| Irrigation            | $5,782  |\n| Farm Machinery        | $2,540  |\n| Furnishings & other Equipment | $2,373 |\n| **Total**             | **$25,175** |\n\nIn addition to the expenditure from Parliamentary Appropriation, there has been approximately $7,000 worth of improvements paid for by the New England Company grant.\n\nI believe that the appraiser's valuation was conservative. If 20% of the cost of recent improvements is\ndeducted for depreciation and the balance subtracted from\nthe valuator's figures, it would appear that the New\nEngland Company equity is approximately $46,000. The\nCompany, in a recent letter, indicates that the property\nstands on their books as an asset of $12,475, or approx-\nimately $60,000. To this figure might be added $7,000 -\nthe value of the improvements paid for from the New England\nCompany grant in recent years. Allowing for depreciation\nand for the increase in land values during the years I\nam satisfied that the proposed purchase price, \u00a38,000, or\n$30,848 at current rates of exchange, is quite fair and\nreasonable. When the new main building is erected, the\nproperty with its fine outbuildings and splendid irrigation\nsystem will be a very valuable adjunct to our educational\nequipment. The site is very attractive and the land, when\nirrigated, quite fertile.\n\nThe New England Company have written in\npart as follows: \"That, if your Department would agree to\npurchase the property immediately for the sum named (\u00a38,000)\nthe Court would agree that the payment of the purchase money\ncould be spread over a period of years to be arranged,\nby instalments, and they suggest that the most convenient form\nof such an arrangement would be for the payments to be made\nin equal sums paid yearly as principal and interest to cover\noutstanding amounts at 5%... The maintenance\ngrants would be continued by agreement for a period of years\non the present basis.\" Another letter, referring to the\narrangement in the event of purchase, states that the Company\nmight be willing to continue the grants which they now give\nand to add thereto the bulk of the interest derived from the\npurchase money.\n\nThere is an item of $10,000 in the Main\nEstimates as the first payment on the purchase price of this\nproperty. I wish to recommend that the New England Company\nbe informed of our intention to purchase immediately, that\nthey be offered $10,000 in cash, $10,000 in one year,\n$10,000 in two years, and the balance plus interest due in\nthree years' time. The last three payments would, of course,\nhave to be included in our Estimates. I do not recommend\nthat the New England Company grants for maintenance be set\noff against the Department's payments of principal and\ninterest, as it would be a source of much satisfaction to me\nif the Company indefinitely continues its grants and its\nassociation with the Department in the conduct of the\nInstitution.\n\nDuncan C.

D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSir:\n\nI am today returning to you under separate cover two blue print copies of the plans and specifications for the new St. George's Indian Residential School at Lytton, B.C.\n\nSome five or six contractors have prepared tenders which, I presume, have gone on to Ottawa.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.H. Cairns.\n\nInspector of Indian Schools of B.C.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nOFFICE OF\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN AGENCIES\nBRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nP.O. BOX 752\nKAMLOOPS, B.C.\n\nJune 16th, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nI was allowed yesterday, for the first time since his operation, to see Mr. Lett in the hospital. He is most anxious that I should put up to you a few matters in connection with the construction of the new school at Lytton. His requests, apparently, are not anything out of the way, nor do I think they will cost very much as extras. I will enumerate them as follows:\n\n1. In the girls' wash rooms, in the basement plan, he would prefer that the girls have exactly the same bath accommodation as in the boys' wing; in other words, three shower baths and three bath tubs instead of one shower bath and four bath tubs, his idea being that they are much more quickly handled in shower baths than in bath tubs.\n\n2. On the same basement floor, he would like cupboard accommodation built both in the girls' recreation room and in the boys' recreation room, to hold the children's clothes, his idea being that they could come downstairs in the morning in their slippers and dressing gowns and change whilst having their ablutions.\n\n3. In the class rooms on the ground floor plans, he states that the blackboard accommodation is apparently not sufficient. He states that, nowadays, a tremendous lot of teaching is done through blackboard work, and it is necessary to have as much as possible.\n\n4. On the First Floor Plan, he would like to have one more bath tub for staff use. He suggests that it be placed in the accommodation marked off as \"stores\" on the right hand of the boys' infirmary. This would not add very much extra cost as it could be connected up with the plumbing in the bath room of the boys' infirmary.\n\n5. On the Second Floor Plan, he points out that there is no toilet accommodation for either of the two staff bedrooms. It would mean going through the dormitories to get to the said accommodation. He suggests that in this case, toilets be placed in the two receptacles marked off as \"stores\" opposite the staff bedrooms, one on the girls' side and one on the boys' side. This would not cost much extra as they could be connected with the plumbing of the dormitory toilets.\n\nI promised Mr. Lett that I would write you for him, and I hope you will give this matter your consideration,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeo.

Much happiness and relief was expressed by both Mr. Graham and Rev. Mr. Lett, Principal, at the news that the construction of the new building is to take place shortly. I wish to point out, however, that every effort should be made to get the children housed in the new building anyhow as regards sleeping before the winter, otherwise considerable expense will be necessary to recondition the heating plant in the old building. In fact, to my mind, I doubt whether this is possible without largely replacing same, and unless they are housed, the possibility of having to close the school temporarily may crop up.\n\nGeo. S.

Adkison & Hill, Ltd., of Vancouver, B.C., is fair and reasonable.\n\nThe Minister recommends that the said tender be accepted pursuant to the requirements of Sub-section 2 of Section 26 of the Public Works Act. Funds for this purpose are available from Parliamentary appropriation.\n\nThe Committee concur in the foregoing recommendation and submit the same for approval.\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\nJune 27, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Matheson:\n\nI am very pleased to inform you that my plans for the Lytton Indian Residential School have rapidly materialized. Not only has Parliament provided sufficient funds for a new main building, but we have received a reasonable offer from a responsible contractor. Complete plans and specifications were prepared some time ago and I called for tenders, which were opened recently. The Department is quite satisfied with the figure \u00a3130,000, which was entered by Addison and Hill, of Vancouver, who have been found quite capable of handling the work. I am directing to you, under separate cover, a set of the plans and specifications, so you will know exactly what type of building is being erected. The dormitories and classrooms will be made ready for an initial enrolment of 150. However, if all available space is used, the building will accommodate 180 children besides the staff.\n\nIn addition to funds for the main building, Parliament has provided \u00a327,000 for water supply, sewage disposal, shelving, cupboards, furnishings, salary of the Inspector of Construction and a horse barn. There was also a vote of \u00a310,000 for a first payment towards the purchase of the property.\n\nI have arranged application to His Excellency in Council for authority to award the contract and I wish to take advantage of the New England Company's offer to sell their equity in the property attached to the school for a consideration of \u00a38,000. The Superintendent General has approved of this scheme and the Department will be glad to accept the proposal of your letter of June 22nd, last, i.e., spread the payment of the purchase money over a term of years.\n\nI am making arrangements with the Department of Justice for the appointment of a lawyer in British Columbia, who will search title and prepare the necessary legal instruments. I am suggesting an Agreement of Sale with a consideration of \u00a36,400, indicating a payment this year of \u00a36,000, \u00a36,000 in one year, \u00a36,000 in two years and the balance of the consideration plus interest due at 5% in three years' time. In addition, there will be a bill of \u00a36,000 for all chattels with a consideration of \u00a31,000, indicating a payment this year of \u00a32,000, \u00a32,000 in one year, \u00a32,000 in two years and the balance of the consideration plus interest due at 5% in three years' time.\n\nErnest Matheson, Esq.,\nGovernor, New England Company,\n26 Bloomsbury Sq.,\nLondon, W.

The Department will use your grants for replacements and repairs and will continue the school as an educational centre for Indian boys and girls, or both, and shall train the pupils in the teachings and doctrine of the Church of England.

Tredcroft,\nDivision Engineer,\nDominion Water Power and\nReclamation Service,\nKamloops, B. C.\n\nMay 20th., 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to inform you\nthat, in accordance with instructions con-\ntained in your letter of April 6th., 1926,\nan investigation having reference to a pro-\nposed sewage disposal plant for the new\nLytton Industrial School has been completed,\nthe following being my report thereon:\n\nINTRODUCTION-\n\nThe new buildings for the Lytton\nIndustrial School will be situated on the\nsouth bank of the Fraser River, approxim-\nately 1,600 feet from the old school build-\ning (see accompanying plan) and when com-\npleted will be capable of housing 175 persons.\n\nThe proposed sewage system has therefore been\ntherefore been designed to take care of a flow of sewage amounting to 6,000 U.S. gallons per day, or 40 U.S. gallons per capita per diem, this amount being equal to the average daily consumption of water per head in institutions of this kind.\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nThe sewage from the new school buildings will be carried by means of a 6\" diameter vitrified sewer pipe from the school to a septic tank which will be situated on the left bank of the Fraser River, a distance of 250 feet from and immediately behind the new school buildings. (See accompanying plan)\n\nAfter having been passed through this tank, the effluent will be discharged by means of an automatic siphon directly into the Fraser River.\n\nSEPTIC TANK:\n\nThe septic tank will be constructed of reinforced concrete and situated at a depth of 2 feet below the surface of the ground to avoid danger of freezing. (See accompanying plan)\n\nIt will be divided by a wall into two compartments, one called a settling chamber, which will be the septic part of the tank, and the other called a siphon chamber, where the effluent will be collected ready for intermittent discharge into the Fraser River.\n\nThe settling chamber will be of the following\nthe following dimensions: 16' x 7' x 9'9\" deep, and will be connected by means of a 3 foot overflow weir with a siphon chamber having dimensions as follows: 10' x 6' x 9'9\" deep.\n\nThis siphon chamber will be equipped with an automatic siphon which will discharge when the effluent in the chamber reaches a total depth of 5 feet, and will discharge four times a day.\n\nThe settling chamber will have a capacity of 5,250 U.S. gallons, equal to 21 hours flow, and the detention period will therefore be 21 hours, with a rate of flow through the chamber of 7 inches per hour.\n\nDrains have been provided in each chamber to permit of the tank being emptied and cleaned when required.\n\nVent pipes, manholes, ladders, overflow pipes, etc., have been provided for in the design and arranged as shown on the accompanying plan.\n\nSEWER PIPES\u2014\n\nThe sewage will be carried from the school by means of one 6\" diameter vitrified sewer pipe (grade .01) to the inspection chamber, which will be situated 45 feet from the school.\n\nFrom this point it will be transferred by means of one 6\" diameter sewer pipe (grade .01)\npipe (grade .01) a distance of 200 feet to the septic tank.\n\nINSPECTION CHAMBER:\n\nThe inspection chamber will be of reinforced concrete and so placed that all pipes entering this chamber will be laid on straight lines and even grades to allow of easy cleaning should they at any time become clogged.\n\nDISCHARGE PIPE:\n\nThe discharge pipe from the septic tank to the Fraser River will be 4\" diameter vitrified sewer pipe, 100 feet in length, laid to a grade of .01 and will be straight and free from bends.\n\nIt will be called upon to discharge approximately 1,500 U.S. gallons every four hours.\n\nSLUDGE REMOVAL:\n\nThe septic tank should be cleaned approximately once every twelve months and this operation can easily be performed by means of the removable wooden covering provided for in the design and which runs the full length of the settling chamber. (See accompanying plan)\n\nCOST:\n\nThe total cost of constructing the above sewage disposal plant will amount to $3,610.00, and no further expenditure for either operation or maintenance should be required other than a charge of approx-\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6464, file 888-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nimately $5.00 per year for cleaning of the septic tank.\n\nREMARKS:\n\nIn view of the above considerations and after a thorough examination of conditions, I would respectfully recommend that a sewage disposal plant be installed at the new Lytton Industrial School as outlined in this report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nE.

Tredcroft,\nDivision Engineer,\nDominion Water Power and\nReclamation Service,\nKamloops, B. C.\n\nMay 20th., 1926.\n\nINTRODUCTION-\n\nThe new Lytton Industrial School will be situated on the south bank of the Fraser River, a distance of 4 miles above the Town of Lytton and approximately 1,600 feet from the present old school buildings. (See accompanying plan)\n\nIt will be a semi-fireproof brick building and when completed will be capable of housing 175 persons.\n\nWATER REQUIREMENTS FOR DOMESTIC PURPOSES-\n\nThe maximum daily water requirements for domestic\nments for domestic purposes in this institution, assuming 175 persons resident in the building, will amount to 40 U.S. gallons per capita, or a total of 6,000 U.S. gallons per day.\n\nWATER REQUIREMENTS FOR FIRE PROTECTION PURPOSES-\n\nThe new building will have a value when finished of more than $100,000.00, and should therefore be supplied with sufficient water to afford protection in the event of fire.\n\nThe minimum amount of water necessary to afford proper protection to a building of this kind is 500 U.S. g.p.m. (i.e., 2 standard fire streams of 240 U.S. g.p.m. each, playing simultaneously). This amount should be available for a considerable period in order that a possible outbreak of fire, no matter how severe, may be subdued.\n\nPOSSIBLE SOURCES OF WATER SUPPLY-\n\nThe only possible sources of water supply available for the new school building which can be obtained, other than by pumping from the Fraser River, which, owing to the great height of the school above the river (400 feet) and the lack of electric power available in this vicinity, would be too expensive, is from two springs, one situated on the Lytton Indian Reserve No. 21 and the other on Lot II, as shown on the accompanying plan.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF SPRINGS-\n\nSpring on Lot II.\n\nThe spring situated on Lot II, while it supplies\nwhile it supplies water at the present time to the school barn, does not have sufficient flow during certain seasons of the year to warrant the installation of any expensive reservoir or other collecting works, in order to provide water for fire and domestic purposes in the new school building; and in addition the 4\" diameter wood-stave pipe which at the present time conveys this water from the spring to the barn is not of a sufficiently large diameter to provide water at a high enough rate should same be required for fire protection purposes at any time in the future.\n\nThis 4\" diameter pipe, which has now been in use for several years, is in bad condition and considerable trouble from leakage has been experienced during the past season.\n\nIt is, therefore, considered advisable to abandon this spring on Lot 11 for any except farm purposes and to install a concrete reservoir to be used for fire protection and domestic purposes near the spring situated on the Lytton Indian Reserve No. 21 (see accompanying plan) rather than to attempt to replace the existing 4\" diameter pipe and make use of the spring on Lot 11.\n\nSpring on Lytton Indian Reserve No. 21.\n\nThe spring situated on Lytton Indian Reserve No. 21 is located approximately 250 feet above the main Lytton to Lillooet highway (see accompanying plan) and has, from information obtained\ninformation obtained from reliable persons familiar with this district, a sufficient flow during all seasons of the year to provide water for school purposes.\n\nIt is therefore proposed to utilize this spring in order to supply water for the new school building.\n\nPROPOSED WORKS-\n\nThe proposed works will be as follows:\n\nA small concrete dam will be constructed and water will be diverted from the above spring at a point 250 feet above the main highway (see accompanying plan). From this point it will be carried by means of a 6\" diameter wood-stave pipe a distance of 600 feet to a reinforced concrete reservoir situated on the high ground north-east of the new school.\n\nThe proposed reservoir, which will be of reinforced concrete construction, will be 25' x 12' x 12', inside dimensions, and will have a capacity when full of 25,000 U.S. gallons.\n\nFrom this reservoir the water will be conveyed through 1,700 lineal feet of 6\" diameter wood-stave pipe to the school building, where it will be used for both domestic and fire protection purposes.\n\nFIRE PROTECTION-\n\nThe elevation of the surface of the water in the proposed reservoir will be 160.00 and the elevation of the ground floor of the proposed school\nproposed school will be 0.00, which will give a static pressure at any one of the proposed four hydrants situated in the vicinity of the school of 69 pounds per square inch.\n\nFrom the above it will be seen that should an outbreak of fire occur a total of 25,000 U.S. gallons of water will be instantly available at a pressure of approximately 52 pounds per square inch at the hydrants, which amount at this pressure will be sufficient to supply two standard fire streams at 240 U.S. g.p.m. for a period of one hour.\n\nCOST-\n\nThe cost of installation of the above water supply system, including the construction of the concrete reservoir, intake dam and the installation of all supply pipes, overflow pipes, hydrants, fittings, etc., will amount to $5,825.00.\n\nREMARKS-\n\nAfter having made a thorough study of existing conditions at the above institution, I would respectfully suggest that a water supply system as outlined in this report be installed at the Lytton Industrial School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) E.H.Tredcroft\n\nE.H.Tredcroft\nDivision Engineer.\n\nC.E.Webb, Esq.\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nWater Power & Reclamation Service,\n739 Hastings Street West,\nVancouver, B.C.\nAPPENDIX \"A\"\n\nESTIMATE OF COST\n\nConcrete intake dam (complete) $110.00\nReinforced concrete reservoir\n25' x 12' x 12' 1,900.00\n600 feet 6\" diameter wood-stave intake pipe in place 530.00\n1700 lineal feet 6\" diameter wood-stave supply pipe in place 1,850.00\n250 lineal feet 6\" diameter wood-stave overflow pipe in place 225.00\nMiscellaneous fittings, hydrants, valves, etc., 350.00\n\nFire-fighting equipment, including\n500 lineal feet 2\u00bd\" diameter fire hose (Grade 2)\n4 standard 1 \u00bd\" diameter smooth nozzles,\n2 standard 7/8\" smooth nozzles,\n4 fire axes\n1 50 foot telescopic fire ladder,\n1 wooden shelter for same,\nRope and block for hoisting hose.\n2 hose spanners\n1 500 foot hose reel 560.00\n\nExtras, including miscellaneous, freight, cartage, etc., 300.00\n\nTOTAL $5,825.00\nJuly 27, 1927.\n\nSirs,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith your copy of the contract for the construction of the new St. George's Indian Residential School at Lytton, duly signed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nAdkison & Hill, Ltd.,\nContractors,\n319 Pender St.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nPlans, specifications and estimates have been prepared by the Dominion Water Power Branch for the installation of a water supply and sewage disposal system for the new Lytton Residential School.\n\nThe water supply system will consist in the construction of a concrete dam in order to form a water reservoir supplied by a number of springs from which a wood stave pipe line will convey the water by gravity a distance of 1700 feet to the school building, where it will be used for both domestic and fire protection.\n\nOwing to the difference in elevation between the school and the above mentioned reservoir it is expected that a static pressure of 69 pounds per square inch will be put on the outlets at the school building. The cost including the installation of fire fighting apparatus will amount to $5,825.00.\n\nThe sewerage system will consist in the construction of a concrete septic tank, located at a distance of 230 feet from the school. It is intended that the effluent from this tank will be discharged directly into the Fraser River, a distance of 100 feet. The installation as planned by the report is that usually installed in connection with similar Institutions, and will cost in the neighborhood of $3,000.00. Should funds be available for this expenditure I beg to recommend that it be done by day labour, under the supervision of the District Engineer of the Dominion Water Power Branch. A saving will thus be made on account of materials being purchased directly by the Department, which is the most expensive item of the work.\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nADKISON & DILL, LIMITED\nGENERAL CONTRACTORS AND BUILDERS\n\n106-107, 319 PENDER ST.

Mr. Lett on the grounds and he has given us the location of the school for which we have commenced excavation.\n\nWe note, however, that in taking the levels of the ground, that there is a considerable slope to the east and to the north. This, of course, is not shown on the plans, nor is the extent of it apparent until one takes the levels. We are not sure, yet, at the Vancouver office, just what the extent of this will be, but, on rough measurement being taken it appeared to be a drop of about ten to eleven feet in portions of the building. This, as you will readily understand, will cause us to go down considerably for a proper foundation at these points and will necessitate very much deeper concrete walls than we were able to estimate from the information given.\n\nWe are going right ahead with the work, however, in order to get as far advanced with the building as possible before bad weather may set in.\n\nWe trust that you will have the correctness of our statements checked up and will make adequate allowance for same.\n\nTrusting to hear from you at your earliest convenience, we are\n\nYours truly,\n\nADKISON & DILL, LTD.,\nPer J.

Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn was here recently and he strongly recommended that this be done, in order to preserve the lumber. The first paint put on has worn just about off, and if it is at all possible I would strongly recommend that the building be painted as it will be a saving in the long run.\n\nIn regard to the silo, this is very badly needed, as the herd is growing and they can well use the extra ensilage, with the corn, and the third crop of alfalfa that is often very difficult to save, there will be no difficulty in filling it, and, I would therefore strongly recommend that this be done, immediately, if the Department can possibly see its way clear to having it done.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

I would, therefore, ask you to consult with the Principal when the building is far enough on that he can see the layout of the different rooms and make out a list in detail of all the built-in equipment required, such as cupboards, lockers, pupils' dining room tables, benches, etc. It would be advisable, when submitting this list, to include sketches showing the type of fixtures required. Also in future when you are making requests for additional equipment such as basement doors, they should be accompanied by prices for the work from the contractor with your recommendation as to whether you consider same fair and reasonable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F.

Carrying up the 3 walls is all that is necessary and a floor which will be on a level with the main ground floor (of Assembly Hall) and still leave 16' clearance in Coal House below. 4 windows style uniform with rest of building - an outside entrance door - with wooden steps up, and one 2x8-68 door leading into Assembly Hall.\n\nNo Heating or Plumbing needed in this room. Interior finished in plain common brick walls - struck joints.

Mr. Lott to report also the necessity of having two slop sinks installed, one in each of ground and first floor corridors, 2 in all\u2014unobtrusively placed in the wall angles at the north end of each corridor.\n\nThe purpose of these sinks is for the convenient disposal of floor water, slop water.\u2014Sink wastes can be conveniently carried down partitions below.\n\nKindly advise us upon this also.

In future always when making a request of this nature include a price from the contractors for same.\n\nI would advise you that Percy A. Gorse of Salmon Arm has submitted a sample of brick, which he states the contractors wish to use in the new Lytton School. This brick appears to be of good quality, but the ends are rough. It could not be used according to the sample submitted for the work, as the rough surface would show where headers are used.

Office to Forward\nOn visiting the site of the new St. George's School to inspect the progress of the building, Mr. Dill, one of the contractors, drew my attention to the fact that a lot of accessories had been omitted from the plans, such as cupboards in the sewingroom, dormitories, and classrooms, as well as individual lockers in the basement playrooms, which are absolutely necessary as the children attending can personal belongings with them, so which they require access at certain times.\n\nThere is also no refrigerator, which is a most important factor in a school like this. This should be put in in the storeroom.\n\nThen there is no provision made for the manual training. A room for this could be placed over the coalbin at a very small cost, as it would only require the extra walls. It would not interfere in any shape or form with the class, and besides, it is of value as a manual training room; it could be used for a dressing-room when entertainments were being given by putting in a door opening into the recreation hall.\n\nI think all these things that I have mentioned will have to be put in sooner or later, and now is certainly the time to do it for they can be placed in the building for half the cost it would take if they have to be put in after the building is completed. I would therefore strongly recommend that the contractors be instructed to do this work as they go along.\n\nI am glad to report that the foundations for the building are just about completed, and they expect to start on the concrete floors in the basement this coming week.\n\nI understand that the Water Rights Branch has been instructed to attend to the water and sewer for the school, and would like to suggest that instructions be given that this work be proceeded with, with as little delay as possible.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDuncan C.

This is a big job, and the autumn is coming. Is there anyway in which they might be hurried? By renting the present concrete mixer to put in tanks would save considerable and hauling of gravel and sand with present equipment would also help out.\n\nUp to the present I have had no message re cupboards and manual training room. It will be necessary for this work to be allotted, as the runners to which the cupboards should be attached should be put in the brick wall.\n\nIf it is at all possible for you to do anything in the way of arranging a quick response concerning the above, it would be to the interest of the Department as well as to ourselves.\n\nThanking you in advance for whatever you may be able to do.

(Dominion Guaranteed) bonds of a par value of $14,000.00, to be handed over to your Department in exchange for your cheque for $13,900.00; said bonds to be held as deposit on tender in connection with the construction of St George's Indian School near Lytton, B.C., for account of Messrs Adkison & Dill Limited.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nManager, Investment Dept.\nADKISON & DILL, LIMITED\nGENERAL CONTRACTORS AND BUILDERS\n\n106-107. 319 PENDER ST.

Paget, Chief Accountant.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have the contract for the building of St. George's Indian School near Lytton, B.C., for which we gave you a marked cheque for Thirteen thousand nine hundred dollars. ($13,900.00).\n\nIn the specifications for the above building in the portion \"Instructions to Bidders\", it states that war bonds of the Dominion or Canadian National Railway bonds will be accepted as security. The bonds must be deposited in a chartered bank, subject to the order of the Deputy Superintendent-General and a certificate should be given by the Manager of the bank saying that the bonds have been deposited with him. With this information and finding that our money would lie for a considerable time with the department and no interest be paid thereon, we thought it would be good business to secure the bonds and have our money released.\n\nThe securing of the bonds we have accomplished and placed them with the Canadian Bank of Commerce in Vancouver with the request that they notify you of same and get payment for our cheque. We thought, according to the above clauses of the specification that we were quite right. We are informed by the bank, however, that you require the bonds in Ottawa and have, therefore, instructed the bank to send them to you at once. If you would please have our deposit money released to the bank immediately on receipt of the bonds, you will confer on us a great favor as at the present time we are without both our money and the bonds.\n\nThe bonds which are to be delivered to you are: Two (2) $1000.00 Dominion of Canada bonds, 5%, due 1943; these are registered in our name.\nFive thousand dollar ($5,000.00) Dominion Bearer bonds, 5%, due 1943; Four thousand dollar ($4,000.00) Canadian National, 4\u00bd%, due 1957; and Three thousand dollar ($3,000.00) Canadian National, 4\u00bd%, due 1957, making a total coverage of Fourteen thousand dollars.

Your telegram read as hereunder:\n\nOttawa, Ont. Sept. 14.\nVia Victoria, B.C.\n\nIndian Commissioner,\nCare Indian Office, Kamloops, B.C.\n\n\"Separate drain pipe to be installed for sewage from laundry and kitchen of Lytton School connected to inspection chamber on outlet pipe from septic tank. Additional pipe and manhole to be included in work under direction of Dominion Water Power Branch.\"\n\nJ.D. McLean.\n\nIn connection with this matter, I beg to say that while at Kamloops last week, Engineer Tredcroft, of the Dominion Water Power Branch, informed me as to the instructions set forth in the specifications which were not in accord with his original plan of drainage for the School. Engineer Tredcroft could understand why you did not want the water from the laundry and kitchens to pass through the main drain in the School building underneath the cement flooring, but considered that it could be carried to the outside of the building and attached to the sewer to be passed through the septic tank with the sewage from the toilets, etc. To have a separate sewer from the laundry and kitchen to be carried down a distance of about six hundred feet and connected with inspection chamber on the outlet pipe from the septic tank would entail a further expenditure of approximately $500.00 for which authority for this further expenditure must be given, if it is to be carried out as per your telegram. I am attaching hereto a pencil sketch made by Engineer Tredcroft showing where it is proposed to put in the separate drain from the kitchen and laundry and conduct the same to the outlet chamber from the septic tank. It also shows where the Engineer had proposed for this drainage to enter the main sewer outside the building above the septic tank. Mr. Tredcroft is of the opinion that the passage of the drainage from the kitchen and laundry through the sewer and out through the septic tank would not in any way affect the septic action; in fact...\nfact he considered it would be beneficial as it was most desirable to have some other drainage go through this system other than that from the toilets.\n\nI would strongly recommend that you should wire to Engineer Trederoft, who is now at Lytton, authority for this additional expenditure, which must necessarily be contracted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E.

With reference to the last paragraph of your letter regarding the placing of fire gongs in the building, I would ask you to kindly submit a price to Mr. Batter, the Inspector of Construction, for the providing and installing of a suitable fire gong on each floor of the building. It has been the practice in the past to have these fire gongs controlled from one of the staff rooms on each floor.

Two are shown in Residence Plan, of course, but they wish to know whether they are to be finished in Brick or otherwise such as Wood or Tile Mantels, and also whether Dampers are to be built in chimney throats.\n\nAs these details are not specifically mentioned they are asserting their claim to an \"Extra\" on this, but as to this I am not concerning myself in this letter.\n\nThey declared, however, their intention to omit dampers off-hand but believing this would be a mistake I have ordered that dampers be built.\nin now as chimneys are being built.\n\nTaking the viewpoint that this is not extra work, I wish to be informed as to whether it is to be finished in brick or otherwise as they are usually finished in brick.

Before these sewer pipes were installed I personally visited the new building and during an examination of the site with the contractors representative in charge of the plumbing, pointed out that outlet E shown on the accompanying plan was the proper point for the main sewer to leave the building. With this suggestion the contractor's representative at the time agreed. He did not, however, follow out this suggestion and presumably to save cost, carried the sewer pipes in 3 separate outlets A, B, and C via the shortest route, see plan.\n\nThis method as you will see from the plan will make it necessary to install manholes at each bend, as when the grading is completed, these pipes will be buried to a depth of from 8 to 10 feet in loose unstable soil and should any stoppage occur as is very probable where right angle bends have to be used it would be impossible to remove same without great expense.\n\nThe specifications did not state at what point the sewer should leave the building neither did they state whether the sewage should be brought out in 1, 2 or 3 outlets and the contractor is therefore technically speaking, working within his rights.\n\nThe sewer pipes inside the building have all been installed and most of the concrete floors laid. For this reason nothing would be gained by trying to alter the interior piping now and the only thing that can be done is to alter the proposed disposal system in the manner shown on the accompanying plan and as outlined by me during my recent conversation with you.\n\nIn view of the fact that the major portions of these alterations, i.e., those referring to the laundry and kitchen water, have already been authorized by wire from Ottawa, I presume I may carry on the whole project simultaneously and make arrangement to install the extra manholes and sewer connections immediately as there is no alternative but to put them in and any delay at this time is very inconvenient.\n\nYou will also probably remember that the specifications call for a concrete tank for rainwater to be provided by the department but up to date we have received no instructions to install same. Is it the intention of the department that we shall install this tank or will they construct it separately. It would seem to me that we are the logical people to undertake this work.\n\nThe accompanying list is an exact statement of the extra material and fittings required and I shall be obliged if\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6464, file 888-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nYou will kindly rush this material to me via C.N.R. at the earliest possible moment.

From Mr. Tredcroft's letter you will note that due to the fact that the contractor has brought the sewer pipes out at three different places from the main building, it will be necessary to connect up these outlets and provide a manhole at each right-angle connection. This is in addition to the provision of a separate pipe for the laundry waste, and the total cost of this additional work is estimated at $1600. In view of your authorization to arrange for the laundry waste connections Mr. Webb reports that this extra work is being proceeded with, as it is urgent and necessary.\n\nIn the sixth paragraph of Mr. Tredcroft's letter mention is made for a concrete tank for rain water. We have not received any instructions about that, and I shall be glad to know if you wish to have it constructed under Mr. Tredcroft's supervision.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T.

The head would be strengthened a trifle in order to look after a wider opening and the trim would be little longer on the head. However, that would be quite alright.\n\nIf you wish to have a pair of French doors in each opening all complete in place with hardware and finished to suit the rooms, the price would be Thirty-nine dollars ($39.00) per opening, or Seventy-eight dollars ($78.00) for the two.\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory,\n\nwe are\n\nYours truly,\nADKISON & DILL, LTD.,\nJCD/H\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6464, file 888-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI have been informed by the Newlett (or Newlett), that in order to make the interior arrangement of the residence (ground floor) more commendable to their requirements they have asked that the archways of living room and dining room be enlarged to 5' x 6' instead of being 4'6\" x 6'8\" (as shown on plans) and that a pair of French doors be installed in each (2 archways). They have intimated to me their wishes to use the living room (of Newlett) pretty much as a reception hall for visitors to the school.\n\nComplying to their wishes I have obtained a price for the extra work and am forwarding same to you herewith.\n\nThis is a low figure so I would recommend that said work be ordered to be carried out at this price.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nFrank W.

In this connection I would state that the installation of this tank is in my opinion advisable in view of the fact that the water which will be used in the new water supply system was analysed by the Department of Health and found to be comparatively hard (see report by Dept. of Health, your file 24705-22B).\n\nThe operation of the Lytton Indian school, which is a large institution, will necessitate a considerable amount of laundry work being undertaken each week and if a supply of soft water can be provided at what the Department would consider to be a reasonable cost there is no doubt that it would be of considerable advantage to them in their operations.\n\nThe Rev. A.R.Lett, principal of the Lytton Industrial school, when I interviewed him regarding this matter suggested that a tank having a capacity of 8000 U.S.gals be installed so that it would be possible to store water during a wet season for use during dry period, but to this suggestion I took exception on the grounds that the capacity was far too large and that in view of the fact that the laundry would undoubtedly have to be operated at least once a week and taking into consideration the average rainfall at Lytton there would be practically no chance of our ever being able to supply such a large capacity. I further stated that I do not consider that the Department would look with favour upon any very large expenditure for this purpose.\n\nI then suggested that tank having a capacity of 4000 U.S.gals.would in my opinion, be more than sufficient to supply all ordinary requirements. The Rev.Lett then stated that while he did not consider 8000 gals. to be excessive yet he realized the necessity for economy and finally agreed that a 4000 U.S.gal. tank should be requisitioned.\n\nAs stated above I consider 4000 U.S.gals. to be more than sufficient to supply their requirements but as a large part of the expenditure will be for fittings, excavation etc. which will remain the same no matter what sized tank is installed there is very little to be gained by reducing the size of this tank below 4000 U.S.gals.\n\nC.E.Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDom.Water Power & Reclamation Service,\n739 Hastings Street, West,\nVancouver, B.C.\nThe proposed tank will require to be located outside the school buildings and buried below the surface of the ground to protect it from frost which means that it will be below the level of the laundry floor, the water from this tank will, therefore have to be pumped to another small iron tank (capacity approximately 200 U.S.gals.) situated inside the laundry so that it may flow by gravity to the water heater and thence to the laundry machines.\n\nThe Rev.Lett suggested that this pumping could be carried out by a small electrically operated sump pump which could be run off the generator which supplies the school with light and power. It could also be carried out by means of a hand operated pump which could be operated by one or more of the pupils whenever necessary and which would reduce the cost of the installation. I have therefore prepared two estimates of cost, one dealing with a tank and pump operated by electricity and one with a tank and pump operated by hand.\n\nWith reference to the above I would respectfully point out that if this installation is to be carried out this year immediate action would be advisable in view of the fact that good weather cannot last very much longer and if the work must be undertaken when the temperature is much below freezing the cost will undoubtedly be increased.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) E.H.Tredcroft\nSenior Asst. Engineer\nDepartment of Health\nCanada\n\nVancouver, B.C. Sept. 21st, 1927.\n\nC.E. Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nWater Power & Reclamation,\n739 Hastings Street West,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have made a chemical analysis of a sample of water taken from Spring which is to supply the Lytton Indian School with water for domestic purposes, submitted by Colonel Whyte of your Department.\n\nThe following are the results of my examination.\n\nTotal Solids parts per million --------------- 469\nLoss on ignition ------------------------------- 54\nSilica (SiO\u2082) ---------------------------------- 17.5\nIron & Alumina, Al\u2082O\u2083, Fe\u2082O\u2083 ------------------ 77.5\nLime (CaO) ----------------------------------- 66.0\nMagnesium (MgO) ------------------------------ 32.0\nSulphates (SO\u2083) ------------------------------- 65.0\n\nTotal alkalinity before boiling expressed as calcium carbonate equals 320 parts per million.\n\nAlkalinity after boiling equals 200 parts per million. Alkalinity removed by boiling equals 120 parts per million.\n\nThis is a comparatively hard water but considerable of the hardness may be removed by boiling.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) W. A. Davidson.\n\nAnalyst in charge.\nSir:\n\nIn further reference to your letter of October 21st regarding the proposed rain water tank for the St. George's Indian Residential School at Lytton, B.C., I enclose herewith a report from Mr. Tredcroft the Resident Engineer together with a letter from Mr. Davidson, Analyst in charge of the Food and Drug Laboratory of the Department of Health, dated September 21st.\n\nYou will note that the analysis of the spring water shows that the water is comparatively hard, in fact under some names calcium carbonate content of over 300 parts per million is called very hard. Fortunately boiling removes much of the hardness, but the water even after that process can still be termed a hard water, and therefore the use of rain water for washing would be a decided advantage, and is recommended by our District Chief Engineer.\n\nIn connection with the two methods of supply submitted by Mr. Tredcroft, Mr. Webb considers that the use of a hand operated pump would be satisfactory. You will note that the tank with hand operated pump can be installed for an estimated cost of $954.00 whereas the electrically operated equipment is estimated to cost $1272.00.\n\nThe last paragraph of Mr. Tredcroft's report refers to the desirability of immediate action if this work is to be carried out this year, and I shall be glad to have your further instructions in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nMr. J. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nNovember 17th, 1927\n\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier  \nSupt. of Indian Education  \nDepartment of Indian Affairs  \nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to correspondence that passed between us a few weeks ago regarding \"Asbestoslate\" Blackboards for Indian Schools, we have just been informed by one of our agents in Vancouver that the contract for the new building to be known as the St. George's Residential School, Lytton, B.C., has been awarded to Messrs. Adkison and Dill. We understand that natural slate is specified for the blackboards, and when the Contractors were approached they could not consider changing to \"Asbestoslate\" without the approval of the Department.\n\nThis attitude is, of course, quite right, but we would like to have your approval of allowing our Canadian-made material to be installed. There will be a considerable saving in the final cost, and we are confident the boards will give many years of perfectly satisfactory service.\n\nAnother point that we think worth mentioning is the time available in which to make delivery. We believe the work has to be finished within a few weeks, and it is doubtful if natural slate could be obtained in time, whereas large stocks of \"Asbestoslate\" are available at Vancouver and can therefore be in the Contractors' possession within a matter of hours.\n\nWe would therefore greatly appreciate your co-operation in instructing Messrs. Adkison and Dill that the contract will be amended to permit the change in question.\nThanking you in anticipation,\n\nYours very truly\n\nTHE GEO. M. HENDRY CO., Limited\n\nM/B\n\nSecretary-Treasurer\nNov. 18, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to the installation of a rain water tank at the St. George's School at Lytton.\n\nIn reply I would ask you to please instruct your District Engineer to arrange for the installing of the tank as outlined in his report, the same to be operated by a hand pump. In view of the fact that we are generating our own current in this building it would not be to use a motor driven pump.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nT. Johnston, Esq.,\nDominion Water Power Branch,\nOttawa.\nNov. 18, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to the new Indian Residential School at Lytton, I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to make any changes in the slate blackboards as specified, and will expect the contractor to provide slate in accordance with the specifications.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy add Secretary.\n\nGeo. H. Hendry Co.,\n129 Adelaide St.,\nToronto, 2,\nOnt.\nDear Sir,\n\nDuring the past two weeks progress in the construction of the school has not been so greatly marked as in the preceding weeks. One or two slight delays occurred in the Bricklayer Gang, owing to slowness in brick deliveries. Bad weather has also retarded the work considerably. In the past four days wintry weather prevails, 6 inches of snow to 10 degrees of frost, so in that time no masonry work has been done. Work will be resumed however as soon as milder weather arrives.\n\nNo great interruption of work done by Carpenters, Plumbers, Steamfitters or Electricians has occurred. Greater part of the Brickwork of last story on main building of school...\nhas yet to be done.\n\nThe rear part, Assembly Hall etc., the walls are complete with exception of the Boiler chimney shaft. The contractors are hoping for the weather to moderate so that the balance of the Brickwork can be rushed or completed before winter sets in. Otherwise everything else is satisfactory.\n\nLestmar, Sir\n\nObediently Yours,\n\nFrank W. Baker\nSir:\n\nI have received your letter of the 18th instant with reference to the installation of a rain water tank at St. George's School at Lytton, B.C., and have instructed our District Chief Engineer to arrange for the installation of the tank, as outlined in Mr. Tredcroft's report, to be operated by a hand pump, the whole at an estimated cost of $954.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The most economical and satisfactory way to have this building erected would be by day labour, under the supervision of the Reverend Principal. The cost of a suitable horse barn would be $4,700 and I would recommend that the building be erected by day labour.

It is noted in your letter that the cost of the barn is estimated at \u00a34,700.00, but I think that this building should be erected under this amount, and I would, therefore, ask you to keep the expenditure as low as possible. All materials should be purchased to the best advantage, after obtaining competitive prices.\n\nI am sending you, under separate cover, time sheets, which should be kept for all labour employed on the work. Mr. Batter, who is acting as inspector of Construction, on the new school, can probably give Mr. Lett some assistance in the construction of this building, and I am today writing him asking him to do so.\n\nAn accountable cheque for the payment of labour will be sent you on application.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

J. D. McLean\n\nDear Sir,\n\nA period of wintry weather checked the progress of the contractor of the new school from the 14th to 22nd of October. With the advent of mild weather and an increased staff of workmen excellent progress is now being made.\n\nIn about 3 more days the whole of the brickwork will be completed.\n\nThe roofs of the Assembly Room, Boiler Room, Laundry, Engine Room, Manual Training Room, Kitchen (and corridor over) and the Residence roof are all ready for the felt or gravel roofing. A crew of roofing men are now at work on these roofs.\n\nOf the sheet metal work, materials and men are on the job and are putting on the galvanized iron work.\nsuit as roofs, ventilation system, rain water hoppers, flanking etc., etc., the electrical work, steam fitting & plumbing have been brought forward uniformly with rest of work.\n\nThe Electrical machinery, Engines, Dynamos have been delivered here or in dry storage until room is ready to set them up.\n\nA crew of men are working on the concrete floor work in Basement, the greater part of which has yet to be done. The floor of Boiler-room has been done so that the Boilers etc. (which are on the ground) can be installed at an early date.\n\nThe local work of the steel staircase and the fire escapes I understand is being fabricated in Vancouver but has not yet been delivered.\n\nWith a continuance of mild weather for a week or so (which is probable here) all exterior work will be finished with a greater assurance of good work being done.\n\nI remain,\n\nObediently,\n\nFrank W.

McLean\nSecretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nVery fair progress has been made on construction of new school during the past two weeks.\n\nThe brickwork has been all completed and there only remain a portion of the coping to be done which is of basalt stone or the weather got too frosty to permit of any further work on this.\n\nThe roofing has been completed in every part and all glazed window sash has been fitted & installed.\n\nThe plumbing and electric wiring has also been completed in the building.\n\nThe electric plant has also been installed complete with engines, dynamos, batteries & switch boards. (Manufactured by\nthe Lister - Brunton to England.\n\nThe roughing in of all steam piping has been completed. The steam boilers are in place, but the smoke breechings and the steam mains are not yet connected up.\n\nThe heating radiators are all in the building, but no connecting up has yet been done (for temporary heat). It is expected that this will be done in the near future. I might say here that I have forbidden any more plastering work until this has been effected.\n\nThe metal lathing have been completed and the plastering commenced with the aid of temporary heat in the shape of some salamanders. This was tried for two days but could not be continued owing to the severity of the weather. During this period I directed that a night-watchman be put on duty as a safeguard against fire.\n\nThe steel fire escapes have been installed and the steel stairways...\ncompleted, but the concrete landings have yet to be done. About 80 per cent of the concrete floors of the basement has been finished. The remainder will be left until the building can be steam heated. A large amount of shiplap ceiling has been put up ready for receiving the metal ceiling and all the grounds for receiving interior finish woodwork are ready, for the plastering which will follow.\n\nThe work as a whole is being carried out in a satisfactory manner. I might add here that the steam heating men will work through the holiday season in order to get steam heat on at an early date next year. The remainder of the work may shut down for short period, maybe 2 weeks.\n\nFinishing that this will be satisfactory.\n\nI remain Obediently Yours,\n\nFrank W. Baker\nInspector\nDec. 21, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 19th instant, with reference to the drainage and water connections required for the laundry machinery at the new St. George's School, I beg to advise you that the Department will expect the contractor to make all of these connections, as the specifications require that the laundry machinery is to be supplied and put in place, and it is not necessary to specify particularly as to the drainage and water supply as the laundry machinery would not work without them.\n\nWith reference to your telegram of the 19th, please advise the contractors that the Department will not consent to any postponement in the carrying out of their contract, and they must provide satisfactory heat for the building, and carry on the work in order to complete their contract in the time specified.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

E.

T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM H. GRAHAM, INDIAN AGENT,\nLYTTON, B. C., His No. 1-06, dated Dec. 20, 1927.\n\nThe new building, which he has set his heart on, is giving him a great deal of worry at the present time, owing to the fact that there are a great number of small things which are being left out, and which will throw a great responsibility upon him, after it is occupied, such as the lack of refrigeration. In a hot climate like we have here in summertime, there is no provision made for keeping food, making it very bad. Throughout the school there is practically no provision made for any storeroom. Storm windows will have to be taken off, and there is not a single place to put them. No provision is made for clothes, in the line of closets or storerooms. No provision is made for the children's grips which will have to be put under the beds. None of these things tend to help him, and with the finances as they are today, it all tends to get on his nerves.\nJan. 4, 1928.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to the portion of your letter of the 20th ultimo, with reference to the new Lytton School, I beg to say with reference to the items referred to regarding the building as follows:\n\n**REFRIGERATOR.** It has been the practice of the Department to provide a separate building, either an ice house utilizing a refrigerator in the building or a small cold storage where the refrigerator is built directly in the ice house.\n\nWith reference to the provision for store rooms, I am sure that Mr. Lett will find when he comes to occupy the building that he will have ample space for storage. I would further point out that the plans were approved by him before the building was commenced.\n\nI have already advised him that when we are arranging for the furnishings for this building that the necessary cupboards will be built in the dormitories and other places where it is necessary to provide accommodation for clothes, grips, etc. It would be well for Mr. Lett to consult with our Inspector of Construction regarding the size, type and location of the cupboards which he would like built in the dormitories and other places, and forward sketches of same to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst. Deputy Secretary.\nIndian Affairs Dept.,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn the 3rd inst., it became necessary for us to close down the work on the St. George's Indian School at Lytton, B.C., on account of the men all leaving for the holidays with no intention of being back before the first of the year.\n\nWe regret to state, however, that the weather has been so cold up there and apparently is continuing so, that it may be necessary for us to remain closed down until conditions materially moderate. The men working on the heating plant, however, will continue and expect to have same in working condition the second week in January or so. If, however, the temperature at that time is considerably below zero as it has been, we think it will hardly be safe to put water into the system in the building. If such is the case it will be impossible for us to start until the temperature rises, and we have a reasonable assurance that we will not be caught again with frigid weather.\n\nWe have carried through up to the present point at great expense to ourselves, the last six weeks of building and have the building entirely closed in, roof on, windows all in and hung and doors boarded up. All partitions are in and all metal lath on. Part of the plastering is done but we found it necessary to stop this work as the frost was too hard.\n\nWe regret very much that it seems impossible now to finish the building within the specified time in February, but, trust on account of conditions you will be willing to allow us the additional time necessary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nADKISON & DILL, LTD.,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6464, file 888-5, part 2)\nLYTTON, BC., JAN., 4 1927.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\n\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nREFERENCE ADKINSON AND DILLS LETTER CLOSING DOWN CONSTRUCTION SUGGEST YOU WIRE THEM TAKING STEPS AT ONCE TO STEAM HEAT BUILDING THAT INTERIOR WORK MAY PROCEED CONDITION RELEASING THEIR PAYMENT CERTIFICATE WEATHER NOW MODERATING CONDITIONS AT OLD SCHOOL DEMAND EARLY COMPLETION.\n\nF.G.

The contract in question calls for the payment to mechanics, labourers, etc., of such wages as are generally accepted as current from time to time during the continuance of the contract for competent workmen in the district in which the work is being performed. It is further declared that the Minister of Labour may at any time and from time to time determine for the purpose of the contract what are the current or fair and reasonable rates of wages. In the present case enquiry has been made by the Fair Wages Officer of the Department of Labour which shows that the current rate of wages for carpenters is the same as that in Vancouver, namely, $7.50 per day, whereas it is represented to us that your firm is paying a rate of wages of $7.00 per day for this class of service.\n\nUnder the authority of the labour conditions of the contract, I am writing you to say that a rate of wages of $7.50 per day must be observed for carpenters on this building and that settlement must be made to individual carpenters who have received less than this rate for the amounts which may be severally due them, covering the full period of their employment.\n\nI should be glad to have word that this ruling is being put into effect.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMinister of Labour.\n\nMessrs.

Lett,\nPrincipal, Lytton Indian Residential School,\nDated December 29, 1927.\n\nI shall have approximately $1500.00 left over from the appropriation towards the building of the new horse barn and if possible this could be used to very great advantage in building a root and apple cellar which we very badly need.\n\nI would also like to do the grading as soon as possible so that I can get seeds and shrubbery planted. This will take about $300.00. Together with the necessary fencing of playgrounds and vegetable garden and the above grading an expenditure of approximately $500.00 should cover all this work.\nJanuary 16, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nThis is to inform you that the Reverend Mr. Lett is being authorized to expend the sum of $1,200 in the preparation of a root and apple cellar at the St. George's Indian Residential School. It is understood that competitive prices will be secured before purchasing the materials necessary. He is also being authorized to incur an expenditure of $500 in connection with grading around the main building, planting shrubbery and fencing the playgrounds and vegetable garden. You should certify to all accounts before forwarding them to the Department for payment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.

Competitive prices should be secured before purchasing materials and the accounts should be given to Mr. Indian Agent Graham for his certificate. You may also expend $500 in connection with grading around the new building, planting shrubbery and fencing the playgrounds and vegetable garden.\n\nI may say that it is possible the New England Company will have a representative at the official opening of the new building. I have informed them that, at the present time, June 15th appears to be a suitable date for the ceremony. I intend to place a brass tablet in the main entrance, for the purpose of recording the Company's interest in and connection with the institution.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Sir,\n\nWith reference to the providing of suitable cold storage accommodation at the new Lytton School, I would point out that either of two systems can be installed. The first consists of the building of a large ice house and placing one or more refrigerators in the building to be filled with ice from the ice house. The alternative scheme would be to build a small cold storage plant, which is so constructed that there is a cooling chamber approximately 6 x 6 with a 7' ceiling. The ice is then placed in the building surrounding the ice chamber, and this room is used for the storage of food. Food can be kept for the same length of time as in the ordinary refrigerator. I would be glad to have your views as to what accommodation you require.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. A. R.

Is it the wish of the Dept. that this amount of gravel and sand (1100 yds gravel 750 yds of sand) should be given free of charge? I do not wish to be brought into the business of the Dept., but it seems to me that a just charge of at least 20 cts per yard should be asked for and a bill to this effect forwarded to the Contractor direct from the Dept.\n\nThis gravel and sand has all been taken from School property and personally I do not see why the Dept. should not benefit to the amount of $350.00.\n\nIt may seem a small amt to you but believe me the School could well afford to use this amt. and I would myself bill the Contractor but as it is not my business I am taking this opportunity of placing the matter before you so that you can deal with it as you see fit.\n\nThe damage to the property alone is considerable as he has in washing the gravel run the wash over one of my best fields in spite of the fact that I repeatedly approached his foreman re same.

W.\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nJanuary 5th., 1928\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nRe: Erection of Indian Residential School - Lytton, B.C.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nWe enclose herewith copy or letter from the Minister of Labour to us in connection with the rate paid to carpenters on the above school and also copy of our letter in answer to this.\n\nWe wish here to advise that when figuring this building we enquired of the rates being paid to carpenters and other mechanics in that district and all up the line. We found that in Chilliwack they were paying from $5.50 to $6.50 per day. Kamloops being the largest centre actually in the Lytton district, we found that the wages paid carpenters were from $6.00 to $6.50 per day. We, therefore, figured our job at $6.50 for carpenters, believing that to be the proper rate to be paid. We found, however, about the time of starting this work that the men in Kamloops would soon be asking for a raise in wages to $7.00. We, therefore, started our work off at that price wishing to have no controversy in the matter. We are, therefore, as you will see, out fifty cents 50\u00a2 per day on every carpenter we have employed on the job.\n\nIf the letter from the Department of Labour is to be followed and the men paid $7.50 per day, we think it will be only right that the department should pay this difference and not ourselves as we have already gone half way at a loss to ourselves.\n\nWe do not see, however, that the department can possibly be correct in their assumption that $7.50 should be paid in this district. It is true we found out only a few weeks ago that Mr. Harrison, the fair wage officer of Vancouver had struck a rate of wages for this work being practically that which is paid in Vancouver. We, however, at the time of figuring and not until a few weeks ago were not cognizant of that fact.\nand there is no rate of wages stated in the specifications or any of the papers coming from your department at the time of figuring this work, merely a reference to wages usually accepted in the district which we have followed and done one better by paying the men 50\u00a2 per day more than seemed right at that time and fully the amount which actually exists today in that district.\n\nWe ask that you will take this matter up with the Minister of Labour and if found necessary to pay the other 50\u00a2 per day, we trust that you will make it up to us.\n\nWe assure you, however, this objection has not come from any of our men but is merely the work of an agitator in the City of Vancouver.\n\nTrusting you will give this matter your immediate attention and greatly oblige\n\nYours truly,\n\nADHISON & DILL, LTD.\n\nPer\n\nJ.C.D./H\n\nEnclos:\nJanuary 11, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Ward,\n\nI enclose a copy of a letter just received from Adkison & Dill, Limited of Vancouver.

Baker\nAGENCY\nSt. George's Indian School\nLytton, B.C.\n\nInspector of Construction Report\ncovering Dec 15 - 31st 1927\n\nMr. J D Maclean\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir,\n\nConstruction work on new school during last 2 weeks of Dec was considerably slowed down on account of extremely cold weather. A considerable amount of the stone coping, stone roof had to be left unfinished.\n\nThe tar & gravel has been completed also all the galvanized iron flashings or all other gal iron work. The plastering work could not go on owing to lack of proper heat but the second floor was partly plastered (first coat).\n\nThe Steel Stairs or fire escape has been completed and is a most substantial or satisfactory job.\n\nAs regard the carpentry work all glazed window sash have\nbeen fitted or installed in place. The greater part of the simple ceilings have been put up ready to receive metal ceiling and all grounds for receiving finishing wood work are all done. No further progress can be made now without steam heat being put into use. Regret to report that the contractors have not to date made any attempt to heat the building in any way, declining to go to such expense. They are waiting until the severe cold of the present time is past. I have forbidden any further plastering or cement work until steam heat makes use of (Dec 13). Men from the steam heat contractor are here working on boilers and radiators getting them ready for use within a few days about Jan 8 or 9th. There will be no reason then for any further delay. I shall report to you again around that date as to whether they comply with these requirements. Obediently Yours,\n\nFrank W.

R. LETT,\nPrincipal.\nExtract from letter of Rev. A. R. Lett,\nPrincipal, Lytton Indian Residential School,\nDated December 29, 1927.\n\nI have looked forward with enthusiasm to the new school and as it is now nearing completion, I am hoping for a new lease of life. While this is so, yet there are coming difficulties, and if these are not given immediate attention there will be unavoidable leakages which I do not want nor can I afford same. There has no provision been made for refrigeration, which, as you know, we cannot do without. We have an ample supply of meat on the farm and also milk and eggs which are perishable. If it is at all possible provision should be made for this before the warm weather sets in which in this part comes about the middle of April.\n\nThe new school is provided with storm sash, and where these are to be stored for the summer months I do not know. Storage room for these should be provided with as little delay as possible as to house them without lock and key would mean destruction to the glass and necessitate a probable heavy expenditure before again replacing them for the winter.\n\nThere is also the storage of overplus, such as children's private clothing, extra school clothing, bedding and equipment. These are articles which cannot be allowed to toss about in any old fashion and must be looked after in order to avoid unnecessary leakages.\nLYTTON BC 14\n\nJ D MCLEAN\n\nDEPT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS OTTAWA ONT\n\nCONSTRUCTION OF NEW ST GEORGES SCHOOL LYTTON PROCEEDING\n\nSATISFACTORILY HEATING PLANT IN OPERATION RELEASE ADKISON AND\n\nDILLS FIFTH CERTIFICATE\n\nBATER.\nJan. 13, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nIt has been brought to the attention of the Department that the contractors for the new St. George's School at Lytton have been using gravel and sand off the school property, and it is thought that they should be charged a reasonable amount for this material, at least 20 cents per cubic yard, the same to be paid directly to the Department. It has been pointed out that the damage to the property has been considerable, and could have been avoided if reasonable precautions had been taken. The Department will expect the contractors to make good any damage.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nFrank Rater, Esq.,\nInspector of Construction,\nSt. George's School,\nLytton, B.C.\nJan. 13, 1928.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the fourth instant, with reference to the gravel used by the contractors for the new school I am today advising Mr. Rater, the Inspector, that he should collect for the Department at the rate of 20 cents per cubic yard for all of the gravel used. I have also advised him that the Department will expect the contractors to make good any damage which they have caused to the fields.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Mr. Lett,\nPrincipal, St. George's School,\nLytton, B.C.\nMr. H. Graham,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nSTORAGE ROOMS: In the Secretary's correspondence to you concerning additional storage room at the new school, also refrigerator, I might point out that I have always criticised the new building for lack of storage room, and cannot now see where the storage room for children's private property is to be found, or for the surplus school clothing. I have also to ask where I am going to store the storm sash to be stored, and I do not think it would be the proper thing for me to store same in the barn loft, or in some other place where the glass is liable to be broken. A proper building for these and other articles should be erected without delay, and would suggest that a building 20x30 be placed in a convenient place, and used only for this purpose, the building to be frame and stuccoed on the outside, which would be in keeping with the main buildings.\n\nREFRIGERATOR: The cold storage should be of a type that would carry our necessities without having to depend on ice, as the weather conditions here, do not warrant this always. Our ice for the year has run us into the enormous sum of from six to eight hundred dollars, so that the expenditure in three years would put up an ammonia plant, which would relieve all future difficulties in this way. There are on the ground a number of tiles, which I am sure could be purchased from the contractor, at cost plus freight, and which could be used to advantage.\n\nSKETCHES: As an alternative, there is in the basement, one of the storerooms, which could be used, even though it would reduce our storage capacity in this part of the building. We cannot enter on the summer without refrigeration, and if this work could now be undertaken, it would take away a possible great leak.\n\nThe sketches for the cupboards, shelves and tables, will go forward to the Department, with estimates of cost, as only yesterday the Inspector and myself completed same.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(Signed) A. R. Lett,\nPrincipal.\nLytton, B. C.,\nJan. 10, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated January 4, unnumbered, with reference to refrigeration and storage rooms at the new St. George's Residential School, and am now enclosing a letter from the Rev. Mr. Lett, which will speak for itself.\n\nHe and the Inspector have been working on the sketches and cost for cupboards, etc., which will be forwarded to you later on.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Graham\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssist. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHG/MD\nOttawa,\nJanuary 17, 1928.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nI have received your letter of the 11th instant enclosing a communication from Adkinson & Dill, Limited, of Vancouver, contractors for the Indian School at Lytton, B.C., regarding the directions which were given to them recently by the Minister of Labour in relation to the proper rate of wages payable to carpenters employed on this work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.

McLean,\n\nIn reporting the progress of the construction work of the new school, I would say that a satisfactory recommendation has been made after the long winter layoff of the greater number of the workmen. The delay was caused primarily by the contractors' failure to get their steam heating plant installed and put into use at an earlier date. The plastering could not be done nor any concrete work as severe frosty weather had set in.\n\nThe steam heating plant is now being used and almost all the radiators connected, warming the building. Plastering is now proceeding satisfactorily; this work is being done in a first-class manner.\n\nI might mention here that I wired you on the 14th to this effect and asked at the same time, on behalf of the...\ncontractors that you release their fifth payment certificate.\n\nA carload of coal has been delivered at the school by the contractors as fuel for the boilers and a man here with papers to fire them.\n\nGenerally speaking things are going along very satisfactorily now and can keep going regardless of weather conditions.\n\nThere is now no reason why rapid progress be made from now on.\n\nObediently Yours,\n\nFrank W.

It was, therefore, impossible for the General contractors or any of the sub-trades to cover any finish for this room and if same has to be tiled, it certainly will be necessary that we be paid for same. As the room is already arranged for cement base we would not figure to carry the tile below that line and the price for the whole room in glazed tile same as for kitchen will be Seven hundred and forty-two dollars. ($742.00).\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory to the department and that we may receive your order, we are\n\nYours Truly,\n\nADKISON & DILL, LTD.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6464, file 888-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSt-Georges Indian Residential School\n\nLyton Jan 28\n\nMr H Gueney O.C.\nArchitect\nDept of Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn accordance with your instructions received in a letter to me Sept 9 respecting the finish of the walls of Laundry in which you express your desire to have walls finished as in Kitchen - in glazed Tile. I thereupon duly instructed the contractors to have the walls so finished.\n\nThe contractors Adkison & Dill, Ltd., now assert that they are entitled to be paid extra for the work in Laundry as it is not - they say - specifically mentioned in specifications. I enclose their letter to me in reference to this, saying it will cost \u00a3742 00\n\nwhether they can maintain this stand or not I do not know.\n\nBut even if this work was an extra I would say that it is an excessive\nI may I would suggest having both the Kitchen & Laundry Tiled to 4\u00bd ft high from floor finished with a dado. The remainder finished in ordinary plaster and deduct from contract the cost of tiling the remainder at the rate of $14 25\u00a2 per yd., which is the rate he is charging for tiling scullery. This would save the Depart. $834 25\u00a2 by the omission of 58 yds. of tiling in Kitchen alone.\n\nTiling the scullery in this manner which would only be 3ft.6 plus 12 in cement base would cost $288 34\u00a2 which would leave $550 76\u00a2 against this would be charge the cost of plastering the upper 3ft.6 in. of wall and wood trim or windows\u2014or finish without trim possibly.\n\nI could recommend this plan as there is such a number of steam mains and other piping through the upper part of walls that a good job in tiling could scarcely be done.\n\nFrom Mr. Baker\nfigure. As the skylight is only 12 x 14 - 9 feet and there is a 12 inch cement base around it - 468 sq ft openings included - it works out at $14 25 per sq. super.\n\nWhat a fair price would be - I cannot say at this moment.\n\nShould they have grounds for support of their contention, I would suggest that they be ordered to finish walls in White Cement, Plaster, with wood trim around openings as in Dining Room.\n\nHowever, if the intention to have walls finished as in Kitchen is shown to be contained in specifications or included in contract, kindly advise me by wire.\n\nObediently yours,\n\nFrank W.

McLean, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 17, 1928.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nRe Carpenters' Wage Rate\nIndian School, Lytton, B.C.\n\nMy attention has been directed to a communication which has been addressed by your firm to the Department of Indian Affairs in relation to the subject matter of my letter to you of the 27th ultimo. I have read the contents of your letter carefully and am sorry if your tender for the work was based on a lower rate of wages than you have found it necessary to pay. I note that you were not furnished until recently with a schedule of current wages rates which had been prepared by Mr. Harrison, our Fair Wages Officer at Vancouver.\n\nThe contract with your firm does not contain any fair wages schedule, but does contain a fair wages clause providing that all persons employed in the construction of the work shall be paid such wages as are generally accepted as current from time to time during the continuance of the contract for competent workmen in the district in which the work is being performed for the character or class of work in which they are respectively engaged; and if there be no current wages in such district, then fair and reasonable rates.\n\nThe Fair Wages Officer who investigated the complaint in regard to the carpenters' wage rate on the Lytton school, found that the men of this trade who are employed have been brought from Vancouver and that Vancouver rates are applicable for carpenters as far east as Lytton and indeed are being paid a hundred miles further from Vancouver on work which is being done for the Provincial Government at Tranquille.\n\nAfter giving consideration to the statements contained in your letter, I do not find any reason to change the direction which was given in my earlier communication, and would ask that this ruling be put into effect without further delay in accordance with the requirements of the Fair Wage Clause of your contract.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPETER HUTCHINSON\nMinister of Labor.\n\nMossman, Adkins & Dill, Ltd.\n116 Pender St., West,\nVancouver, B.C.\nADKISON & DILL, LIMITED\nGENERAL CONTRACTORS AND BUILDERS\n\n106-107, 319 PENDER ST. W.\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nFebruary 15th, 1928\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nCanada.\n\nRe Carpenter's Rates - Indian School.\n\nArchitect\n\nWe wrote you on January 5th, in reference to a communication we had received from the Minister of Labor with the request that you take up the matter of carpenters' wages with him. Since then, you advise us has been done but we have not heard anything further from the Department urging that the difference in the wages be made up to $7.50 per day for each carpenter. We are, therefore, writing you to know what your attitude is in the matter. From our former letter it must be perfectly obvious to you that it is impossible for us to pay the increased wage out of our own funds.\n\nWe certainly followed the letter of your specification in figuring the job and not beyond the spirit of your specification in saying the ten $7.50 per day instead of $7.50 being the amount on which we based our estimates.\n\nIf, however, the government desires that a higher wage shall be paid than that which we could reasonably estimate, then we think the government, through the department involved, will surely have to make up that difference. It makes no difference at all to us how much we have to pay the men so long as we have been able to figure that amount into our estimates, and if you feel like allowing the difference to the men, we certainly will be pleased to distribute the amount when ratified by you. I give you all the names and the amount of time worked so that it could be handled direct from your department if you so wish.\n\nIn reference to the second clause in the Minister of Labor's letter, copy of which we enclose, he states that all the men who are employed have been brought from Vancouver. Would say it is possible that most of the men came from Vancouver, but, we did not bring them.\nThey were hired on the job at Lytton, paying their own way there. It is only the fact that our head office is in Vancouver that Vancouver carpenters have easy access to us. Had we been contractors for Kamloops, for instance, this question never could have risen and we must maintain that we are in the same position.\n\nThe Minister of Labor refers to the Provincial Government building at Tranquill, on which they are paying $7.50 to carpenters. This, we understand, is quite true, but you must note that the Tranquill contract was let quite a time after ours and in addition to that the Provincial Government took the precaution to state the amount of wages that were to be paid to carpenters, thus eliminating any necessity for the contractors to discover for themselves what rate was being paid in the district.\n\nTrusting that you will either ratify the increased payment or take this matter up with the department of labor further and have it eliminated, which, we think, as a matter of fact would be the better plan as we must assure you that all men being hired on the job knew well the wages that were being paid and agreed to same without question.\n\nWe are\n\nYours truly,\n\nADISON & DILL, LTD.,\nPer\n\nP.S.

I then suggested that an Ammonia plant should be installed similar to the one in the Kamloops Indian school. This plant would prove of greater satisfaction and more economical both to us and to the Dept. With an expenditure of some five to eight hundred dollars each year for ice and the wear and tear of trucks hauling same three miles from the station it would seem that a permanent plant should be installed. The initial expenditure for the plant would be paid for in two or three years' cost of ice without taking into consideration the cost of erecting such a building you speak of. I would not hesitate a moment in accepting your suggestion were we assured of harvesting ice in the river here, but as this is very remote, it is inevitable to saddle us with additional expenditure if it can at all be avoided. We could then make our own ice necessary for kitchen refrigeration and be assured of proper keeping of meat and other perishable foods.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nThe Deputy Superintendent General wrote me that the sum of $1200.00 had been authorized for the purpose of building a root and apple cellar, and $500.00 in connection with grading around the new St. George's School.\n\nAs this work has been started and there will be pay-lists coming in almost at any time now I will be obliged if the Department will forward me a cheque for the same to defray these expenses.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\n(H.

Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the last instant, with reference to the providing of cold storage at the new St. George's Indian Residential School, I beg to say that it will be impossible to install a plant similar to the one at the Kamloops School, as we would not have sufficient power from our electric lighting plant to satisfactorily operate same. As you probably know the Kamloops School is connected up with the power lines at Kamloops, and they have all the electric power required to operate such machinery. The only type of mechanical refrigeration that could be installed at your school would be one of the models similar to the Frigidaire, and this would be, as you know, directly connected up with a suitable refrigerator. Mr. Pitchburn arranged recently for the installation of one of these outfits at the Sechelt Indian Residential School, and if you would communicate with him he could probably advise you if same is giving satisfaction. You might look into the matter, and let me have your recommendation, as to the size you think suitable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. A. R.

A copy of a report on the subject from Mr. Tradcroft, Engineer-in-Charge of this work, to our District Chief Engineer is enclosed for your consideration. This report recommends installing a water-softening apparatus at an approximate cost of $1,000.00 instead of a rain water tank at an estimated cost of $654.00; the water softening apparatus would, of course, apply to all the water used in the school building. Mr. Tradcroft asks to have this matter placed before you as soon as possible and a decision communicated by wire through this office so that the work, whether the decision is to build a rain water tank or install a water-softening apparatus, may be completed during the present month. I shall be glad if you will advise me in regard to this at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of November 14th, 1927, enclosing copy of telegram from the Director of Water Power authorizing the installation of a concrete rain-water tank at the Lytton Industrial School, I wish to state that work on this project was delayed owing to the fact that I considered it advisable to make some further recommendations to you in this regard before proceeding with the installation.\n\nThe idea of a concrete rain-water tank originated, I believe, with the principal of the Industrial School at Lytton, who was anxious to obtain a supply of soft water for use in the school laundry, and when an estimate of the cost of this tank was requested by the Department, no account was taken of the hardness of the water which would be supplied to the boilers and hot water system in the new building.\n\nI now find, on further careful examination, that during recent years endless trouble and expense has been experienced in the old school building owing to the pipes, boilers, tubes, radiators, etc., being corroded on the inside with layers of lime and magnesia, caused through the use of excessively hard water; and unless some steps are taken to remedy this condition the same trouble will undoubtedly be experienced with the new heating plant.\n\nI would therefore like to point out that if the Department is prepared to authorize an expenditure of $954.00 in order to supply soft water for laundry purposes, it would be far more economical to abandon the idea of a concrete rain-water tank and install a water softening apparatus having a capacity of 20 U.S. g.p.m., and which would soften the entire amount of water which will be used in the hot water heating system.\n\nThe cost of this installation would amount to approximately $1,000.00, which is practically the same as the cost of the proposed rain-water tank, (i.e. $954.00) and would have the advantage that whereas the rain-water tank would only supply water for laundry purposes, and the intermittently if the rainfall was light, a water softening apparatus would take care of the whole hot water heating system, and a full supply of soft water for all purposes would be available at any season of the year.\n\nC. E. Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDom. Water Power & Rec. Service,\nVancouver, B.C.\nThe cost of operating this water-softening apparatus, assuming that a total of 2,000 U.S. gallons of hot water would be used per day (which amount is ample to supply all ordinary needs in an institution of this kind) would amount to less than 80\u00a2 per day, including the cost of salt, minerals, etc., and this expenditure would be offset many times over in the saving effected in repairs to boilers, hot water system, and the use of soap in the laundry, kitchen, etc.\n\nI would therefore respectfully recommend that in place of a concrete rain-water tank being constructed as originally suggested, a zeolite water softener having a capacity of 20 U.S. g.p.m. continuous flow be substituted in its place, which apparatus, I am convinced, would prove far more satisfactory and economical in every way.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. H. Tredcroft\nSenior Assistant Engineer.\nMarch 8, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to the supplying of soft water for the new St. George's Indian Residential School, at Lytton, and in reply to say that I approve of the recommendation of your District Chief Engineer that a water softening apparatus be installed in place of the concrete rain water tank already authorized, as it is noted that there is very little difference in the cost of the water softener.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

F. MacKenzie,\nActing, Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nFrank W. Bater, Esq.,\nInspector of Construction,\nLytton, B. C.\nDear Sir,\n\nReporting the progress of construction of new school so far is considerable amount of general finishing has still to be done before the building can be said to be completed.\n\nThe present amount of remaining work lies in the painting & varnishing which will take 2 weeks or so to complete. There is still a small amount of carpentry finishing - fitting on small hardware fittings & some odds & ends of finishing or refinishing & cleaning up. Plumbing & steam fitting will take a few more days.\n\nContractors are pushing along all lines of work without any cessation in any part; as far as possible. They are somewhat handicapped by the long distance from any source of supply of materials & labor when\nThe Electricians have the greater part of their work done\u2014most of the lamps or fixtures in place.\n\nThe engines & generators of electric plant have been run a few times but has not yet been thoroughly tried out, chiefly owing to a refusal of all parties to supply gasoline for engines.\n\nThe Heating plant has been well tested, same has been in use for some time & is in satisfactory shape.\n\nSame thing applies to the plumbing.\n\nThe insulation covering of Boiler & steam main has been finished but must mention that the small steam laundry boiler or jacket heater or the hot water storage tank has not be so covered as the contractors maintain that this work is not in their specifications for those parts, & have refused to do it, as it is not specifically mentioned. I cannot compel them to do it.\n\nI expect however to be able to report entire a satisfactory completion of the building at the end of the month.\n\nI remain\n\nObediently yours,\n\nFrank W.

Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 1st instant, with reference to the providing of cold storage at the new St. George's Indian Residential School, I beg to say that it will be impossible to install a plant similar to the one at the Kamloops School, as we would not have sufficient power from our electric lighting plant to satisfactorily operate same. As you probably know the Kamloops School is connected up with the power lines at Kamloops, and they have all the electric power required to operate such machinery. The only type of mechanical refrigeration that could be installed at your school would be one of the models similar to the Frigidaire, and this would be, as you know, directly connected up with a suitable refrigerator. Mr. Ditchburn arranged recently for the installation of one of these outfits at the Sechelt Indian Residential School, and if you would communicate with him he could probably advise you if same is giving satisfaction. You might look into the matter, and let me have your recommendation, as to the size you think suitable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. A. R. Lett,\nPrincipal, St. George's Indian School,\nLytton, B. C.\nIn the Dairy Products Industry refrigerating machinery has proven to be of immense value. Absolute control of temperature in storage rooms and freezer rooms, chilling of brine for ice cream freezers and the maintaining of low temperatures in ice cream hardening rooms are the principal functions of refrigerating machinery in this industry.\n\nCold Storage design and construction for the storage of food products in general is a class of work which we are well qualified to build. Special types of refrigerating plants such as Fur Storages, Oil Cooling, Water Cooling, etc., are to be found in our list of installations.\n\nWhen contemplating changes or an entire new plant we would urge you to avail yourself of our consulting service embracing our many years of experience in designing and installing an increasingly large number of plants of all types.\nWhen writing to us for Quotations please include information along the lines indicated on this page\n\n1.

As a result of this policy it can be readily appreciated that we have gathered no little amount of data and information in our many years of experience in building an increasingly large number of refrigerating and ice making equipments for various industries.\n\nThis bulletin has been prepared for those who are interested in the smaller sizes of refrigerating and ice making plants and in the following pages brief descriptions and illustrations are given of the compressor and component parts of the so called \"high pressure side\", the Vilter self contained units, the coil work or \"low pressure side\", ice tanks, brine tanks, ammonia fittings, etc., all to the end that those who are contemplating the installation of equipment of this class may be enabled to form a comprehensive idea as to what we have to offer.\n\nThe Vilter Manufacturing Company\n\nMILWAUKEE. WISCONSIN.\nBuilt in various sizes from one to eighteen tons of refrigeration (Standard Rating) (A.S.R.F. Code). All sizes being of the same general design, described and illustrated in the following pages. This VILTER ammonia compressor is a logical development of our many years experience in the construction of this class of machinery and has resulted in a very successful unit. It has proven to be very economical and reliable in operation requiring but a minimum of attention. It is made of high grade materials carefully assembled, tested and finished prior to shipment.\nTHE FRAME\n\nThe twin cylinder frame is made of semi-steel and combines the crankcase, cylinders, outboard bearing, and water jacket in one integral casting. The metal is amply thick, of a dense strong composition and the design is one with a low center of gravity thus assisting in securing stability of operation. The base of the frame is provided with a lip around the edge and in addition the base has an opening through it in the central part which admits of grouting being poured under the base at this point.\n\nIn the manufacture of the frame the casting is first carefully cleaned and sand blasted to remove any imbedded foundry sand before any machine work is started. For the accomplishment of the machine work on the frame specially designed machine tools are utilized which not only permit of many operations being performed at one setting of the frame but also insures absolute alignment of the cylinders with reference to the crank shaft. After the frame casting has been machined it is tested under air pressure to make sure that it is absolutely tight. As shown on the opposite page the frame is provided with a large hand hole in the base which is placed there to permit of inspection and adjustment of the crank pin bearings.\n\nLUBRICATION\n\nProper lubrication of the compressor is obtained in part by means of the splash system. The crank case is filled with oil to a point indicated on the oil gauge and the the churning of the crank shaft and connecting rods splash oil up on to the cylinder walls and up into the basins which are a part of the frame and which introduce the oil into the end bearing and also to the bearings where the stuffing box is located. Attention is invited to the oil lantern in the stuffing box into which oil is introduced by means of an oil duct coming from the crank case. The horizontal ring which supports the flywheel is lubricated by means of an oil ring which rides on top of the shaft. The lower portion of this oil ring is immersed in oil and this oil is continually brought to the top of the bearing when the compressor is in operation. Provision is made for draining the oil from this bearing whenever desired. To insure positive lubrication of the piston pins oil tubes carrying oil pumps on the lower ends are fastened to the connecting rods. When the compressor is operated oil is constantly carried from the crank case up to the piston pins by means of this device, thus insuring proper lubrication.\n\nBEARINGS\n\nThe bearings for the crank shaft and crank pins are all die cast and made of high grade Babbitt Metal. The bearings in the piston ends of the connecting rods consist of accurately finished close grain cast iron bushings pressed into the connecting rod ends. The design of all the bearings is such that large bearing surfaces are obtained which together with the thorough lubrication obtained results in a compressor which will function extremely well over a very long period of time.\nTHE SUCTION VALUE\n\nThe suction valve is our plate type of valve, the same as is now placed in all of our compressors. As seen in the figure it is made of one or more thin steel rings hardened and ground down to a perfect surface. These rings are held in place by light helical springs, and all is safely secured within two caps fastened together by a special machine screw. The method of construction and the manner in which the valve is secured in the piston eliminates the possibilities of a part ever falling into the cylinder.\n\nThe suction valve is located in the piston and is made as large as conditions will allow. The gas is drawn into the cylinder during the down stroke and the change of direction of piston movement, augmented by the spring, closes the valves. As the valve is held flexibly and is ground to a surface, there is no loss of ammonia by leakage past the valve.\n\nTHE VALVES\n\nSome of the greatest losses in ammonia compressors are in the type of valve used. For best economy the suction line on the indicator card should coincide with the suction pressure outside the cylinder in the suction header. This is a physical impossibility assumed as it requires some drop of pressure in order to make the gas flow from the header to the cylinder. In order to decrease this loss of pressure to a minimum the valves must be light, of little inertia, and easily operated. The valve parts must be straight and the ports and the valve openings must be ample in cross sectional area.\n\nTHE DISCHARGE VALVE\n\nThe discharge valve is also of the plate valve construction, although in a modified form. It consists of a plate valve with a cylindrical recess which makes a tight running fit on its inside with a projecting lug in the safety head of the compressor. The valve is held flexibly in place by a light helical spring. By means of our special patented construction this valve will operate with practically no noise.\n\nThe discharge valve is made single or in multiple depending on the size compressor; this is done to secure the necessary area. The safety head construction is used which permits of a very small clearance being obtained and also insures safety in operation.\nCONNECTING ROD\n\nIn the manufacture of our connecting rods the greatest care is taken. Special machinery is used for the boring and reaming of the ends. The rods are made of cast steel with a strong H section and are fitted with a cast iron bushing on the piston end and a die cast pure Babbitt Metal bearing on the crank end. Special attention has been given to lubrication and ample oil holes and grooves have been provided.\n\nTHE PISTON\n\nThe piston which is of the trunk type with ample space between the two parts for clearance opposite the suction gas inlet is made of semi-steel and ground to a micrometer fit. It is carefully fitted with the required number of piston rings of a high grade type to insure the proper functioning of the piston. The top part of the piston carries the suction valve and the lower part of the piston carries the piston pin which is made of a special hardened steel ground to fit and properly secured in place. This construction results in proper piston lubrication with generous bearing areas.\nVilter ammonia expansion piping, or as it is sometimes designated, ammonia evaporating piping, is very carefully fabricated. The pipe used is of high quality and specially built tools and equipment are utilized in this work. As may be noted from the illustration, the ammonia flanges or couplings are made of drop forged steel and fitted with tongue and groove joints in which metallic gaskets are secured by means of a minimum of four bolts. In the illustration shown below attention is invited to the fact that the finished coil is one homogeneous length of pipe which has been made possible by means of electric welding. The flanges are sweated and soldered on to the pipe when the coils are built up in our shops. After the coils have been fabricated they are carefully tested with air pressure while submerged in water and after testing they are painted.\n\nThe Vilter Double Pipe Ammonia Condenser is made up of 14 inch and 2 inch high grade selected ammonia pipes placed one within the other. The inner 14 inch pipes, connected at the ends by the usual form of flanged return bends of 4 inch centers, enclose the water circulation while the annular spaces between the inner and outer pipes form the ammonia condensation chambers. The 2 inch outer pipes are screwed into special return bends at one end and connected to similar return bends by four bolt flanges at the other end. The inner water pipes pass through stuffing boxes on the outer side of the return fittings and can be disconnected and withdrawn separately without interference with the rest of the apparatus. The direction of water and gas circulation in this type of condenser are countercurrent.\n\nVilter Liquid Receivers and Vilter High Pressure Oil Traps are all made of heavy wrought material with welded heads and with nipples and sleeves welded on. Extreme care is observed during construction and each receiver and trap is carefully tested under pressure prior to shipment.\nThe illustrations on these two pages outline in a general manner the application of mechanical refrigeration to a single refrigerator box. That portion of the equipment in the refrigerator box is known as the \"low pressure side\" and consists of ammonia expansion piping and brine holdover tank, both of which are placed in the floor of the refrigerator box. Plants such as these are designed to operate but a portion of every 24-hour period depending upon conditions. The holdover tank contains ammonia expansion piping submerged in a brine solution. This piping cools the brine in the tank during the period when the compressor is operating and this body of cold brine prevents any undue rise in temperature in the refrigerator when the compressor is shut down.\n\nThat portion of the equipment outside of the refrigerator box is known as the \"high pressure side\" and consists of the ammonia compressor, belt and motor, ammonia condenser, oil trap, liquid receiver, pressure gauges and ammonia connections, water supply and drain connections to the ammonia condenser and ammonia compressor are also included.\n\nThere are numerous arrangements found in practice depending upon the number of refrigerators, freezers, brine or ice tanks which are to be placed in operation but they are elaborations of the fundamental system illustrated. In general liquid ammonia passes through the expansion valve into the expansion piping where by virtue of its low boiling temperature it absorbs heat from the interior of the refrigerator and thus evaporates into a gas. The compressor takes this gas and forces it through the condenser where the gas due to the pressure generated by the compressor and coming into contact with the cold water pipe in the condenser, condenses into a liquid form, flows into the liquid receiver and from the liquid receiver the liquid returns to the expansion valve again.\nSMALL CAN ICE PLANTS\n\nOur tanks and coils are so designed and proportioned, and a sufficient number of cans furnished, to permit slow freezing of the ice. A high grade product of uniform quality is thus secured.\n\nThe freezing tank is made from sheet steel, well riveted and braced, so that it will not leak or bulge when filled with brine. The tank is set in a first class manner and the insulating material covered with a neat facing material, dressed and matched wooden lagging. The top is provided with a wooden cover work and insulated covers for the ice cans.\n\nThe evaporating coils are of loop construction, each made from one continuous length of extra strong ammonia pipe, connected by heavy manifolds and also to a liquid line leading from the expansion valve and to the suction line leading to the compressor. A valve and connection for blowing air, oil or scale from the coils, or charging the system with liquid anhydrous ammonia, is accessibly located near the bottom of the tank.\n\nThe brine agitator is of the horizontal type, usually driven by a link belt chain from a sprocket on the compressor shaft.\n\nIn this illustration the air agitating equipment which is employed to make clear ice is shown. This equipment is furnished only when the water which is to be frozen is suitable for making clear ice.\n\nAs these ice tanks are often used in combination with other refrigerating work, such as the cooling of refrigerator boxes and rooms, the following table giving general data pertaining to our standard size plants is listed.\n\n| Plant No. | Compressor Twin Cylinder type | Wheel diameter and face | H.

The condenser and liquid receiver used in this unit are of the submerged type and are mounted on the base between the motor and compressor. These units are assembled, tested and finished in our shops prior to shipment thus reducing the work of installation to a minimum. Special foundations are not required for this unit as in the case when a unit of the type illustrated on page 12 is installed.\n\nThe operation of this unit is quite simple and easily understood and as it is very quiet in operation owing to the Vilter plate valves being used in the compressor it has met with very favorable consideration since its initial appearance on the market.\n\nIn certain types of plants where steam is available for motive power refrigerating units such as this are desirable. To fulfill these conditions this unit has been developed. It consists of a Vilter twin cylinder compressor direct connected through a flexible coupling to a high grade steam engine. The engine and compressor are mounted on a cast iron base and the entire unit is secured to a built-in foundation.\nAPPLICATION\n\nIn the development of the application of refrigerating machinery the field is constantly being extended, in various ways, and consequently no attempt is made here to list all types of plants. The several illustrations are of organizations wherein Vilter Twin Cylinder Compressors and other Vilter equipment have been installed and are the types of applications most generally met with in practice.\n\nThe question of whether or not a brine system should be used or an ammonia system employed is best solved by the existing conditions. If there are many boxes to be cooled and they are of small size and not all centrally located the brine system is usually to be desired. Hotels, Clubs, Hospitals and Institutions usually employ brine systems, as in these types of installations there are usually numerous refrigerator boxes in several different portions in the building. In many of these installations an ice making tank is also installed to furnish the ice required for table use. In the event that there are but a few refrigerator boxes which have to be cooled and these boxes are located very close together the direct expansion system is usually to be desired, as in this case the employment of a brine tank, brine pump and brine coils can be dispensed with as the ammonia is expanded directly in the ammonia expansion or evaporating coils properly placed in the several refrigerator boxes.\n\nIn some installations a combination of the two systems is desirable. A typical example of this being in dairy and Creamery plants where the brine holdover tank in the refrigerator box is made large enough to not only act as a holdover tank for this box but also supplies brine to the milk and cream cooling apparatus.\n\nBakers have found that a refrigerating plant is of great value to them in the manufacture of bread. Temperature control from day to day regardless of outdoor conditions is obtained by a properly designed and installed refrigerating plant.\n\nCandy manufacturers have also found that a refrigerating plant is a very desirable item of plant equipment especially so in the manufacture of chocolate confections.\n\nIn the Dairy Products Industry refrigerating machinery has proven to be of immense value. Absolute control of temperature in storage rooms and freezer rooms, chilling of brine for ice cream freezers and the maintaining of low temperatures in ice cream hardening rooms are the principal functions of refrigerating machinery in this industry.\n\nIn the Packing House Industry and in its branches such as wholesale and retail markets, sausage factories, etc., temperature control is of primary importance. Our many years of experience are available for the correct design and construction of Meat Culling, Freezing and Storage Plants.\n\nCold Storage design and construction for the storage of food products in general is a class of work which we are well qualified to build. Special types of refrigerating plants such as Fur Storages, Oil Cooling, Water Cooling, etc., are to be found in our list of installations.\n\nWhen contemplating changes or an entire new plant we would urge you to avail yourself of our consulting service embracing our many years of experience in designing and installing an increasingly large number of plants of all types.\nWhen writing to us for Quotations please include information along the lines indicated on this page\n\n1.

O. BOX 868\nVICTORIA, B.C.March 19, 1928\n\nDear Mr. Lett:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters of the 4th and 17th instant in which you desire information as to the kind of cooling plant established at the Sekelt Indian School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the plant at the above mentioned school was one manufactured by the Vaughan Motor Works, 3/4 ton, operated with 2 H.P. Painswick Horse Z. type engine, and the price of the same was $1,050.00 f.o.b., Vancouver. This was for the two refrigerators and engine alone and the cooler cost $596.00, making a total cost of $1,647.00. At first the Rev. Principal of the School wished to put in the Vilter system but this compressor with cooler would have run into more money than was voted for, consequently, a 3/4 ton Twin Vaughan machine was decided upon.\n\nI am herewith enclosing Bulletin No. 29 dealing with the Vilter Twin Cylinder Vertical Enclosed Type Ammonia Compressor, and I believe the Vaughan machine is very similar to the Vilter.\n\nThe prices of these two types of cooling plants are as hereunder, but does not include the cooler:\n\n| Type                  | Cost          | Engine Cost |\n|-----------------------|---------------|-------------|\n| Vaughan twin          | $1300.00      | 2 H.P. engine | $950.00 |\n| \" Vilter Manufacturing Co.\" | $1600.00   | 5 H.P.     | $100.00 |\n\nGeorge E.

Also help in changing lighting poles and install telephone poles.\n\nI am,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nSir:\n\nI herewith beg to enclose a letter from the Reverend Principal of St. George's Residential School, in which he asks for a further grant of $200.00, for grading, etc.\n\nI have examined this and find that they have removed a good deal of earth, and up to yesterday, he had moved 213 yards, and as the money is just about expended, I would like to recommend this extra $200.00 be granted, which I think will about complete the graveling. It is most essential that this be done, as all the soil around is more or less sand which drifts very badly. Also as he says if he had had to hire other teams altogether this money already expended would not have lasted this long.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

In reply I enclose herewith accountable cheque No. 1, in your favour, for the sum of $200. This should be accounted for in the usual manner.\n\nI have also your letter of the 26th ultimo, regarding the quotation which you received for the old heating plant. It is considered that the offer of $300 which you received would be a fair price, and you may accept same. You should obtain payment and forward the amount to the Department for credit to the Appropriation for Indian Education.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\nLytton, B. C.,\nApril 4, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nSometime ago I think the Department advised the Provincial Boiler Inspector to inspect the boilers that have been recently installed in St. George's School.\n\nThe Inspector states that you also asked as to what class engineer would be needed. He also states that the Indian Department uses its discretion as to whether or not they use an engineer, as the Provincial Government has no jurisdiction in the matter.\n\nMr. Lett and I have talked the matter over, and he says he has a handyman, the blacksmith, now at the school, who has also been running the boiler in the old school, for several years. He could obtain a fourth class certificate, if the Department would consent to this. This man could be used as he is now for blacksmithing and other work, having been at the school now for the last four years, but if we had to employ an engineer, he would not want to do anything else, and would take double wages to keep him. During summertime he would be needed only one day a week, on wash day.\n\nI would like to suggest that the Department give its sanction to allowing us to run these boilers with the man that we have. An early reply to this will oblige,\n\nAssist. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.Graham) Indian Agent.\nOttawa, April 12th, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, relative to obtaining the services of an engineer to attend to the boilers at the new St. George's Indian Residential School, and recommending that the services of the blacksmith now at the school be engaged for the purpose.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve, temporarily, of the blacksmith attending to the boilers, his retention in the position to depend upon his services being entirely satisfactory to the Principal and yourself. Later, I should be pleased to have a report regarding the services he is performing in attending to the boilers and whether you consider he is capable of continuing the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

C.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nThe expenditure for grading has been much higher than I at first anticipated, consequently this, together with the removal of the bunkhouse, which had to be done, has overrun my grants, having also used up considerable of the root cellar grant on the grading. This week will put everything in shape for seeding, which, with the planting of shrubs, I can do myself.\n\nWould it be possible for me to get an extra grant of $500.00 to cover present expenditure, and do the remainder of the work, part of which is over expended already, and I am unable to pay same with school funds.\n\nI am,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nSir:-\n\nI herewith beg to enclose paylists for money advanced in connection with the new horse barn, root cellar and for grading round the new St. George's Residential School.\n\nAs the money arrived the Reverend Principal was advised as to the amount for each purpose in the work, but he just worked the men, so as to get it all done, together, with the result that the money has not been used exactly as was stated on each cheque.\n\nI placed these cheques in a trust account, and am now enclosing a statement with the paylists, showing that I have overexpended a few dollars, and the work is still not completed.\n\nI am enclosing a letter from the Reverend Principal explaining this, in which he asked for a further grant, which I trust the Department will see fit to allow. The work has been far heavier than I ever anticipated. Mr. Lett has done all the supervision himself, and I think has spent the money to the best advantage.\n\nTrusting the Department will find everything in order,\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

This trouble with the chimneys is not to be surprised at as they are left down 6 feet below walls of main building and are within 10 feet of same.\n\nThe obvious or only cure is to lengthen them to 6 or 7 feet and carried up in brick to be a permanent job.\n\nTo have this done would cost $55 in my estimation.

Lett, Principal of St. George's Indian School, at Lytton, B.C., with regard to a refrigerating plant and I have furnished him with the style of one installed at the Sechelt School last year which has been giving entire satisfaction. This plant was installed by George E. Mitchell, of 453 Thurloe Street, Vancouver, B.C., and it is 3/4 ton driven by a 2 h.p. Fairbanks Morse Engine. The price for the compressor plant with engine was $1,075.00 with $300.00 additional for the construction of a cooler, making a total of $1,375.00.\n\nMr. Mitchell has written to me stating he would be prepared to install the same kind of plant at St. George's School, but the School would have to take care of the cartage at Lytton and provide necessary water, of which very little is needed, also board the Engineer at Lytton while he is installing the plant, the time occupied being about four days.\n\nI am of the opinion that it is essential that a refrigerating plant should be installed in this School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.B.

To, of course, audit the position taken that the laundry would not be complete without some drain connection to the washer, but, I think, if this is submitted to Mr. Gurney Orr, the architect, he will very readily approve of our position as it was impossible to figure from the plans anything definite in connection with this drain and sump as the plans state that detail will be furnished for drain and we, naturally, supposed that when the detail would be furnished, a price would be considered for its installation. Had it merely been a drain to carry away the water, we might have gotten away with something much cheaper than what we have put in, but, we thought the only proper way to handle this would be to make it according to regular laundry practice. This information we secured from the laundry people and have put it in according to the design submitted at that time.\n\nCertainly we never figured a five cent piece for it when figuring the building.\n\nTrusting you will be able to get this matter passed through for us, we are\n\nYours truly,\n\nADKISON & DILL, LTD.,\n\nPer J.

The building will be left clean and all the contractors materials or equipment has been removed from the ground.\n\nThe heating plant gives great satisfaction and is left in perfect condition\u2014same thing applies to the plumbing\u2014a little extra...\nplumbing was necessary in the laundry connection with the laundry machinery (apart from the drains) the contractors were very tardy about putting this in. I also asked for a water line & faucet for the engine room for supplying water to the cooling tanks of engines but refused to do it nor being specifically mentioned in specifications. Water will have to be got in by pails or hosepipe.\n\nThe laundry machinery is in good order or seems satisfactory. The electric lighting plant give great satisfaction also, and is now in permanent use.\n\nMr. Lett has taken up residence in the school, & has taken charge.\n\nThe greater part of school furnishings is been installed in the school... is almost ready for occupation.\n\nI have given contractors a letter accepting the building as satisfactorily finished & in a few days will be sending in the final certificate along with their Extras & Deductions accounts... for showing cost of Electric fixtures.\n\nObediently Yours,\n\nFrank W.

We have paid bills for materials amounting to $794 and have forwarded accountable cheques for labour amounting to $1100 - a total of $1894. Mr. Lett writes that the expenditure for grading has been much higher than anticipated, that he had to move a bunk house, and, although he is prepared to do the grass seeding and the planting of shrubs, without cost to the Department, he needs approximately $500 to finish the root and apple cellar and complete the grading.\n\nIn view of the approaching opening ceremony, I wish to recommend that authority for this additional amount be granted.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, April 19, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 904-06 of the 11th instant, enclosing paylists in connection with the work at the St. George's Indian Residential School.

MacKenzie\nSecretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOwing to the heavy slope of the land at the rear of the above new school, the grade will be terraced down making it 3 ft lower at extreme rear of building, thus leaving 2\u00bd to 3 ft of unpainted concrete wall showing. Mr. Lott and Mr. Graham think that this should be cement finished as is the remainder of wall showing above grade. There is about 40 super yds required to be covered or finished. The cost of\ndoing this would not exceed $30.00 labor & materials.\n\nThe contractors would not do the work without an order\u2014on the spot\u2014which I could not give them. Thinking myself that the work should be done kindly wrote Mr. Graham whether it can be ordered done at once if possible.\n\nReporting again on the work of installing the boys' girls' dormers, sewing-room doors, miscellaneous shelving, etc., but to say\u2014as work is only one carpenter & myself also working as a carpenter\u2014the work can not be done much before Sat May 5th.\n\nAnd as far as I can see there is all that is required at the new school. If any services no longer required here after that date I decidedly you,\n\nTruly W. Baker\nMay 7, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Bater has reported that owing to the grade at the new St. George's Indian Residential School a portion of the exposed concrete at the rear of the building requires replastering with cement. He estimates the cost of the work at approximately $30.00 and I would ask you to kindly arrange to have this work done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

W.\nVANCOUVER, B.C., April 10th, 1928\n\nP.W. Peter, Esq.,\nInspector,\nSt. George's School,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have received again your certificate together with our cheque and would say we hoped, as expressed in our letter, that we would have gotten this back to you before you had sent your documents to Ottawa. However, as they were already gone, that cannot now be helped.\n\nWe are sending the certificate to Ottawa and asking for remittance in accordance with same.\n\nNow, in answer to your letter regarding gravel, for instance, you have apparently taken a little offense at mentioning gravel at all, but, we see no reason for this as our only mention of the gravel was that we did not figure up the amount you state but we are willing to pass it at this. In this case there is certainly no need to mention it further and certainly no need for any special measurement. We will say, however, that we are quite satisfied with the measurement that you have given.\n\nNow, as regards the tile in the kitchen and scullery, would say originally the plans and specification called for glazed brick in the kitchen. These brick were a part of the strength of the wall and figured by us accordingly, allowing the price that it would cost us over and above common brick to place in glazed brick. We are quite satisfied to show you, or anybody else, our original estimate for this work which is as follows:\n\nWe figured that 776 sq.ft. of glazed brick face was required, at a price of $1.00 per foot, making $776.00 for the completion of the kitchen walls, but, you will remember that considering the condition of things and the time required to get the glazed brick, we asked that this be changed to tile allowing us more time and better facilities for finishing these walls.\nWe knew, at the time, it was likely to cost us a little more to put in the tile than it would the brick, but, on account of the saving in time and convenience we stated at that time that there would be no change and certainly, when the accommodation was to ourselves, we had no right to ask the government for more money to make this change.\n\nNow we submit to you the exact cost on all the tile, metal lath and plaster that went into the finishing of the two (2) rooms, both scullery and kitchen. You will find that this amounts to eight hundred and seven dollars and seventy-cents. ($807.70) and, as we are entitled to 10% on the work, we do, it makes a total of eight hundred and eighty-eight dollars and forty-seven cents. ($888.47).\n\nIt is true when first asked to tile the walls of the scullery, we gave you a price of seven hundred and forty-two dollars. ($742.00) for the job, which in our opinion is not out of the way. This, of course, proportionately would be higher than we had figured for the kitchen but we already knew that the tile work was going to cost us more money than we had figured and there was no good reason why we should do additional work at a losing price.\n\nWe think you will see by these figures, any of which can easily be verified, that if there is to be any change in the price that we should receive, there is an amount coming to us for the finishing of the two rooms of one hundred and twelve dollars and forty-seven cents. ($112.47) being the difference between the cost of the work eight hundred and eighty-eight dollars and forty-seven cents ($888.47) and the amount of our estimate for finishing of the kitchen of seven hundred and seventy-six dollars. ($776.00). We, of course, are not asking that this amount be allowed but, if you feel in all fairness that we should get it, we certainly will not object to receive our certificate for same.\n\nWe are\n\nYours truly,\n\nADISON & DILL, LTD.\n\nFor J.

MacKenzie\nActing Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThere is still another matter I wish to put before you for your information or consideration.\n\nIn connection with the final settling up with the contractors of the above new school\u2014Adison & Dill Ltd., Vancouver. They have written me several times strongly protesting any deduction against their contract. As I respectfully herewith submit to you all the particulars, also 2 of their letters to me, so that you will be able to judge as to what is fair. I deducted a certain amount of money for a number of 5 sq. feet of glazed tiling that was contracted for but never put in. The deduction was based at $1.55 per sq. foot which was the price asked for by the contractors to do the tile work in the lavatory.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6464, file 888-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThey have since informed me however that in their original estimates for the school they only figured $1.00 per sq foot for the glazed tile work. Thereupon I have ventured to recompute or reprice the work at this price.\n\nFirst of all - the outstanding facts in connection with the matter are these - there are exactly 1,000 sq feet of wall surface in Kitchen - of this 450 sq ft has been tiled and the remaining 550 sq ft has been plastered.\n\nThus:\n\n- 450 sq ft of Tile at $1.00 = $450\n- 550 sq ft Plaster at $0.80 = $440\n\nValue of work done in Kitchen = $490\n\n1,000 sq feet originally contracted for at $1.00 per sq ft = $1,000.00\n\nValue of work done = $490.00\n\nAmount liable for deduction = $510.00\n\nExtra work done in Scullery:\nThere is a total of 468 sq ft of Wall surface in Scullery, of which only 194 feet was actually tiled and the remaining 274 feet plastered.\n194 sq ft of Tile in Scullery at $1.00 = $194.00\n\n27 \" \" of plastering on metal lath - at 12 cents = $32.88\n\nValue of extra work in Scullery = $226.88\n\nAmount liable for deduction brought forward = $503.60\n\nValue of work done in Scullery = $226.88\n\nAmount still liable for deduction = $276.62\n\nThe above measurements are correct & prices allowed fair. (Note - no openings in walls have been deducted)\n\nThe contractors should be quite satisfied with this ruling.\n\nThe previous deduction worked out at $497.10\n\nDeducted Total = $885.80\n\nExtra for plasterwork = $388.70\n\nActual Deduction = $497.10\n\nAmount of revised deduction = $276.62\n\nBal. allowable to Govt. = $220.48\n\nIf contractors have been paid according to statement shown on final certificate then I would suggest the a further $220.48 be paid to them.\nas regards the contractors demands\nno deduction at all be made\nI do not see how they can effect\nit as they were not put to any\nextra trouble in any way in doing\nthe work.\n\nI might add that they were\ncharged 25\u00a2 per yd for gravel\nused from school land whereas\nonly 10\u00a2 should have been charged\n(or $110.00) Whether they have been\npaid this extra amount over the\ncertificate I do not know.\n\nIf this cut is given them also\nleaving a balance of $220.48 to their\ncredit they should be well satisfied\nknowing that this will be satisfactory\n& remain\n\nObediently Yours,\nFrank W.

Murray Bros., that this amount was sent direct to them. Now, we do not know why our sub-contractors should be paid direct from the department, but, as it has gone that way, we are crediting the account with that amount of money.\n\nWe believe we have given you a first-class job and satisfactory to everybody concerned, as far as we have been able to ascertain and we trust that you will get these matters cleaned up and let us have a full settlement of this building.\nAlso, if it is quite in order, we would be glad to have the return of our security bonds which we left with you on this contract.

MacKenzie\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to the trouble with the chimneys of residence of the new school to which I have previously reported and as instructed by your telegram of April 5 both chimneys were heightened 7 ft each or brought up to the level of the parapet walls of main building at a cost of $60.\n\nRegret to report that the trouble is not entirely got rid of so that there is still a little occasional trouble.\n\nI have thoroughly examined flues that no stoppages or obstruction of draught are there.\n\nMr. Ditchburn, the Commissioner, who was here visiting the school observed the trouble also and asked me to write you to permit us to put another 3 feet on them as these chimneys are now at a\nconsiderable elevation the labor cost would be considerable and each chimney would require anchoring to the main wall of building the cost would be around $40. Kindly advise me by return mail if this work can be done.\n\nI reported also to you on April 25 that owing to the grade line of earth being left 3 ft lower at rear of building the cement concrete foundation walls have been left without a finishing coat of cement and as contractors refused to do this below grade line Mr. Ditchburn who has personally inspected the walls says this should be done and went so far as to authorize me to have it done. Mr. Jett has a quantity of cement left over some of which can be used for this purpose, without cost to the Depot.\n\nThe only expense would be labor which would be around $25.00 Both this and the chimney jobs should be done at same time. The builder, who is now off duty since May 10th is open to return to Lytton for a few days if necessary to see this work done. Obeyantly Yours\n\nFrom W.W. Baxter\nMay 26, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 12th instant, regarding the chimneys at the Lytton School, I would ask you to please arrange to have them heightened as recommended. Care should be taken that the chimneys are well anchored due to the additional height.\n\nWith reference to the cement plastering on the outside of the foundation walls at the rear of the building the Indian Agent has already been authorized to have this done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.

Whether this voucher has got lost in transit I do not understand.\n\nI reported to you of its non arrival on May 27th by telegram.\n\nI regret also to report that I am still out $34.20 in regard to payment on labor returns in connection with the installing of new school fixtures - tables, benches, cupboards, lockers, &c., may other fittings.\n\nThe total labor cost of this work was $548.20. The whole of which has been paid out to the men employed and the labor returns properly O.K'd.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6464, file 888-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nand witnessed by either Mr. Lett or Mr. Graham, Indian Agent, and received by the men. All these returns were sent in to Ottawa and are on file. Of this amount I have received only $513 70\u00a2 from the Deputy. The amount of money sent from Ottawa to cover the wages of the men I have employed was $550 00, sent in 2 cheques at different times. The first, sent in March for $300 00 direct to me, was insufficient to cover the amount of wages in demand, by $34 30\u00a2 I paid this out of my own pocket in order to let the men go, or this was witnessed by Mr. Lett. The second cheque was for $250 00. I asked sent to Mr. Graham, as I expected to be called away to another appointment, I however did not leave until all work was done on May 10th.\n\nThe April & May labor returns I handed in to Mr. Graham to pay amounts of $233 70\u00a2 which he duly did, but he refused to pay me the $14 30\u00a2 that I am owed, owing to the fact that the previous labor returns did\npass through his hands, although he evidently OKed or witnessed by Mr. Leit. He evidently refuses to take any notice that these returns have been sent in to Ottawa. (Sent in on April 23rd) Will you be good enough to examine my labour returns sent in by me or verify my claim to this money and let write to Mr. Graham ordering him to pay me this money. I cannot afford to lose this money, as the salary I have been in receipt of is so small, $6.00 per day that I can barely get the necessaries of life for my wife & children who have to live in a separate house in Vancouver as there is no place to live out there at Lytton, so the expense of railway tickets has been heavy. And unless I receive this money, or my last months salary cheque (for April) I shall not be able to proceed to Lytton for lack of funds, having no other employment since June 10th.

HG/MD\nSir,\n\nI have Departmental letter dated June 15th, in connection with the proposed erection of Workshops for St. Georges Residential School.\n\nWhen Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn was here he took this matter up with the Rev. Principal and myself, and we came to the conclusion that the old St. Georges School building might be demolished and what material could be got out of that might be used for building a two storey wooden building, the lower portion to be used for workshops rough sketch of which is enclosed and the whole of the upper part made for a boys recreation room and gymnasium, as it is most essential that the boys should have a room of this description that they can use all the time for as it is now the present hall has to be used alternately for boys and girls but if we had an outside one for boys the girls could have that in the school for themselves. It would be quite impossible for the school to do this work itself as it only means that the farm is neglected in trying to do extra work. We thought it the best and cheapest to let a contract to demolish the old school which will have to be done in the very near future in order to do away with fire risk to the chapel which is attached to it and also incidentally to save the windows and doors. You will notice that in the sketch one room is set aside for storage for it is at the present moment one of the dormitories has to be used for this and with the opening of the new term the dormitory will be needed so I can't imagine where we are going to store the things that are in there now.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\nYour obedient servant\n\n(H.

Lett, Principal. They are, of course, in the new building and undoubtedly it is a great relief to the Principal and staff to get there. Mr. Lett, too, hopes to have considerably more children the next term. Considerably more cupboard space will be required. They are also greatly troubled with sand getting into the house during any high winds, and will probably have to do some oiling of the boy's playground, which is to windward of the building. A storm had occurred just before I got there, and everything as covered with sand. Whilst there, I checked up certain articles and equipment that had been supplied to the school by Kamloops firms. With the exception of two articles all were satisfactory and as ordered.\n\nG. S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n707 WELTON BUILDING\nHOWE STREET\nVANCOUVER, B.C., June 30th., 1928\n\nM Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nTO ADKISON & DILL, LIMITED\nGENERAL CONTRACTORS\n\nRe St. George's Indian School, Lytton, B.C.\nTo account rendered\n\nYour remittance will greatly oblige\nDear Mr. McLean:\n\nI had an opportunity of going thoroughly over the school building at Lytton. The construction is defective in several important particulars, and if the contractor's security cheque has not been returned, I would advise you to hold it. I think the Supervisor of Construction is to blame to some extent.\n\nMr. Dill, of the Contracting Firm, saw me in Vancouver, in company with Mr. Bater, and I was not at all impressed by the last named gentleman.\n\nUnseasoned lumber was evidently used for the doors and interior fittings, and the result is that many of the doors have shrunk, and go right past the stop, and others are crooked and do not close. A poor job of plastering was done, and the material throughout is not first class. The cement floors in the play room are sure to give trouble later on, as they are already scaling. There are one or two points about the building that I will take up with Mr. Orr when I return to headquarters.\n\nMr. Dill is anxious that certain allowances should be made him, and he brought up the question of increased wages, but after seeing the building, I am not at all sympathetic with his claim, in fact I think we have a claim against him.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nMr. Dill,\nc/o Adkison & Dill, Ltd.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis letter may be regarded as a statement dealing with the glazed tile-work in kitchen and scullery of the St. George's Indian School, Lytton, B.C., which you recently completed.\n\nOwing to a change made in this work (asked for by the Department) the amount of tile work to be done was considerably reduced, therefore it is only to be reasonably expected that a proportionate amount of money be deducted from your contract amount.\n\nThe deduction was made on account of 594 sq. ft. of glazed tile-work omitted at the rate of $1.00 per foot amounting to Five hundred and ninety-four dollars. ($594.00).\n\nAgainst this, I have allowed Sixty-six dollars ($66.00) for 66 sq. yds. of plaster which was put up in place of the omitted tile-work.\n\nIn the scullery, extra tile and plaster work was done at the request of the department, which was allowed for at the rate of $1.00 per ft. for tile and $1.00 per sq. yd. for the plaster, which further offsets your deduction, reducing it to Two hundred and sixty-two dollars. ($262.00).\n\nThe account sent in to the Department along with the final certificate, the amount of deduction was larger owing to the fact that you were overcharged on the tile-work $1.65 per ft. instead of $1.00.\nFinal readjusted account stands as follows:\n\n594 sq. ft. of glazed tile omitted from kitchen $594.00\n\n594 sq. ft. of plaster substituted $66.00\n\n234 sq. ft. of tile installed in scullery $234.00\n\n32 sq. yds. of plaster in scullery $32.00\n\nTotal extras $332.00\n\nTotal deductions, less extras $262.00\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory, I am\n\nYours truly,\n\nFrank W. Baker\n(Superintendent of Construction)\nDuncan C Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDept of Indian Affairs Ottawa\n\nWith reference to our conversation when we met in the Vancouver Hotel in company with Mr. Dill in matters pertaining to the Lytton School. I have, as you requested, supplied Mr. Dill and also the Indian Dept. (herewith attached) a copy of a statement explaining in detail the deduction from his contract sum for a quantity of glazed tilework omitted from Kitchen of new school.\n\nThis statement is a readjustment of course of the same item shown in the original statement sent in along with the final certificate, wherein the deduction is considerably reduced.\n\nThis is the only deduction made against Mr. Dill in the entire contract and is in my opinion quite fair and my action guided by stipulations laid\nDown in conditions of contract in Depto\n\nSpecifications\n\nSettlement should be made with Mr. Dill, Addison & Dill Ltd., accordingly.\n\nI trust now that the entire contract and extras or deduction Account has been made clear to the Depto. and that you have all particulars on record.\n\nBut if you wish to have these particulars set forth on one document I shall be glad to fill them out if you will send me the forms.\n\nI remain Sir,\n\nObediently Yours,\n\nFrank W.

The work is to be carried out in such a way that as much of the material as possible can be salvaged. In the carrying out of this work, you may employ a couple of carpenters and have the same carried out by day labour under the supervision of the Rev. Principal. With reference to the building of a small store house from the materials taken from the old building, I would ask you to please advise me what you think the approximate cost of same to be.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLYTTON, B.C.\nDear Mr. Graham\u2014\n\nRe the present small building which we have been utilizing as a dairy. This is a temporary wooden structure without a flue, as it was not thought necessary to go to any great expense, for a permanent dairy would be erected.\n\nWhile the present building is not large enough, and the wooden floor unsanitary, this is not the real reason of the necessity of a new building. We have had no less than three fires on the roof of the present building, and the last time the roof was completely destroyed. On this occasion we had to do some fire fighting to save the barn, which had just been filled with the first crop of hay.\n\nA permanent concrete building should be erected with brick flue doing away with the present fire hazard, and would give us a perfectly sanitary structure.\n\nPlease take this matter up with the Dept. at your earliest.\n\nYours very sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nLytton, B. C.,\nSept. 4, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nWhen the barn for St. George's Residential School was erected, no provision was made for a dairy, so we had a small temporary wooden building put up, the roof of which has caught fire three times now, and endangered the barn.\n\nAs this only has a wooden floor and is unsanitary, I would like to recommend that a proper dairy be erected. I am enclosing the Reverend Principal's letter on this subject.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Ind. Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHG/MD\nLytton, B. C., Sept 3rd / 28\n\nMr. H. Graham  \nIndian agent  \nLytton.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nRegarding the radiation in the recreation room, I beg to say, that, as the long nights are approaching, and we are making more use of the room, it is essential that the present floor radiation should be replaced by wall radiation.\n\nWith the radiation as it now is, there is a constant fear of the children getting severely hurt. As you know I retained the wall radiation in the old school, and the cost of the change would not be very great, and should be done before there is need for the furnace.\n\nDeputy Sup. Gen. Scott has asked that this matter should be taken up directly with him and immediately on his return from his western tour.\n\nKindly take the matter up with him at your earliest.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nThe radiation in the recreation room was pointed out to you as being very unsuitable for a playroom, as the radiators were along the floor, and some child might get very badly hurt when playing basketball on these.\n\nWe reserved the wall radiation plant from the old school, which could be taken down and placed on the wall of the present building in place of the floor radiators, at a comparatively small cost, and I would like to recommend that this be done, to save all the room possible for the children whilst at play.\n\nI am enclosing a letter from the Reverend Principal on this subject.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Ind. Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHG/MD\nLytton, B.C., Sept 3rd / 28\n\nMr. H. Graham  \nIndian Agent  \nLytton.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nDuring Deputy Supt. General's visit here, I called his attention to the shortage of basement storage, and asked that we be allowed to add two small storage rooms just off the corridor running from the children's dining room, past the kitchen, on the north-west side of the building. This could readily be done at a very small cost as it would only mean the putting in of concrete for three sides with a 6\" partition in the middle making access to the rooms from the corridor and the necessary roofing.\n\nPlease take this up directly with Mr. Scott.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nP.S. We have no storage room for fruit &c. Potatoes & vegetables have to be kept in the corridors. The potato peeling done outside. This latter cannot be done after the weather turns.\n\n[Signature]\nLytton, B. C.,\nSept. 4, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nWhen you were inspecting the new St. George's Residential School, the want of a storeroom for fruit, potatoes, etc., and a room for peeling potatoes and vegetables, etc., was pointed out to you. We personally examined where we proposed one should be built on.\n\nYou asked us to bring this to your attention so I am now enclosing a letter from the Reverend Principal in connection with the same. This is certainly a very necessary addition as there is no place whatever for storing preserves, etc., which unless kept in some cool place are likely to ferment.\n\nIt is hard to say what this building would cost, but I strongly recommend that a uniform brick room be put up that would not be an eyesore in any shape or form to the present building.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nDuncan G. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Ind. Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nNG/MD\nMr. H. Graham  \nIndian Agent  \nLytton.\n\nDear Mr. Graham-\n\nRe. the shortage of storage for storm sash, beds and extra furnishings. We are now using up dormitory space for this purpose, which room should be liberated as soon as it is at all possible to be used as sleeping quarters. We are getting in a number of small children, and it is essential that they should be separate from the bigger ones, to the advantage of the children as well as to the supervisors. The plan I submitted to you some time ago would undoubtedly be the best for storage purposes, besides working in with the Dept., plan of technical training for the boys. The extra cost of the playroom upstairs in this building would be very little, and it would relieve the present congestion in the recreation in the main building.\n\nSupervision would be made easier and the children kept in constant occupation. As it is now three nights in the week the boys occupy the room and the girls the other three. With an additional playroom for the boys at a very small cost this could be obviated and would make things much easier.\n\nI am anxious to have this placed before the Dept. at this time so that when they undertake the erection of the storage room together with the Manual training and repair rooms an addition to the four walls of six feet would do the trick and we should be well equipped.\n\nI trust the Dept will see through this proposition and my wish materialise.\n\nYours very sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nLytton, B. C.,\nSept. 4, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nConsiderable correspondence has taken place between Commissioner Ditchburn, myself and one letter from the Department dated June 15th, No. 165-0-5, and I submitted a rough sketch to the Department supplied by the Reverend Principal of what he wanted.\n\nHe, Mr. Lett, has now written me in connection with this, and I am herewith enclosing his letter. As we are now filling up the school with new pupils, the dormitories are required that are at present filled up with stormwindows and all sorts of extras, for which a storeroom has to be provided, besides making a recreation room for the boys, as well as workshops of different descriptions.\n\nThe approximate cost of the rough lumber required for this would be $500.00, and I trust that you will be able to recommend this being done.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

Consideration will be given to this matter in next year's estimates. In the meantime I would ask you to please furnish me with a rough sketch showing the exact kind of room the Rev. Principal would recommend, and if this room is to be used for the storage of vegetables, etc., I would suggest that the greater part of it be below grade level. Please let me have a sketch and recommendation at your earliest convenience.\n\nI understand that there has been some discussion regarding bringing of hydro electric power lines into the school. I would be glad to have a full report from you on this matter.\n\nWith regard to the providing of a building to be used as a store house and recreation room, I would ask you to please submit a rough sketch showing what you propose to erect, the probable cost, and advise me if it is the intention to put the building up by day labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nJ. De Mele, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nKamloops, B.C.,\nAugust 17th, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. McLean:\n\nI had an opportunity of going thoroughly over the school building at Lytton. The construction is defective in several important particulars, and if the contractor's security cheque has not been returned, I would advise you to hold it. I think the Supervisor of Construction is to blame to some extent.\n\nMr. Dill, of the Contracting Firm, saw me in Vancouver, in company with Mr. Bater, and I was not at all impressed by the last named gentleman.\n\nUnseasoned lumber was evidently used for the doors and interior fittings, and the result is that many of the doors have shrunk, and go right past the stop, and others are crooked and do not close. A poor job of plastering was done, and the material throughout is not first class. The cement floors in the play room are sure to give trouble later on, as they are already scaling. There are one or two points about the building that I will take up with Mr. Orr when I return to headquarters.\n\nMr. Dill is anxious that certain allowances should be made him, and he brought up the question of increased wages, but after seeing the building, I am not at all sympathetic with his claim, in fact I think we have a claim against him.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nJ.D.

Principal and myself have interviewed Col. Spencer, the owner of the plant, who states that he is quite willing to let us have power and light, but before final arrangements are made, he would like a report upon the plant from an independent Engineer. He thinks it would be more satisfactory to himself and the Department.\n\nI have therefore asked Mr. Ditchburn if he could make arrangements with the Dominion Water Power Branch to send an Engineer here to report on it.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Sec.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nHG/EB.\nDear Sir,\n\nRegarding the rough sketch of the proposed new storage and repair shops for this school which I have just submitted to Indian Agent Graham and which he has endorsed and recommended having gone over the situation with me, I thought it best to make some further comment for your information.\n\nRegarding the basement which I purpose dividing into four parts:\nOne room 20x17 for the installation of the refrigeration plant taking out of the school basement as it is not proving at all satisfactory in its present position owing to it being of such handy access to the kitchen. The milk butter bacon and etc being kept in it causes considerable opening of the door allowing the temperature to fall rapidly necessitating the constant use of the engine and the quick fall and rise is not the best for the keeping of meats.\n\nThe remaining part of this division 17x20 left as an open shed to be used as a wood shed and to keep in it the axes saws etc in use rather than having them standing in the corner of the school basement or in the corner of the fence.\n\nThe middle of this floor 35x35 to be used for storage of storm sash extra beds & bedding etc now housed in the top dormitory and which we now need for children as we are now running 140 it is essential to relieve these rooms.\n\nThe remaining 20x35 to be made into two bedrooms for extra farm help now occupying one room in the school building necessitating the use of one bedroom in the residence to accommodate one of the teachers which at the present time is occupied by her.\n\nThe first floor divided into three shops shoe repairing, carpenters repair shop and manual training shop. The present room used for manual training is altogether too small necessitating the curtailing of instruction and repetition of classes.\n\nRegarding the top floor, I have asked that the four walls be extended so that this can be used for a playroom for the boys. The roof has necessarily to be put on and with very little added expense the walls could be extended which would add to the looks of the building besides relieving the congestion in the auditorium also giving a playroom for each side.\n\nI wish also by this means to keep in closer touch with the old boys having a club room which they could come perhaps once a fortnight to play games and carry out the business routine of an organised club.\n\nI feared that perhaps the Dept. would think that the proposition was to elaborate and not warranted but I am sure you can readily see its necessity.\n\nThanking you very obediently yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6464, file 888-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nLytton, B.

If the key is used the doors are so far away from the jam that the locks are of no avail.\n\nThe concrete paint was all off in three weeks after the building was occupied.\n\nThe tiling in the scullery are loosening up and in patches liable to fall off.\n\nThe baseboards in many cases has warped and with the quarter round has came away from the floors. This is general throughout the building.\n\nThe varnish on the outside doors has not stood the weather and these are ready for paint again.\n\nThe drinking fountains should also be replaced as they evidently were of the very poorest.\n\nIn some cases the concrete is coming out of the stair steps.\n\nThe planter is coming off in spots.\n\nI trust that these will be attended to at the earliest possible moment especially the doors and tile in the scullery.\n\nYours very obediently\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nNov. 6, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter that has been received from the Rev.

Atkinson and Dill, and have the items mentioned in Mr. Lett's letter attended to at once, in accordance with the terms of the specifications which call for a twelve months guarantee of the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

Shockley Co. I wish to advise you that these two firms can not be relied upon to do good work except under all kinds of compulsion, and if my advice is worth anything would not recommend acceptance of their tenders under any consideration.\n\nThe writer was Inspector of Construction at the Tyton School which was built by Adkison & Dill, and my experience with them there was such that I am prompted write you this letter.\n\nTwo very reliable firms tendering are Browne & Vestaunet and Smith Bros & Wilson.\n\nI understand that the Dept. is not entirely satisfied with the work at the Tyton School, I can assure you that...\nthe building was well constructed, but the clean finishing of the floors was not possible under the conditions that had to be contended against. I am referring to the action of the Principal Mr. A. R. Lett moving into the school too soon, and storing in the new school large quantities of new furnishings 2-3 weeks before the floors were even oiled, thereby giving the contractors trouble in the finishing of the work. Clearly, however his haste to move into it was excusable owing to the bad condition of the old building.\n\nI can assure you now that the work was all completed by the contractors to my satisfaction before they left, but not without difficulties.\n\nIf any defects have appeared since my leaving there I feel that they will not be minimized by Mr. Lett as he is not well disposed towards the contractors owing to an unsatisfactory gravel bowling contract he had with them.\n\nI hope however, in this connection that I have not been thought neglectful as I had to be fair to all concerned, & hope also that I shall again serve. I am Sir,\n\nObediently,\n\nFrank W. Bater\nOffice of the Auditor General\n\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, November 8th, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Paget,\n\nI have your voucher No. 243 (Education Vote) for a payment of $1,155.50 to Adkison and Dill Ltd., being the balance due on their contract for the erection of the St. George's residential school at Lytton, B.C.\n\nThe voucher includes a statement of extras and deductions showing a net amount of $2,665.50 to be added to the contract price.\n\nIn two items of the extras and one of the deductions the extensions appear to be incorrect:\n\n8. Extra glazed tile work, 21\u00bd sq.yds at $13.95 $295.00\n9. Extra plastering, 63 2/3 yds at 75\u00a2 49.25\n12. Omission, glazed tile work, 69 2/3 sq.yds at $13.95 965.50\n\nThe extensions should be:\n\n8. Extra glazed tile work 299.93\n9. Extra plastering 47.75\n12. Omission, glazed tile work 971.65\n\nThere is also an error of 25\u00a2 in the addition of the extras.\n\nWith these corrections the extras would amount to $3,774.75 and the omissions to $1,192.85 making the balance in favour of the contractor $2,581.93 instead of $2,665.50 as paid.\n\nIf these figures are correct, would you please obtain a refund of the overpayment of $83.57 from Adkison and Dill.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nF.H.

McLean, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nRe St. George's Indian Residential School,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe clause at the end of our letter of even date, herewith enclosed, refers to a balance on the above building of Fifteen hundred and thirty-seven dollars and forty cents ($1537.40) which we have never yet been able to collect or even get an answer to our letters in connection with same.\n\nThe amount is made up of a deduction in tile work, etc., made by the Inspector on the building, because the tile work had been changed from that originally specified.\n\nAs shown in our letters to him, copies of which the Department, I understand, have, the work actually cost us more money than what we had originally and it is out of the question that any deduction should have been made.\n\nThe balance of the account is for extra wages paid for labour insisted upon by the Minister of Labour. Our letters both to your department and to the Minister of Labor, set out our position fully.\n\nWould say further, when Dr. Duncan Scott was in Vancouver, several weeks ago, he promised to give these matters his personal attention on returning to Ottawa. We have, however, never heard a word about the matter from your department. We presume the Doctor has been so crowded with business on his return that this matter has necessarily had to be neglected.\n\nIt does not, however, help our case as we really need the money and would greatly appreciate a remittance of same.\n\nWe are\n\nYours very truly,\n\nADKISON & DILL, LTD.,\n\nPer J. C. Dill\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6464, file 888-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThere may be some reason for the varnish to have given out on the outside doors. This, of course, can easily be remedied.\n\nThe concrete he speaks of, if in the iron stairs, maybe on account of the thinness of the tread being only about 1-1/4\" thick on a thin metal bottom. These, however, were built to specifications.\n\nHis other complaints seem more or less trifling but if given our dues we will certainly see that all these matters are corrected.\n\nThis latter clause refers to a complaint which I will make in a letter I am enclosing.\n\nWe are\n\nYours very truly,\n\nADKISON & DILL, LTD.,\n\nPer\n\nJCD/H\nADKISON & DILL, LIMITED\nGENERAL CONTRACTORS AND BUILDERS\n\n106-107, 319 PENDER ST.

McLean, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nRe-St. George's Indian Residential School,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have had a visit from Frank Rater, who was the Inspector on above school which we erected for you.\n\nHe showed us letter from yourself requesting that the conditions at the school be taken up with us and also gave us a copy of the Rev. Mr. Lett's letter to you, making complaints of said building.\n\nWe must say that this letter has come rather as a shock to us as Mr. Lett has been in the city several times since the completion of the building and was here and had dinner at the writer's house not more than six or seven weeks ago. On each visit he has made, he has assured us that everything was in first-class shape and seemed to be very well satisfied with the building indeed.\n\nNow, as to the objections, would say we are prepared to make good, at any time, on any of our buildings whether under guarantee or not, for anything in the shape of faulty construction or poor materials supplied.\n\nThe building, however, having been finished in the winter, it is only reasonable to expect that the doors would at that time have absorbed a certain amount of moisture and when thoroughly dried-out would shrink somewhat. These certainly can easily be fixed.\n\nThis also would pertain to any other of the woodwork.\n\nRegarding the concrete paint, we presume this is on the floors of the building and would say that we provided the best concrete paint we knew of but, must also say that we know of no paint put on a hard concrete floor that would stand the wear and tear of a school full of children with rough boots, especially in a country with so much sand that blows right into the building with every wind-storm.\n2460 Heather Street,\nVancouver, B.C.,\nNov. 16, 1928.\n\nMr. J. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nAs requested in your letter to me of the 6th inst. I called at the office of Messrs. Adkison & Dill Limited, Contractors, who built the new school at Lytton, B.C., and interviewed Mr. J. C. Dill personally re the subject of your letter; namely, the Rev. A. R. Lett's report to you that considerable repairs are needed at the school and that the contractors be recalled to put things to rights, also charging that inferior work had been done by them.\n\nMr. Dill informs me that he is quite willing to renew anything there that is not up to the quality called for in the Specifications or of inferior workmanship, regardless of any obligation to do so but, if anything is out of order through misuse by the occupants of the school, then that would be a different matter.\n\nHe is of the opinion that Mr. Lett's report is somewhat exaggerated and I could not say how true it is without first paying the school a visit and verifying it. I personally know that in one instance Mr. Lett's statement is neither correct nor fair. I refer now to the painted floors in the basement. He knew that this paint had not sufficiently hardened at the time of moving into the school. I was at the school at the official opening, June 15th, and there were no other complaints then.\n\nIt is possible that some of the woodwork, doors, etc., have undergone a certain amount of shrinkage, owing to the fact that the building was finished at an unfavorable time of the year.\n\nI would suggest that the writer be authorised to go out to the school and ascertain the facts and report to you, or to determine what is necessary to be done, what parts are to be renewed, and to order contractors to carry this out.\n\nTrusting I shall hear from you to this effect,\n\nI am Sir,\n\nObediently yours,\nNov. 26, 1928.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to the Principal's complaint of unsatisfactory work at the Lytton School.\n\nI would ask you to please proceed to Lytton, carefully examine the building and submit a report to the Department covering the defects.

Bates\n2460 Heather St\nVancouver\n\nDec 11 -\n\nMr. J D McLean\nAsst. Deputy Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs Ottawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs directed in your letter to me dated Nov 26th I went by train out to the St. Georges Indied School. I went there in company with the Principal and we went all over the building and thoroughly examined the defects he has complained about.\n\nWith regard to the doors, there are about 20 that need attention, refitting so that they fit more closely to the frames and the lock keepers adjusted. There has been some shrinkage in them so as to leave about 3/8 of an inch between jamb & door. The door jambs should be taken out or refitted to doors. The doors themselves are in perfect condition. Only the interior doors are affected.\nThere is one exterior door\u2014the boy's entrance, the frame of which needs reanchoring into the brickwork as the wall plugs have loosened on one side. This door is subjected to a great deal of slamming & heavier brickwork should have been specified to go around it.\n\nThe varnish on the exterior doors is about gone & should be cleaned off & revarnished with a good weather-proof varnish.\n\nThe \u00bc round of baseboards do not fit closely and should all be taken off & reset.\n\nThe baseboards are everywhere in good order and all other interior woodwork, excepting on some of the windows where the window stops need taking off or adjusting closer to sash to prevent rattling.\n\nAs regards the glazed tilework there is a patch about 2 sq yds loose in the scullery over the sink and some tiles have already come out.\nI suspect that this portion was shock up by the contractors plumbers when drilled holes through it to anchor up some heavy fixtures, and it is a wall of wood constructed (studded) when these tile are reset there will be no further trouble.\n\nThe tile in the kitchen is in perfect condition.\n\nAs to the plastering, it is on the whole of very good quality, there are a few small holes where it has been damaged by door handles etc., and there are a number of cracks in corners of rooms where walls are of stud partitions. These cracks are caused by the natural shrinkage of wood.\n\nSome of these walls bear directly upon the floor joist in which there is the greatest amount of shrinkage and at other parts are attached to brick walls which remain rigid and at such places cracks appear. However when they are filled up with plaster of parts they are rendered\nalmost invisible. There is no settlement in the foundation walls nor at any post or column.\n\nThere are 2 or 3 small line cracks in foundation wall which I believe lateral shrinkage in a long length of wall. It must be taken into consideration that no reinforcement bars was specified for walls (only in footings of piers).\n\nThe faulty cement tread in steel stairs of which there is only one, on the boys side, must be relaid.\n\nAs regards the drinking fountains they of a good standard make & are as firm & rigid as could possibly be, but there is either a restriction or contraction of the flow of water, or low pressure as the water does not rise more than an inch from the nozzle whereas when they were first installed the water would rise 6 or 8 inches high. However they\nshould be examined by a plumber\nthink they can be made to work\n\nThe concrete paint on basement\nfloor has worn off completely.\nbut the paint in the bathrooms or\nstairs or landings is in good condition\nand Leit says that nothing can be\ndone to the basement floor until\nthe summer vacation when paint\nwill have a chance to dry or harden\nbefore school opens again.\n\nWhen contractors applied this paint\nthe floors were damp or cold or the\npaint did not dry before school was\noccupied.\n\nI looked over the roof and found\nit in good condition, no sign of a\nleak, at one point where a little\ntar oozed through ceiling around a\nrain water leader, was a spot where\nsome tar was spilled before roof was\ncovered or the heat of July caused it\nto run.\n\nThe lighting or heating or plumbing\nsystems appear working in good\norder and there are no complaints.\nas far as contractors are concerned.\n\nThere is a faulty fuse plug in the high pressure boiler that is used to supply laundry with steam, but I think Mr. Scott is taking care of that.\n\nThe wood floors throughout buildings are in good order.\n\nSome of the girders or beams that have been covered in wood and covered in sheet metal (same as ceilings) do not look good as some of the metal has buckled somewhat owing to shrinking of the wood on which it is nailed.\n\nThe excessive heat and dryness of this locality in the summer time plays havoc with new lumber, so if this building had been finished out in the summer months it would have been a more satisfactory job.\n\nI might say that the best of materials and workmen have been employed at this school, but all cannot foresee what will happen under certain\nconditions, such as we have here.\n\nI might say that the brickwork is without a flaw anywhere.\n\nThe whole contract has been carried out precisely in accordance to plans or specifications, and that I have seen to it that all work seen or unseen was done so carried out. I have not spared the contractors one iota. I was constantly on the job Sunday or Monday, as many of the trades worked on Sunday, so I spent my entire times as Inspector and supervising our little building projects. And doing a lot of working with tools for him that I never got any extra pay for.\n\nI understand from the contractor that he is sending a man up at once to carry out the work necessary to put things in a satisfactory condition as soon as this is done. Our little can inform you of the fact, as I am only concerned now with this report only of any further service I shall be glad. I am yours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6464, file 888-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nWith reference to the electric lighting plant of the new school Mr. Lott states that the engines are giving a lot of trouble and expensive to maintain, and that cheaper current can be purchased from a nearby Hydro plant.\n\nIt costs the school $2.75 a day to run the 9 Kilowatt plant against $1.00 per day for the 15 Kilowatt offered to the school, but without guarantee in case of breakdown of short duration.

This work was interrupted by Xmas holidays but is being resumed again and will be finished about the middle of January.\n\nI am Sir,\nObediently yours,\nFrank W. Bates\n\n(over)\nI might also mention that while at Tyton recently I framed or hung a plan (which I shall describe) in the engine-room of new school.\n\nThis plan drawn by the writer last Sept. while employed by Depar as Inspector of Constuction is a floor plan of basement of school showing exactly where the several systems of drainage pipes were laid, namely, the main sewerage, the Kitchen & Laundry drain, which is separate from the Rain water drain.\n\nThe writer noted the location of these drains before they were covered in, so that they may be easily traced in case of any trouble cropping up in the future so one else (otherwise) would know the location of these drains.\n\nFrank W.

Ottawa 14th January, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nI return herewith the account in triplicate which you submitted in connection with work done at St George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, under the Boiler Inspection Act. Kindly send the account to the Principal of the School, as his certificate is required thereto, before the matter of payment can be given attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean.\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThe Chief Inspector of Boilers,\nNew Westminster,\nB.C.\nSir,\n\nWhen you were out last summer, Mr. Lett and I pointed out to you the various defects in St. George's new school building.\n\nI presume that it was on the strength of this that Mr. Bater, who was superintendent of construction, was sent up to report, and the contractors apparently, that he would mend any deficiencies, with the result that Mr. Bater was sent up by the contractors to do the work. He was here for about ten days, and Mr. Lett asked me to come up today to see the work that had been done and not been done. Additional cleats have been put round some of the windows, but these are far from satisfactory. You can see daylight round almost any door in the building, and the same might almost be said of the windows; in some cases the window sills are coming away from the cement, and one can see daylight right round.\n\nThe whole building has shrunk, with the result that you can put your fingers underneath all door casings, and in places the quarter round, round the floors of the rooms, has shrunk, leaving crevices between the baseboard and quarter round.\n\nThe residence part of the building is so bad that what heat does get there is all used up by the draughts that come in round doors and windows.\n\nI notice too that the transoms have not been put on with hinges and proper fixtures. Some are actually just held in position by big nails.\n\nSome of the work that has recently been done by Mr. Bater, has not even been varnished.\n\nThe crevices left where the building has settled all round the floors are just receptacles to catch dust, etc.\n\nThe whole building is taking so much to heat, far more than we ever dreamt, which is not to be wondered at, when so much cold air comes in, in every direction. Even doors that Mr. Bater has tried to patch up, are very far from satisfactory now and lots of them he never touched at all.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Sup't General,\nDept. of Ind. Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,---\n\nnever touched at all.\n\nI would certainly like to recommend that the contractor be compelled to put all these defects into good shape.\n\nThe lumber of the whole building has shrunk and dried up, not having been properly dried lumber when put in. It might have been quite all right, if it had been in a building in a damp climate, but in this dry climate, it has dried so that now nothing fits.\n\nI think that the doors anyway should be all replaced by larger doors, as this makeshift will never be a success.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

Bater on behalf of Adkinson & Dill contractors, allow me to report the following for the information of the Dept.\n\nI was not at all satisfied with the work and called in Mr. Indian Agent Graham who also will pass his coment on the work.\n\nThe door jams have been filled in with \u00bd\" material nailed on to the jams and lock catches refitted leaving the woodwork where the original settings open with no filling whatever, & in a great many cases the extra material put on is not varnished.\n\nThe Door jams in all cases are standing away from the floor anywhere from \u00bd to \u00be of an inch leaving a very unsanitary and unsightly condition.\n\nInstead of the baseboards being taken off they were filled in with strips of one inch material and the quarter round reset.\n\nThe Fire escape doors were not touched and the wind blows through almost as though they were open.\n\nThe windows also were not looked into as a great many of them are rattling in the wind.\n\nThere was also some windows left without screens which Mr. Bater said he would provide but they are evidently not forthcoming.\n\nThe Drinking fountains have been left as they were.\n\nThe outside doors instead of being handpapered and revarnished were varnished over the old varnish and I am sure that in six months time they will be as bad as they were before varnishing.\n\nMr. Bater has spent five weeks patching and surely left a patched up looking New School but should have spent another five weeks to finish his patching and I expect he will report favorably to the Dept on his own work and ask Railway fare and time wages for inspecting what he has done.\n\nThe Contractor was somewhat fore-sighted in asking Mr. Bater to do the work and Bater being innocent enough not to see that he was being made a tool of will report favorably on the repair work to the advantage of the Contractor and perhaps get away with it but I trust this will not be so.\n\nI think a non interested man should be sent in to see what has been done and what has been left undone so that the Dept. could receive an unbiased report on the conditions existing.\n\nI trust the above will not burden you but thought it my duty to again put the situation before you.\nso that you might be aware of the situation.\n\nI am sorry to be so harsh in my criticism but I think it is a shame to let these people get away with such work without the Dept. knowing something of it and trust that you will use same to the benefit of the building.\n\nMr. Bater in the first place should not have undertaken the work having been inspector on the construction, again he is a brick layer by trade and could not be expected to do justice to the carpenter work repairs. He should also have suggested to the Dept. the proposed repairs before the work was undertaken by any one to see if the proposed repairs would be satisfactory to the Dept.'s Architect.\n\nPlease use the above as information for the Dept. only, as last time my letter was forwarded to the Contractor and I happened to be the subject of some heavy criticism by him for having made my report to Ottawa instead of to him personally.\n\nYours very obediently\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n| DATE | DETAIL                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Jan 20 | Present Mr. Baker  \nInspector of Institutions  \nProceeding to Lytton School  \n& inspecting work done by  \nAdvisors & Vill institutions  \n& the complaint made by  \nthe municipal Rev.

Wilson\nAssistant Deputy Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs Ottawa.\n\nDear Mr. Wilson,\n\nWith reference to the St. George's Indian School - Lytton BC and your letter to me dated Nov 28, 1928, asking me to go out to the Lytton school to investigate the complaints in regard to certain repairs needed at the school. I accordingly went out to Lytton and as you know sent in a detailed report of what was wrong. I also wrote again about the complaint informing you of what the contractors' advance or did not were doing. The contractors have finished the work they were required to do, so have asked me to report the fact to you, and also to bring to your attention the fact that there is still a certain sum of money due them in connection with the building of the school which I am dealing with in a separate letter herewith attached.\nIn order to satisfy myself I went out to Sutton again on the 21st inst., & inspected the work done. I will describe it in detail. The doors complained of were not nearly so bad as Mr. Lott reported. They had been fitted frames & lock perfectly. They are not likely to go out of adjustment\u2014again as building & woodwork is now thoroughly dried out.\n\nOf the concrete slabs of basement floors nothing can be done at the present time not until next summer comes. But as the floors are perfectly smooth & cleanable & show no sign of wearing away, nothing is it is not necessary to do anything to them. The floors were treated with borax & properly painted before school was taken over\u2014but as Mr. Lott wanted to occur building before paint had a chance to harden, contractor cannot be blamed if it wore off in places.\n\nThe patch of old tile in scullery wall has been replaced. (that had fallen out) Practically all of the 4 round (of baseboard) have been taken off & replaced.\n\nOutside doors have received a coat of best varnish obtainable.\nThe drinking fountains complained of are a good heavy standard make same as used in Vancouver schools and cannot be said to be of the very poorest as our last claims.\n\nThe holes in plaster have been repaired or settlement cracks pointed up. I might say that the only places damaged were caused by heavy objects accidently striking wall at some time during occupation of building and although the contractor was not obliged to repair these - did so.\n\nTwo of the concrete stair treads were taken out & renewed. They are all now faultless.\n\nMany small hardware fitting were readjusted so that they would fasten. The fir flooring is everywhere in good shape but need re oiling or varnishing to make them appear good. No varnish was specified. One or two locks have been damaged by accident as also has several panes of glass of which the contractor cannot be called upon to replace.\n\nThe engines of the electric plant\nhas not been running as satisfactorily as expected but this is due to the fact that they were never operated by a man that knew how to run them. Any trouble or misadjustment could not be understood or located. Batteries were never more than half charged, mostly \u00bc charged. Engines run under heavy load, perhaps with defective valves or a blown fuse plug.\n\nThe plant never had a chance, but it functioned perfectly when school was taken over. Contractor cannot be called upon to recondition same. I believe all else is satisfactory or think the Deptt should appreciate the manner in which the contractors carried out the requirements of their contract with the Deptt to the fullest extent.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nObsequiously Yours,\nFrank W.

Residential School in Lytton, B.C., has asked the writer who was the Inspector of Construction during its construction, to certify for and to set before you their claim to a sum of money still due them in connection with the building of the school.\n\nPart of the claim in question is on account of an over-deduction made against them for gravel or sand used by them off the school land. They were charged 20 cents per cubic yard, totalling $221. The charge was later reduced to 10 cents per cubic yard, as per your letter to me Feb. 28. The whole amount, however,\n2/ is still being withheld or have not been allowed any part of it.\n\nThey went to considerable expense to develop the pit, erected a long water flume for washing the gravel every foot used was washed.\n\nThey claim they were given permission to take all they wanted by Mr. Jell provided he be given the hauling to the school. It was not until Jan 13, 1928 after they had taken almost all they needed when they were notified by the Deputy at Ottawa (two me) that they were to be charged $20 per yd for it.\n\nThis does not appear to be a square deal on the contractor. They have asked me to present these facts to you and to recommend the waiver of any charge to be allowed the $22.00 in full.\n\nThe balance of their claim is in connection with the deduction from their contract amount\u2014myself.\nmade against them from their final certificate (not in error) but for the omission of a certain amount of glazed tile work in Kitchen & Scullery of new school, as a result of changes asked for by the Deptt.\n\nThey claim that a deduction cannot be legally made from their contract amount when a change is asked for by the owner (the department in this case). The change was made to overcome a serious error in the specifications that might have cost the Deptt a much larger sum than is involved in this deduction.\n\nI would recommend that this deduction be also waived, amounting ($497 10\u00a2) in all $718 10\u00a2.\n\nI remain Sir\n\nObediently Yours,\n\nFrank W.

This limit, we think, is already passed and we trust that whoever the proper authorities are to settle this matter will have it in hand and do so immediately as it would be very odious to us to have to be compelled to take the matter into the courts.\n\nTrusting to hear from the department with a settlement, immediately, we are\n\nYours very truly,\n\nADKISON & DILL, LTD.\n\nJCD/H\n\nPer J.

HG/MD\nFEB. 15, 1929.\n\nSIR,\n\nThere have been several complaints from the Principal of the St. George's School that the contractors for this building have not performed their work in a satisfactory manner, and that there are many defects appearing throughout the building.\n\nSome time ago Mr. Bater, who acted as Inspector of Construction on this work, submitted a report outlining some of the defective work and this is supposed to have been put in good order by the contractors. A letter has been received by the Department from the Reverend Principal and the Agent stating that the work has not been properly performed, and I would ask you to kindly look over this building and submit a report to the Department on your findings. You may ask the Reverend Mr. Lett to point out what he considers the defects in the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. Gardner Smith, Esq.,\nc/o St. George's Indian School,\nLytton, B. C.\nADKISON & DILL, LIMITED\nGENERAL CONTRACTORS AND BUILDERS\n\n106-107, 319 PENDER ST. W.\nVANCOUVER, B.C., Feb. 13th., 1929\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have your letter of the 6th., instant, and would say we are very sorry indeed to hear that there is still dissatisfaction with our work at St. George's School at Lytton.\n\nWe hate to say it but it would almost seem that we are being persecuted on this job for some personal reasons rather than actual fact.\n\nIt is true we had Mr. Bater do the repair work. He claimed to us that he was a first-class carpenter and we know he has been working at carpenter work in the City of Vancouver. Had it not been so we would never have given him the work to put right.\n\nWe thought at the time that it would be more advantageous to all concerned to wait a little later in the year until the weather moderated and would have done so, but, as Mr. Bater was going to be up there anyway, and as it was he that had to be satisfied, we thought it would be good business on our part to let him make the repairs to his own satisfaction, which to us would mean the department.\n\nIt certainly was not in any sense of the word with the idea of putting anything over the department.\n\nWe have paid Mr. Bater good money for his services; One hundred and fifty-one dollars and fifty cents ($151.50) cash in wages, and it seems strange to us that the superintendent at Lytton and the Indian agent should allow Mr. Bater to go away from the work and things still in an unsatisfactory condition to them.\n\nAgain we wish to assure you as we have done several times that we are behind our work to the limit and will be perfectly glad to make anything right if found faulty on our account.\n\nWe think, however, we should be treated likewise and as there is still money coming to us on this operation, surely we either should be paid or some reason given for not doing so.\n\nWe have now been trying for ten months to have this matter settled and have been given nothing whatever but promises that the matter would be looked into and few promises even at that.\nFeb. 13/29.\n\nWe trust that we will hear something better from you by return mail.\n\nWe are also glad to know that an officer of the Department will make the next inspection. We would be glad indeed if Mr. Gurney Orr, the architect himself could be that inspector.\n\nWe also would be pleased if when any inspection is being made that whoever may be in charge would be given authority to wire us while he is in Lytton, if he finds anything seriously wrong that we may go up at once and go into the matter with him, personally.\n\nThis is all we have to say now.\n\nTrusting you will use your good offices to see that we get a square deal as we are perfectly willing and anxious to give one, we are\n\nYours truly,\nADKISON & DILL, LTD.,\n\nPer\n\nJCD/H\nFeb. 22, 1929.\n\nSirs,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 13th instant, with further reference to St. George's Indian Residential School, I beg to say that from correspondence received here it appears that there is still great dissatisfaction with some of the material and workmanship in this building.\n\nMr. E. Gardner Smith, who has acted as Inspector of Construction on many important buildings in the last few years for this Department is proceeding immediately to Lytton and will submit a report to the Department.\n\nI may say for your information that Mr. Smith will probably be at Lytton for some time looking after other work being carried out there for this Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nAdkison & Dill, Ltd.,\n106-107 Fender St. W.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to the repair work done by Mr. Dill at the St. George Indian Residential School at Lytton, I beg to mention to you that I have not yet received my cheque for my services or expenses in connection with same from the government. I sent in my account (with my report) Jan 25th amounting to $27.40.\n\nAs the Deputy had commissioned me to deal with the matter, I considered that my attention was necessary until the matter was disposed of.\n\nI hope the Deputy will be good enough to remit as I am at present suffering the direst poverty. Having had but little employment since May 10th last when the work finished at Lytton, my appointment as Inspector ended.\nAfter long periods of unemployment I am in very reduced circumstances. My wife and children dependant upon me. I have had to apply to Mr. Barnett Lee of the Soldier Club for relief and to the City Relief Officer so we would not starve.\n\nI obtained a little work from the Depot last June $60 a mo. and also worked 3 weeks here for the contractors. I applied to the Depot for further employment but was not successful. Trusting I shall receive settlement asked for.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYours Truly,\n\nFrank W. Batter.\nFeb. 27, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to your account of $27.40 in connection with work at the Lytton School, I beg to say that you were instructed to proceed to Lytton to make a report. Your account for expenses incurred in making this inspection has been paid.\n\nWith reference to your last account it is not considered that the Department would be justified in paying this as you were employed by the contractors for the building, in carrying out the necessary repairs and therefore not by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Deputy Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter dated Feb 29 (sent on to me at Victoria where I have employment) in reference to my claim for payment of $27 services or expenses Re Lytton School.\n\nIn reply, it is true that the Department settled my account for making out a report dated Nov 16/28.\n\nThis second account is for a second report informing the Department what was done by the contractors in the way of the repairs, and also submitting to you their claims for payment of a certain amount withheld by the Department from their contract account submitted in the same way as I have submitted their progress certificate. The contractors did not pay me one cent for doing this. They regarded me as the Depar...\nagent\nfor this work, as before.\nIt is true that I worked 120 hrs\nfor them as a skilled mechanic on\nthe repairs at a $1.00 an hour.\nMr. Lott also employed me 27 hours\nbuilding a chimney & laying cement\nfloors in the new Daily Building.\nMr. Lott also employed me 8 hours\nsetting up the Bronze Memorial Tablet\nsent over from England, and other\nwork around school, but that is\nmy own private endeavor to earn\na little money to support my wife &\nchildren. I see no disgrace in\nit. None of these gentlemen paid\nme one cent toward my railway\nor boarding expenses while at\nLynton. On the other hand I paid\n$32.00 dollars to Mr. Lott for meals\nat the school. The writing of reports\nto Depot was done in my own\ntime or for the Depot which should\nbe paid for by the Depot. While\nat the School I gave Mr. Lott a\nPlan (Tracing) of the whole basement floor.\nnew school showing exactly where all the drains, sewers, & rainwater were laid in case of trouble. Where they could not be located without this plan, drawn voluntarily by myself, which is worth far more than $27 was asked for by the Dept. Mr. Jett himself thought it valuable anyway.\n\nI would be glad if the Dept. will remit me this amount claimed and it will finish the business on hands, so far as the contractors are concerned.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nFrank W. Butler\nformer Inspector of Construction\nMarch 6th, 1929.\n\nR. Guerney Orr Esq.\nArchitect.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- St. George's School, Lytton, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 23rd ultimo I would say that I have carefully noted your instructions regarding the rendering of my salary and expense accounts, and I shall follow the procedure outlined by you.\n\nWith regard to my services at Cardston during the first half of the month of February, I seem to have had no time to make out the account since leaving there, but hope to do so within a day or two.\n\nWith reference to that part of your letter bearing on the complaints of faulty work done by the contractors in the building of St. George's School, I have been pretty well all over the job with the exception of the roof, which I have yet to examine, and on the whole there is nothing seriously wrong with the building that is evident at the present time. However, the Reverend Principal has good reason to complain about the loose-fitting doors and windows, and the settling of the floors away from the base in a number of places, and other minor troubles. The trouble is the result of using lumber not thoroughly seasoned, which the dry summer weather has caused to shrink badly. The man who was sent by the contractors to make the necessary adjustments and repairs did not complete his work by a long way, and further corrections are necessary.\n\nWhen in Vancouver recently I called on Messrs Adkinson and Dill with reference to the defects that have developed in the building and had a conference with their Mr. Dill. I also met the millwork sub-contractor (Mr. Crystal) and the heating & plumbing sub-contractors Murray Bros. The last mentioned firm have promised to make good the drinking fountains that refuse to function, and to make the heating of the water in the hot water storage tank more satisfactory. Mr. Dill states that he has already spent $200.00 in sending a man to overcome the troubles, and had understood that everything was all right until recently notified to the contrary. He agrees to come with his superintendent, and take notes of everything requiring their attention, and to leave everything in good shape. He proposes taking this action within a few weeks, as his firm are pre-occupied with something else at present.\nDill complains that there is a considerable balance due them still from the Department, and that his letters calling attention to this have not met with any response. I told Mr. Dill that after he has remedied the faults which have developed in the building his claims will be more apt to be considered.\n\nNow that the winter is about over there does not seem to be any emergency about having these adjustments performed at the school, and I took it on myself to tell Adkinson and Dill that if they attend to the troubles within the next few weeks it will be satisfactory. This they have promised to do.\n\nWith the exception of the defects reported by the Reverend Principal, there is nothing radically wrong with the building that I have been able to discover, and there is much worthy of praise. I shall make a further report after the contractors have completed their repair work.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\nADKISON & DILL, LIMITED\nGENERAL CONTRACTORS AND BUILDERS\n\n106-107, 319 PENDER ST. W.\nVANCOUVER, B.C., March 12th, 1920\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nAttention - J.B. McLean.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have your letter of the 23rd, of February, since which time Mr. T. Gardner Smith called at our office and afterwards went to Lytton and called again upon us the latter part of last week explaining to us the situation there.\n\nIt appears that there is quite a little dissatisfaction with the mill-work which apparently is quite justified.\n\nWe are not in a position at the moment to have this righted, as we explained to Mr. Smith. Two of our best carpenters, either of which we would feel justified in sending to the job, are engaged finishing up some work for us now. It will, therefore, be nearly three weeks before either of them will be relieved, at which time we will be glad to take up the matter and straighten everything out to Mr. Smith's satisfaction.\n\nWe understand he is to be at Lytton or back and forth from there for several weeks yet.\n\nNow, in the meantime, we are still wondering why we cannot get any reply as regards our claim upon this building. We anxiously beg you to give us some answer in this connection. Surely it is unfair to ask us to maintain a building and continue to go to expense to do so without at least having the balance of our account considered and some information as to what we may expect.\n\nTrusting to hear from you immediately, we are\n\nYours very truly,\n\nADKISON & DILL, LTD.\n\nPer\n\nJCD/H\nLytton, B.C. April 17, 1929.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nReport on St. George's School, Lytton, B.C.\n\nSir:\n\nIn response to a request made by the Department's Architect, Mr. R.Guerney Orr, I now submit the following Report on the condition of St. George's School, with reference to the complaints made by the Principal, Rev. A.R.Lett, of defective work in the building. These complaints may be summarized as follows, and I shall deal with them in the order given:\n\n1. Badly fitted doors, a number of which are not standing up well.\n2. Loose fitting and draughty windows, which rattle badly when the wind blows.\n3. Defective spots in the concrete floors of play-rooms.\n4. Floor drains in wash-rooms above level of the floors.\n5. Open spaces in several rooms where the floors have settled away from the base and quarter-round. This applies also in bath-rooms where the floors and base are of concrete.\n6. No heat in a number of radiators even when there is a good head of steam.\n7. Total failure of the hot water storage system.\n\nWhen in Vancouver recently I called on the contractors, Messrs Adkinson & Dill, and formally notified them of the defects which I had observed. Last Sunday Mr. Dill came here in response to my request, bringing with him his superintendent who was in charge of the construction, the carpenter foreman, the millwork man, and his heating engineer. We went over the building pretty thoroughly; the complaints were gone into, and Mr. Dill has undertaken to make the following adjustments:\n\n1. The doors will be taken down, and practically all of them have strips added to them as needed to make them fit the frames snugly. These strips will be neatly fitted, glued, sandpapered, and tinted with orange shellac to match other woodwork. In some instances thresholds will be placed beneath the doors to take up surplus space; and the fastens will be made to hold the doors properly.\n\n2. Practically every window in the building will receive a specially-struck parting strip with a rabatted extension which\nwill extend to meet the edge of the upper sash. As the groove in which the upper sashes slide had been milled too wide, there is far too much play at present, which results in draughty windows which rattle badly with every wind that blows, but by adopting the means outlined this trouble should be overcome. The same fault applies to the lower sash in all windows, but this can be easily corrected by moving the vertical stop to take up this surplus play, and this will be done.\n\n3. The defective spots in the recreation rooms are not very extensive, and the contractor has agreed to chisel out these places, and fill them level with a rich concrete strengthened with Master Mix hardener.\n\n4. The floor drains in wash-rooms have been carelessly placed with regard to the general level, and these floors have not been given the required grade. Surplus water refuses to run uphill to these floor drains. This trouble cannot be corrected without breaking up and re-laying these floors. This would cause no end of mess and trouble at this late day, so the school staff will have to push the water to the floor drains with mops and brooms when swabbing these floors, as they are doing at present.\n\n5. The open spaces below the base at floor lines is caused by the shrinking of the green joists used. The shrinkable timber has not been evenly distributed. Perhaps this was scarcely possible where stud partitions meet brick walls. Mr. Dill tells me that it is impossible to buy seasoned joists in Coast markets, and that this shrinkage was unavoidable. However, there will not be any further shrinkage of joists, and the contractor is sending 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" bull-nosed strips to take up the open spaces where the quarter round has proved insufficient. In some rooms 2\" strips will be necessary. The bathrooms have large cracks in the concrete where the base and floor meet. These cracks are to be raked out and filled, which is not a difficult correction to make.\n\n6. A number of radiators throughout the building do not circulate the steam, and remain cold. Even a casual inspection reveals the cause. In my opinion there are far too many horizontal runs to and from the radiators, in some cases several feet in length, with little or no grade away from the radiators. The specifications call for \"not less than HALF INCH fall per foot run\", and this has not been observed. I pointed this out to the heating engineer, but he states that every radiator functioned perfectly when the heating contract was finished, but that the settlement in the floors has in some instances robbed the horizontal runs of the fall which had been given them, and is the sole cause of the radiators thus affected not now heating. He has agreed to send a mechanic to go over all the radiation, and that every radiator will be made to circulate the steam satisfactorily.\n\n7. The hot-water storage system which has been installed here does not furnish hot water when depending on the steam taken from the heating boilers. It has been found necessary to keep the jacket heater going full blast too, or do without hot water. I took this matter up with the heating engineer, and he assures me that the service has been installed exactly in accordance with the detail\nshown on the heating sheet supplied by the Department, and with the specifications accompanying same. Steam has been taken from the boiler header through an 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" pipe to the storage tank of 300 gal. capacity, and in this tank are two loops of coils of 1\" diameter. This installation has proved entirely inadequate to heat this large body of water. I told him that as far as the naked eye could tell, something must be missing, and that in other schools not only had we an abundance of hot water but that it had been found necessary to install a \"Powers' Automatic Temperature Control\" to prevent the water from becoming excessively hot. He asked to see the plans and specifications of one of the other schools, and I showed him that at St. Paul's School. It was then noticed that at St. Paul's the steam is taken from the boiler header through a 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" pipe as compared with an 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" pipe here, and that at St. Paul's a \"Darling-Whitlock Type K Storage Heater No. H-B-3\" had been specified, which is a high-efficiency tank, which heats up quickly, and not to be compared with what was specified for this school.\n\nThe heating engineer has two suggestions for overcoming the present inefficiency of the water-heating service, viz\n\n(a) To increase the size of the pipe line between the steam header of boilers and storage tank. This would also involve the increasing of the size of the pipes forming the coils, and putting in more coils, in the storage tank. In order to make this change it would be necessary to bore the tank to take larger intakes, for which work he says we should have to bring boiler makers here\u2014all of which would involve heavy expense. Under present circumstances he does not advise this change.\n\n(b) A second suggestion is that coils be placed in the firebox of each boiler and carried to the storage tank on the same principle as is done in kitchen ranges. He states that this method is frequently adopted, and that an abundance of hot water would result; also that the cost would be slight as compared to the first suggestion. The heating boilers are already bored to admit the necessary pipes to carry out this installation, and the entire cost would not exceed $50.00. He recommends that this method be adopted.\n\nAs the lack of hot water is a daily handicap in the operation of this school during a large part of the year, I would respectfully suggest that authority be given to overcome the difficulty; and that if the heating contractor's recommendation (b) meet with the Department's approval, that this method be tried out. This contractor offers a guarantee that the present lack of hot water can be remedied in this way.\n\nThe foregoing covers the complaints made by the Reverend Principal. The contractor, Mr. Dill, now has his carpenter foreman at work here making the corrections outlined, and has promised to leave him here until everything is made right.\nIn a previous letter I mentioned the lack of light in the main corridors in this building, and in looking over the specifications I noticed that in both the carpentry and glazing specifications it was required that all doors from the corridors should have glass panels. I intended asking the contractor to take out these doors and substitute others having glass panels as called for, but in looking at Sheet 5 of the Plans for this school I see that the doors from corridors are marked \"B\", which does not call for glass. This was obviously an inadvertence, for it was clearly the Architect's intention to provide borrowed light for all corridors. The result is that these passages are dark and gloomy.\n\nThe lighting specifications, Page 55, Clause 2, calls for a certificate of inspection from the local inspector of the Canadian Fire Underwriters' Association. Mr. Lett states that this requirement has been ignored and no inspection made.\n\nI am informed that during the winter great difficulty was found in heating the Principal's residence, and that only by the excessive heating of the main building could sufficient heat reach the residence. This condition caused a largely augmented consumption of coal, else the residence was fairly too cold for comfort. Mr. Lett asks that a separate steam main be run direct from the boiler room to the residence. I have asked the heating contractor to give me an estimate of cost for this additional service, and when this is received I shall write the Department again on this subject.\n\nIn fairness to the general contractors, Adkinson & Dill, I may say that on the whole they have given the Department a very fair job. The main complaints have to do with the doors and windows, and these defects are now in process of being remedied. The masonry of walls and foundations is holding up well, and apart from the minor troubles mentioned, the contract generally has been well executed. I should have preferred an inexpensive pressed brick in the outside walls instead of the common brick used, but I am told the Department approved the sample of the common brick submitted. Also no dark brick were used for trim, as called for in the plans.\n\nI am also told that Sheet 68a dealing with the standpipe system for fire protection was not included in the specifications furnished the contractor, and that this service has been installed as an extra, and it is not yet complete.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\nDear Sir,\n\nOn my return from the semi-official opening of the Kamloops School last week, I stopped off at Lytton for a day and found very good work was being made with regard to the re-building of the chapel at St. George's School under the supervision of Mr. Gardner Smith. I learned, however, that no word had been received in connection with the building of the workshop and I would strongly recommend that this work should be taken in hand while Mr. Smith is at the School. Possibly the Church and the workshops could be completed about the same time.\n\nI believe Mr. Lett sent you a tentative design of what is required\u2014a frame building 35 ft. by 70 ft. of two stories and a basement. The basement is needed for storage machinery, etc., the first floor being for technical training, the second storey for a gymnasium for the boys in the summer to save the assembly room in the main building. To put on the top storey it would only require the walls to be run up about nine or ten feet higher and the extra cost would not be much greater than if the building only comprised the basement and the technical training room.\n\nI think that the building might be constructed on day labour plan under Mr. Smith's supervision, as he would know just what size of timber should be used. I am of the opinion that the building should be on cement foundation with walls sheathed outside with shiplap and covered with rustic, inside walls being sheathed up with number one shiplap. Ample windows should be put in to give sufficient light in the manual training room. The roof could either be of shingles or heavy rubber roofing material, but that would depend entirely upon what is best suited to the climatic conditions at Lytton.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E.

Mr. Lett showed me a letter received from the Department a few days ago authorizing the erection of a Utility Building, to be erected under my supervision, and not to exceed $7,000.00 in cost. I staked out the new building on Saturday, and today (Monday) the excavation was commenced. Mr. Lett has explained his requirements, and I am planning the building accordingly. The overall size will be 36' x 70', and will consist of a full-size basement, and two stories above. The top floor will be used entirely for a gymnasium, and the roof will be supported by 5 trusses, so as to leave the floor clear of posts. I shall give you a fuller description and plans of this building a little later. We shall have a good deal of material left over from the Chapel that is now in use for staging, scaffolding, runways, etc., all of which will work into the new Utility Building. Also we have lumber from the old Chapel which for various reasons we could not use again in the new Chapel, and this, too, will find a place in the Utility Building. We shall carry on the two new buildings simultaneously. For this latter building I should also have an accountable cheque for $2,000.00 sent promptly for the payment of labour. The Department cheques are deposited in the Ashcroft branch of the Bank of Montreal, and are drawn against by cheques signed jointly by Mr. Lett and myself.

A few weeks ago Mr. Crombie, of Mortimer & Crombie, Plumbing & Heating Engineers, of Vancouver, was here on my invitation to give a tender for the heating of the new Chapel,\u2014which work has been awarded to this firm.\n\nWhile Mr. Crombie was here I discussed with him the problem of getting sufficient heat into the residence at the least expense. In order to determine the cause of the difficulty I got the school's engineer to make up a good fire in one of the boilers, and when 2 lbs of steam was registered it was noted that even in the residence the radiators were warming up. After a time, though, it was found that the residence radiators had cooled off, while those in the main building were still functioning. It was also noted that in the residence the steam mains were graded downward in the line of flow, and although provision had been made for dripping the condensate at the low points of the line, yet the steam had ceased circulating. Mr. Crombie states that these mains in the residence become \"air-bound\", and for that reason the steam soon ceases to pass through to the radiators. He recommends that \"air eliminators\" be installed in the steam mains in the residence, and feels sure that if this is done there should be no difficulty in heating the residence when there is a fair pressure of steam.\n\nTo install the air eliminators recommended, and to make one or two minor changes in the residence steam mains, will not cost more than $75.00 if done while the heating of the Chapel is being installed, and I recommend that this be done. While admittedly this change would not be so efficient as a direct line from the boiler header to the residence, the expense would be almost negligible in comparison, and I believe nearly all the cause for complaint could thus be overcome.\n\nAs the heating men have been notified to come on the 17th inst. to install the heating of the Chapel, I should like the Department's consent\u2014if the proposal be approved\u2014to the suggested means of correcting the residence heating.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nBuilding Supervisor.\nJune 12, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 5th instant with reference to the heating in the Principal's portion of the St. George's School, I beg to say that the Department approves of the installing of air eliminators as recommended.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Nelson,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. Gardner Smith, Esq.,\nc/o St. George's Indian School,\nLytton, B.C.\nGYMNASIUM\n\n35' x 69'\n\n(to be heated)\n\nDOWN\n\nFIRST FLOOR PLAN\nC/O St. George's School,\nLytton, B.C. July 3rd, 1929.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- New Utility Building, St. George's School.\n\nSir:\n\nWith regard to the Utility Building authorized for this School, I enclose herewith pencil drawings of the three floor plans, and of the East Elevation.\n\nThe plans as shown are what the Reverend Principal requested, and it has been my aim to give him exactly what he asks for. You will note that the size of the building is 36' x 70', and comprises basement, ground and first floors. I have marked on the various rooms the purposes for which they are intended, which I think will be found sufficiently self-explanatory.\n\nThe basement floors and foundation walls are of concrete. To the latter is anchored a wall plate 3\" x 6\", and all outside studding is 2x6\". The three rooms on the ground floor, and the Gymnasium on the first floor, are all reached by means of outside steps. This feature prevents any passing from room to room on these floors, and Mr. Lett considers this important.\n\nThe outside studding is being sheeted with shiplap, placed diagonally, over which comes a layer of building paper, and then the drop siding finish. The interior finish will be V-joint in the residence end of the basement, and in the gymnasium only. The other interior walls will not receive finish material. Double floors, with paper between, will be provided on ground and 1st floors.\n\nYou will note we are carrying up 8\"x 8\" posts on the outside walls to carry the trusses which will support the roof, the purpose being to avoid any inside posts in the gymnasium; and ample support is provided for carrying the floors.\n\nBetween the two bed rooms of basement is a wash-room, in which we are installing a wash basin and toilet. We have carried water from the school water main in pipes salvaged from the old school, and have connected the waste to a small septic tank, the overflow from which we have directed to a rock-pit built for the purpose. The Utility Building is placed about 110 ft. north of the boiler room of the main school.\n\nI think from the rough drawings and preceding comments you will have a very fair idea of the kind of building we are erecting. But there is one important point which I now wish to bring to the attention of the Department. I refer to the heating of this Utility Building. You will observe I have indicated the rooms that should have heat supplied during cold weather. On the drawings I have\nmarked a chimney, but all the rooms which require heat could not be served from one chimney, although the most necessary ones could be heated by stoves connected to the said chimney.\n\nThe heating contractor (Mortimer & Crombie, Vancouver) are now installing steam heat in the Chapel, and Mr. Crombie has made a proposition for heating the Utility Building too. Briefly, the scheme is to convey steam from the boiler room through a 2\" line, underground to the Utility Building, and to return the condensate to the boilers by means of an automatic electric pump. It would not be the intention to heat the rooms of the new building to the class-room temperatures, and with the exception of the two bed-rooms and wash-room, the other rooms would only require to be made comfortably warm for working in, which means just a little more than taking off the chill, in cold weather. We have almost enough radiators and pipes left over from the old school and chapel for this job, which Mr. Crombie has taken into consideration in quoting a price of $600.00 for the steam heating of those rooms in the Utility Building which I have indicated by the words \"To be heated\". I think his price is very moderate, and it is only owing to fortuitous circumstances that he is able to give us this low figure. Against this cost we would have the saving of the outlay in chimney (not yet built, only the footing) the stoves, and extra fuel and attendance. Also we should be avoiding a fire hazard.\n\nMr. Crombie will give a written guarantee that the service he proposes to install will perform satisfactorily, and will give a 12 months' guarantee against defects in labour and materials. It would be a decided advantage to have this new building connected up to the general heating plant of the school, and the heating contractors advise that by so doing we would not be overtaxing the existing heating facilities.\n\nShould the Department sanction carrying steam heat to the Utility Building, the $600.00 that it would cost would run us over the $7000.00 which we were asked not to exceed\u2014perhaps about $500.00 over\u2014and for this reason particularly I am unwilling to take any action in the matter without first obtaining the Department's approval with respect to the excess cost.\n\nAwaiting the favour of an early reply to this heating proposal,\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nBuilding Supervisor.\nE. Gardner-Smith,\nInspector Department of Indian Affairs,\nSt. George Indian School,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have been very busy since receiving your letter of May 23 or should have written you sooner, but would say we are pleased to know that everything is now in a satisfactory condition with the exception of some of the radiators in connection with the heating plant. Mr. Lyall, I think, when promising to rectify this, was under the impression that his men would be at the school, making another installation for you and that they could make this correction at that time.\n\nMr. Lyall is not now, however, with Murray Brothers, as he has accepted another position. We understand that the reason these radiators were not functioning was because of a drop either in the pipe or the radiator on account of shrinkage of the joist. If this is the case we think it could easily be rectified by the engineer of the school. I think you would surely not expect Murray Brothers to send a man on a special trip to make this slight adjustment.\n\nFurther, in connection with our accounts on the school we would say when in Vancouver you promised when this work was completed that you would take up the matter with the department of the amount of extra wages we were compelled to pay to the carpenters on the insistence of the department of labor.\nE. G.-S. (2).\n\nWe have received no word or remittance in this connection, and are still hoping to receive an adjustment from the department for the additional wages paid, amounting to $819.30.\n\nTrusting you will use your good graces in this respect, and wishing you personally the best of success and good health, we are,\n\nYours truly,\nADKISON & DILL, LTD.\n\nPer\n\nJCD/MA\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6464, file 888-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nG/o St. George's Indian School,\nLytton, B.C. May 23rd, 1929.\n\nMessrs Adkinson & Dill,\nGeneral Contractors,\nPender St., West,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nThis is to say that your Mr. Wills has completed the various adjustments in the building here with regard to defects which had developed, to which attention had been called. He has been over all the doors and windows, and as a result of his painstaking work the building is now as quiet as a sanctuary when the wind blows, which is in marked contrast to the conditions previously existing, both in respect of the drafts blowing through as well as the noise which was so much in evidence.\n\nMr. Wills, of course, did not touch the heating installation, which Mr. Lyall promised to rectify in respect of some of the radiators that were not functioning.\n\nI think it only fair to say that Mr. Wills has performed an enormous amount of very tedious work, in a creditable manner.\n\nYours faithfully\n\n(sgd) E. Gardner-Smith,\nInspector,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe-St. George's Indian School, Lytton, B.C.\n\nsir:\n\nWith respect to the defects which had developed in this building, I called on the contractors, Adkison & Dill, Ltd., of Vancouver, and notified them to attend to the remedying of same. After a personal visit to the school of the contractor and several members of their organization, their carpenter-foreman was left here to attend to the defects, under my supervision. Materials were also sent him. This man spent nearly two months here, and all the matters about which complaints had been made were satisfactorily dealt with, except the defective radiators in a few rooms.\n\nWhen at the contractors' office their Mr. Dill raised the matter of extra wages which he stated he had been required to pay, and that as his tender had been based on the rate of wages current in the district, this forced increase amounted to $19.30. He said that he had already taken this matter up with the Department by correspondence, but no response had been made to his representations. He asked if I would approach the Department on his behalf, and endeavour to get a settlement of the claim. He showed me a document signed by all the carpenters who worked on the job, acknowledging the extra money the firm had been ordered to pay, and which had been made retroactive.\n\nIn reply to the contractors' representations, I told them that the necessary adjustments in connection with the school building must first be done, not as a condition precedent, but under their 12 months' guarantee. I also told them that the matter was entirely out of my province, and that beyond simply passing their request on, I could not presume to take any action in a matter about which the Department had not asked for my opinion or advice.\n\nI enclose my letter to Mr. Dill reporting the completion of the adjustments in the building; and his letter on the subject of the extra wages.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nBuilding Inspector.\nATTENTION MR. CORY\n\nThe letters turned out are the correspondence with Adkison & Dill regarding their claim against the Department for the difference in wages.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6464, file 888-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nI am attaching hereto copy of letter I have today received from E. Gardner-Smith, Esq., Building Inspector at Lytton, who has been rebuilding the Chapel and Utility Building at St. George's Indian Residential School, in which he points out the importance of increasing the size of the hot water tank in the kitchen at the School and I would respectfully beg to recommend that Mr. Gardner-Smith's suggestions be put into effect, the cost of which will only amount to $95.00. I would recommend that you should wire Mr. Gardner-Smith in order that the work may be done while the plumbing and heating contractor is at the School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nEnclosure:-\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nCANADA\n\nc/o St. George's School,\nLytton, B.C., July 3rd, 1929.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVictoria, B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Ditchburn:\n\nThe work on the new Indian Chapel here is now practically completed, there just remaining to be done the finishing of the painting and heating, and the installing of the lights. Painters and heating men are doing their work now, and I shall bring an electrician here when the Utility Building is further advanced so that both buildings may be done at the one time.\n\nThe Ottawa authorities authorized me to carry out various changes in the school building with regard to the hot water storage supply, and the heating of the residence more efficiently, and these improvements are now being carried out. But there is one small matter that I did not take up with Ottawa, and it is this: The large range in the kitchen is only provided with a small 40 gal. range boiler, and it is found that the demands on this supply for dishwashing and other purposes quickly draw off the hot water, and there is then a shortage. The boiler should be at least twice the size of the present one. The plumbing and heating contractor quoted a price of $96.00 to supply and connect an 84 gal. range boiler in place of the small one now in use, provided this is done while he has men on the job. The small range boiler would then be available for use in the kitchen in the basement of the new Chapel.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Lett advised referring this matter to you, as it is important to have this larger range boiler installed while the workmen are here\u2014if approved\u2014in order to avoid increased cost if done afterwards. I shall be pleased to receive your instructions in this regard.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"E.

Mr. Lett was delighted with the result, and states that for the first time since the school was built, the residence radiators became really hot. I think we may say the cause for complaint in this regard has been overcome.\n\nThe coils placed in the heating boilers proved most efficient in heating the water in the H.W. storage tank. The water became hot in a surprisingly short time, and there is no question whatever as to the abundance of hot water which will be available whenever the heating boilers are in operation. The coils are large and sturdy, and are so placed at the rear end of the firebox of each boiler that the heat and flames come in direct contact with the coils, thus insuring maximum heating efficiency. We found it necessary to replace the firebrick baffle walls which mark the end of the fireboxes, and which serve to deflect the heat and smoke to the flues, as these walls were entirely gone. There will be an additional charge for this work, which I shall send later. This expense of renewing the firebrick baffle walls should not recur in the future, as the coils are placed where they will act as a screen to protect the baffle walls from damage. The charge of $99.50 for the coils includes, also, the alteration of the connection of the jacket heater to the H.W. storage tank so as to get better circulation and quicker results from this auxiliary service, which was very unsatisfactory before.\nThe steam heating of the Chapel proved fully satisfactory, the radiators there becoming hot simultaneously with those in the school. The radiators in the basement of the Chapel also heated well, though not quite so quickly as those in the Chapel above. The extended steam mains are properly proportioned, dripped at low points and bends, and provided with air eliminators at the extreme ends. I may confidently predict that there will be no lack of heat in the Chapel when the boilers are sufficiently fired. Dunham traps and valves have been used in the new installation.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nBuilding Supervisor.\nThe steam heating of the Chapel proved fully satisfactory, the radiators there becoming hot simultaneously with those in the school.

Gardiner-Smith  \nBuilding Supervisor.  \nDept. Of Indian Affairs  \nc/o St. Georges I.R. School Lytton B.C.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI am enclosing Accounts of extra work for the above school and trust you find same in order.\n\nI have gone through the plans of the main building regarding the capacity of the boilers and gross radiation and also have enquired of the Vulcan Iron Wrks., Re their capacity (boilers) and find the system capable of handling the proposed extra radiation.\n\nI have to go to Copper Mountain for about a week to get some work started and on my return will proceed with your work.\n\nYours very truly\n\nMortimore & Crombie\n\nPer. [Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6464, file 888-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES  \nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES  \nCANADA\nREPORT ON UTILITY BUILDING, ST. GEORGE'S SCHOOL.\n\nSir:\n\nThe work of construction of the new Utility Building is making good progress, and today a start was made in shingling the roof.\n\nFrom the blue print I sent the Department showing the floor plans and elevation, you will know just the type of building we are erecting. It will be quite devoid of ornamentation and frills, and perhaps severely plain, but will give the school the added room and facilities asked for by the Reverend Principal.\n\nI was glad to receive the Department's approval of the proposal to carry steam heat into this building from the school heating plant, for as this is a frame structure there was the suggestion of fire hazard in heating with stoves. Mr. Crombie, of Mortimer & Crombie, is an unusually conscientious and efficient man in his profession; and from his letter (which I enclose) you will see that he has been very careful to make quite sure that the added load would not overtax the capacity of the boilers. I got back the complete plans of the school from Askison & Dill, and loaned the heating sheets and the specifications to Mr. Crombie so that he might make a careful check-up on the existing radiation, and boiler capacity. As the Utility Building occupies a site somewhat lower than that of the school, provision will be made to return the condensate by an automatic electric pump with sufficient horse-power to cause the 3 K.W. lighting engine to start up and take the load, thus avoiding the danger of exhausting the lighting batteries.\n\nAs this district runs a close second to S.W. Alberta in strong winds, we have taken pains to insure the strength and rigidity of the Utility Building. The outside walls are of \"H\" studding, and all the wall sheeting, as well as the sub-floors, has been put on diagonally. This has added nearly 50% to the labour-cost of sheeting the walls, but the result justifies it. The siding will, of course, be placed horizontally, and building paper placed between the shiplap and siding.\n\nFour sturdy roof trusses have been erected so as to carry the roof without interior posts on the top floor (gymnasium) and ample strength has been provided in beams and posts to carry the ground and first floors, as shown in the blue print.\n\nThe plumbing in this building will consist of a toilet and wash basin in the wash-room between the two bed-rooms shown in the basement, and a drinking fountain built into a recess in the wall of the Gymnasium. Provision will be made for easy emptying of all water\npipes in the event of the building ever being unoccupied or unheated in cold weather. We have built a septic tank for this building, as its situation is too low for connection to the school sewage system.\n\nI have completed arrangements for the painting, electric wiring and heating of the Utility Building, all of which should be performed during the next two or three weeks, and the building should be entirely completed, and my men gone, previous to the re-opening of the school on the 16th of August. Practically all the materials needed for the work are now on the ground.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the accountable cheques sent me have been deposited in the Ashcroft branch of the Bank of Montreal, to the credit of \"St. George's I.R.S. Bldg. A/c\", and have been drawn against, for labour only, by cheques signed jointly by Rev. Mr. Lett and myself. My accounts are all in perfect order, and entered up to date. The sum of the cheques issued agrees exactly with the sum of the time-sheets, as of course they should. Mr. Kay, who has worked with me from the start, and who is my right-hand man, is quite capable of carrying the work through to completion, including the keeping of the men's time. I mention this in case the Department might wish to transfer me to Gleichen in the near future, in which event I would suggest that Mr. Graham, the Indian Agent here, append his signature to the labour-cheques in my stead. Should the Department wish to recall me, I could make all necessary arrangements for the completion of the work on just a few days' notice.\n\nThe Utility Building is running close to estimates, and is likely to cost slightly less than the sum authorized. The cost to the 20th instant may be summarized thus:\n\n| Description                  | Amount   |\n|------------------------------|----------|\n| All Materials thus far delivered | $3103.30 |\n| Labour of all kinds          | $1371.05 |\n| **Total Cost to July 20th**  | $4474.35 |\n\nThis leaves ample margin for the electric lighting, painting, plumbing, carpentry, and further purchases of materials to finish. The steam heating has been specially authorized to cost $600.00, which brings the total amount authorized up to $7600.00, and I feel confident of keeping within this limit.\n\nThe weather has continued favourable, and with the exception of frequent winds, the conditions have been ideal for outdoor work.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nBuilding Supervisor.\n**Canadian National Railways**\n\n**STRAIGHT BILL OF LADING - ORIGINAL - NOT NEGOTIABLE**\n\n---\n\n**RECEIVED**, subject to the classifications and tariffs in effect on the date of issue of this Original Bill of Lading.\n\n---\n\n**EVANS, COLEMAN & EVAN LTD.**, the goods described below, in apparent good order, except as noted (contents and condition of contents of packages unknown), marked, consigned and destined as indicated below, which said Railway agrees to carry to its usual place of delivery at said destination, if on its road, otherwise to deliver to another carrier on the route to said destination.

The height and length of the fire box, combined with a large combustion chamber, provides ample room for the air and heat producing gases to mix and burn, thereby reducing fuel consumption.\n\nThe boiler proper is a single unit constructed of six plates of steel, fire door ring, and stay bolts joined by electric welding.\nTubes expanded and beaded.\nNo holes are punched through inside plates.\nSmoke boxes, front and rear, are detachable.\nSmoke connection is horizontal at rear of boiler.\nGrates are self-supporting, of the rocking and dumping type, are heavy, strong and durable, with fifty to fifty-five per cent air space.\nBase is detachable.\n\nThis boiler is distinctly an advance in boiler construction.

I wish to explain the last item of $72.00.\n\nIn order to overcome the total lack of hot water in St. George's School the Department authorized the placing of coils in each of the heating boilers, which has been done, with the result that when the heating boilers are in operation there is an abundance of hot water. It was found, however, that the fire-deflecting walls at the rear of the firebox in each boiler had become disintegrated and broken down, which condition should not be allowed to continue. Also, we were to place the coils directly in front of these walls, and it would have been extremely difficult to replace said walls after the coils were installed, as they now form a protective screen in front of them. I enclose a circular illustrative of the boilers in use, and giving a sectional view showing the baffle walls which we have had to replace.\n\nThe firebricks and fireclay for the new baffle walls had to be shipped in from Vancouver by local freight, and 200 firebricks, and a sack of fireclay, were used. The cost or labour and materials for this repair work make up the charge of $72.00 shown.\n\nI am not certain whether or not I am doing right in including this charge in this Voucher; perhaps it should be assumed by the school authorities. However, this can be left to the discretion of the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\nTHIS IS 165-0-5\n\nCLOSED\n\nPLEASE SEE\n\n165-0-5C\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(RG 10 Volume 6464)\n\nFile 888-5, part 1\nLytton Agency - St. George's Residential School -\nBuilding Maintenance-Supplies-Accounts\n1923 - 1927\n\nFile 888-5, part 2\nLytton Agency - St. George's Residential School -\nBuilding Maintenance-Supplies-Accounts\n1927 - 1929\n\nFile 888-5, part 3\nLytton Agency - St. George's Residential School -\nBuilding Maintenance-Supplies-Accounts\n1929 - 1933\n### NEW CHAPEL & UTILITY BUILDING, ST.

Principal, as before. The reason for the omission is that both Mr. Lett and the Indian Agent were absent from Lytton when I left. I feel sure the Department will accept my Statement as rendered.\n\nI note in the Department's letter advising me of my appointment as Inspector of Construction for the Old Suns School, I am to receive $6.00 per day, and Indian Agent Gooderham will certify my Time A/C. I shall have future Vouchers certified as directed.\n\nIn the Wage Scale set for the various trades, in keeping with the prevailing rates, the tendency is generally upward, but the remuneration set for the man capable of supervising all the work is even less than before, in which inglorious distinction he stands alone! Without in any way reflecting on the good intentions of the Department which I have the honour of serving, may I ask if it is not possible to do somewhat better for the Department's representative on the job? My best services, and my full loyalty to the Department, are assured in any case, and it is with all due respect that I am venturing to allude to what seems to me to be an inconsistency in the scale of wages as affecting myself.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nOttawa, September 24th, 1929.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nIn connection with your Expense Account for the month of August, I beg to point out that a receipt from the Hotel Macdonald for $5.50 charged therein is missing. Kindly obtain and forward same.\n\nCheque in payment of your account is going forward.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. H. Paget\nChief Accountant.\n\nE. Gardner Smith, Esq.,\nInspector of Construction,\nCare of Indian Office,\nGLENHEIN,\nAlberta.\nMr H. Graham,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton.\n\nDear Mr. Graham-\n\nI have asked the teachers to requisition for a health scales and which you will find included in the present form for school supplies.\n\nWe have been in the habit of weighing the children once a month which we find essential from a health standpoint as it gives us a monthly check on the progress of the children.\n\nThe present scales has become inaccurate being a very low priced type it has gone its limit hence the above inclusion which I trust you will see fit to endorse.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nmaintain that if the children are sent in young they are worked to death before they grow up which is of course absurd, yet it is a feeling we are obliged to contend with, and takes some combattting and argument.\n\nWhile the children are not worked, they are without supervision when not in the class room and I believe the arrangement would justify make right two wrongs, one in the school, that of children without supervision getting into endless mischief because of no occupation and also relieve the minds of the parents, and we would find a greater sympathy to the school.\n\nKindly take the matter up with the Dept. with a view of immediate increase in the Class Room Seating Capacity.\n\nYours very obediently\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nMr H. Graham,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton.\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nWith our present numbers of 147\u20142 in the hospital who will be back to school shortly, 5 still absent which absence I am unable to account for, I have been diligent in enquiries and reports of their being yet out, and also an expected increase of perhaps some 26 whom you contemplate sending in, it will be necessary to increase the number of desks in the class rooms by 35.\n\nAs the quarterly report shows there are now grades 1 & 1A and the contemplated increase will increase this number to approximately 95. These children are mainly under 10 years of age and of no use in manual training of any sort as by virtue of their age they are not able for much only play.\n\nWith the present system of half day class room work 50% of these children are running around without supervision and would like permission to rearrange the Jr. Work so that these children would receive teachers supervision from 9 o'clock until 4 o'clock. Play ground supervision for two hrs. and from 10 to 12 in the Class room in the A.M. and 1,30 to 3 in the P.M.\n\nThis arrangement would mean an additional teacher and a salary of $600 per month which I think I could stand with the proposed increase of numbers.\n\nIt might also relieve a feeling now existing among the parents wherein they...\nSir:\n\nI herewith beg to enclose a requisition for school material from St. George's Residential School.\n\nYou will note that on it they have asked for a set of scales. In regard to this I beg to state that the children are weighed regularly, and the scales that they have now are very inaccurate, and it is most essential that these children's weights should be kept properly, and I would like to recommend that a good new set be supplied.\n\nYou will also note that they have applied for a number of desks. The Rev. Principal has just discussed this question with me, and he states that he is trying to add more pupils to the school, and as the majority of these children who are now being taken in are all very young, being seven and eight years of age, and are quite useless to do anything in the line of work around the school, he has decided that it would be very much better for them to be under supervision, and to have them in school a certain time both morning and afternoon. This will necessitate another teacher, and also mean more desks, thus the requisition.\n\nTrusting that the Department will approve of this,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 10, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 6020-06 of the 2nd instant, enclosing requisition for school material for the St. George's Indian Residential School. You may purchase a set of scales, suitable for weighing children. Please see that no unnecessary expense is incurred.\n\nI have read the Principal's letter, concerning the need for more desks. The Department will approve of the purchase of whatever number is really required. The requisition states that 39 extra desks are now needed. Please check up on this and make sure that there is space for them. You should ascertain the exact sizes required and place the order with Clarke and Stuart, of Vancouver. Ask them to give you their special price to the Dominion Government. When the desks have been supplied, if satisfactory, please certify the account, in duplicate, and forward it to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\nMr. H Graham,\nIndian Agent\nLytton.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nRe our Lighting Plant I beg to make the following report:\n\nThis plant has never given the service that it should have given for the type of engine installed. When first occupying the school the engines would not switch off and as a result continued to run on the batteries. I have been obliged many times to get up in the night to switch them off otherwise the strain on the batteries would be enormous. The batteries also had a leaky cell which caused rapid discharge, and I reported to the company shortly after moving into the school. We have been obliged to replace three sets of valves in the large unit. This the company claims due to over heating on account of poor circulation the pipes having become blocked with alkali in the water. We have detached the pipes and cleaned out the water system three times since installation, I also had to replace one head on the large unit due to a crack.\n\nThe repairs on the plant to date has cost the school \u00a3133.36 with a bill now outstanding of \u00a340.00 and a list of repairs just submitted by the engineer which will run into another \u00a350.00. These repairs have all been put onto the large unit, the 3 K.W. engine has not given us any trouble at all, and is now working perfectly while we are unable at present to get any more than 35 amps out of the 6 K.W. unit, which is only about half of its generating power.\n\nThe batteries at the present time are in very bad shape so much so that extra charging has to be done to keep any charge in them. This condition of the batteries is not due to over load in lighting or to neglect in any way, but due to defective engines and also to the leaky cell.\n\nI have been constantly reporting the grief we have had to the company principally through Commissioner Ditchburn. My engineer has been constantly complaining and has been obliged to be on duty night and day in order to give light at all.\n\nLast Nov. and Dec. we burned approximately \u00a3250.00 worth of gas and oil due to valve trouble, and extra running in recharging batteries. The plant has during the year run us into an enormous overhead expense all of which seems due to a defective plant. The Lister Co. will not hear of this yet I have seen that the plant has had the very best care, and personally cannot account for the grief we have been having. Since the little unit has given good service I cannot see why the large should not have done the same, were it not that something is wrong.\n\nIn conclusion I might say that I cannot see that the school or the Dept. should have to stand the expense of a new set of batteries.\nwhich is now evident. The last visit made to the school by a representative I approached him concerning the condition of the batteries, and he had the company replace the cracked cell, and also stated that he would see what could be done with the battery people regarding the installation of a new set. I have not had any more from him re his suggestion and am therefore submitting the condition to you, with a view of having the Dept. take the matter with the company.\n\nThe school is not responsible for the present condition of the batteries especially since we have done our best to keep the engines in good running order, the expense of which as you see has been enormous.\n\nSince the softener was installed we have used the softened water entirely and in one month after the circulation had been cleaned out and new valves put in we again had the same trouble develop. We cannot go on spending on the plant in such a way without results. The whole trouble is centred in the large unit and this and the batteries should be replaced by the firm.\n\nYou have personally been here and have witnessed the grief we have endured with the plant.\n\nI shall be glad to give you any further information in my power in order that we shall not be obliged to enter upon the long winter evenings with a broken down lighting system.\n\nYours Very obediently\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nP.S. The Company lately in reply to correspondence stating the condition of the plant, said it was impossible for it to become this way even with no care at all\u2014 but have taken no step whatever in the matter.\n\n[Signature]\nSir:-\n\nI herewith beg to enclose a letter from the Rev. Principal of St. George's Residential School, fully explaining the unsatisfactory state of the lighting system, in the school.\n\nI might say that the Rev. Principal has called me up there times without number on account of the unsatisfactory state of this, and even today they are having to use candles every little while as the plant goes wrong, and they are left in darkness. I feel sure that this plant was not put in correctly in the first place, or it could not have given the trouble that it has. In fact, a plant of this description should have run several years without any appreciable expense. There are other plants of the same description at some of the other schools, which have given no trouble at all, and I certainly think that the Department should make the Lister Agents either replace this plant, or put it in satisfactory running order.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

Our electrician called a couple of months ago at this school and gave the plant a thorough inspection. He found on arrival that the plants were being abused, in that the water cooling the engine was not the proper height, thereby naturally causing the engines to run exceptionally hot. This was carelessness on the part of the attendant, and was pointed out to Mr. Lett at the time he was there. Since that time a new operator has been put on the job, but he has been ordering unnecessary repair parts for these engines (that is in our opinion). I think you will admit that we should be in a position to know the parts which are never called for and never need replacing, and since he is ordering these parts and insists on getting them, and when he gets them admits that they do not benefit any, I think that there is something wrong with the operator.\n\nI will go to Lytton this week and would ask you to hold this matter in abeyance until you hear from me further, as I will give you full details upon my return to Vancouver.\n\nThanking you in advance and assuring you that we will do our utmost to see that the different schools get the best service and satisfaction from our equipment.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.

Not one atom of steam will go through; it just condenses and freezes up, and they do not appear to have left any places to drain these pipes.\n\nThe engineer is working night and day, and half his time is taken up thawing out pipes and fixing others as they burst from being frozen. The radiators and piping throughout the building appear to be leaking more or less. There is little or no heat going through to the residence, which is practically uninhabitable, although the temperature is only 40\u00b0 above zero outside.\n\nThe engineer reports that he very much doubts whether the electric light system will keep going until Christmas. This matter I reported to you sometime ago, and you replied on October 13, 1929, that you would take it up with the agents and that they were sending a man to put things right, but the system seems to be no better.\n\nI would like to recommend that these firms be required to send men to put things right, now being the time for them to be on the ground to see that the plants are not working properly.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssist. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHG/MD\nJan. 11, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Smith,\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter which has been received from the Indian Agent at Lytton with reference to the St. George's School. Will you kindly look over this letter and advise me what you think of its contents.\n\nI may say with reference to the lighting plant that I have asked the Lister Co. to send one of their experts to Lytton to check up the lighting plant.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. Gurney Orr,\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nE. Gardner Smith, Esq.,\nGleichen, Alta.\nOttawa, January 13th, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI am returning herewith the account which you submitted for the current year's fees for inspecting the boilers at St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, B.C., and would request that you forward same in triplicate to Mr. H. Graham, Indian Agent, Lytton, B.C., as it is necessary that the account be certified by him before payment can be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nChief Inspector of Boilers,\nVancouver,\nB. C.\nLytton, B. C.,\nJan. 17, 1930.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn October 2nd, I forwarded to the Department a letter received from the Rev. Principal of St. George's Residential School, in connection with the unsatisfactory condition of the lighting plant.\n\nThe Department replied on October 15th, stating that they had written to the Lister Company, asking them to have an engineer examine the plant at the earliest possible moment.\n\nOn December 12th, I again wrote the Department on the same subject, as the Lister people had apparently not done anything in the matter of sending an engineer here.\n\nI am this morning in receipt of a telephone message from Mr. Lett, the Rev. Principal, stating that the largest of the two engines is just about gone, and that batteries are in the same condition, so that he is now having to run the small engine continuously to get sufficient light, and this does not give power enough for the washing.\n\nSomething will have to be done very quickly, or they will be both without light and power. Trusting the Department will take this up again with the Lister Company,\n\nAssist. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nTo date we have not had any action by the Lister people about the Lighting Plant. It is not in shape and needs immediate attention. I have already reported its condition of repair and stated that I did not think the School nor the Dept. should be at the expense of reconditioning as the big engine never functioned properly and the batteries were installed with a defect. Both of which defects were reported to the company.\n\nI have again written to the Co. today trying to get action.\n\nYours very obediently\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nConstruction Office,\nOld Suns School, Gelichen, Alta.\nJan. 17th, 1930.\n\nR.Guerney Orr Esq.\nArchitect.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- St. George's Indian School, Lytton, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 11th instant with copy of a letter from the Indian Agent at Lytton, B.C.\n\nIt is noted from Mr. Graham's letter that trouble is being experienced in getting heat into the Chapel and Utility Building, and that the Residence is not being sufficiently heated. On receiving this information I at once wired the heating contractors in Vancouver, a copy of which message I enclose, and I delayed replying to your letter pending a reply to my wire. No reply has yet come, so I do not know if the conditions complained of still exist.\n\nRegarding the heating of the Chapel, this was tested out before I left, and the radiators heated there simultaneously with those in the main school. The work was installed in conformity with the best practice in the trade, the lines being properly graded, vented, provided with air eliminators, and with a wet return line underground to join the wet return in the main building. Abundant radiation was placed in the Chapel.\n\nThe Utility Building was not provided with a great deal of radiation, as some parts of that building were not intended to be heated, and we did not want to put too much added load on the boilers, but radiators were put where asked for. The condensate from this building is returned to the boilers by an automatic force-pump system.\n\nThe Residence heating was found to be airbound, and by installing air eliminators in the Residence basement we overcame that trouble, and the radiators throughout the residence heated well, under the test we gave it, and Mr. Lett remarked that it was the first time those rads had ever heated properly since the school was built.\n\nMy own impression is that the boilers have not been steadily and sufficiently fired, and a proper head of steam obtained. It is a large institution, and during extreme cold the boilers should have day and night attention and a good head of steam maintained. This means burning lots of coal, but that cannot be avoided. The engineer (assuming he is still the same) is a diminutive man, both semi-deaf and crippled, and I can understand his being unable to keep up steam during rigorous weather, unless given adequate assistance.\nA little dribble of steam is not enough in cold weather, and just invites freezing troubles.\n\nBefore leaving Lytton I placed on the Principal's desk a 12 months' guarantee from the heating contractors, in which they agreed to return to the school in the event of anything going wrong with their work, and make any necessary adjustments or repairs, for a period of one year, without expense to the Department. This heating firm (Mortimer & Crombie, of Vancouver) have an excellent reputation, and would undoubtedly observe the terms of their guarantee, if notified of the need for same.\n\nNot having any information later than Mr. Graham's letter of Dec. 12th, I have no way of knowing how conditions now are at the school at Lytton, but expect to hear from the heating contractors in answer to my wire at any time; and should further information come I will forward it to you. Should the Department wish me to do so, I will take a few days off from my work here, and go to Lytton and see for myself what the troubles are, and take the necessary steps to have them remedied under the twelve months' guarantee, should mechanical troubles actually exist.\n\nWith regard to the lighting plant at St. George's School, it was giving trouble last summer, and the lights gave out several times. I think the plant suffered from too much tampering with by local help in the endeavor to fix things they did not understand.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nGleichen, Alta.

LITTON COMPLAINTS RECEIVED FROM LYTON SCHOOL OF FAILURE OF HEAT TO REACH CHAPEL UTILITY BUILDING AND RESIDENCE STOP ALSO FROZEN AND BURST PIPES STOP PLEASE FIRE ME IF ANYTHING HAS BEEN DONE BY YOU TO REDUCE THESE TROUBLES OR IF THESE CONDITIONS STILL EXIST.\n\n(Sgd) L. Gardner-Smith\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6464, file 888-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMr. E. Gardner-Smith,\nGleichen, Alta.\n\nDear Mr. Gardner-Smith,\n\nYours to hand. It is true the heating in the Chapel, Utility Building, and Residence has not been satisfactory during the cold snap. There was on the other hand an unnecessary cry made during my period in the Hospital. That is they made the situation somewhat exaggerated yet I do not think it will ever be what it ought to be until a separate unit is put in for the Chapel and Utility Building or a Vacuum system is installed; this latter is out of the question as we have not sufficient power to handle the pump. If a vacuum system were feasible it would no doubt solve the problem as it would increase the efficiency of the boilers and insure even distribution throughout, since this cannot be done it seems the plan would be to install a separate boiler in the utility building for heating both buildings.\n\nThere are two burst radiators in the Chapel and the heating in the Utility building has never functioned. We have been obliged to forget it entirely and installed a stove in the Manual Training room, the Gym has not been used for about one month and we cannot hope to use it until the weather relieves. We have also not had a service in the Chapel since Christmas Day. It would take approximately 2\u00bd to 3 tons of coal a day to keep it heated sufficiently for use and the school building would be so overheated as to be very uncomfortable and involve a great waste of fuel which we cannot afford. I believe with a separate unit we would save considerable expense in heating.\n\nThe trouble seems to be in the fact that the condensate is to slow in returning during the cold weather and is also so great that the pipes cannot handle it so that it freezes in the traps and turns or elbows.\n\nMr. Crombie was here and said nothing could be done other than install a vacuum pump for which as I have stated we have not sufficient power for operation.\n\nThe residence during the snap which has been rather prolonged, has not been at all comfortable the same trouble existing, evidently the pipes being unable to handle the condensate. During the milder weather there seems to be a much better circulation and no trouble to keep heat in the radiators in this wing. The central portion of the building is always comfortable and would not take much fuel to keep so but when the boilers have to be forced to get heat in the residence the middle gets so warm that windows have to be thrown open and a waste follows.\n\nI trust the above will give you an insight into the situation as I have already stated something will have to be done before we enter upon another winter.\n\nPersonally I am picking up slowly but not as brisk as I might be.\nCopper Mountain, B.C.\n\nMr. E. Gardiner Smith\nGlacier, Alta.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe your wire of even date,\nMr. Litt informed me of the trouble they were having\nwith the heating at St. George School in December.\nI went to Lytton on the 19th and made a very\ncareful survey of the heating system, at that time\nI made a report to the Indian Agent Mr. Graham\nalso to Mr. Litt as Mr. Litt was in hospital.\n\nThey have a most unusual condition\nin regard to steam pressure, the boiler ratings\nshow ample capacity but they cannot get steam.\nWe have done about all that we can do with\nthe system and I would again advise that the\nDept. Engineer make a report as same as regards\nto more boiler capacity. Vacuum pump or what\never is necessary.\n\nSincerely yours,\nH. S.

Jan. 24th, 1930.\n\nR.Guerney Orr Esq.\nArchitect.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe - St. George's School, Lytton, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nSince my letter to you of the 17th instant, regarding heating troubles at the above-mentioned school, I have heard both from the heating contractor, Mr. Crombie, who installed the additional heating in the Chapel and Utility Building, and from the Reverend Principal, Mr. Lett, both of which letters I enclose herewith.\n\nLast August we tested out the heating, and everything then functioned perfectly, but it is apparent there is considerable difference in a mid-summer test as compared to one in mid-winter. For instance, the temperature was nearly 100 in the shade then, and has been 25 below zero recently at Lytton.\n\nIt is probably you have had further advice from Lytton since your letter to me of the 11th inst., so probably you will have received a copy of the Report which Mr. Crombie mentions. Apparently the boilers are incapable of taking care of any load additional to the heating of the school itself, unless assisted by some method of speeding up the circulation in the wet return line. However, before presuming to make any recommendation, I should like to go into the matter thoroughly with Dunham's representative in Calgary (Mr. Alex. Walker) in whose technical knowledge relating to heating services I have much confidence. I intend going to Calgary for the week-end, and while there shall discuss the whole question in detail with Mr. Walker, after which I will write you more fully and more definitely.\n\nNeedless to say, I am much concerned over the unsatisfactory heating service at Lytton, and shall do anything in my power to assist in giving them relief.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6464, file 883-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n| DATE   | DETAIL                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1930   | St. George's School                                                   | $22.20 |\n| Jan. 20 | To Inspection of Boilers at St. George's Residential School, during the year 1929 | $22.20 |\n\nI hereby certify that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that all expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6464, file 888-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n**Department of Indian Affairs, British Columbia**\n\n**Lytton AGENCY**\n\nTo Chief Inspector of Boilers, Office of the Chief Inspector of Boilers, Vancouver, B.C.\n\n| DATE     | DETAIL                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1930 Jan. 20 | St. George's School $22.20 To Inspection of Boilers at St. George's Residential School, during the year 1929, | $22.20 |\n\n---\n\n**BOILER INSPECTION ACT**\n\n**NOTICE OF ANNUAL FEES**\n\n(Owner's name) Department of Indian Affairs, Dominion Government, Ottawa.\n\n(Address) re St. George Indian School, Lytton, B.C.\n\nOffice of the Chief Inspector of Boilers, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nDecember 19\n\n| BOILER No. | Arrears | Current Year's Fees | Deductions | Balance due. |\n|------------|---------|---------------------|------------|--------------|\n| 44029-B.C. |         |                     |            |              |\n| 44008      |         |                     |            |              |\n| 44028      |         |                     |            |              |\n\nStatutory Interest 6 per cent.\n\nTotal due January 1st, 1930 (Last day for payment, January 31st, 1930) $22.20\n\nNOTE.\u2014At the commencement of each calendar year a tax by way of a fee is levied on the owner of each boiler, as required by the \"Boiler Inspection Act.\" No Certificate of Inspection permitting further use of a boiler can be issued until all fees have been paid.

The choice of this Gravity System may possibly have been made owing to the fact that the initial cost of such System is slightly lower than a Vacuum System, the cost of which would, of course have to include a Vacuum Pump.\n\nWe have found that a Heating System running over a comparatively large horizontal area, such as yours possibly covers, is more satisfactory when handled by a Vacuum Pump which makes for the pulling of a speedy and positive circulation through the System. On heating systems in high buildings covering a comparatively small horizontal area the problem of getting free circulation back to the boiler is apt to be much less difficult.\n\nWithout seeing your plant it is of course impossible for our Engineers to express anything like an intelligent opinion as to what might be done to remedy the situation, and even if we were to make an inspection of the plant, it is just possible there may be certain limitations beyond which it would be impossible to go toward a remedy owing to your location. For example, if the condition could be corrected by the installation of a Vacuum Pump the question of motive power would have to be considered as it is just possible you have no electric current available there outside of your own local plant, and any electric driven Vacuum Pump would possibly require a 2 or 3 HP Motor, which your electric plant might or might not have capacity to drive. Any attempt to operate a Steam Driven Vacuum Pump from your low pressure boilers would not be practical.\nHowever, as stated above, it is nearly impossible to discuss your difficulty intelligently without seeing your plant, and for the purpose of doing this we would be willing to send our Engineer from Vancouver to go into the matter fully with you on condition that you pay the expense of his trip. We would, of course, make no charge for his time or services outside of his travelling expenses.\n\nIf you are satisfied in your own mind that a Vacuum Pump could be installed, that would solve your difficulty, and in the event of our Vacuum Pump being used on the job there would be no charge of any kind for our Engineer to make an inspection, that is this trip would be made at our own expense.\n\nIf a Vacuum Pump cannot be installed the only thing that we could suggest would be to have some practical Heating Contractor go into the plant and eliminate as far as possible any lifts in the pipe lines, thereby giving free circulation back to the boilers by gravity.\n\nWe shall be very glad to hear from you at any time and to give you any information regarding any point that can be covered by mail.\n\nYours very truly\n\nC.A.DUNHAM CO.

There seems very little wrong with the general installation according to plans and specifications.\n\nHowever there is an unusual condition experienced in regard to maintaining steam; whenever the fires get low the pressure is not sufficient to heat the extreme ends of the system.\n\nI would advise that you get in touch with the C.A.Dunham's Co's representative at Vancouver, and have their Engineer make a survey and report to the Department. They maintain an engineering staff for that purpose.\n\nWe might suggest that provided there was sufficient electric power a Return Vacuum Pump could be installed that would greatly increase the boiler efficiency.

I was in for inspection the other day after some more extreme cold, and found some more radiators gone. I hate to go back again. The boilers cannot keep sufficient heat in these wings and they both freeze up.\n\nThe Residence has had to be thawed out several times, and only the other day we did not have any heat until four o'clock PM, and then with both fireplaces and stove in basement burning from early morning.\n\nThe letters enclosed will speak for themselves.\n\nWe are unable to shut the Chapel off as there is no valve in the line and I hesitated to cut the steam pipe as I felt I did not want to do extra damage.\n\nI have not had the Dunham people here as I felt the expense of bringing them would be of no avail while the weather is still so cold. I have never seen such continuous below zero temperatures here before.\n\nYours very sincerely\n\n(Sgd) A.R.Lett\nPrincipal.\nR. Guerney Orr Esq.\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- St. Georges Indian School, Lytton, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nWith further reference to the heating troubles at St. George's School, I enclose herewith copies of further correspondence on the subject from the Reverend Principal, Mr. Lett, which is self-explanatory; and Dunham's, & Mortimer & Crombie's suggestions.\n\nWhen in Calgary today I had a conference with Mr. Alex Walker, Dunham Co.'s Engineer for Alberta and Eastern B.C., and the situation was reviewed carefully. I had with me the plans of the buildings, and the recent correspondence relating to the heating troubles, and the reports of Mr. Crombie, and Dunham's Vancouver Engineer's recommendations.\n\nMr. Walker states he is unable to make any very definite recommendation without first checking up the entire job including the capacity of the heating boilers themselves. He says heating boilers are usually over-rated regarding the amount of load they can carry in sub-zero weather. He further states it is probable in very cold weather there is more condensate than can be returned to the boilers with sufficient rapidity over the far-spread sluggish horizontal lines without other help than exists at present. In other words, he thinks the circulation of steam is retarded owing to the system being overloaded with condensate.\n\nTo relieve the excess of condensate he makes the tentative suggestion that the wet return from the Chapel be diverted to the Utility Building, towards which there is an excellent fall in grade, and from the Utility Building the condensate could be delivered back to the heating boilers of the School by means of the force pump now installed in the basement of the Utility Building. This change would relieve the wet return of the school of any added load. In this connection the capacity of the automatic force pump in the Utility Building would be first tested.\n\nRegarding the insufficiency of heat in the Residence, Mr. Walker suggests carrying an additional steam main into the Residence from the blind end of a steam main in the school basement almost adjoining the Residence, thus making a loop with the other main which is now furnishing heat to the Residence. The addition of air eliminators which we made last summer relieved the air-bound condition then existing, but apparently additional steam circulation is needed for extremely cold weather. I recall Mr. Crombie said this would give added heat, but he did not then think it necessary, as all the residence radiators heated splendidly at that time.\nIt is only too apparent that an unfortunate condition exists in connection with the heating service at St. George's School, and to me, personally, it is a matter of deep concern. I shall be only too glad to assist in any way I can to give those good people relief, and to bring their heating service to a proper condition of efficiency.\n\nMr. Walker has kindly consented to accompany me to Lytton, if so desired by the Department, and to check up every feature of the existing system, and give us the benefit of his knowledge and technical experience in outlining what should be done to correct the troubles which may be found in the heating service as it now stands. I could get away from my work here for a few days without detriment, and would arrange with Mr. Gooderham to visit the job daily in my absence. I should also wire Mr. Crombie, the heating contractor who did the heating work, to meet us at Lytton, and we should then be in a position to make an intelligent recommendation to the Department as to the necessary procedure to follow, by checking up the job itself, under mid-winter conditions as they now exist.\n\nI realize it is possible the Department may have made other arrangements already for dealing with the heating troubles referred to, but I am offering the foregoing suggestion regarding a visit to the St. George's School in case no action is being taken already, and subject, of course, to the Department's wish that I co-operate in solving this difficulty. Mr. Walker would make no charge other than his actual out-of-pocket expenses; and in giving attention to our problem he would be acting in unison with Dunham's Vancouver branch.\n\nShould the Department decide to send Mr. Walker and me to Lytton (or Mr. Walker alone) it would be well to do so at once so that the conditions may be observed as they exist now rather than when warmer weather returns. By wiring a reply we could leave at a day's notice after receiving the wire.\n\nThe foregoing suggestions are respectfully submitted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nFeb. 13, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to the heating trouble at the St. George's School I would ask you to please have Mr. Walker proceed to Lytton at his convenience and submit through you a recommendation that will overcome the difficulties experienced in heating the different portions of the Lytton buildings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Owing to the constant burning out of the valves the valve seats in the heads are gone. I have reported these defects to the Lister people and have been careful to keep them informed of the heating of the engines and the constant burning out of exhaust valves. I have also asked them to send their representative here to go over the plant and have it put into shape but while I received answers to my correspondence saying that their man would visit the School at certain dates they have not responded.\n\nAs you know the plant has given us continual trouble and has never given satisfaction even after the circulation was put in shape and it is time something was done to make this part of the institution a workable entity.\n\nThe batteries are completely done and I cannot afford a new set, but will be obliged to purchase a set at an early date if the Co. cannot be persuaded to make the plant good as it has not been to the neglect of the school that the plant has gone to such a state of condition. I have always maintained that a new pair of engines and batteries should be installed at no cost whatever to the School or the Department and am still of that opinion.\n\nThe Co. have not visited the School even after they were asked to do so from Ottawa. I therefore feel that something should be brought to bear which would make them give us some recognition.\n\nIn writing the Dept I enclosed an account of the repairs put on the plant since installation, which has since mounted somewhat, and I do not feel that it should be necessary that new engines, should have new engine heads, and the plant new batteries, if the installation was what it is supposed to be.\n\nIn conclusion I might say that we have done everything to keep the plant going, but it has now approached the state where we can expect at any moment to be without lights.\n\nPlease take this matter up with the Dept. at once as it is urgent.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\nMr. H. Graham\nIndian Agent,\nLytton.\n\nPrincipal\nLytton, B.C.,\nMarch 25, 1930.\n\nI herewith beg to enclose a letter from the Rev. Principal of St. George's Indian Residential School, which will speak for itself.\n\nOn visiting the school recently, the engineer drew my attention to the deplorable state of the lighting plant. I immediately discussed it with the Rev. Principal, and he assured me that everything possible had been done to get the Lister people who installed this plant to make it good, but up to the present they have never even sent an engineer to look it over.\n\nEngines of this description should certainly not be burning out valves and one can quite easily see that with the constant burning of these it is going to injure the valve seats, and give no end of trouble. This plant to my knowledge has been most unsatisfactory practically from the very day it was installed, and I really think that they should be made to make this good.\n\nThe batteries are in such a state now that they cannot be relied on for any power, with the result that the engines have to be kept going when any power is needed, and then with the state that they are in at present it is hard to say when they may play out altogether, and then the school will be completely without either light or power.\n\nTrusting that something will be done in the very near future to remedy these defects,\n\nAssist. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYours obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham) Indian Agent.\nApril 8, 1930.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 25th instant with further reference to the electric lighting plant at the St. George's School, I have today written to the Lister Co. and asked them to send their representative to Lytton immediately and report to the Department on the condition of the plant. If their representative does not arrive within a reasonable time please advise me.\n\nI may say that the Department has installed a large number of these plants in the past years and the Lytton installation is the only one from which a complaint has been received. Are you sure that the school authorities are taking the proper care in operating the plant.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. GORDON ORR,\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nApril 8, 1930.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have again received complaints from the St. George's Indian Residential School at Lytton that the electric lighting plant is in a deplorable condition and I would ask you to kindly arrange immediately to have your representative make a careful inspection of the Lytton plant and advise me what is required to put same in a satisfactory condition. As you have already been advised there have been complaints about this plant from the time same was installed.\n\nAs you know I have been specifying in the past your plants, and with the exception of the Lytton School the service seems to have been satisfactory. Of course I cannot continue to specify this outfit if there is going to be trouble in operating the plant as is being at present experienced at Lytton.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.

March 5th, 1930.\n\nE.Gardner-Smith Esq.\nIndian School.\nGLEICHEN, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe- The Dunham Co's Report on St.George's School Heating.\n\nWe were very pleased to receive your letter of the 28th ult., also Mr. Walker's Report. As contractors, we did not wish to make any recommendation ourselves, and we therefore appreciate the opportunity of looking over this Report before you forward same to the Department, as this makes our position clear.\n\nI feel Mr. Walker has taken great care in checking over the heating system, and I am in agreement with him with regard to the steam pressure. The addition of another boiler, placed in the Utility Building, to supply this building and the Chapel, would doubtless be the solution, and would also augment the main building service. It might also be that by placing valves in the existing supply to the Chapel this building could be heated during moderate weather by the present boilers to save having another fire except when required during extreme winter months.\n\nThe matter of the return from the Chapel, which we placed in 4\" vitrified pipes approximately 24\" below ground, this line seems to require a much heavier insulation to withstand the low temperatures of that district. This line cannot be placed any deeper in the ground, but we can and will give it a more adequate covering.\n\nRegarding the return pump in the Utility Building, there seems to be some question as to the successful working of this unit. When we tested out on completing this job we opened the cleanout plugs in the boiler room, and pumped water through the line. Unfortunately when I was at the school in December the weather was too cold to chance turning steam into the line as there was then little enough pressure for the main building, hence I was unable to make a test at that time as regards the check valves they are lifting with the stream.\n\nThe Residence and Main Building are installed according to the original layout, except that we relieved the airbound condition in the Residence. If Mr.Walker's recommendation of a separate supply to the Residence were carried out it would greatly facilitate the heating of this section.\n\nThanking you for your courtesy and patience, and assuring you of every assistance and cooperation,\n\nYours very truly\n\n(Sgd) H.S.Crombie.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- Heating System at St.George's School, Lytton.\n\nSir:\n\nWith regard to the heating troubles at the above mentioned institution, and in accordance with the Department's letter of instructions of the 13th ultimo, I requested Mr. Alex. Walker, Dunham Company's Heating Engineer for Alberta and Eastern B. C., to inspect the heating system at St.George's School, and to render me a Report and Recommendation.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a copy of Mr. Walker's Report, and his Recommendation for overcoming the deficiencies in the heating service as at present existing. I think you will find the Report self-explanatory.\n\nI saw Mr. Walker in Calgary after his return from Lytton, and had a further discussion with him on matters pertaining to the heating problems there. Mr. Walker says the initial mistake was in putting any added load on the school heating plant. His check-up convinced him that the boilers' heating capacity, under sub-zero conditions, was considerably overrated; this feature is referred to in his Report. He states that in order to carry the heating of the Chapel and Utility Building on the existing system it would mean continuous heavy firing, which would entail extra help and an enormous fuel consumption.\n\nAfter receiving Mr. Walker's Report, I mailed it to Messrs Mortimer & Crombie, Vancouver, who were the heating contractors that installed the heating in the Chapel & Utility Building. I enclose Mr. Crombie's reply, from which you will see he is in full accord with Mr. Walker's findings and recommendation.\n\nBefore carrying the steam heat to the Utility Building, Mr. Crombie called on the Vulcan Iron Works, Vancouver, and asked their opinion as to the boiler capacity of these boilers (made by them) to carry the contemplated load, and the manufacturers of the boilers assured Mr. Crombie that he could safely add the proposed additional radiation. It was on the strength of this assurance that we added\nheating of part of the Utility Building to the existing plant.\n\nDuring the past winter Lytton has had unprecedented low temperatures, which has given the severest kind of a test to the heating system of the school. Certainly it has revealed its defects.\n\nI think from the information submitted, the Department will have a very complete understanding of the conditions pertaining to the heating at this institution. I have every confidence in submitting Mr. Walker's recommendations for the consideration of the Department, and fully believe, if carried out as outlined in his Report, St. George's School will enter the next and succeeding winters with ample facilities for coping with the severest of weather.\n\nI would respectfully suggest that the necessary changes, if approved by the Department, be carried out in July, when the school will be unoccupied.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nE. Gardner Smith\nInspector of Construction\nDear Sir:\n\nI have yours of the 5th inst., in reply to mine of the 25th ult., in connection with the lighting plant at St. George's School. You will have had my report on this matter also one from the Lister Company by this time.\n\nTheir representative complained that the valves were too closely set, causing trouble. He brought their electrical engineer with him, and went over the whole system, and stated that he had set the valves and put the engine in good shape, so that we would have no further trouble, but their backs were hardly turned before the same trouble occurred.\n\nNow this was no fault of the school. The engines were never touched, so there must be something else radically wrong, in the installation.\n\nWe have a very good man taking care of this plant, and I am positive that it is not the school's fault.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nR. Gurney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect for Department,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHO/MD\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6464, file 888-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMr. Gurney Orr-\n\nWe were of the opinion that we had cleared up satisfactorily the mechanical trouble as far as the plants were concerned in showing the operator the exact clearance to be kept between the valves, and telling him plainly that he was to leave the valves alone, but however, we received a letter from the School on April 9th, stating that the exhaust valves on both of the engines were again in need of resetting as both were losing compression; this applying to the small plant as well as the large one. We immediately sent our electrician to investigate this and found that their statement was absolutely not correct. The small plant again ran perfectly and there was nothing wrong with the valves, and the large plant had one exhaust valve which was barely closing due to the fact that Mr. Lepine had again ground it in a day or so after our visit, reducing the clearance between the valve stem and the tappet to the extent that the valve would barely close and the engine was losing compression and would have resulted in the burning off of the valve within a few days. He also argued that even though the valves on the small plant were not leaking it would only be a day or so before they would be and to prove to him that his contention was not correct Mr. Waters replaced the exhaust valve in the small plant as well as the one in the large plant with new ones, and brought these valves to Vancouver as evidence that there is absolutely nothing wrong with them. These same valves I have forwarded to Mr. Bitchburn at Victoria for his inspection.\n\nAs stated in your letter, we are not having this trouble at the other schools and I quite conscientiously believe that this trouble is caused by the tampering and tinkering around the plants by the operator instead of leaving them alone, and you will have such conditions as long as he is on the job as I cannot see any relief if the plants are not allowed to operate normally. Last fall, he ordered gears, bushings, etc. for this engine, stating that these parts were worn out and causing trouble. We contended that they were not needed, as we rarely have a call for these parts, but however, we forwarded them to him. On our last inspection trip to the school, we found these parts in the cupboard at the school as they were originally shipped, and they had never been put on as they were supposed to have been. This\nApril 22/30\n\nMr. Gurney Orr-\n\nshould prove that this man is not reliable and is not to be depended on as an operator for these plants, and I do not look forward to any change of situation as long as he is on the job.\n\nI have requested Mr. Ditchburn to forward to you my previous report as it covers in detail the actual requirements of the School, but I would only point out that the lighting load today has increased to a large extent over what it was originally when the school was built, putting a very heavy load on these plants at all times, which has to a certain extent been the cause of some of the trouble.\n\nYou have asked us to investigate and find out what is wrong with the plants, and I would advise that it has taken some little time to determine the trouble aside from the plants, and I have written to Mr. Ditchburn in fuller detail stating as best I can the reason for the dissatisfaction, doing so in the interests of your department as well as our own.\n\nThanking you, and assuring you that you will have our cooperation at all times, I am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nR. A. LISTER & CO. (CANADA) LIMITED.\n\nVancouver Branch.\nApril 22/30.\n\nMr. Gurney Orr,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, CANADA.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRE: ST. GEORGE'S INDIAN SCHOOL, LYTON, B.C.\n\nIn reference to your letter of April 8th, 1930, wherein you state that you have again received a complaint from the St. George's School, Lyton, that the plants were in a deplorable condition and most unsatisfactory.\n\nI would advise, that prior to receiving your letter, the writer, with our electrician, Mr. Waters, had already visited the school and made a thorough test of the plants, and a complete summary of the conditions as we found them, and had already submitted our report to Mr. Ditchburn at Victoria.\n\nBriefly summarizing the condition of the plants, as we found them, I would state that the small plant was working splendidly in every way and the larger unit was operating only to 75% of its load. The trouble on this plant was due to the improper timing of the ignition, and in a few minutes this plant was also pulling its full load in a satisfactory manner. Both plants were then put under load, jointly, and they developed about 15% overload, proving that the plants, themselves, were in good order from a mechanical standpoint. The operator, all along, has been complaining that the valves and the valve seats were defective, worn out, etc., but I would advise that there is no truth whatever in his contention, and it is his mania for grinding valves which has caused all of the trouble at St. George's School.\n\nThe battery, however, on this plant is completely done, and needs replacing immediately as at the present time its condition is causing higher gas consumption than would be the case if a new battery were installed.\n\nAlso, the plants are badly overloaded and what they actually require at this school are two 7\u00bd K.W. plants. This matter, I have taken up fully in my report to Mr. Ditchburn.\nMay 1, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Ditchburn,\n\nI am enclosing herewith for your information copies of letters which have been received in connection with the lighting plant at the Lytton School. I am at a complete loss to know where the trouble is with this plant. I am inclined to think that it is due to improper operation by the school. As you know we have a number of these plants installed and all of them, with the exception of the one at Lytton, are giving perfect satisfaction. I will be pleased if you can have an independent investigation made and find out where the trouble is.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. Gurney Orr,\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVictoria, B.C.\nMay 8th, 1930.\n\nSt. George's Indian School,\nLyton,\nB.C.\n\nFor the attention of Mr. A.R. Lett.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of May 8th in reference to the engines at your school and note your remarks that the new valves which Mr. Waters put in are blowing both in the seats and guides, and would advise you that your letter is just what we expected.\n\nYou stated in your previous letter, before the last visit of Mr. Waters, that such was the case on both engines, but on his arrival he found that it was not so and we, therefore, do not know whether to make much of your complaint or not.\n\nI note you claim that the camshaft of the large engine is gone, and the timing is difficult to adjust and on this point can assure you that such is not the case. No failure has happened to the camshaft unless it were to get badly broken or bent, which never happens, and if it needs new bearings you still have these in your cupboard which Mr. Lepine originally ordered, and have never been put on. If your gears are stripped on this engine, you also have these on hand, and these are the only parts in connection with the camshaft that can wear. We do not know why Mr. Lepine did not put them in, considering that he has the repairs in stock, since last September.\n\nConsidering, Mr. Lett, that on two occasions we visited your school and found the small plant working in excellent condition contrary to your report and the large plant functioning in fair shape when our arrival outside of adjustments which were out of adjustment by your operator, we do not feel that your claim justifies our sending a man. I have, therefore, sent a copy of your letter to Mr. Ditchburn at Victoria, and I will await instructions from him as to what steps he wishes to take, before doing anything on our part.\n\nWe want to give you the best of service and satisfaction at all times, but find that this is impossible considering the letters which you have been writing to the Department and ourselves with complaints on your plant and other matters; we have found that a large proportion of these troubles that you outlined in your various letters do not exist, and until such time as you will put the servicing and operating of your plant in competent hands at the School, we do not feel that we can do much towards eliminating your trouble.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nR.A. Lister & Co. (Canada) Ltd.\n\n(Sgd.) J.R. Day.\nMr.W.E.Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Indian School at Lytton.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of a letter which I received in this morning's mail from Mr.Lett of St.George's Indian Residential School at Lytton, and you will note that the contents of this letter outline the troubles which they originally complained about.\n\nMr.Lett states that the camshaft of the large engine is gone, and the timing is difficult to adjust. Complaints of this sort make it almost a hopeless case as it is impossible for anything to happen to the camshaft unless he strips a gear, and if such were the case the engine would not run at all. You can, therefore, see that these complaints are fictitious, and until such time as something is done to curb the perpetrator of these reports, it will be impossible to get satisfaction or results.\n\nI am at all times prepared to give you the best of service by way of a mechanic and parts, but when you get complaints as outlined in this letter it causes us to doubt whether genuine trouble exists or not.\n\nI would draw your attention to the last paragraph of Mr.Lett's letter, wherein he states that the repair bill has been high, but we pointed out in our previous report that many of the parts which he ordered were still lying in the cupboard and had never been used.\n\nI am writing to Mr.Lett this morning and enclosing a copy of my letter for your reference.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.A.LISTER & CO. (CANADA) LIMITED.\n(Sgd.) J.R.Day.\nCOPY. ST. GEORGE'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nLytton, B.C. May 8/30.\n\nR.A. Lister Co., Ltd.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nSir:\n\nWe are in continual trouble with the engines. The new valves put in by your Mr. Waters are again blowing both in the seats and guides.\n\nI have had to provide two new spark plugs one for each engine. I feel that I shall have to have some readjustment made by Mr. Irvine or the school will be out of sight.\n\nThe camshaft of the large engine has gone and the timing is difficult to adjust.\n\nI am sorry to have to report again so quickly but know you wish to know how we are going. I hope that something of a permanent nature will soon be done as the grief we have had with the present installment has been nothing short of nerve racking and the repair bill has been high.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA.R. LETT.\nR. A. LISTER & COMPANY (CANADA) LIMITED\n1816 Hamilton Street,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nApril 4th, 1930.\n\nMr. W.E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to our letter of March 26th, I informed you that I was leaving that night for Lytton, which I did, taking Mr. Waters, our electrician, with me to enable us to make a thorough check-up on the plants, and remedy as far as possible any troubles that we might find. Mr. Lett, and the operator, Mr. Lepine, were both attendant when we arrived, and a very rigid inspection was made of both plants. We beg to submit the following report:\n\nSmall Plant No. 1a\n\nThis plant was in very good condition, and ran nicely, and when put on full load, without making any adjustments, carried the full rated output without hesitation. The operator has reported that this plant was giving serious trouble with the valve, but in conversation with him he satisfied me that the trouble is due to the fact that he has not given the proper valve clearance between the tappet and the valve, thereby resulting in the burning off of the valve. This engine is sound and in good shape.\n\nLarge Plant No. 2a\n\nThis engine was started up, and would not carry over two-thirds of its load, and on examination the trouble proved to be in improper timing of the ignition. When this was altered, it pulled its full load without trouble. This engine is quite noisy due to the natural wear, as it has been doing the most of the work of lighting in addition to operating the lumber machinery. It is not at a dangerous stage, however, and will give plenty of service yet before proving troublesome, outside of the noise which is not detrimental to the operation of the plant.\n\nBoth plants were then started up, and they carried their full rated load for a short period, without any difficulty, proving to me that as far as the plants are concerned, there is not much actual trouble with their operation from a mechanical standpoint.\n\nThe automatic features, however, cannot function as completely as they should, owing to the fact that the storage battery is completely done, and should be replaced immediately, and successful operation of the plants will not be achieved until such time as this storage battery is replaced.\n\nSchool Lighting Load.\n\nI asked Mr. Lett to give me the normal lighting load and this load runs approximately 65 Amps. The total load, as might be often called for, is 92 Amps., which is 15% more than...\nthe full capacity of the plants. This, therefore, means that their ordinary lighting load is practically the full capacity of the plants, and as the lighting load comes on quickly the small plant runs for short time only. The large plant then cuts in to take over the load, and the small plant eventually comes in to assist it. You can, therefore, see that the large plant has had most of the work to do. A lighting plant should not be operated continuously at its full load if long life is to be expected. A margin between its normal working load and its full load should be left, which is not the case with the large unit which is now functioning.\n\nSuggested Improvements.\n\nAfter carefully considering what is necessary to give the most satisfactory installation for the school under the present working conditions, I would strongly suggest the installation of a larger unit to replace the small one, which is now working automatically with the other large one, and when the necessary time comes replace the engine on the existing large plant.\n\nOur new unit, replacing the small one, would be a 7\u00bd K.W., and by replacing the engine on the present large plant, the capacity would be increased from 6 K.W. to 7\u00bd K.W., which would then give a combined output of 15 K.W., which will put them past the point of power shortage for a long time to come. If I were asked to specify the type of installation suitable for this school, under the present load conditions, I would quote on two 7\u00bd K.W. Lister Prinston Automatic Units, working together.\n\nReasons for this Change.\n\nIf the 7\u00bd K.W. Plant were installed, replacing the small 3 K.W. plant, the operation would be as follows:\n\nWhen the load comes on and starts this No. 1 plant, it will continue to operate and have sufficient capacity to carry practically full load continuously, and the load could be shifted to the other plant giving both equal running periods, thereby equalizing the wear. As it now stands the large plant takes the majority of the running.\n\nThe No. 2 plant would take care of the laundry drive as at present, and a further safeguard could be had by arranging the drive so that the laundry could be operated from either plant. However, this is not of great importance as far as the present question is concerned.\n\nWith the above method of operation, much longer life would result from both units, and there would be no chance of overloading either of the plants.\n\nBattery Replacement.\n\nWe would be very glad to quote on a new battery to replace the present one, but before doing so would like to clear up one point, namely, the size of battery required.\n\nIf the plants are to remain as they are, I would recommend the use of the same size battery, namely, 100 Amp. Hour, but if you contemplated replacing the present small unit with\na larger one at this time or at a later date, I would recommend supplying a larger battery of 120 Amp. Hour capacity.\n\nThe price of a 110 volt, Globelite, 108 Amp. Hour Battery would be $535.00 laid down at Lytton, and the price of a 110 volt, 120 Amp. Hour Battery $550.00, freight paid to Lytton.\n\nDelivery on these batteries can be made in a very short time, and we could have either one of them delivered to Lytton in approximately two weeks.\n\nSummarizing this letter, my recommendations are as follows:\n\n1. Immediate replacement of the Storage Battery.\n2. Replacement of the 5 K.W. Unit by a 7\u00bd K.W. Unit.\n3. Eventually replacing the engines on the present large plant, restoring it to new condition with an increased capacity from 6 to 7\u00bd K.W.\n\nIn the event of your replacing the small unit with a larger one, I would advise you that we are prepared to take this small unit in as an allowance on the purchase price of the larger unit, and if you would like me to go into detail on the necessary changes to be made and give you a quotation on it, I would be very glad to do so on receipt of word from you.\n\nThanking you, and assuring you that we will do all that we can to keep things running satisfactorily, I am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nR.A. LISTER & CO. (CANADA) LTD.\n\n\"J.H. Day\"\nDear Mr. Orr,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 1st instant relative to the lighting plant at the Lytton School to which you attached a copy of a letter of J.R. Day, representative of the Lister-Bruston Co., at Vancouver, in which he outlined the condition of the plant as found by him after an investigation on the 29th of March.\n\nWith regard to your desire to have an independent investigation made to find out just where the trouble is, I may say that Mr. Webb, District Chief Engineer of the Dominion Water Power and Reclamation Service, informed me recently that Engineer Tredcroft, at Kamloops, is fully competent to make the necessary investigation and report and I, therefore, have requested that this investigation should be made by Mr. Tredcroft and have furnished all the necessary correspondence dealing with this subject. I will write you at a later date furnishing you with the conclusions arrived at by the above mentioned Engineer.\n\nI may say, however, that Mr. Day furnished me with a copy of his letter to you and also gave me a full report as to his findings at the time of his investigation of this plant on the 29th March, and I am herewith attaching a copy of the same for your information. However, on May 6th Principal Lett again wrote the Lister-Bruston Co., Vancouver, complaining that he had had to provide new spark plugs for one of the engines, the camshaft of the larger engine had gone and the timing was difficult to adjust. Mr. Day, on the 9th of May, wrote Principal Lett stating that it would be impossible for the engine to run if anything had gone wrong with the camshaft and if it needed new bearings the School had a supply of them in the cupboard which had been ordered by the engineer some time previously. I am attaching hereto copy of Mr. Day's letter to me with regard to this complaint and also a copy of Principal Lett's letter and his reply thereto from which correspondence you will observe that the attitude taken by the Company is that the plant never has been operated by a competent person and that the last engineer seems to have a penchant for changing adjustments and, if this be the case, this expensive lighting plant will never be able to give the satisfaction expected of it so long as such a condition exists. It is well, however, to await the report of Mr. Tredcroft on this subject.\n\nPersonally, entirely outside of the question of competent or incompetent operation of the plant, I am inclined to the...\n\nR. Gurney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6464, file 888-5, part 3)\nto the opinion given by Mr. Day to the effect that the plant is over-loaded and it would be well to take into consideration the advisability of at least having the 3 k.w. engine substituted by a 7-1/2 k.w. one. However, while I know very little about internal combustion engines, I have been given to understand from competent persons that the over-loading of an engine results in the troubles which the Principal has been complaining of.\n\nI have had some correspondence with Mr. Day as to what the cost would be for placing in the Lytton School a 7-1/2 k.w. engine in place of the 3 k.w. or possibly two 7-1/2 engines and having the present Lytton plant thoroughly re-conditioned for installation at the Cranbrook School where the present lighting plant is old and inadequate though some repairs will be made at an early date. Later on I will write you on this question.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.E.

Webb, Esq., District Chief Engineer, Dominion Water Power and Reclamation Service, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nKamloops, B.C.\nJune 2, 1930.\nINDEX\n\nPage\n\nDescription of Lighting Plant .................. 1\nReport of Defects in Plant ..................... 2\nCondition of Plant at Time of Inspection ...... 2\nPresent General Condition of Plant ............ 5\nCost ........................................... 7\nRemarks ....................................... 7\nSir:-\n\nRe Lytton Indian Residential School Lighting Plant.\n\nIn accordance with the request contained in your letter of May 22nd., I visited the Lytton Indian Residential School and carried out an examination with reference to the operation of the lighting system, which had been reported to be out of order, and in this connection would report to you as follows:\n\nDESCRIPTION OF LIGHTING PLANT\n\nPower is supplied to the Lytton Indian Residential School for lighting purposes at 110 volts D.C., and is obtained by means of 2 D.C. generators having a capacity of 3 and 6 Kilowatts respectively.\n\nThese generators require to be operated at 550 R.P.M., and are entirely automatic in their operation.\n\nIn the case of the 3 Kw. generator, it is driven by a 6 H.P. gasoline engine, and the 6 Kw. generator is operated by a 12 H.P. gasoline engine.\n\nThe automatic features of the plant are that when the load is below 3 Kilowatts the 3 Kw. unit only operates; but when the load increases above 3 Kilowatts and below 6 Kilowatts the 6 Kw. unit cuts in and the 3 Kw. unit cuts out. If the load is still further\n\nC. E. Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water Power and Reclamation Service,\nVancouver, B. C.\nload is still further increased above 6 kilowatts, then the 3 kw. unit again cuts in to assist the 6 kw. unit in carrying the load.\n\nThe plant is of the standard type, many of which are in use throughout Canada giving entire satisfaction.\n\nREPORT OF DEFECTS IN PLANT\n\nThe principal of the Lytton Indian Residential School at the time of my arrival stated that while the 3 kw. unit gave satisfaction, the 6 kw. unit was entirely unsatisfactory and had never operated properly since the time it was installed.\n\nHe stated that while this unit would operate with a certain amount of satisfaction on a light load (not above 30 amps.), when the full load (55 amps.) was placed on it, the speed of the gasoline engine was reduced so much that the load could not be carried and the engine continually stalled.\n\nHe also stated that the exhaust valves in this engine continually burnt out and required to be replaced, and that the bearings were loose and that the cam shaft and other parts showed undue wear.\n\nCONDITION OF PLANT AT TIME OF INSPECTION\n\nUpon testing this unit immediately upon arrival, I found the condition of this machine as stated by the principal to be substantially correct, that is to say, while the engine would carry a light load, as soon as a load of 35 or 40 amps. was placed upon it the speed of the engine was reduced from 550 r.p.m. (its rated speed) to as low as 360 r.p.m.\nas low as 360 R.P.M., and that if this load was increased the engine stopped altogether.\n\nAfter repeated tests showed that this unit was not functioning properly, the fly-wheel was removed and the engine was partially dismantled, when the following defects were found:\n\nThe clearance between the tappet rods and the tappets on the exhaust valves was far too great.\n\nThe spacing of the timing gears in front of the engine, i.e., between the main shaft and the cam shaft, was wrong, due to the fact that either when the engine was assembled or at some other time an inexperienced mechanic had changed the idler gear without making sure that when the new one was put in the relation between the cam shaft gear and the main shaft was correct. The amount these gears were out was 3 teeth.\n\nThe engine was then re-assembled and a test run on same. It was now found that while the engine could be brought up to speed (550 R.P.M.) on medium load, it failed to hold this speed at full load, and that no adjustment of the generator brushes or timing gear would remedy this condition.\n\nAfter a still further examination, it was found that the gas ports on the carburettor situated between the carburettor and the intake manifold were far too small, that is to say that when the machine was running on a light load the gas ports would be partly open and sufficient mixture would pass through into the cylinders to allow the engine to operate, but when full load came on this engine, while the operation...\nengine, while the operation of the governor was satisfactory and the governor opened the ports to the full extent, these ports were too small to allow a sufficient amount of mixture to pass into the cylinders to maintain the engine speed.\n\nI therefore instructed the operator to increase the size of these ports by about 40%, which he did by filing and cutting them larger.\n\nUpon re-assembling the carburettor with the ports enlarged, the operation of the plant was entirely satisfactory. The engine speed was easily raised to 600 R.P.M. and the engine carried an over-load of 20% with no signs of faltering. (The rated capacity of this plant is 55 amps., and after adjustments were made the plant carried 65 amps. for a long period with no sign of heating or failure).\n\nA few minor adjustments were then carried out, and the position of the brushes on the generator was corrected, owing to the fact that they had either slipped or had been moved by the operator in his previous endeavours to improve the condition of the plant.\n\nAfter this had been done the two plants were given tests as one unit, that is to say, the 3 Kw. unit was operated alone; then the 6 Kw. unit was allowed to cut in and the 3 Kw. unit to drop out; then when the load increased above the capacity of this unit the 3 Kw. unit was allowed to come in and assist the 6 Kw. unit. The result was that the plant carried the total load (82.5 amps.) easily with no sign of the engine speed being reduced or any part of\nduced or any part of the machinery overheating.\n\nThis being the case, it would obviously appear that the whole trouble in the operation of this plant lay in the fact that the gas ports in the carburettor were too small, thereby preventing the engine getting sufficient fuel at high speed for heavy load.\n\nPRESENT GENERAL CONDITION OF PLANT\n\nThe general condition of the plant, seeing that it has been in operation for two years, even though this operation has not been entirely satisfactory, is good.\n\nThere are certain features in its installation which cannot be described as being first-class and should be altered.\n\nThese are as follows:\n\n1) There are too many sharp bends on the exhaust pipe between the engine and the mufflers.\n\n2) These mufflers are situated inside the engine room and are noisy, and are not, in my opinion, the best type for a plant of this size. A concrete exhaust box situated below ground outside, properly equipped with a drain and outlet, would be far superior.\n\n3) The operation of the laundry machinery is carried out by the 12 H.P. engine by means of a heavy belt driving the laundry operating shaft situated overhead and to one side.\n\nThe operation of this belt places heavy side-pull on the main bearings of the engine, and as the engine requires to be operated at full speed when driving this machinery, it is only natural to expect the bearings to wear unequally.\n\n(An engine driving a\n(An engine driving a lighting plant in which a large institution is entirely dependent for light should not, in my opinion, be used for any other purpose. A separate engine should have been installed to operate the laundry, or it should have been operated by steam).\n\nOn days during which the 12 H.P. engine is used to operate the laundry machinery, which usually runs for 8\u00bd hours continuously, the operator reports that the 6 Kw. generator has a tendency to become overheated, which may possibly be caused by an open circuit in one of the coils and which can no doubt be easily adjusted.\n\nIt would, however, be advisable to install a different type of coupling between the engine and the generator so that on days during which the engine is being used for operating the laundry machinery only, this coupling can be disconnected and the generator not operated.\n\nUnder present conditions, the engine being direct connected to the generator, whenever the engine is in operation the generator is in operation too, and when no lighting load is on, is delivering current to charge the batteries.\n\nUnless this charging of the batteries is closely watched, they can very easily become overcharged and rapidly destroyed.\n\n4) The battery set (52 cells), which is supplied to carry small loads and to start the engines, is entirely destroyed and must be replaced immediately.\n\nWhen this battery is replaced, cells with larger containers should be installed so as to allow more liquid to\nallow more liquid to surround the plates.\n\nThe destruction of this battery appears to have been caused chiefly through over-charging, probably due to the lack of experience of the previous operators and the fact that the battery was not cut out of the circuit while the laundry machinery was being operated.\n\n5) The 12 H.P. engine is slightly noisy in operation and shows certain signs of wear, which is only natural after two years use. The following parts should be shortly replaced:\n\n- 2 main bearings,\n- wrist pins,\n- pistons and piston rings,\n- gaskets,\n- intake manifold.\n\nThe plant should also be given a general overhaul by experienced men under the supervision of this office to ensure that it is properly carried out.\n\nCOST\n\nThe cost of the above repairs, together with the cost of overhauling the plant and changing the exhaust piping as outlined in this report, would amount to approximately $395.00. (See Appendix A)\n\nThis amount does not include the cost of a new battery set.\n\nREMARKS\n\nIf the above repairs are carried out, there is, in my opinion, no reason why the plant should not operate with entire satisfaction, with the exception that if the 12 H.P. engine is still to be used for operating the laundry as well as for supplying light\nfor supplying light, the department must be prepared to expend a certain amount on its maintenance each year.\n\nThe present operator appears to be a good man and has undoubtedly done his very best to operate this plant satisfactorily, and it was only due to the fact that the cause of the trouble was most unusual and very difficult to locate that he was unable to do so.\n\nThese plants should, in my opinion, be examined regularly by an engineer from this office, and if necessary overhauled and repaired semi-annually, and the cost of this examination and overhaul would undoubtedly be more than saved in the trouble and expense which would be prevented thereby, for the reason that the operator, in addition to looking after the lighting plant, is not an expert and has a great many other duties to perform around the school; and it is not likely that any operator will start in and overhaul a plant or do much work on it until such time as it begins to show that it is not functioning properly, when it is generally too late.\n\nIn the present case, it is well to point out that several spare parts had been ordered and purchased by the previous operator, for which I understand the department paid, which were not necessary and in addition have never been used or where used have been\nwhere used have been installed incorrectly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.

CALDWELL, Indian Agricultural Agent for 1930.\n\nWhile at Lytton I visited the St. George's Indian Residential School farm. The Rev. Mr. Lett showed me over the school farm and farm buildings. Mr. Lett appears to be a capable and practical farmer and his crops were looking well. Mr. Lett is working hard to get his lighter land in Alfalfa and with the outlook for water very good this year, it looks as though he was going to be successful. The farm buildings were neat and clean inside, but were in need of paint, the paint on the old buildings having peeled off. There are also three new buildings that have not been painted, a machine shed, granary and engine house.\n\nIf the present cow herd is to be kept on this farm I should think that isolation quarters should be provided separate from the main building, at the present a portion of the main building being used for this purpose. This herd having contagious abortion, I would hardly think it safe to keep infected animals in the same stable with the other stock.\n\nJ. D. Caldwell,\nIndian Agricultural Agent.\nST.

Gardner-Smith Esq.\nBuilding Inspector.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nGleichen, Alta.\n\nDear Mr. Gardner-Smith:\n\nI have lately been wondering about the heating changes, and whether there is a possibility of this work being done during the coming vacation. I should like to make arrangements for the men who will be here for the work, if it is to be done during the months of July or August.\n\nWill you kindly let me know promptly if anything definite has yet been arranged.\n\nI trust by this time you have the Rev. Gibney and his large family safely housed in the new quarters, as very probably the fine new school is now about completed.\n\nWith kind personal regards from us all to yourself,\n\nI am\n\nVery sincerely yours\n\n(Sgd) A.R.

June 16th, 1930.\n\nMr. R.Guerney Orr.\nArchitect.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- St.George's School, Lytton, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nI enclose herewith a copy of a letter which I found awaiting me on my return from the East, in which Rev. Mr. Lett refers to the proposed changes in their heating services, and which he is desirous of having done during the school vacation period.\n\nYou already have in your file the Report from Mr. Alex. Walker, and his recommendations for overcoming the heating difficulties. The total cost of the proposed changes, including the placing of a separate boiler in the basement of the Utility Building in a deepened boiler room, and the connections to the heating mains of the Chapel, and the building of a separate chimney from the proposed new boiler room, and the carrying of a separate main from the boiler room of the school to the residence, would probably run close to $3000.00.\n\nIn a brief discussion of the subject, Dr. Scott seemed sympathetic towards the project, but was not sure that the money could be found at present. The matter was, therefore, left over until your return to Ottawa.\n\nIf it be found financially possible to carry out this work I would respectfully suggest that it be authorized as soon as possible, and if so desired, I should be pleased to make a trip to Lytton and make the necessary arrangements for carrying out Mr. Walker's recommendations. Mr. Crombie would be the logical man to install the additional heating service, and as much as possible of the existing lines to the Chapel and Utility Building should be salvaged and used again.\n\nI shall await with interest your valued instructions in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nP.O. BOX 666\nVICTORIA, B.C., July 11, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nYou have no doubt by this time received from the Director of the Dominion Water Power and Reclamation Branch the report of Engineer Tredcroft with respect to the electric lighting plant at the Lytton School. I have received two copies of this and have made a third to be furnished to R.A. Lister & Co. in Vancouver, as not having any knowledge of the working of this plant I felt it was the proper thing to let them have the views of an experienced engineer.\n\nBoth Engineer Tredcroft and the Lister Company agree that it is essential that a new set of batteries should be installed at once as the old ones have been bled to death. Engineer Tredcroft thinks this was due to over-loading the line, but I recently received a report from Principal Lett stating that he has found something wrong with connections in the switch board, which he claims is responsible for the battery trouble, and if his opinion is correct then it would appear to me that the company should supply new batteries free. A copy of Principal Lett's report in this particular connection is furnished herewith, and I am forwarding a copy to the Lister Company in Vancouver also. Principal Lett Says:\n\n\"We have within the past few days discovered a defect in the switch board of the present plant which has evidently been responsible for the grief we have had and also for the present condition of the batteries. If this find, which has been made right, continues as it has for the past few days to keep the engines switching properly without continuing to run on the batteries it will bear out my continual contention that there has always been something not just as it should be and that the Co. is responsible for the present condition. Naturally I am rejoicing in the discovery as I have done everything I knew how to keep the plant in good order and felt that the Dept. would take the condition as sheer neglect on my part which is not done the supervision nor the man who is attending to the engines. The defect should have long ere this been discovered by the Co.'s mechanics who have visited the school.\"\n\nIn a report which I received some time ago from Mr. Day, the Vancouver representative of the company, he pointed out that as the plant at the Lytton school appeared to be very much over-loaded, he thought at least the 6 Kw. engine should be replaced by a 7\u00bd Kw.\n\nR.

Hereunder are the offers made by Mr. Day:\n\n**ESTIMATE NO. 1**\n\n**NEW AUTOMATIC PLANTS FOR LYTON, B.C.**\n\n2-Lister Automatic Radiator Cooled Lighting Plants\n7\u00bd K.W., 110 Volt, Speed 500 r.p.m., Less batteries.\n\nPrice, $2,650.00 each .................. $5,300.00\n\nParalleling Panel for above Plants ... 300.00\n\n120 Amp.

Yuill, R.P.E., a consulting engineer of Vancouver intimating that he is negotiating with the town of Lytton for the installation of a lighting plant, and if these negotiations are carried out he could deliver current to the Lytton Indian school more economically than the school is doing at present through its own plant. Provided this can be done satisfactorily, I would then recommend that the present plant at the Lytton School be reconditioned and shipped to the Cranbrook School for installation. In the meantime a new battery set of 120 amperes hours, 100 volt, at a cost of $645.00 must be installed without further delay, in view of the fact that the present batteries have no life whatever.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nW.B.

I hope there is something in it and that everything will be satisfactory.\n\nI do not think it necessary or advisable to instal a larger plant in this school. The existing one should be ample for all their requirements. In fact it is larger than some of the other schools have, where there is no difficulty in properly lighting the building.\n\nIf the scheme as mentioned in the last paragraph of your letter is carried out it will certainly be to advantage to connect up with the power system when arrangements can be made to instal the existing lighting plant at some other point.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour esteemed letter of July 10th to hand re Lytton Indian School, with enclosed report on this plant by Mr. E. H. Tredcroft, of the Dominion Water Power and Reclamation Service.\n\nDealing first with the portion of your letter, which is an excerpt from a letter received from Mr. Lett, dated May 21st, I note his remarks that he has found a defect in the switchboard which has been responsible for the batteries running down, etc.,......\n\nThe last time the writer visited Lytton, I arrived unexpectedly at the school, and, as pointed out in my previous report, found the large plant operating quite satisfactorily, driving the laundry. This plant was supposed to be entirely out of commission. Mr. Lett informed me that he had found the trouble -- namely, a small screw on the relay was holding the relay shut and causing the battery to run down. We went into it in detail and I proved to Mr. Lett's satisfaction that there was nothing in this, and his rejoicing was very short lived. However, he is passing this along to you as the cause of the trouble. I can assure you that there was no trouble such as he outlined on that switchboard, and if the discovery which he made was causing all the trouble, both with the plants and the battery, as he states in his letter, then Mr. Tredcroft's report can be discarded - Mr. Lett contends the trouble was on the switchboard, while Mr. Tredcroft claims it was with the engine. You can, therefore, draw your own conclusions.\n\nDealing with your remarks that if this defect existed, we should replace these batteries free! I\ncan assure you that the short life of the battery was caused by improper attention on the part of the attendants. This, I have told you before, and I still adhere to my previous opinion.\n\nDealing with Mr. Tredcroft's report there are some remarks which I would like to make. On page 2, Mr. Tredcroft states that he found the large plant, on his arrival, not working properly in that it was only carrying a load of 35 to 40 amps, and the speed would drop to 360 r.p.m., and the engine would stop if the load was increased. He also found on removal of the flywheel, that the valve timing of the engine was out due to the idler pinion being improperly meshed. He states that after making the proper adjustments, he found it necessary to enlarge the opening in the carburettor manifold by 40%. This engine then carried a 20% overload with no signs of faltering. Dealing with the above statement, I would point out that he found this plant out of adjustment on his arrival, which was only a few days after my visit. The writer on the occasion of his last visit, and on previous visits to the school, with Mr. Lett and Mr. Lapine in attendance had pulled a 15% overload on this particular engine, and I pointed this out in my report to Mr. R. G. Orr of April 22nd, a copy of which was sent to you. It certainly was not necessary to do any cutting as stated by Mr. Tredcroft in his report. Further, if it were necessary to do this cutting on this one particular engine, it would be necessary to do it on all the engines which our factory turn out, which you know would be absurd, owing to the fact that we have hundreds of these plants and engines in this particular size working satisfactorily.\n\nThere is one question which I would like to ask Mr. Tredcroft - considering that this plant is a constant potential system - that is - the voltage remains constant from no load to full load, and the load change is taken care of by a speed variation controlled by the magnetic governor coil, opening and closing the throttle opening, which Mr. Tredcroft altered, if the opening were enlarged to give more gas and more speed on full load what did he do with his excess speed on minimum load due to enlarging the size of the holes in this throttle, which means increased voltage.\nThe most interesting portion of his report on this page, however, is the fact that he found this engine so badly out of tune within such a short period after our visit to the plant which proves that somebody changed the adjustments after our visit. This verifies my contention in my previous reports\u2014that the adjustments on the plants were not left as we made them, and consequently the plant could not function properly.\n\nMr. Tredcroft did not accomplish any greater results in getting capacity from this plant than we, ourselves, accomplished every time that we visited the school, as my previous reports to you will show. As far as adjustments are concerned on the brushes of the generator, there is only one place for these brushes, and that is at the neutral point, where you will get absence of sparking and good commutation. This has very little to do with the load of the engine.\n\nOn page 3, Mr. Tredcroft states that it would obviously appear that the whole trouble in the operation of this plant lay in the fact that the gas ports of the engine were too small, thereby preventing the engine getting sufficient fuel at high speed for heavy load, and on this point I take exception. He also states that there are too many sharp bends in the exhaust pipe between the engine and the mufflers, and that these mufflers in the engine room are noisy, and in his opinion are not the best type for a plant of this size, stating that a concrete exhaust box below ground level outside, properly equipped with a drain and outlet, would be far superior. I would point out to Mr. Tredcroft that if he had disconnected the exhaust line from the engine, while it was in operation he would have found that his power output would remain just the same, and thereby prove the exhaust equipment on this plant is correct.\n\nThe expansion pot is very close to the engines, thereby eliminating any back pressure and the pipe and bends which are on this equipment are of 2\" diameter, whereas the minimum pipe diameter which we could use on this installation without detrimental results would be 1\u00bd\". I am thoroughly satisfied that Mr. Tredcroft does not understand the exhaust end of this installation when he recommends underground exhaust chamber, as this would endanger both life and property. I would advise that when these engines stop they do so by releasing the compression on the cylinder by holding one of the valves open. The\nengine still rotates for some time due to the momentum of the flywheels, and there is a certain amount of gas drawn in on each revolution of the engine which is not exploded but expelled from the exhaust line into free air. As the installation is at present it passes through the short exhaust line into the cast-iron exhaust pot, and then in turn into the outside air. At times, this gas becomes ignited with the result that there is a back-firing which is not detrimental in any way as the exhaust pot is small and being made out of heavy cast-iron, is exceptionally strong and no damage results. However, if you were to take an underground exhaust chamber, and expel this unburned gas into the chamber, and it then became ignited you would simply be minus a concrete exhaust chamber, and possibly kill someone in the process. I think that this is a point which Mr. Tredcroft has overlooked, and I warn your Department at this time to refrain from carrying out a plan of this description.\n\nRe the operation of the 12 H.P. Engine on the laundry, I note Mr. Tredcroft states that there is a heavy side pull on the main bearing of the engine, causing undue wear in the bearings, and he recommends that a separate engine should be installed for this purpose. He also states that the operator reports that the generator on this plant becomes overheated when it is run 8\u00bd hrs. continuously. I think it would be better if Mr. Tredcroft had not brought this into his report. If a 10 to 15% load, used for battery charging while running the laundry is going to cause overheating, of this generator, what will 20% overload do to the machine, which he states he developed, in the previous part of his report?\n\nIn reference to the side draught on the bearings of the engine, driving the laundry, there is nothing in this as we absolutely guarantee these engines to operate on full capacity, belt load, driving in any direction, and we turn thousands of these engines out for belt drive purposes every year and you can therefore dis-consider this portion of the report. In addition I would point out that on this particular engine the crankshaft is supported by a centre bearing, making three bearings in all.\n\nI note he claims, when operating the engine for driving the laundry, and there being no lighting\nload on, the generator is delivering current to charge the battery and the battery can become very easily destroyed by overcharging. If Mr. Tredcroft is well acquainted with storage battery action, he will agree with me that there are certainly no signs of overcharging on this battery, and as a matter of fact one needs only to look at it to see that it has been starved and inadequately charged instead of being overcharged. Therefore when he makes the statement that this battery has been overcharged, apparently due to the lack of experience on the part of previous operators and the fact that the battery was not out of circuit when the laundry was running\u2014it appears to me that he is not very well acquainted with the battery business or he would not make such a statement.\n\nFor his information, I would advise that it is possible to operate the laundry machinery without generating any current whatever if it is deemed necessary to do so in this school. It is necessary, as it has been found in all other schools, to take advantage of laundry wash day to give the battery this over-charge, which you must give it to obtain long life, and which is the practice which is carried out in all the other schools, where the laundry is driven by the power plant machine. They all have been operating with exceptional satisfaction.\n\nMr. Tredcroft states that then the battery is replaced, cells with larger containers should be installed so that there will be more liquid surrounding the plates. On this point, I have nothing to say as I would not recommend the Exide Battery Co. on this point as I am convinced that they know more about this business than I do.\n\nIn the last paragraph on page 5, Mr. Tredcroft reports that it is well to point out that several spare parts had been ordered and purchased by the previous operator, for which I understand the Department paid, which were not necessary, and in addition have never been used or where used have been installed incorrectly.\n\nDealing with this in my previous reports I pointed out that these parts were ordered by Mr. Lepine, which is the case as shown by our Invoice #1846, and the order was signed by Mr. Lepine as well as Mr. Lett in Sept. 1929.\nI have his original order for these parts in front of me at the time of writing and it was Mr. Lepine who ordered these parts and not the previous operator as intimated by Mr. Tredcroft. This proves that Mr. Tredcroft's report in this instance is one of protection and is given without having the proper information on hand other than that which he received from the school.\n\nSince Mr. Tredcroft was asked by the Department to give a report on the exact condition of things as he found them, I do not think that verbal statements as given above by the operators of the plants should be taken into consideration.\n\nSummarizing Mr. Tredcroft's whole report, you will observe that the main body of it agrees with my previous reports to your Department, in that he found the plants altered on his visit and not functioning properly, and that the plants will do their work when left properly adjusted, which bears out my contention that the trouble is more in the operation of the plants than in the plants themselves.\n\nIf any further information is required, or if you desire to enter into further details, I will be glad to discuss it on receipt of word from you.\n\nThanking you, and trusting that I may have the pleasure of hearing further from you, I am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nR.

The former brick work will run into a very considerable expense and would suggest the wood work construction with the fireproof lining making the room fire proof so that in case of accident the pent holes in the wall could be closed and no risk entailed.\n\nThe Laundry machine has already been repaired but I have not been able to have guards for the fly wheels and pulleys in the engine room. This seems to be a requirement not very often taken care of and special guards will have to be made up. I shall therefore have to wait until I can get same gone into by some one competent.\n\nI trust you will find this satisfactory.\n\nYours very obediently\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nSir:-\n\nHaving further reference to my letter of the 12th of June, and Department's reply of the 19th, asking prices for the changes asked for, I took this matter up with the Rev. Principal, and asked him to get prices according to the requirements needed.\n\nHe was anxious to add to the structure that required to be added to the boiler room, a projecting room for the moving picture machine, which really means raising the structure higher, which had to be added for the improvement called for in the boiler room.\n\nI am now enclosing a letter from the Rev. Principal, and also a quotation from Mr. W.H.

I am returning the letter of Mr. Stewart. I note that this improvement will cost approximately $300. There are no funds in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the purpose; but, if the Rev. Mr. Lett is satisfied that he will not require any assistance from the New England Company grant for the time being, this improvement could be allowed. Please let me have an early reply.\n\nENCL.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\nR. Guerry Orr Esq.\nArchitect.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nPerhaps I am foolish for worrying myself unduly and in taking my duties so seriously, but I'm afraid I'm built that way, and cannot help it. Now after this little preamble I shall disclose the purpose of this letter, and let you know what is on my mind.\n\nThe beautiful Chapel which the Department provided for the new school at Lytton has to be abandoned during the winter months because of the inadequacy of the central heating plant to handle the added load. We built on a false premise when we assumed that the existing boilers could heat this building too at times of low temperatures. Theoretically they might do it, but last winter told a different tale. On the authority of the Department, Mr. Walker (Dunham's Alberta Engineer) made a Report on the conditions as he found them, and indicated what should be done to provide sufficient heat for the Chapel, Utility Building and Principal's Residence. You have Mr. Walker's Report and recommendations on file, and are fully conversant with the existing conditions, so I need not dwell on them.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Lett wrote to me recently expressing his anxiety that the heating troubles be remedied before the coming winter. When in Ottawa I mentioned the matter to Dr. Scott, and he was sympathetic towards providing relief, but seemed in some doubt as to whether the money could be found. You were absent from the Capital at the time, and the matter was not discussed at any great length in your absence. I also mentioned the subject to you in Toronto, and if I remember rightly, you said you would see what could be done about it later.\n\nI recognize, of course, that there may be no money available at present for this work, and that of sheer necessity it may have to be postponed. My immediate object in bringing the matter to your attention just now is to say that if there\nis any chance of providing the good people at Lytton with the relief they desire, I shall be only too glad to cooperate. Mr. Crombie, of Vancouver, who put in the radiation and hook-up last summer, is the logical man to do the work, and he is conscientious and efficient, and is in full accord with Mr. Walker's recommendations.\n\nI know you are exceptionally busy this summer, and perhaps I should ask your pardon for intruding this problem on your already overburdened mind, but I simply had to write this letter to ease my own conscience!\n\nThe work on the Blue Quills School is proceeding with almost mathematical precision, and I am finding the contractors capable and dependable, and they have abundant equipment. The erecting of basement steel, and the bricklaying, should start this week.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nMr. Orr recommends that an improvement be made in the heating system at the St. George's Indian Residential School, so that the chapel can be successfully heated. The cost will be nearly $3,000. At the present time, there is over $1,700 in the New England Company account for this institution and this will be doubled in a few days, when the September quarter grant is received from England. I have examined Mr. Lett's recent reports and I believe that he will not require any special help for current expenses for the time being. The New England Company grant could therefore be used for the heating improvement and I beg to recommend your approval to the proposal.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSept. 16th, 1930.\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, CANADA.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis acknowledges your cheque #3670, dated Sept. 12th, covering our invoice 480V, of July 31st. We note that you made this cheque out for $576.60, which is $54.10 over-payment, and it is quite apparent that you have added the freight to the amount of our invoice, whereas the freight is already included in the invoice, and the cheque should be for $522.50. In order to keep your records clear, we are herewith returning the cheque and would ask you to forward one for $522.50.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nR. A. LISTER & CO. (CANADA) LIMITED.\n\nJRD/S\n\nEnclosure\nDear Mr. Perrier,\n\nMr. Indian Agent Graham handed me the letter from you regarding the building of a projecting room for the new machine that I have arranged to be installed in the School. I wish to point out that the lower part of this proposed addition is compulsory in order that the building used as an hoist may be standardized according to the Boiler Inspector's report. The extension necessary to be used as projecting room would therefore constitute perhaps a third of the cost of same. I trust you will find this explanation satisfactory as I felt after reading your letter stating that this building should be put up entirely from the New England Grant, that you had overlooked the Boiler Inspector's report. The extension in reality was asked for in order to measure up to the standard required through inspection.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL.\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE\n\nLytton, B.C.,\n\n165-0-5\n\nSeptember 24th, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI have departmental letter of September 13th, and note that there seems to be some misunderstanding in connection with the matter of the projection room for moving picture machine at St. George's Residential School.\n\nAccording to instructions given by the Boiler Inspector, and to live up to the Compensation Board's regulations, this ash hoist has to be built anyway, and would cost approximately $314.50, as per letter from Mr. H.W. Stewart, which was returned.\n\nThe Rev. Principal, though, suggested that this be built out of lumber and that it be extended up an extra six feet, and the cost of this would be trivial, as the roof would have to be built over it anyway, and thus make a moving picture projection room out of it, by lining this extra height with gyproc (a fireproof material). It would do no harm built of lumber, as it is on the back of the building and could be painted red and would never be noticed.\n\nThe Rev. Principal, Mr. Lett, objects to using the New England funds for this purpose, as this ash hoist has to be put in to comply with the Compensation Board's regulations, and should have been built with the building when it was erected.\n\nTrusting that this fully explains the matter and that the Department will be able to have this done as the Workmen's Compensation Board is wanting to know what is being done in the matter, and if an accident occurred we would get no compensation.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssist. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHG/MD\n6th October, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nAs it is drawing near to the Winter months and the Department has done nothing regarding the changing of the heating system in the two wings, the Residence and the Chapel, and if we are to get through the Winter without this, some changes are very necessary in order to save fuel consumption and unnecessary freezing of radiators and pipes in the Chapel. Resulting from last year's freeze up we have some breakages to take care of now. This freeze up could not have been avoided as there was no valve in the steam pipe running to the Chapel, hence the necessary repairs that now demand our attention. This valve would close off the line so that there would be no further fear of a freeze up as we could then cut off the Chapel and have no further bother.\n\nPersonally, I am trying not to think of the possibility of having, again this Winter, to use the Auditorium for my Services and having no heat in the Residence.\n\nLast year the consumption of fuel was rather great and unnecessary expense could be saved if the heating system were changed.\n\nIf the Department could see fit to make this alteration I should be glad, otherwise I must ask for the installation of a valve which is very necessary in order to prevent further damage being done through frost.\n\nPlease take this matter to the Department and kindly urge them to make the necessary alteration, if it is possible, or to allow the valve to be put in and make the repairs necessary to the Chapel radiators and pipe lining.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\n(Signed) A.R.Lett.\nPRINCIPAL.\n\nMr. H. Graham,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI herewith beg to enclose a copy of a letter just received from the Rev. Principal of St. George's Residential School, in connection with the inefficient heating system in said school, and you are aware that we had considerable correspondence over this last winter, as the school was certainly in a deplorable state as heat could not be taken to the residence or to the chapel.\n\nThe Rev. Principal advises that he had been corresponding with Mr. Gardiner-Smith over this all summer, and had been expecting him right along to come to make the necessary changes, but up to this time he has not appeared, and the winter is fast closing in on us now, so naturally he, the Rev. Principal, is getting very anxious about it.\n\nI trust that the Department will have something done very soon to rectify this trouble. The residence especially might as well be without heating as to be as it is at present.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssist.

At my last visit there were 171 children registered. The dust question seems to be a bad one to solve as every wind that blows brings it in. Considerable oiling of the playgrounds, along with belts of poplar trees round the school, seems to be the only solution. The children were having for their next meal the evening one, gingerbread, apples and stewed pears. I was assured that they were having at least two pints of milk apiece per diem. The dish and food heater in the kitchen was disconnected. Apparently there was something wrong. I instructed Mr. Graham to have the matter investigated and warned a pity to have such a useful and costly piece of kitchen furniture lying idle. Two extinguishers were still lying about as complained of by me last year, and I therefore asked Mr. Graham to urge the principal when he returned to have them placed upon brackets. I went over the classrooms and dormitories and found all in order.\n\nGeo. S.

Montieth,\nMinister of Labour,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nWe have a little matter which we wish you would look into and straighten out for us if possible.\n\nIn 1929 under the former Government, we built the Indian Residential School at Lytton, B. C., on which there is owing to us a balance of Eight Hundred Nineteen Dollars and Thirty Cents ($819.30). To our constant communications to the Indian Department we have received no reply in this matter. They have never definitely refused to pay the bill but merely ignore our correspondence.\n\nThe reason for this, we presume, is because the amount of our charges is for extra wages paid to the carpenters on the demand of your Department, by the late Minister, Peter Heenan.\n\nThis demand was made on us by the Minister in order to satisfy the request of the Labour Unions in Vancouver. It was in addition to what our men had agreed to work for, and in addition to any wage scale paid in any of the surrounding country within 150 miles of Lytton, where we were doing the work.\n\nOur contract was for wages to be paid according to the scale of the district, and we had taken special care, before figuring the building or entering into the contract with the Department, to ascertain, both in Kamloops and Chilliwack, what the wages of that district and surrounding country were at the time. As a matter of fact we were already paying our carpenters 50 cents more per day than the rate in the district demanded, but the Minister, to satisfy the Vancouver Unions demanded that we pay another 50 cents per day, and this additional amount, which was required of us, is all\nfor which we are asking remuneration.\n\nOur whole position is set out in our letters which have been sent to your Department and the Department of Indian Affairs; and also in a statement, in your possession, signed by our men showing that the additional 50 cents per day paid to them was in excess of their agreement with us at the time of being hired.\n\nWe think we are justly entitled to being remunerated for this additional expenditure, and we ask that you will favour us by giving it your immediate attention, with the hope that you will see us justly dealt with, and that remittance will be forthcoming to us for same.\n\nWe are,\n\nYours truly,\n\nADKISON & DILL LIMITED.\n\n(Sgd.) Per J. C. Dill.\nOttawa, December 10, 1930.\n\nDear Sirs:-\n\nYour letter of the 27th ultimo addressed to the Hon. D. J. Montieth, Minister of Labour, Ottawa, evidently was received by the Provincial Department of Labour, Toronto, and redirected to the undersigned at Ottawa. It is observed from your communication that you are claiming from the Department of Indian Affairs the sum of $819.50, which is stated to represent extra wages paid to carpenters in excess of the prevailing wage on demand of the Honourable Peter Heenan, who was Minister of Labour at the time, for work done on the contract for an Indian school at Lytton, B. C.\n\nIn reply may I say that careful consideration has been given to the representations made. Upon going into this question, however, I find that under the labour conditions of your contract the Minister has authority to determine for the purposes of this contract what are the current or fair and reasonable rates of wages, etc. This authority evidently was exercised in the light of information which had reached the Department respecting conditions prevailing in Lytton and vicinity and with the further knowledge that the carpenters over whom this wage dispute arose had been drawn from Vancouver. In view of the authority of the Minister in such matters as herein referred to, it does not appear to the undersigned that this Department can be of assistance to you in this instance. However, as you have intimated in your letter that this claim has already been submitted to the Department of Indian Affairs, for which Department the work was being performed, I am, therefore, transmitting to that Department, for their information, a copy of your letter and of my reply thereto.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMinister of Labour.\n\nMessrs.

MacKenzie, Esq.,\nc/o Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Heating Plant, Lytton, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI met Mr. Sjoquist on Monday last, and accompanied by his steam-fitter, we went over the heating plant at Lytton very carefully. We were able to figure out a scheme whereby the steam main and returns from the Utility Building to the Chapel could be run underground, and Mr. Lett was anxious that the space between these two buildings could be used for a playground, and if we had run the main overhead, the piping supports would have been an attraction for the children, as no doubt, they would have practiced their acrobatic stunts on the steam main.\n\nBy using the sub-basement in the Chapel, and a pit in the Utility Building 15 x 8 x 5 feet 6\" deep, has given us sufficient depth to run the steam main underground, and also to bring the return back dry. This will prevent any possible chance of freezing in the Chapel through lack of firing.\n\nRegarding the chimney, I asked Mr. Sjoquist to make at least an 8\" wall on the side next the building, as a precaution against fire, and there was a matter of 300 extra bricks, but this was covered in the price of $600.00.\n\nThe boiler to be used is an Inglis No. 11, and as the water at Lytton is inclined to be of a foamy nature, and steel boilers lack sufficient steam space, I drove down to Vancouver and interviewed the Inglis people, and they agreed to make the boiler 3\" higher to give us this extra steam space, and 6\" longer to give us an additional heating surface without any additional cost for the boiler.\n\nThe new main to the Residence will be installed so that if no heat is required in the School, the fireman will be in a position to shut off the School entirely, and heat the Residence.\nThe fireman complained to me that he could not keep an equal water line on the boilers. This condition is caused through the use of check valves on the returns between the Hartford connection and the boiler. These check valves are installed according to the British Columbia regulations, and they are of absolutely no value; in fact, they are a cause of trouble, and I suggested to Mr. Sjoquist that he take out the flaps and by doing so, the boilers will retain a steady and equal water line.\n\nI prepared a piping lay-out for the Utility Building, and I also directed the steam-fitter how I wanted this installed.\n\nBefore leaving Lytton, bricks and lumber for the chimney and pit were on the job, and the Inglis people were working on the boiler and expected to have it completed in ten days.\n\nAs the Department are spending quite a little sum on the above alterations, I believe it would be good business to have a thorough check and tests made on the plant some time towards the middle of January. I would be quite willing to make this report and tests, if you so desire.\n\nThe following is a list of my expenses:\n\nFare & Berth ............. $54.60\nMeals & Hotel ............ 30.00\n\nMaking a total of ........... $84.60.\n\nI am not putting any charge in for the trip from Lytton to Vancouver and return, as Mr. Sjoquist was kind enough to allow me the use of his car.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. Walker\n\nC. A. Dunham Company Ltd.,\nCalgary Branch No. 7.\n\nAW/M\nDear Mr. Strang,\n\nI have just received quotation of $445.20 for lumber, which quotation I asked for in connection with two buildings I wish to erect: one in connection with the school and school farm, with curing place for pork. We have now come to that stage where we raise a great number of hogs and I would like if at all possible, a place where I can cure this pork; bacon prices are much higher and we could with very little expense realise a much greater income.\n\nI wish also to erect a feed shed for Lot 47, with the intention of adding a silo in which to store corn silage for feed purposes there. The pasturage does not cost the school anything and as we have a great deal of roughage for feed in the first crop of hay, we could, by adding silage to the rations, increase our range herd considerably, and also put out for sale the whole of our second crop of hay.\n\nAs lumber is fairly low in price at the present time I have added a couple of thousand feet of shiplap, and also some 2\" lumber for repairing the flume, which repairing is always necessary in the Spring time.\n\nI have already got out the frame for the proposed building at Lot 47 and the erection of same would be no outside expense other than the lumber.\n\nI would be very glad indeed if the Department could see fit to grant us $500 for this work.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\nPRINCIPAL.\n\nMr. Strang,\nActing Indian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nLytton, B. U.,\nDec. 20, 1930.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI herewith beg to enclose a letter from the Rev. Principal of St. George's Indian Residential School, asking for a grant of $500 to put two buildings, one in connection with the school and school farm, with curing place for pork, and the other a feed shed for Lot 47, with the intention of adding a silo in which to store corn silage for feed purposes of the cattle kept there over the winter.\n\nIn regard to these requests I would like to recommend that they be granted if at all possible, as both buildings would be very useful additions to the farm buildings at the school.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.

F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary to the Deputy Minister,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn Friday the 23rd, I completed my inspection of the alterations to the Heating Plant at St. George's Residential School, Lytton.\n\nThe Residence which has now a new steam main, is heating very nicely, without any pressure showing on the boiler, and Mr. Lett was inclined to think it was a little too warm, but this can be taken care of by the valves on the radiators.\n\nThe Utility Building and the Chapel are also working very nicely, and on making a test on the Chapel, I found it required only a very short time for the steam to travel from the boiler in the Utility Building to the last Radiator in the Chapel. We had perfect circulation through every radiator, with only a small amount of vapour showing at the tri-coc-s, and no pressure indicated whatsoever on the steam gauge. Two to three fires per day will be all that is necessary to keep the Chapel and the Utility Building warm.\n\nThe concrete work, the building of the chimney, and the installation of the complete plant have been carried out according to instructions, in a very neat and proper manner and with the exception of two small changes in the piping and the raising of three ceiling Rads in the basement, the work is complete.\nThere was a rainfall of two inches at Lytton last Thursday, and no water entered the boiler-room, showing that the boxing which covers the mains between the Utility Building and the Chapel was tight.\n\nAttached you will find my expenses covering two trips to Lytton, and the account submitted by the Kamloops Plumbing & Heating Company.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.

It will therefore be necessary that this heater be replaced and I would be obliged if you would submit this need to the Department. It is very necessary that we have plenty of hot water in the school.

It is considered the school should provide this equipment from per capita earnings or other receipts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nThe Indian Office,\nLytton, B.C.\nDear Mr. Strang,\n\nThe pipe line connecting the barn with the supply spring has been continually breaking out and it has been necessary to replace old sections with new pipe. This winter the line which runs through the full length of lawn, has again broken out and I do not wish if at all possible to injure the sod, which is now well taken and which has given us a great deal of work to establish by digging into the line which runs through the lawn.\n\nAbout 1,200-ft. of 4\" 50-lb. pressure wood pipe would be necessary for this repair and I would be glad if the Department would undertake this expense.\n\nI have today written for quotations and we would undertake the work of installation ourselves.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nPRINCIPAL.\n\nMr. Strang,\nActing Indian Agent,\nLyttion, B.C.\nMarch 5, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nI herewith beg to enclose a letter from the Rev.

The studs are\nplaced so far apart that when the plaster gets even a small\nknock, cracks appear, and before long a section of the\nplaster falls out. This has been the case in a number of\nplaces at St. George's.

According to our records there are only four boilers at this school and the total fees on these amount to $28.60. Will you kindly advise me what the additional $6.40 covers.

Funds are available in the New England Company grant for this purpose; but, before authorizing you to make purchase, I have to request you to let me know the names of two or three suitable sources of supply. If the matter is urgent, you may telegraph these to the Department. Instructions will then be sent to you concerning the purchase.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A.

This pipe is continually breaking out and we wish to replace same with new pipe and also some six inches low pressure pipe with which to carry irrigation water over one of our alfalfa fields which heretofore has had a box ditch, same having fallen in and is of no more use to us without replacement.\n\nI trust this will explain my reason for making application for this new pipe.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nA.H.

The school was clean and tidy. On visiting the kitchens, I found that the supper consisted of corn, bread, and butter and cocoa with rice pudding. The senior boys were getting meat and potatoes additional, and the senior girls apple pie. A small refrigerator of about 10 cubic feet capacity is wanted in the kitchen. Fire drill is being well carried out. I pointed out that the fresh refills should be put into the fire extinguishers, and that they should be tagged. I also requested that these extinguishers should be placed upon brackets, so that they do not get moved about, and always remain in the same place. The plaster walls seem to be giving way and deteriorating badly, apparently being plastered upon too flexible wire. The paint, too, must have been poor as it is pealing and flaking off all the pipes. The root crops were being stored in the barns when I was there. The barns need painting again. There were 22 milk cows being milked at the time of my visit, but there is still some bother and loss with abortion amongst the herd. I also inspected the manual training quarters of nine dual benches. The principal wished he could get a lathe installed.\n\nGeo. S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, January 11, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nThe enclosed accounts, in duplicate, amounting to $22.20 and $5.40, have been received from the office of the Chief Inspector of Boilers, Vancouver, covering the cost of inspecting the boilers at the St. George's Indian Residential School.

(Seventy five dollars) for putting in a reducing pressure valve? It seems as though the high pressure is beginning to show in many other places e.g. on our softeners, toilets, valves etc. etc. and I think the installation of a reducing pressure valve would save us a great deal of repair.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA.R.LETT\n\nPRINCIPAL\nLyton, B. C.,\nJan. 27, 1932.\n\nSir:-\n\nI herewith beg to enclose a letter from the Rev. A. R. Lett, principal of St. George's Indian Residential School, which will speak for itself.\n\nIn regard to this hot water heater I would like to recommend that a reducing pressure valve at a cost of Seventy-five ($75.00) Dollars, be put in, which would do away with having to purchase hot water heaters so often.\n\nTrusting that the Department will be able to authority this expenditure,\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A. Strang)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nAS/MD\nFebruary 3rd, 1932.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Bushard,\n\nI wish to purchase from the New England Company funds, which are available for the St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, B.C., in the federal district of Cariboo, 2,400 feet of 6\" low pressure wood pipe for irrigation purposes. The cost will be approximately, $450.00. I am informed that there is only one company in Vancouver that makes this pipe, viz., the Pacific Coast Pipe Co., Ltd., 1551 Granville Street. Will it be satisfactory to place the order with this manufacturer? I should be grateful for an early reply as the Reverend Principal wishes to get the work done before the spring work commences.\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nOttawa, February 3rd, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your 11006-06 of the 27th ultimo, with enclosure, and in reply I have to authorize you to purchase a reducing pressure valve for the domestic water supply system at the St. George's Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nA. Strang, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\nSanitary Conditions: The main drain pipe from the sinks and which runs under the kitchen floor often blocks. This causes serious trouble. This is not a pipe drain going to the septic tank. The Principal requests permission to open up the floor of the corridor just outside the kitchen. He wishes in the opening thus made to place an inspection trap. It will, of course, be necessary to consult the plans of the pipe lines in the school when starting this work. It can, of course, be carried out at the school without expense to the Department and will make future flooding of the kitchen floor impossible. When this work has been done, I recommend that new linoleum for the 30 ft. by 20 ft. kitchen floor be authorized at a cost of $150.00.\n\nThere is plaster off the walls in the Boys' and the Girls' wash rooms on the basement floor. I would suggest that zinc lining be placed in three of the boys' shower baths and in one shower bath on the girls' side.\n\nFarming: I should like to draw the attention of the Department to the fact that a small canning plant at this school would make the surplus product of the farm and garden, in the way of fruits and vegetables, available for winter use. Such a canning plant I am informed would cost in the neighbourhood of $300. I consider that the money spent on this would not be wasted, as much of the perishable products of the garden would thus be saved.\n\nThe De Laval Cream Separator is now 10 years old and is not worth any further repair. I beg to recommend that the purchase of a new separator of approved pattern be authorized.\n\nA small electric refrigerator of approved pattern is also recommended for use in the kitchen.\n\nAbout $600 worth of paint is required. This is the total cost of the paint that the Principal considers necessary if the various farm buildings are to be painted this year. Some of these buildings do not appear to have been painted, and a number require repainting. The boys, under the instruction of one of the staff, could do all the actual work. The provision of materials for the painting of the farm buildings is recommended. The total of $600 mentioned would include the necessary paint for four cottages.\nOttawa, February 6, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Barry, Inspector of Schools for the Province of British Columbia, in a report on his inspection in November, last, on the St. George's Indian Residential School, states as follows regarding the sanitary conditions: \"The main drain pipe from the sinks and which runs under the kitchen floor often blocks. This causes serious trouble. The Principal requests permission to open up the floor of the corridor just outside the kitchen and place an inspection trap in the opening thus made, and states that the work can be carried out at the school without expense to the Department. This will make future flooding of the kitchen floor impossible.\"\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department will approve of the Principal arranging to open up the drain and install the inspection trap. We understand that he has plans of the drainage, which he should consult before starting the work. The Department would pay the cost of the trap and materials used, but it is expected that the work will be carried out by the school without charge.\n\nThe Inspector also draws attention to the condition of the plaster on the walls in the boys' and girls' washrooms on the basement floor. He recommends that a lining be placed in three of the boys' shower baths and in one of the girls' shower baths. You should see that the work is satisfactorily performed, and at the least possible expense, and you may forward a voucher, in duplicate, covering the cost of the material. It is thought that the labour could be performed by the school staff without charge.\n\nThe Inspector further recommends that linoleum be supplied for the kitchen floor and also a cream separator. In this connection I have to say that the Department will have no funds to provide the linoleum, and it is considered, with regard to the cream separator, that the school authorities should provide the expenditure required in the purchase of a new separator from per capita earnings or other receipts.\n\nWe have noted for our Estimates for the next fiscal year the providing of funds for a small canning plant, the paint required in the painting of the various farm buildings and cottage, and also a small electric refrigerator for use in the kitchen.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Lett, principal, of St. George's Indian Residential School here at Lytton, and find that he has a very good system, which I also observed when up at the school.\n\nThe other night the fire bell was rung just as the children were starting to go to bed and everybody was out of the school in 3\u00bd minutes. The girls took a little longer than the boys. In summer they have fire drill after the children are asleep, but not in winter owing to the cold.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.

C.\n\nDear Mr. Strang:-\n\nFind herewith enclosed bill of expenditure on cleaning and repair of main ditch. This is getting more burdensome as the years go by. It amounts this year, as bill denotes, to the amount of $426.30. This is a rather heavy item on the School as an overhead on irrigation, and in submitting the accounts to you, I wish you would take the matter up with the Department, with the view of having the Department bear this expenditure for us.\n\nIn regard to the ditch, on the whole it is evident that new fluming will have to be put in. We are not at all assured of continued irrigation for this year, as the present flume is rotting, and will not in repair hold nails and in many places is completely falling apart. It was necessary this year to replace some fifteen boxes, and it will be necessary, I feel, before another irrigation season that the whole ditch be put in good condition. I am submitting this to you in the early part of this season so that the Department will be able to make provision for this expenditure in the coming Autumn or before irrigation begins next Spring.\n\nIf anything is done the ditch should be enlarged as well as a new flume built, so that more water could be handled during the season of Freshet, which would give us assurance of at least one crop of hay on a much greater acreage, and would benefit the Indians to a larger degree as well.\n\nI trust you will take the matter up with the Department at once.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA. R. Lett.\nPrincipal.\nSir:-\n\nI herewith beg to enclose a letter from the Rev. A. R. Lett, principal of the St. George's Indian Residential School here at Lytton, which will speak for itself.\n\nIn regard to this I would like to recommend that this matter be given favorable consideration, as it is most essential that the flume and ditch referred to be kept up owing to the number of Indians using it as well as the School, it being the only water they have to irrigate their farms which would completely dry up without it.\n\nMr. Lett has also enclosed a unitized account showing what the cleaning, building flume and lumber would cost.\n\nTrusting that the Department will be able to help in this matter,\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.

Strang,\nThe Indian Agent, LYTTON, B.C.\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Strang:\n\nI have been thinking very strongly of trying to put in a small canning plant for the School, and this year the local canning plant is not going to operate. Hence we have some tomatoes on our hands (small acreage), but it would be very nice if we could put a few tons of these up for winter consumption. I have made enquiries regarding the possible cost of this plant, such as we would need, and it would cost somewhere in the neighbourhood of $225.00. This would give us a capacity of about two hundred pounds per cooking, and would be quite an asset to the food supply for the winter.\n\nBesides the tomatoes, we have planted quite a crop of pumpkins, and also have this year, a goodly crop of harvest apples, and in the Autumn prune plums which could all be taken care of by this plant. I have been making enquiries, and understand that Principal Raley of Coqualeetza has, for some years, had a small canning plant which has given him every satisfaction. I also enquired of Mr. P. Moore, superintendent of Colony Provincial Farm, who says that it is one of the best expenditures he has ever made, and cans up to one hundred and fifty tons over the Provincial Asylum.\n\nA supply of cans, which would take care of about ten tons of canning produce, would cost around $100.00. The same cans could be used three years in succession. This would be an extra cost, making total of $325.00 for the Plant and cans. Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn and Inspector Barry have both recommended this installation to the Department, but I have wondered if this expenditure could not be made out of the New England Company's grant to the School.\nMr. A. Strang:\n\nAs you know, it would be a very substantial asset to the School as we grow so much perishable food stuffs which could be taken care of by canning. Besides varying our menu, it helps to keep the children in fit condition and happy.\n\nPlease do what you can for me, as, if I cannot make this installation this year I shall be at a considerable loss.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA. R. Lett.\nPrincipal.\nLytton, B. C.,\nJune 28th, 1932.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nI herewith beg to enclose a letter from the Rev. A. E. Lett, principal of the St. George's Indian Residential School, which will speak for itself.\n\nAs Mr. Lett says it would be a great help in saving much of the perishable produce of the farm, and I would like to recommend that he be granted this canning plant to be paid for out of the New England grant.\n\nAs he says the cannery that started up here last year cannot operate this year owing to financial difficulties, so he will have a considerable amount of perishable produce on hand that he expected to sell to the cannery, which will be a complete loss unless he can put it up.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A. Strang)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nAS/MD\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, enclosing a communication which you received from the Principal of St. George's Indian Residential School in which he applies for a grant to the amount of $325 to install a small canning plant for the use of the school and in the purchase of a supply of cans.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of the Principal arranging for the purchase and installation of the canning equipment and for a supply of cans, at a cost not to exceed the above mentioned amount. The expenditure for this purpose will be provided from the New England Company's grant to the School. The Principal should obtain an account, in triplicate, covering the expenditure incurred. This account he should hand to you, and you should attach same to a proper voucher form, certify in the usual manner and forward to the Department for payment.\n\nI may say it is noted that the Principal states that the same cans could be used three years in succession. The Department will rely on the Principal and staff to see that, as a result of the canning process, there will be no danger of ptomaine poison resulting to the pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. Strang, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nJune 21st, 1932.\n\nMr. Williams,\n\nThe Honourable Mr. Stevens has written the Minister with regard to the claim of Mr. John Dill, of Vancouver, against the Department of Indian Affairs. Mr. Dill, who is a member of the firm of Adkison and Dill, Limited, had a contract, I believe, for the construction of the Indian School at Lytton, B.C., and the claim arises from the scale of wages which they were compelled to pay on the same.\n\nThe Minister would appreciate your letting him have a complete report covering this matter.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa June 23, 1922\n\nMr.\n\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nDo not file.\nJune 24, 1937.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nMr. Buskard,\n\nReferring to your memorandum of the 21st instant with reference to the claim of Adkison and Dill on their contract for the erection of the St. George's Indian Residential School at Lytton, B.C., I beg to give you the following information.\n\nWhen plans and specifications are being prepared for a building, the regulations provided by the department shall apply to the Department of Labour for a fair-wage schedule of wages. In the case of the Lytton school the Department of Labour recommended the general clause, which provides that all mechanics shall be paid such wages as are generally accepted as current in the district where the work is being carried out, and this clause was inserted in the specifications for the St. George's School at Lytton.\n\nOn December 24, 1937, the department received a letter from the Department of Labour in which they enclosed a copy of letter which they had addressed to Adkison and Dill, Contractors, advising them that they did not consider that they were paying wages in accordance with the fair-wage clause, and stated that an inquiry had been made by the fair-wage officer which showed that current rate of wages for carpenters should be $7.60 per day, whereas they were paying $7.00 for this class of service. The contractors were instructed to pay the wage as determined by the Department of Labour. The contractors, Adkison and Dill asked the department to reimburse them for the advance in these wages, which, of course, could not be considered, and no allowance was made to them for the wages as required to be paid by the Department of Labour.\n| DATE   | DETAIL                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1932   | St. George's School                                                   | $23.55 |\n| Aug. 30 | To 1 Canning plant on our attached account, which expenditure was authorized by departmental letter No. 165-0-5 dated July 9, 1932, from the New England Company's grant to the School. | $23.55 |\n\nI hereby certify that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that all expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nForm No. 11\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6464, file 888-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nLETSON & BURPEE, Limited\n162 TO 198 ALEXANDER STREET\nTERMS: NETT CASH 30 DAYS\nVANCOUVER, B.

The price for installation did not include this meter, which is actually the property of the school, and should be paid for by you. It is a fact, of course, that it was ordered by the Light Company, but this was most convenient and by arrangement, and when you consider that the installation charge did not by any means cover the actual cost of poles, wire, etc. I hope you will agree that the Indian Department should pay for the meter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nLYTTON ELECTRIC LIGHT CO., LTD.,\n[Signature]\n\nGHS*A\nLetter No...3-06\n\nOffice of the Lytton Indian Agency,\n\nSeptember 27th, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 458R, amounting to $56.60 in favour of Lytton Electric Light Co., Ltd., for meter installed in St. George's School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. dated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101 SM/MD\nOttawa, October 5th, 1932.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 27th ultimo, with which you submitted voucher No. 458R amounting to $56.60 in favour of the Lytton Electric Light Co., Ltd., covering charge for a meter supplied for use at St. Georges Indian School, I have to request that you will forward to the Department a receipt covering the express charge of $1.10 in the Company's account which is dated 27th August.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nN.G.

I have been thinking of increasing our range herd, to bring it up to the number of around 125, and in order to keep the herd in good shape, it is necessary for me to provide a feed shed to which could be built a silo and some 60 to 70 tons of corn could be siloed.\n\nI would also like to fix up a more decent living place for the man who is caring for this lot. We have considerably improved our output at Lot 47 and would like to develop the range herd, and in order to do so these necessary improvements would have to be made, both of which would cost us in cash approximately $1,000.\n\nI believe the Department could spend this money from the New England Company grant and we would be glad if this could be done that the Department should let us know at the very earliest as we wish to begin these improvements at once while the Fall weather would allow building.\n\nWould you kindly approach the Department to this effect.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA. R. Lett.\nPrincipal.\n\nARL/CW\nSir:\n\nI have received a letter from the Rev. A. R.

Funds for this purpose will be provided from the New England Company grant, Account No. 460.\n\nYou or the Principal should arrange for the purchase of any material required from firms on the list to receive consideration. As much as possible of the labour should be performed by the school staff. Itemized accounts, in triplicate, for all materials should be obtained. These you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. Receipts covering any freight charges on the materials should be attached to the account. You should state on the account that payment is being made from Account No. 460. You should also forward a voucher, in triplicate, in payment for any labour. This expenditure also will be paid from Account 460.\n\nIt is noted that the Principal desires to begin these improvements at once and to have them completed before the extreme cold weather sets in.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Ferrier, Superintendent of Indian Education, we were able to, last Spring, begin the building of a slaughter house and bacon curing place. For this purpose Mr. Ferrier asked us to purchase cement and shiplap, submitting to the Department bills in triplicate for payment. This gave us the opportunity of starting the building which is now almost complete, making an added cost to the School of approximately $171.61. I understood, through Mr. Ferrier, that the Department would undertake the remaining cost of this building, and I would be glad if you would submit this cost to the Department in view of having it returned to the School.\n\nWe also are in need of about 475 feet of \u00bd\" water pipe with which to connect water to this building, which will cost approximately $20. We would be glad if the Department would include this in the above amount.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA. R. Lett.\nPrincipal.\nSir:\n\nI herewith beg to enclose a letter from Rev. A. R.

This matter is being taken up with the parties concerned, and I will advise you further. The original vouchers are returned herewith.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nN.C.

Allan, Esq.,\nChief Examiner,\nAuditor General's Office,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 20, 1933.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to refer to your voucher No. 540R in favour of St. George's School for lumber, cement, etc., totalling $170.61. This is made up of several bills which appear to have been paid by the school and refunded to the school by official cheque #368 in November. The account of B. Rebagliati for lumber supplied under date of May 4th, and paid by the school, is incorrect as the amount of lumber listed totals 472 board feet instead of 972. Consequently the total of this bill for lumber would be $7.50 instead of $15.45 as submitted. I would therefore ask you to take this matter up with the Principal of the School and the merchant concerned with a view to having $7.95 refunded to the Department. You should give this your prompt attention, and report without delay.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nN.C. Allen\nRepresentative of the Treasury.\n\nA. Strang, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nLyton, B.C., March 13, 1933.\n\nMr. A. Strang,\nIndian Agent,\nLyton, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Strang:\n\nAs the Spring is here, and necessary repairs must be made to irrigation systems, we find that some of our flume has again gone to pieces. It has been our object wherever the flume has been decayed to renew with a more permanent line, and have been using 6\" low pressure wood pipe, which according to quotations just received, is worth $39\u00bd f.o.b. here, and as we are in need of approximately 1000 ft. of this pipe, it would mean an expenditure of roughly $400.00, which the School cannot readily spend. Will it be possible, therefore, for the Department to let us have this pipe, presumably out of the New England Company's Grant, as it would help out considerably in maintaining and repairing our irrigation system, and also would help to conserve water which is so necessary in the irrigated districts.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA. R. Lett.\nPrincipal.\n\nARL/CW\nLytton, B. C.,\nMarch 17, 1933.\n\nSir:-\n\nI herewith beg to enclose a letter from the Rev. A. R. Lett, principal of St. George's Indian Residential School, asking for 1000 ft. of 6\" low pressure wood pipe, to take the place of worn out flume, which would cost approximately $400.00.\n\nI would like to recommend that this be allowed to be charged against the New England Company's Grant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A. Strang)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nAS/MD\nOttawa, March 23, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, enclosing a communication from the Principal of St. George's Indian Residential School requesting authority to incur an expenditure of approximately $400 in the purchase of 1,000 feet 6\" low pressure wood pipe for use in connection with repairs to the irrigation system.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding the above mentioned amount in the purchase of the quantity of new wood pipe required. The purchase of this material should, if possible, be made from a firm on the list to receive consideration. An itemized account, in triplicate, covering the cost should be obtained. This you should attach to a proper voucher form, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. The expenditure for the purpose will be provided from the new England Company's grant to the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. Strang, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF GERALD H. BARRY, INSPECTOR OF INDIAN SCHOOLS, P. O. Box 666, VICTORIA, B. C., ON HIS INSPECTION OF ST. GEORGE'S RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL - forwarded under cover of his letter to C. C. PERRY, Assistant Indian Commissioner, Victoria, dated March 7, 1933.\n\nVocational Training: This report is in addition to the rather lengthy one given under this heading under date of November 27th, 1931, and should be read in conjunction with that report.\n\nThe girls are doing considerable work for the school in the way of actual making of clothes. There are nine Singer Sewing machines in use at present on the Girls' Side, and I would strongly recommend that the Principal's request for THREE TAILOR Machines (Singer) be approved and charged to the B. C. Special Vote. These larger and more efficient machines for heavy work are required for the making of the boys' clothes, etc.\n\nSix hundred yards of material for the making of mattress cases is also required. This material should be made up during the year by the girls working with the larger machines mentioned above. The mattresses used at this school are different to those supplied in the past to other schools. In view of past correspondence I do not know just what vote the money for these covers should be taken from. The fact is that they are required, and no doubt the Department will arrange who is to pay for them.\nOttawa, 15th April, 1933.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYou appear to have over-looked letter of the 26th March, instructing you to obtain refund of $7.95 from the Principal of St. Genorge's School in connection with certain accounts for repairs. It is important that a letter of this kind receive immediate attention, and therefore I have to request that you will lose no time in attending to this matter. The necessary adjustment between Mr. B. Rebagliati and the School should be made with regard to the lumber which he supplied, and the Department should receive the refund.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nN.G. Allen,\nRepresentative of the Treasury.\n\nA. Strang, Esqr.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter dated March 20th, I wrote you in regard to this on April 7th, but the letter was mailed without the cheque for $7.95, which had to be sent to Vancouver to be certified.\n\nI am now enclosing this cheque and trust same will be found in order.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.

Strang,\nIndian Agent,\nLyttown, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Strang,\n\nAt your request and in co-operation with my own correspondence with you, and through you to the Department, I have been over the ditch and find that all of the flume (excepting for that which was put in by the School last Spring\u20141932\u2014costing approximately $800) is in need of replacing. There is about one mile of flume on the ditch, and it has now rotted to that extent that it cannot be touched at all, and wherever it springs a leak new boxes have got to be put in \u2014 hence the yearly expense of up-keep is becoming larger and larger. We have, during the last two Springs spent over $1400 in lumber and costs of repair. I would suggest that the Department buy enough lumber and have same put on the ground so that parts of the flume could be replaced at our own time. The cost of this lumber would be approximately $2000. Enclosed time sheets together with a lumber account which expense was incurred this Spring will leave $300 of the $600 grant just allowed, to buy some lumber, and would suggest that this be spent at once, in order that the lumber may be on the ground in case of an emergency, as we do not know when we may have a break. At any time you wish a list of lumber in detail, I shall be glad to give it to you, but for purposes of quotation we shall need 114,756 feet of lumber to replace the flume.\n\nThanking you, and trust that you shall take the matter up at once as it is important.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL / A.R.LETT.\nLytton, B. C.,\nJune 5, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nEnclosed herewith please find return of labour on the joint irrigation ditch from Botanie Creek and Lake, together with bill for lumber bought by Mr. Lett, Principal of the St. George's Indian Residential School, for repair work on said ditch, and his letter to me regarding the condition of said flume.\n\nIn respect to this, I may say I can agree with Mr. Lett regarding the condition of the ditch, and in view of these facts, I have on order 18,000 feet of flume lumber to be charged against E.R. No. 338. Same will be on the ground in case of emergency.\n\nTrusting the Department will find the return of Labour and bill for lumber in order.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A. Strang)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAS/SQ.\nEtc.\nOttawa, June 13, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, enclosing labour returns on the joint irrigation ditch from Bootanik Creek and Lake, together with account for lumber purchased by the Principal of the St. George's Indian Residential School for the repair work on said ditch. In reply I have to say that the account, covering the cost of the lumber, to the amount of $67.17, will be paid.\n\nRegarding the labour returns, I am returning same herewith, as the Department is in doubt concerning to whom cheques in payment should be sent. If Mr. Lett paid the individual labourers, you should prepare a covering voucher, in triplicate, in his favour, which you should certify. If he has not paid the labourers, should individual cheques be issued in their favour? It is noted, further, that the dates mentioned do not correspond with the ending of the weeks for which the labour was employed. Also, is the Department to understand that the rate paid, viz., 30 cents per hour, is a reduction of what was certainly the amount paid for similar type of labour in 1931? If not, it would be necessary to deduct 10% from the amount paid. Please give the matter of these labour returns your attention and return same in proper form for payment, with full information given, as requested. Please state, also, if these returns cover the total amount of the labour employed in carrying out the repairs.\n\nI have also the communication which you forwarded from the Principal, requesting that a quantity of lumber be supplied to make repairs as required to the flume of the ditch, to a cost of approximately $2,000. In this connection I have to say that no funds, except the sum of $600 authorized in official letter of April 29th, last, can be provided to carry out any further repairs to the flume of the ditch this year. I note that you have on order 18,000 ft. of flume lumber, which will be a charge against the amount authorized by E. R. No. 338. You should forward an itemized account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of this material.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nEncl.\n\nA.

F. Dawson, Esq.,\nDist. Res. Architect,\nDept. Public Works, Canada,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nre: Inspection of Boilers and Machinery,\nIndian Residential School, Lytton, B.C.\n\nOn July 24th, 1933, I inspected the plant of this school, which consists of:\n\nTwo Birchfield boilers 7' x 8' x 4'6\", having 64 3\" tubes, rated 43 H.P. each, numbered 44028 B.C., built in 1928, making them now 5 years old. Longitudinal joint welded.\n\nOne Inglis Supreme boiler, 60\" x 30\" x 42\", having 53 - 3\" tubes rated at 34 H.P., No. 44564 B.C., built in 1931, making it now 3 years old. Longitudinal joint welded.\n\nOne Vertical tubular boiler 67\" x 31\" having 43 2 3/4\" tubes and rated at 6.3 H.P., built in 1927, making it now 6 years old. Longitudinal joint double rivetted lap. Boiler No. 44008 B.C.\n\nBoiler No. 44028 B.C.\n\nI gave this boiler a careful hammer test and found that all stays, plates and joints were in good condition. I then gave it a Hydrostatic Test of 40 Lb. and found everything tight.\n\nThe internal condition of this boiler is very good, there being no corrosion.\n\nThe safety valve works freely and will blow off at 15 Lb. pressure.\n\nThe fusible plug has been renewed.\n\nTest cocks, water gauge, main stop valve, blow off cock and pipe are in good condition. The steam gauge is correct.\n\nBoiler No. 44029 B.C.\n\nThis boiler is in much the same condition as 44028 B.C. except the blow off cock, which is leaking and needs to be overhauled. The steam gauge is about 1 Lb. light.\n\nThe bridge walls of both these boilers have been rebuilt and are in good condition. Some of the nipples of the hot water coils installed in the furnaces are leaking slightly and should receive attention.\nBoiler No. 44029 B.C. Continued.\n\nOn account of the hardness of the feed water a water softening apparatus has been installed for the laundry. I would suggest that only water from this apparatus be used as make up feed water.\n\nI have issued certificates for these boilers, allowing a steam pressure of 15 Lb. and condition good.\n\nBoiler No. 44008 B.C.\n\nI gave this boiler a careful hammer test and found that all joints, plates and rivets were in good condition. I then gave it a Hydrostatic Test of 190 Lb. per square inch and found every part quite tight. I then set the safety valve to blow off at 135 Lb.\n\nThe steam gauge is 15 Lb. light and should be renewed.\n\nThe test cocks, water gauge, blow off cock, are in good condition.\n\nThe fusible plug is to be renewed.\n\nInternally the boiler is in good condition, very little scale showing.\n\nI have issued a certificate allowing a steam pressure of 135 Lb. and condition good.\n\nBoiler No. 44564 B.C.\n\nThis boiler is also in first class condition externally and internally. The main stop valve was leaking so badly that I could not complete the Hydrostatic Test. This boiler is fitted with a scum pan or surface blowdown but there is no cock fitted on the outside of the boiler so it can be used. A screwed plug being screwed into the connection this should be fitted with an asbestos packed blow down cock so that it can be used.\n\nThe fusible plug is to be renewed.\n\nThe bridge is in good condition and will need no attention.\n\nI would like to point out that when this boiler was installed it was installed in a deep pit and no provision was made for draining it. This must be attended to as under present conditions should a leak occur the attendant would very likely be badly burnt before he could get out and the steam and boiling water would prevent him from drawing the fires and the boiler would be practically ruined. To put in a drain would cost about One Hundred Dollars ($100.00).\n\nI have issued a certificate allowing a steam pressure of 15 Lb. and condition good.\n\nLaundry.\n\nThe machines are kept in good condition. There should be a pipe guard placed around the washing and drying machines which I pointed out to the engineer. Some of the materials required are at the school and the rest will cost about Ten Dollars ($10.00).\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT. J. Amall,\nEngineer, D.E.W.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6465, file 888-5, part 4)\nMr. A. Strang  \nIndian Agent,  \nLyton, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Strang:\n\nWe are trying to finish the work at \"47\", which we contemplated doing over the year, and still have the barn and corals to erect. I find that it will be impossible for me to get same done with our own gang, as I have been running with a very close minimum of help, and would like very much if the Department could see fit to allow a grant of $200.00, taken from the New England Company's Departmental funds for wages so that I can employ preferably Indians to do this work. I might also need 2800 or 3000 feet of lumber which would be an additional cost of $60.00, making the Grant $260.00 in all.\n\nPlease take this up with the Department at your very earliest.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA. H. Lett.  \nPrincipal.\n\nARL/CW\nSir:\n\nI herewith beg to enclose a letter from the Rev. A. R. Lett, principal of the St. George's Indian Residential School, which will speak for itself.\n\nIn regard to this letter I would like to recommend that this request be granted to be paid from the New England Company's Grant for having the barn and corals erected for the range herd's winter quarters at Lot 47.\n\nTrusting that this will receive favorable attention,\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A. Strang)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nAS/MD\nOttawa, September 25, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, enclosing letter received from Rev. A. R. Lett, Principal of St. George's Indian Residential School, requesting authority to purchase lumber and hire extra labour for the erection of barns and corrals on Lot 47.\n\nWith regard to the above request, you may inform the Principal that he may incur an expenditure not exceeding $260. In forwarding vouchers you should state that payment is to be made from Trust Account 460.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. Strang, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nLYTTON, B.C.\n\nMr. A. Strang,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Strang:\n\nThe pipe line which supplies the barn with water has again broken out very badly -- in fact, there are five leaks. I approached the Department some time ago for renewal of this pipe line, and was then refused. I have since that time been able to carry through, but find that directly we patch one place, another breaks out, and the line will have to be taken right out and reconstructed.\n\nLast Spring I was able to purchase some 400' of 2\" iron pipe and 300' of 1\u00bd\" iron pipe, which could be used to replace the present wooden pipe line, but it is not enough to go through to the tank, which amount of pipe would carry us about halfway between the barn and the tank. I would like therefore, if possible, the Department to allow us a Grant of $100.00 with which to buy pipe and an extra $100 (cost of installation) making $200.00 in all expended on this work.\n\nI should be able to purchase some second-hand pipe in Vancouver which would do this work very nicely, and would be a permanent job. Kindly take this up with the Department at your earliest.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal - A.R. Lett.\nLytton, B.C.,\nSept. 19, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI herewith beg to enclose a letter from the Rev. A. F. Lett, principal of St. George's Indian Residential School, which will speak for itself.\n\nIn reference to this letter I would like to recommend that this request be granted as the water is doing a lot of damage round the school, tearing up the lawns, undermining foundations, etc., every time a break occurs in the rotten pipe.\n\nTrusting that the Department will be able to grant this request,\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A. Strang)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nAS/MT\nOttawa, September 29, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, enclosing letter of the 18th instant from the Principal of St. George's Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say you may authorize the Principal to secure the necessary pipe to repair the pipe line leading to the barn. It is noted that the cost of the pipe and its installation will amount to approximately $200.\n\nIn forwarding vouchers, you should state on them that payment is to be made from Trust Account 460.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. Strang, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nOttawa, October 16, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Arnall, Engineer of the Department of Public Works, who inspected the boilers and machinery at the St. George's Indian Residential School in July, last, has forwarded a report of his inspection to this Department. He has drawn attention to the condition of the boilers at this school and the repairs required, as follows:\n\nBoiler No. 44029. The blow-off cock, which is leaking, needs to be overhauled. The steam gauge is about 1 lb. light. Some of the nipples of the hot water coils are leaking slightly and should receive attention.\n\nBoiler No. 44008. The steam gauge is 15 lb. light and should be renewed. The fusible plug is to be renewed.\n\nBoiler No. 44564. This boiler is in first class condition externally and internally. The main stop valve was leaking so badly that I could not complete the hydrostatic test. This boiler is fitted with a scum pan or surface blowdown, but there is no cock fitted on the outside of the boiler so it can be used. A screwed plug is screwed into the connection and this should be fitted with an asbestos packed blow-down cock so that it can be used. The fusible plug is to be removed. This boiler was installed in a deep pit and no provision was made for draining. This must be attended to, as under present conditions, should a leak occur, the attendant would very likely be badly burnt before he could get out and the steam and boiling water would prevent him from drawing the fires and the boiler would be practically ruined. To put in a drain would cost about $100.\n\nYou should draw the above to the attention of the Principal and he should arrange to see that the repairs, as mentioned by the Public Works Engineer, are attended to at an early date. The cost should be met by the school authorities from per capita grant or other receipts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. Strang, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\nMr. A. Strang,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Strang:\n\nThe Matron has been in to ascertain whether it would be possible for me to purchase some ticking for mattresses, and also reports the need of blankets, and as the school is struggling to keep above water in finance, I wondered if the Department could not purchase 50 yds. blankets for single beds, and 400 yds. ticking for mattress covers.\n\nWe have also a leak in our hot water jacket, which is the third jacket that has been put in since we moved into the new school. Quotations for this are to hand from the Crane Manufacturing Company, and renewal will cost $90.00. I would be glad also, if the Department could see their way clear to handle this for us.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA. R. Lett.\nPrincipal.\nLytton, B.C.,\nOct. 6th, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI herewith beg to enclose a letter from the Rev. A. R. Lett, principal of the St. George's Indian Residential School, which will speak for itself.\n\nIn regard to the blankets and mattress covers, I would like to recommend, that if possible, these be purchased for the school.\n\nIn the second paragraph he asks for a new hot water jacket, which would cost $90.00. I would like to recommend that this be purchased also, as it is absolutely necessary to get one to replace the cracked jacket.\n\nTrusting for a favorable reply to these requests,\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A. Strang)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nAS/MD\nMr. A. Strang,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Strang:\n\nWhen coming through Chilliwack not so long since, I received information to the effect that a laundry man, who has gone out of business, has in his possession an electric ironer, which originally cost him $400.00, and was used for a period of six months, and now could be purchased for, I think, $100.00, and as our laundry department is in need of such a machine, I thought it would be a good time to bring this offer before the department, so that, if possible, they would be able to install an ironer at a very reduced rate.\n\nThis machine brings with it a guarantee.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA. R. Lett.\nPrincipal.\nSir:\n\nI herewith beg to enclose a letter from the Rev. A. R. Lett, principal of the St. George's Indian Residential School, which will speak for itself.\n\nIf it is at all possible I would like to recommend that this ironer be purchased for use in the laundry of this school, as it would be of great assistance in ironing the large pieces such as sheets.\n\nTrusting that the Department will be able to authorize the purchase of this ironer, as it is a good bargain,\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A. Strang)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nAS/MD\nOttawa, October 26, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your two letters, Nos. 15128-06 and 15129-06, of the 6th instant, enclosing communications which you received from the Principal of the St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, B. C.\n\nWith reference to the electric ironer, blankets and mattress covers asked for by the Principal, I have to say there are no funds available to cover the cost of purchasing this equipment.\n\nRegarding the purchase of a new hot water jacket heater, I have to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $90 in supplying this heater. After this article has been installed, you should forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost. Please state thereon that payment is to be made from Trust Account, No. 460.\n\nI may say that the Department has authorized considerable expenditure for this school during the current fiscal year, and, unless repairs or the purchasing of equipment are of an urgent nature, it will be impossible to provide any further funds for the St. George's School this fiscal year, either from our Appropriation for Indian Education or from New England Company grant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. Strang, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\nDear Mr. Strang:\n\nIn connection with the Department letter handed to me last evening please note the following that:\n(1) Boiler #44029 has been cared for as asked by the inspector, that is, needs in leakage and in the steam gauge has been made right.\n(2) Boiler #44008 steam gauge 1 pound light has also been looked after and the fusible plugs have been changed.\n(3) Boiler #44564 regarding the repairs in connection with the blowdown pan the arrangement that the inspector found on the boiler has been accepted by the Department as a perfect installation from the beginning and I do not feel that the school should be obliged to care for this expenditure. Also in connection with the provision for draining mentioned with an estimate cost of draining being $100.00, this also was accepted by the Department and I do not feel that the burden of this expense should be placed upon the school.\n\nI might say definitely that the financial status of the school cannot stand such expenditure when in the first place the installation was accepted by the Department as measuring up to the necessary Dominion and Provincial provisions for heating facilities.\n\nI shall be glad therefore to do this work if the Department can see fit to make the expenditure.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA.R. Lett, Principal.\nSir:\n\nI herewith beg to acknowledge receipt of departmental letter dated October 16th, in reference to the report of Mr. Arnall, Engineer of the Department of Public Works, who inspected the boilers and machinery at the St. George's Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply beg to enclose a letter on this subject from the Rev. A. R. Lett, principal of this school, which will speak for itself.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Lett states that it will be impossible for him to meet the expenditure of $100.00 from the per capita grant or other receipts.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A. Strang)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa/\n\nAS/MD\nOttawa, November 8, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 15258-06 of the 24th ultimo, enclosing a communication which you received from the Principal of the St. George's Indian Residential School, regarding the recommendation of the Dominion Public Works Department Engineer, who inspected the boilers and machinery at the school.\n\nWith reference to Boiler No. 44564, the Department will have no funds this year to provide the blowdown pan or to install drainage from the pit in which the boiler is installed. It is considered that, with proper care and supervision, this boiler should be satisfactory for the coming winter's use. It is noted that the other repairs to the boiler, as recommended by the Inspector, have been carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA.

I then gave it a Hydrostatic test of 40 lbs. and found it perfectly tight.\n\nI set the safety valves to blow at 15 lbs. water pressure.\n\nCare must be taken to keep the internal wet legs clean and free from sediment, also the furnace crowns as there was a lot of sediment in them.\n\nI have issued a certificate allowing a steam pressure of 15 lbs. and condition good.\n\nBOILER No. 42028.\n\nOn the same day I gave this boiler a similar inspection and found it in first class condition. I set the safety valves to blow off at 15 lbs. The steam gauge is 2 lbs. heavy.\n\nI have issued a certificate allowing a steam pressure of 15 lbs. and condition good.\n\nBOILER No. 42029.\n\nI also gave this boiler a similar inspection and found it in first class condition. There were some corrosion blisters on the tubes and furnace crowns which must be kept clean. The previous water treatment for the three boilers numbered above must be continued. I set the safety valves to blow off at 15 lbs. water pressure. During the Hydrostatic test the blowdown cock was leaking badly and needs regrinding. The steam gauge is correct.\n\nI have issued a certificate allowing a steam pressure of 15 lbs. and condition good.\nBOILER No. 44006.\n\nOn the same date I gave this boiler a careful internal and external inspection and found that there was quite a lot of internal corrosion, some corrosion blisters on the furnace crown and tubes. These must be all cleaned off and when raising steam must be done with a slow fire and the water kept in the gauge glass nearly to the top. After steam is formed blow some water down to the proper working level.\n\nI then gave it a Hydrostatic test of 200 lbs. and found it quite tight. The fusible plug must be renewed. I set the safety valves to blow off at 135 lbs. water pressure. The steam gauge is 2 lbs. light.\n\nI have issued a certificate allowing a steam pressure of 135 lbs. and condition good.\n\nWhen this boiler is not in use it should be emptied and dried out to prevent corrosion.\n\nAUXILIARY MACHINERY.\n\nThe auxiliary machinery is in a very good condition. They have been kept in very good condition and will need no repairs. All the necessary guards have been installed.\n\nMy attention was drawn to the large amount of fuel used during the season. The only solution is to install automatic coal stokers of the underfeed type which will make a considerable saving in the cost of fuel as well as greatly add to the efficiency of the plant.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT. J. Arnall\n\nT. J. Arnall,\nEngineer.\n\nTJA/FH\nOttawa, Sept. 21, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received the report of the Engineer, Public Works Department, B.C., on his inspection, in July, last, of the boilers and machinery at the St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton.\n\nBoiler No. 44564 - The Engineer states that care must be taken to keep the internal wet legs clean and free from sediment, also the furnace crowns, as there was a lot of sediment in them.\n\nBoilers Nos. 42028 and 42029 - These were found to be in first-class condition.\n\nThe Engineer recommends that the fusible plug be renewed on Boiler No. 44006. He further states that the steam gauge is 2 lbs. light. When this boiler is not in use, it should be emptied and dried out, to prevent corrosion.\n\nPlease draw the suggestions of the Engineer to the attention of the Principal. He should arrange to have the recommendations carried out - any costs to be paid by the school authorities from per capita or other receipts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. Strang, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nDear Sir,\n\nWithin the past year the School was obliged to replace the third hot water jacket and now the fourth one has cracked. It would seem that something is radically wrong with this installation because the original heater installed when the school was built should still be functioning but together with it three others have likewise cracked and up to the present time these replacements has cost the school approximately $400.00 and now we are confronted with another expenditure of $150.00. Twice I have reported the fact of these jackets going in this manner and have asked the Department to bear the cost of replacement which was refused and the school was obliged to carry this extra out of Per Capita Earnings. Now I am not worrying over past expenditures but as this is the fourth, in six years of this nature, I think something should be done to remedy the cause.\n\nI would suggest that the Department have a heating engineer look into the matter with the view of ascertaining why this so happens. I believe myself that the Jacket installed is not of large enough capacity to handle the hot water needs of the school and constant heavy firing results in the cracking of the Jacket. It is very evident that something is responsible for such repetitions and I feel the Department now should take steps to remedy the condition.\n\nThe hot water proposition in the school has always been a worry and since a constant supply of hot water is so very essential for the cleanliness and health of the children we should have an efficient heating plant in order that the Staff and Children should be sufficiently supplied.\n\nSincerely thanking you for immediate attention.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\nMr. A.F. McKenzie,\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nPrincipal\nDr. H. W. SULL, Deputy Superintendent General, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nIn June of this year the writer had the privilege of calling on you and discussing the possibilities of Underfeed Stoker installations in your Schools in British Columbia, and you were kind enough to introduce the writer to Mr. Orr and Mr. Phelan, with whom I also reviewed my recommendations.\n\nThe conclusions I reached, at that time, were that Capital expenditures for the current year would be difficult to sanction.\n\nSince my return I am informed that you have under consideration the installation of some form of Automatic Heating in the St. Georges Indian Residential School at Lytton, B.C.\n\nIf we are correctly informed, we respectfully request a copy of your specification, or otherwise we will be pleased to submit a specification from this Office.\n\nAwaiting the favor of your reply,\n\nwe remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nCANADIAN SUMNER IRON WORKS, LIMITED.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\n\"COAL, PROPERLY UTILIZED WITH MODERN EQUIPMENT, IS THE SAFEST, CHEAPEST AND MOST SATISFACTORY FUEL.\"\n## RETURN OF LABOUR\n\n**on the** [blank] **on** [blank] **Reserve**\n\n**for week ending** July 21, 1934\n\n| NAMES               | Nature of employment or trade | No. of Hours | Mon. | Tues. | Wed. | Thurs. | Fri. | Sat. | TOTAL | PRICE PER | AMOUNT OF WAGES | RECEIVED PAYMENT | WITNESS |\n|---------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|------|-------|------|--------|------|------|-------|-----------|-----------------|------------------|---------|\n| Peter Quinn         |                               |              | 8    | 8     | 8    | 8      | 8    | 8    | 48    | 25        | 1200            | Peter Quinn       |         |\n| John Eggleston      |                               |              | 3/2  | 8     | 8    | 8      | 8    | 8    | 43/2  | 25        | 1087            |                  |         |\n| John Walter         |                               |              | 8    | 8     | 8    | 8      | 8    | 8    | 32    | 25        | 800             |                  |         |\n| Helen James         |                               |              | 8    | 8     | 8    | 8      | 8    | 8    | 32    | 25        | 800             | Helen James X    |         |\n| Peter Quinn         |                               |              | 8    | 8     | 8    | 8      | 8    | 8    | 48    | 25        | 1200            | Peter Quinn       |         |\n| Andrew Woody       |                               |              | 8    | 8     | 8    | 8      | 8    | 8    | 48    | 25        | 1200            | Andrew Woody     |         |\n| John Charles        |                               |              | 8    | 8     | 8    | 8      | 8    | 8    | 32    | 25        | 800             | John Charles     |         |\n| William James       |                               |              | 8    | 8     | 8    | 8      | 8    | 8    | 32    | 25        | 800             | William James    |         |\n| John Webster        |                               |              | 8    | 8     | 8    | 8      | 8    | 8    | 32    | 25        | 800             | John Webster     |         |\n| Andrew Adams       |                               |              | 8    | 8     | 8    | 8      | 8    | 8    | 32    | 25        | 800             | Andrew Adams     |         |\n\n---\n\nCheque No.: [blank]\n\nRecommended for payment: [blank]\n\nBalance: [blank]\n\nI hereby certify that the services have been performed and prices are fair and just.\n\nFOREMAN: [signature]\n\nAGENT: [signature]\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6465, file 888-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\n| NAMES          | Nature of employment or trade | Mon. | Tues. | Wed. | Thurs. | Fri. | Sat. | TOTAL | PRICE PER | AMOUNT OF WAGES | RECEIVED PAYMENT | WITNESS       |\n|----------------|------------------------------|------|-------|------|--------|------|------|-------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|\n| Peter Quinn    |                              | 8    | 8     | 5    | 29\u00bd   |      |      | 737   | 25.1      |                 |                 |               |\n| J.

It is presumed that this latter work was done by the school team.\n\nOn checking your pay lists it is found that they total $409.93, and this amount, together with the amount paid for nails, viz., $15.79, makes a total of $425.72, a cheque for which amount is going forward.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I thought it well for this to be reported, and would be glad if sometime you would inspect this condition.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nARL/JF\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6465, file 888-5, part 4)\nLytton, B. C.,\nMay 7th, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI herewith beg to enclose a letter from the Rev. A. R. Lett, principal of St. George's Indian Residential School, in regard to the way in which the Utility Building has settled.\n\nIn this connection I beg to state that I have inspected the above mentioned building and found, as Mr. Lett states, that the east side of the building has settled, causing a distinct list in the chimney.\n\nThis is evidently caused by the seepage of water through a hole in the floor of the boiler pit on that side of the building. To prevent further settling of the building, I would suggest that the water be piped from the pit to the west side of the building where it is lower. This would mean tunnelling under the floor in order to reach the pit on the east side.\n\nI think that the sum of $50.00 would cover the expense of this, at the very outside, and I would like to recommend that this amount be granted for this purpose.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A. Strang)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMr. J. D. Sutherland.\n\nJune 15, 1935.\n\nbe handled is for you to write a letter to him authorizing him to take $100.00 from School funds. To do this, of course, you would have to send him an advance from the N. E. Fund. I suppose you will wish to speak to the D. M. about this matter, but in view of the assistance that the N. E. Company gives us, I feel that we might allow him $100.00 towards his expenses.\n\nMr. Lett promised me quite definitely that we would have no further trouble regarding the staff, although some of those at present at the school are leaving at the end of June. I told him quite frankly that he must get this matter settled at once as otherwise there might be considerably more trouble than there has been in the past.\n\nI am sorry to say that every Agent I met seems to have no use for this St. George's School. I went over it very carefully and I really cannot find what objection they have to it. It appears, however, that Mr. Lett's manner with the Indian Agents leaves much to be desired. Possibly, when we get him down to Ottawa this summer we can go after him a little harder. There is certainly something hurting this School, as it is very unpopular. Mr. Lett seems to be in good health again and, as you know, I always liked him and I really cannot understand why all the Agents seem to be opposed to him.\n\nMr. Lett requested authority for paint, varnish, etc., and for some minor repairs to the building. The total cost of doing this work would be approximately $1,000 to $1,500. Funds, of course, could be secured from the N. E. Company money, and, if you feel the same, I would be inclined to send him enough to cover everything. I believe, however, it might be well to tell him to consult the Agent before making any purchases, in order that all supplies can be purchased from firms on the approved list. As you will remember, we were inclined to doubt Strang, but from my conversation with him I am inclined to feel he is a pretty good Agent. When I return I will have plenty to tell you about all the Agents in B. C. The majority appear to be very capable.\n\nGive my best regards to all the rest of the Staff, and hoping you are not working too hard,\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6465, file 888-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n(1) Give the ancient and to Dr. Macdonald\nbefore Pugwash in full regimentals\nand with column standing at\nattention behind him\n\n(2) also send you a new statue\nof St. George by the - it is\nwonderfully situated on the bank\nof the river with the armatures\nstanding - 100 behind on the other\nside of the river.\n\nalso visited the famous\nfort 47 - will tell you about it\nwhen I get back\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Note: The handwriting is difficult to read.]\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nJune 15, 1935.\n\nMR. J. D. Sutherland,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Jack,\n\nSince I reached British Columbia on the 5th inst. I have visited the Kootenay, Kamloops, Cariboo, Lejac and St. George's Indian Residential Schools, and I am enclosing letters addressed to the Secretary regarding these Schools.\n\nI know you must be busy, but I trust that, in the case of the Kamloops School at least, you will be able to get Mr. Orr moving. Mr. Ferguson considers that if a foreman and a couple of men were engaged the work might be done, with the assistance of the School staff. This would probably be a more satisfactory way than giving a contract.\n\nI am getting used to the B.C. roads, although climbing around these mountains on single tracks is quite a change from the paved roads of Ontario.\n\nI have found all the Schools in very good condition.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Lett wants to come to Ottawa this year - or rather, he wants to visit his mother who is ill and resides in North Bay. You will remember that four years ago Ferrier allowed him his expenses and, in the usual way, he expects the same consideration this year. The only way this could\nOttawa, June 22, 1935.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nMr. Phelan, of this Department, who recently visited the St. George's Indian Residential School, states that you have requested authority to purchase paint, varnish, etc., and carry out some minor repairs to the school building. It is understood that the total cost would be, approximately, $1,000. Mr. Phelan states, also, that you desire to visit Ottawa and your relatives in the East.\n\nThe Department will approve of you taking leave of absence for the purpose mentioned above, providing you can make arrangements that the work at the school will be carried on satisfactorily while you are away. You will be forwarded a cheque, to the amount of $1,500, from the New England Company funds, from which you may take the sum of $100 towards travelling expenses - the balance to be used by you in the purchase of materials and for the labour in carrying out the repairs referred to above.\n\nBefore making purchase of the materials, you should consult Mr. Agent Strong, as it is desired that all purchases be made from firms on the approved list. Mr. Strong will be able to supply you with this information. It might be well, before you leave, to see that purchase of the materials is made and the work of the repairs completed or, at least, well under way.\n\nIt will not be necessary to forward accounts covering the cost of the materials and labour in connection with the repairs, but it is expected that you will keep a record of same in the school accounts.\n\nYou might advise the Department of the date when you will likely arrive in Ottawa. Your vacation period should be during the time the pupils are absent for their holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A. R.

A. R. Lett, Principal, St. George's Indian Residential School. I would request that you advise him regarding the purchase of materials and any outside labour that may be necessary in the carrying out of the repairs, painting, etc., which he desires to do to the school buildings. As you will see by the enclosed copy of letter, Mr. Lett has been asked to consult you in connection with the purchase of the materials, etc.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Lett is being granted leave of absence to visit the Department and relatives in the East.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I am very grateful for this help and permission to get home this summer as I very much want to see Mother again.\n\nThe work at the school will be carried on by Mr. J. Liper, who is manager of the farm work. As the school will be closed, with all the children away for their vacation, there will be no great necessity for anyone except a watchman, which vigilence can be kept by the dairyman or the man who looks after the orchard and gardens.\n\nI will be able to get to Ottawa about the middle of July, and I am looking forward to seeing those whom I know in the Department.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\nA.

Mr. Lett, Principal of the St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, B.C., visited the Department on July 31st, and, in the course of conversation, he mentioned that he was looking into the possibility of developing a waterfall near the school for the purpose of supplying electric power for the St. George's School.\n\nAt the present time the school obtains its power from one of the electric companies in the vicinity of Lytton. All the power required by the school can be obtained and a good service is supplied.\n\nI feel that it would be a very great mistake to make any change in the present system, and, in the event of Mr. Lett, at some future date, suggesting a change, I would strongly recommend that no such action be taken.\nPublic Building\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDATED July 16th, 1935\n\nMr. C.

Boiler should be kept perfectly dry when not in use.\n\nBoiler No. 44028 B. C.\n\nInterior of boiler very dirty, a large amount of scale has been allowed to accumulate in wet legs; this must be cleaned out before boiler is put in operation. Firebars burnt on account of allowing hot ashes to accumulate. Laundry:- A new pipe guard should be placed around the belt of the Hydro extractor.\n\nBoiler No. 44029 B. C.\n\nInterior of boiler very dirty; must be cleaned out before operating. A complete set of firebars and frames are required; they are all burnt out owing to the hot ashes being allowed to accumulate.\n\nBoiler No. 44564 B. C.\n\nBoiler in good condition, but must be cleaned out internally; as before reported no drain in boiler-room floor; this should be attended to before an accident occurs. Refrigerator, spring loaded bypass between high and low pressure should be overhauled.\n\nThe above matters should receive immediate attention. Mr. Arnall's report appears to indicate that the engineer is not performing his duties in a very satisfactory manner. Definite instructions should be issued to him regarding the proper care of the boilers and, if he does not perform his duties satisfactorily, a change should be made.\n\nA copy of this letter is being sent to Mr. Agent Strang.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

J.P. Boyd.\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nFind herewith enclosed quotations for a Ford Station Wagon. In asking for this new truck, I might point out that: first, our old truck is done; secondly, a light truck would save the heavy truck from doing so much light running; thirdly, I have been running the mail and picking up freight all these years for the school myself, and now feel that I would like to have someone else take care of this each morning. This Station Wagon would enable us to continue taking our basketball, football and baseball teams to out of town places for competition, and in this regard would make us more or less independent.\n\nIf you can see fit to grant us sufficient money to cover this from the New England Grant, we would indeed appreciate the advantages a new truck of this type would render to the school.\n\nThanking you in advance for your consideration of this matter.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\nA. R. Lett,\nPrincipal\n\nMr. J. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nARL/JF\nOttawa, October 16, 1935.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 8th instant, I beg to say that a payment of $500 in New England Company funds is being forwarded to you in order that you may finish the painting at the St. George's Indian Residential School.\n\nWith regard to your other letter of the 8th instant, in connection with the purchase of a new truck, it is considered that it would be advisable to postpone action in this matter until next Spring. You might let me know how often it is necessary to have a truck take athletic teams from the school to outside places. It is not likely that this occurs very often.\n\nIt is also noted that there is a heavy truck at the school and this is available when required. The operation and maintenance of a second truck would add considerably to expenses, and, as you are aware from letter recently directed to you, the travelling auditor has taken exception to the large expenditure at the St. George's School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nRev. A. R. Lett,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Indian Res. School,\nLytton, B.C.\nDear Mr. McInnes:\n\nYour letter No. 165-0-3, dated October 16th, re application for Ford Station Wagon, which as stated would, to a large degree, make us independent in our transportation necessitated in our inter-town and school games. We have made as many as six trips to Lillooet, 45 miles distant, also four trips to Spence's Bridge and Ashcroft, 24 and 52 miles distant, and Lytton every other week.\n\nDuring the late agent's term of office among us, he (Mr. Graham) was very good in putting himself and his car at our disposal on competition trips of this necessary activity of school life, but we are not now so favored for the present agent has no interest in us whatever in this regard, hence I have been obliged to beg, borrow or hire extra transportation, and I thought, by having a light truck in which I could comfortably seat up to twelve or fourteen children, it would leave us in a position of independence at times of this sort.\n\nThe big truck is cumbersome and not conducive to much comfort and is also expensive to send on long trips with only half loads, also these B.C. Interior roads do not materially help in keeping down repair bills.\n\nI also had in mind, as pointed out, the fact that I had for all these years been taking care of the morning town trip and feel it is time some member of the staff or one of the boys should now be given this work. During times when, such as this year, I have been obliged to do so much running in transporting children at vacation time, a light truck would be a very great help for us; wherein, I was obliged to make two trips with the car when one would have been sufficient, wherein I sent the big truck to bring a much smaller load than it could carry.\n\nMost of our freighting also could be taken care of by a light truck, saving the expense of running the heavy one to and from Lytton. Very often, in this regard, with a light truck, freight could be lifted during the morning trip in collection of the mail, bread and other school supplies, thus saving again in being obliged, first in using my car as a light express freight wagon, secondly in having the large truck.\nOttawa, November 9, 1935.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, in further reference to the purchase of a truck for the St. George's Indian Residential School.\n\nThis matter has received careful consideration, but, as pointed out in official letter of the 16th ultimo, the Department considers that it is advisable to postpone action until next Spring. You might write again at that time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A. R. Lett,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Indian Res. School,\nLytton, B.C.\nThe installation will be completed in a neat and workmanlike manner with each unit being set into a pit of ample capacity so that the Engineer will have free access to all parts and provide the further advantage of increasing the combustion chamber size so that the fuel can be properly consumed and efficiency and economy become an assured fact.\n\nIn submitting this proposal, we have every confidence that our Automatic Coal Stokers will prove satisfactory and economical under all conditions.\n\nThe Birchfield Boiler enjoys a splendid reputation for efficiency and coupled with a Progressive Stoker, your annual saving in fuel will more than carry the charges on the initial cost, while the further advantage of dependable automatic heat will more than justify the change. Some of our customers in Vancouver who have had Automatic Stokers in service for several years, claim savings up to 50% which is quite high but we feel safe in saying that our average saving in fuel, over a one year run, will be not less than 30%.\n\nWe have many of those units in use around Vancouver and each and every one is an advertisement of their quality. Last month we installed one in the C.P.R. Telegraph Building on Hastings Street, and this sale was made only after the C.P.R. Engineers had thoroughly investigated a list of installations and assured themselves of the ability of our machines to do all we claim for them.\n\nEvery part of the stoker, from the 1 H.P. Motor down, is guaranteed free from defects of any kind and if instructed with your valuable order, we will spare no effort to make your installation an outstanding success.\n\nWe would appreciate your paying our plant a personal visit and if possible, making a survey of some of our completed installations but if this is not possible, you might delegate someone competent to offer an opinion.\n\nAwaiting the favor of your early reply,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPROGRESSIVE ENGINEERING WORKS LTD\nPROGRESSIVE ENGINEERING WORKS, LIMITED\nPATTERNMAKERS, FOUNDERS, MACHINISTS\nAND BLACKSMITHS\nBUILT PROPELLERS AND MARINE REPAIRS A SPECIALTY\nMANUFACTURERS OF MINE, MILL, AND SAWMILL MACHINERY\nTRANSMISSION SUPPLIES AND ALL KINDS OF FLANGED\nPIPE FITTINGS\n\n360 WEST FIRST AVENUE\nVANCOUVER, B.C.

School,\nLYTTON, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe have pleasure in offering the following quotation on Progressive Automatic Coal Stokers for your steam heating plant at Lytton, and trust our proposal is attractive enough to warrant your placing this order.\n\nOur proposal is offered in two ways; first, a 24 monthly payment plan without interest charge but having a 10% cash payment when the contract is signed, the second is based on settlement within 30 days with a cash discount of 10%. The first arrangement is a very fair one and based on the payment being taken care of from fuel savings effected.\n\nProposal. To installing two (2) Progressive Automatic Coal Stokers in the 47 H.P. Birchfield Low Pressure Steam Boilers situated in the Boiler Room of the Lytton Residential School.\n\nPRICE complete, all charges paid, each $1070.00\n\nPayment Plan.\nEach Unit, $1070.00\n10% Discount for cash $107.00\nwithin 30 days $963.00\n\nMonthly Payment Plan.\nEach Unit, $1070.00\nCash Deposit $107.00\n24 monthly payments, without interest, $40.12 ea. $963.00\n\nThe Progressive Stokers supplied will be of sufficient capacity to satisfactorily and economically carry the load required and be built and installed in such a manner that their operation will be positively automatic.\nBLACK DIAMONDS\n\nCoal\u2014all said and done, is still the most dependable fuel available to mankind, and used intelligently can deliver value far in excess of its cost, but even the most modern hand-fired heating equipment fails to get this latent value unless the highest grades of coal are used.\n\nAutomatic Coal Stokers, on the other hand, have made the use of low-priced coal successful, and their higher burning efficiency has also made possible the extraction of a greater B.T.U. value than was ever accomplished by the laborious hand-firing method. Automatic Coal Stokers are built on the principle that to be efficient they must consume the highest available B.T.U. content and the Progressive Engineering Works Ltd. claim that their Automatic Coal Stoker is constructed and balanced in such a manner that the maximum heat value is obtained.\n\nManufactured by\n\nPROGRESSIVE ENGINEERING WORKS LIMITED\n360 West First Avenue\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nFor\n\nMAXIMUM HEAT AT MINIMUM COST\n\nINSTALL THE PROGRESSIVE AUTOMATIC COAL STOKER\n\nCLEAN DEPENDABLE ECONOMICAL!\nCOMFORT AND ECONOMY...\n\nActual performance is what the customer expects when purchasing an automatic coal stoker. A machine may look well but its ability to function economically and satisfactorily throughout the heating season should be the deciding factors when making a decision.\n\nTo achieve this result, your Automatic Coal Stoker must be built by Engineers who know their business and are in a position to guarantee results both in performance and economy of operation over any other form of automatic heating.\n\nWhen you install a Progressive Automatic Coal Stoker you have purchased a machine which looks its value and in which nothing has been sacrificed for appearance.\n\nIn business in Vancouver for almost a quarter of a century, we enjoy a reputation for making dependable machinery, and our Automatic Coal Stokers are built to carry on this tradition.\n\nTHE DEPENDABLE STOKER\n\nRELIABLE AND LASTING...\n\nThe Progressive Automatic Coal Stoker is manufactured in a wide range of sizes to meet the needs of every size and class of heating problem from the domestic to the large commercial units. The Progressive is built on the underfeed principle using a worm feed screw made from the finest alloy steel, while the gear box, \"Precision Built,\" is guaranteed to function accurately and noiselessly over a long period of years.\n\nEvery unit within the gear box, from the bronze worm wheel to the hardened steel gear pawls, run in a bath of oil, ensuring smooth, frictionless movement and long life. The entire stoker, with the exception of the electrical equipment, is manufactured in our own plant, making the unit a factory-built and guaranteed piece of equipment, while the electrical devices are nationally famous for their accuracy and finished appearance.\nOttawa, November 26, 1935.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a copy of letter addressed to you, dated the 21st instant, from the Progressive Engineering Works, Vancouver. It appears from this letter that you have been requesting quotations on automatic coal stokers for the St. George's Indian Residential School.\n\nThis appears to be the first intimation the Department has received regarding this matter, and I wish to point out that no change should be made in the heating system at the St. George's School without first receiving our approval. The cost of providing stokers has been noted, and, at the present time, the Department has no funds for this purpose.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A. R.

This is the fifth installation in this school since we moved in in 1928.\n\nWe were careful to follow out all directions in regard to draining the water and also in keeping the pressure down to below fifty pounds.\n\nI will be glad if you will take this up with Mr. Arnall, as he knows of the installation and also of the trouble we are and have been having.\n\nHoping for your earliest attention to the matter.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA.

This is the fifth heater installed since the new school was built\u2014seven years ago.\n\nWe have taken special care with this one, and cannot quite understand why we are obliged to, in such a short time, replace it.\n\nIf it should happen that your representative will be travelling this part, please arrange him to visit us at his earliest.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA. R. Lett,\nPrincipal.\n\nMetals Limited,\nVancouver, B.

We have done everything we can to carry out advice with regard to draining the water and flushing the heater daily, but to no avail. We cannot understand why these heaters are continually breaking as they do, and we feel unable to take care of the expense.\n\nI would be glad if the Department could help in anyway towards a re-installation of a new heater, and also to take up with the authorities, the possibility of, in some way, eliminating this continuous expense.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA.

Please let me know what replies you receive. When advising the Department, you might let me know the approximate cost of a new heater.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A. R. Lett,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Indian Res. School,\nLytton, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter No. 165-Q-5, dated November 26th, regarding the Progressive Engineering Works in Vancouver and their quotation on an Automatic Stoker for the school. Their representative came to me and asked if I was interested; needless to say, I told him I was, stating that if he could persuade the Department to make such an installment, it would be of benefit to the school, but made no arrangement for installment to be made, expecting to take care of same out of per capita grants.\n\nAn automatic stoker, for at least one boiler, would make a difference in regulating the heat of the building and would materially reduce the cost of firing the boilers.\n\nUnless the Department can do this there is no possibility of the school taking care of this cost. This was made clear to the Progressive Iron Works representative.\n\nTrusting the information will be satisfactory regarding this proposition.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\nA. R. Lett,\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. A. F. McKenzie,\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAPL/JF\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nBy the time this arrives, you will have received the Inspector's Report regarding the progress of the school and its need as to class-room reorganization.\n\nWe propose a new class-room to be housed in the Chapel basement, and to be used as a preparation and feeder room for the remaining class-rooms in the school.\n\nThe Basement of the Chapel lends itself very nicely to the establishment of a Primary room. It could also be used as a playroom for these younger children; with very little expense, other than extra desks and blackboard, this could be made an ideal place.\n\nI have been hoping for such a room for some time, but felt that unless I could have a guarantee of a special grant from the Department or have extra available children who would become per capita earners, brought in, I could not possibly carry this extra incurred expense of a teacher's salary.\n\nThere are now in the school one hundred sixty-two and four in the hospital who will, I expect, shortly be returned, making a per capita earning capacity of one hundred sixty-four, which does not warrant the expenditure of another fifty dollars a month, cash, with twenty-five dollars for room and board. I believe this number could be materially increased if pressure by the Agent was brought to bear on some of the parents now holding their children out of school, and a number maintained closer to our maximum of one hundred eighty. With an average of one hundred seventy-five children I feel I could undertake such an expense.\n\nIt would seem that I should rather talk, not from a money point of view, but for the cause of education take steps immediately to establish a new classroom. I would appreciate your advice in this matter.\n\nI would also call attention to the straggly manner in which children enter the school. If more attention were paid to time of entry it would make the classroom work much easier. In September we had sixteen entries due mostly\nto my own activities and also to those of the missioner. Beginning October 22nd we had three local children brought in and two belated ones from Ashcroft\u2014making five in all. This fact is very upsetting and a principal cannot expect efficiency from a teacher if her numbers are constantly being added to. With a little interested diplomatic activity, on the part of the Agent, the Indians could easily be led to observe September and February as times of entrance and it would make a very great difference in getting efficiency and maintaining it, especially in the lower class-rooms\u2014children coming in at any time is upsetting to both children and teachers.\n\nThe Inspector will report adversely on the Primary Room and this fact is not all due to the teacher, she has been terribly handicapped by straggly entrance. Personally, I cannot do more than ask, and feel that more sympathetic and interested co-operation should be forthcoming. The school is now in good shape and has regained its standard. We have not had any truants and the children and staff are happy.\n\nIt is unfortunate, that during an epidemic of nasty sore throats, we had one death, cause of death pneumonia. This girl's father has always objected to his children going to school and held them out until the latter part of October when she was brought in at the Agent's demand. I made a special trip for the girl and her sister at the beginning of the term, and, together with the Department's Constable, saw these people in the hop-fields, a promise was given by the father that his girls would be sent up the following Wednesday, September 11th, with no results; no further notice was taken until October 22nd. I feel, that had the father been made to carry out his promise and the girl had had a month and a half's good food regularly, I would not have lost her. She came in in a run-down condition and covered with impetigo, consequently she did not rally in the crisis. In every case of pneumonia, twelve in all, we were able, with reasonable nursing, to pull the children through and I am sure this would also have applied to pupil No. 0170, Lily Smoker.\n\nI shall be glad of an early reply, for then I can make the necessary preparations.\n\nIf available children are brought in I am sure they would increase our number up to one hundred seventy-five, or one hundred eighty.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\nA.

Lett, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Indian Residential School,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nHaving reference to your letter of the 2nd instant with regard to the water jacket which takes care of the domestic hot-water supply, I have taken this matter up with Mr. Arnall, our Engineer, and he states that he cannot do any more than was suggested in his report of the 8th January, 1935. In this report, paragraph 5, it was stated the holes should be drilled and tapped to allow the removal of scale in the restricted passages. He noted that you had a flush valve installed, but Mr. Arnall states that this would not help much as the scale deposited is quite hard and would not wash out. The hard scale is what is causing the heaters to crack and they will continue to do so under present conditions.\n\nIn his report, Mr. Arnall also stated that a 2-inch continuous brass coil enclosed in a brick-lined metal casing would give much better satisfaction.\n\nI requested Mr. Arnall to give me a sketch of what would be required to eliminate this trouble and he suggests that a brick enclosed brass coil heater be built according to the enclosed sketch. The approximate cost of this would be Two Hundred and Twenty Dollars ($220.00).\n\nMr. Arnall states that if this is installed and proper precautions taken to clean it out at regular intervals there should be no further trouble.\n\nTrusting this will be the information you require and wishing you the Compliments of the Season, I am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nC.F.

This letter and plan is the outcome of a great deal of consideration in regard to the trouble we have had with our hot-water heating jacket, and also with testing of water for the purpose of ascertaining what would be the best installation with the view to eliminate trouble and extra costs.\n\nI am submitting this in accordance with your letter numbering 165-0-5, dated December 4, 1935.

I trust that his action in this matter will bring the enrolment to the full number for which grant is provided, viz., 180.\n\nWith regard to preparing the basement of the chapel for use as a classroom, the Department considers that it would be advisable to delay action in this matter until your enrolment increases. The Inspector's report shows that there are already four classrooms. We understand, of course, that the number in the primary room is too large, due to the condition mentioned in your letter. The Inspector's report shows, however, that he recommended promoting some of the children from the primary room to the next classroom, and this will relieve the congestion in the former room to a certain extent.\n\nI would appreciate if, about June first, next, you would again remind the Department regarding the difficulties you have experienced in the past in having children return to the school promptly upon the expiry of their leave.

Therefore it was necessary to ship twice as much paint to finish the job which I hope you will be able to put in your 1936 requisition for supplies. We are carrying a balance of $762.70 on our books here until March 1936.\n\nHope you will be successful in getting this O.K.'d by the Indian Department at Ottawa.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMcLennan, McFeely & Prior, Ltd.\n\nW.

These people had their representative come to the school in June last to look over the needs in painting and quote on the paint necessary, according to this man, to do the job. They have now pointed out that it has taken twice the amount of paint expected to do the outside work, and are asking that they be considered.\n\nIn this regard I might say that unless the Department feels they should be, wholly or to a degree, recognized, this company will be entirely at a loss for this amount. In other words, the Department need not make any further payments. The company entirely admit that they under estimated the conditions of the buildings. I might also say that I was very careful to point out, to the men who came here from the paint company in Vancouver, the condition of the buildings, and asked them to examine them carefully so that they would be in a position to supply the paint without further payments being asked for as the Department had given me a grant and they would expect me to keep within these figures.\n\nI trust this will be satisfactory explanation regarding the present relation of the school to this company. This quotation was to supply sufficient paint to do the painting both inside and outside. The company, in supplying sufficient paint have not fallen down on the fulfillment of the contract. It will be entirely in your hands to allow part or whole of this extra cost of paint over and above what they originally thought should do the work.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\nA. R.

You were forwarded, at the end of last June, a cheque for $1,500, of which amount $1,400 was intended to cover the cost of purchasing paint, varnish, etc., and to carry out minor repairs to the school building.\n\nIt was expected that you would keep the expenditure within the amount provided, and, as arrangements were made by you, the Department does not understand why you advised McLennan, McFeely & Prior, Limited, in letter dated the 20th ultimo, to communicate with us. We are not aware what your understanding with the firm was, and, consequently, the matter should be adjusted between yourself and the firm in question.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F.

GEORGE'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL - (Date of inspection February 27-28th, 1936).\n\nOriginal on No. 165-0-6.\n\nThe Matron asked me to recommend that two new Singer TAILOR machines be given to the school as they are so badly needed for this vocational training. I would recommend that consideration be given to this request, which I believe to be a reasonable one in view of the fact that so much construction work is done at St. George's School. Much money is saved by the making of the girls' dresses and other clothes in place of buying them, and the training given of necessity to the girls is of the greatest value.\n\nI wish to draw the attention of the Department to the fact that at night although the ordinary doors of the dormitories are locked the doors leading to the fire escapes are not locked or protected with seals or in any way. It is claimed that on one occasion about a year and a half ago boys got into the girls' dormitory. I also understand that the Indians complain that their girls are left without protection in this way.\n\nI would strongly recommend that LIGHT WEIGHT HASPS with SMALL PADLOCKS be fixed to all doors leading to fire escapes on the girls' side of the school and on the boys' side also. If this is considered a dangerous practice it would be made perfectly safe if fire axes be kept in glass fronted boxes beside each door and also spare keys to the little padlocks kept in glass fronted boxes near the fire axes.\n\nMr. Phelan made suggestion to the Principal that electric bells be connected to the Supervisor's rooms, but the Principal does not like the idea. I believe the provision of light locks on the doors would do two things, take away one of the Indians' objection to sending the children to this school, and prevent the boys leaving the school at night by means of the fire escapes.\nOttawa, April 20, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe following is an extract from Mr. Barry's report regarding his recent inspection of the St. George's Indian Residential School:\n\n\"I wish to draw the attention of the Department to the fact that at night, although the ordinary doors of the dormitories are locked, the doors leading to the fire escapes are not locked or protected with seals or in any way.

We favour the installation of an electric bell to connect with the supervisor's room, and, on the occasion of your next visit to the school, you should take up this matter with the Principal and have him arrange for the installation.

He requires this truck in transporting pupils to and from their homes and also in freighting supplies from the town of Lytton to the school\u2014a distance of three miles. The school has at present a big truck. The Principal states that this truck is cumbersome and also expensive to send on long trips and, owing to the condition of the road, there is considerable expense for repair bills. He estimates the cost of supplying a light truck, with standard equipment and heavy duty tires, plus freight, to be approximately $1,100.\n\nThe New England Company, London, England, provides a grant of \u00a31,000 ($4,860) per annum, which is funded in the Department to the credit of the school, to be used as the Department sees fit, in providing equipment, repairs to buildings, etc. At the present time, there is to the credit of this fund the sum of $9,618.\n\nI would recommend that a light truck be supplied, the cost to be paid from the New England Company grant, and there would be no charge against public funds in this connection.\n\nI would request your approval for the expenditure and to be informed of the name of the dealer from whom the truck should be purchased. I may say that, last fall, the Principal forwarded a quotation from Boyd Motors Limited, Merritt, B.C., for the supplying of a Ford truck, of the type mentioned above, with standard equipment, for the sum of $1,106.60, f.o.b. Lytton.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nEXTRACT from Report of Inspector G. S. Fragnell, Inspector of Indian Agencies, regarding his inspection of the ST. GEORGE'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL on May 20, 1936.\n\nRev. Mr. Lett, Principal of the school, is obtaining a couple of drums of oil to see if the immediate vicinity of the school can be oiled so as to abate this dust nuisance. He also took me down to see the new hot water boiler in the boiler room. This school has had to install a number of these boilers since it was built. Apparently, the trouble is caused by the presence of calcium carbonate and calcium sulphate which, when heated, causes scale in the pipes. As I have seen advertised in English papers some remedy for this, I am going to let the Principal have some information at a later date. I am afraid the installation of this boiler is going to cost more money than was originally expected. It seems that Rev. Mr. Lett obtained an estimate from Mr. Dawson of the Public Works Department, which he submitted to the Department, for $220.00. Unfortunately, Mr. Dawson had not estimated in this certain brick and other work that had to be done, and apparently, the final cost will be around $360.00. I don't think this could be avoided.\n\nI am afraid that the school is going to be very hard up for water for irrigation purposes this year, as apparently, some of the white users opened the gates to Botanie Lake where there is storage. There seems to be some mix-up, too, regarding the closing of these gates early in the fall for storage purposes, and the Dominion Water Rights Engineers, I understand, thought that it was not safe to keep the storage fairly full throughout the winter, owing to a possible early and excessive run-off, in the spring. However, this year, there was very little snow on the watershed, and the consequence is that the storage naturally did not have a chance to fill up, as it might have done if the gates had been kept closed earlier and the lake gone into the winter with some storage from last year. I am not absolutely clear in this matter, but the next time I see Mr. Webb, I will make enquiries.\nThe Principal of the St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, B.C. (Federal Electoral District of Cariboo), has forwarded several requests to be supplied with a light Ford truck, station wagon type, with standard equipment. He requires this truck in transporting pupils to and from their homes, also in freighting supplies from the town of Lytton to the school\u2014a distance of three miles. The school has at present a big truck. The Principal states that this truck is cumbersome and also expensive to send on long trips and, owing to the condition of the roads, there is considerable expense for repair bills. He estimates the cost of supplying a light truck, with standard equipment and heavy duty tires, plus freight, to be approximately $1,100.\n\nThe New England Company, London, England, provides a grant of \u00a31,000 ($4,380) per annum, which is funded in the Department to the credit of the school, to be used as the Department sees fit, in providing equipment, repairs to buildings, etc. At the present time, there is to the credit of this fund the sum of $9,518.\n\nI would recommend that a light truck be supplied, the cost to be paid from the New England Company grant, and there would be no charge against public funds in this connection.\n\nI would request your approval for the expenditure and to be informed of the name of the dealer from whom the truck should be purchased.

R. Lett  \nPrincipal,  \nSt. George's Indian Residential School  \nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis is in reply to your letter of October 7th in which was enclosed a copy of specifications for mechanical stokers.\n\nEnclosed please find a cut of our No. 15 Heavy Duty \"Mabury Combustioneer\" Automatic Coal Stoker. The specifications of our Stoker cover all points brought out in specifications, with the exception of the hopper having an air tight lid. This will be provided, should we be successful in securing the order.\n\nGear Box\n\nIt will be noted that our Gear Box is fitted with an automatic clutch whereby, should an overload be placed on the motor due to an obstruction in the flight, this will cause the automatic clutch to release the motor from the worm. This feature is far ahead of the older method of using a shear pin.\n\nWe also provide an access plate for the removal of an obstruction in the coal feed, without removal of the coal from the hopper. This also is an added advantage over many of our competitors.\n\nGuarantee\n\nIt is understood that Seller guarantees that the \"Mabury Combustioneer\" Automatic Coal Stoker, when put in use and operated according to Seller's instructions and burning an average good quality of coal, will:\n\n(1) Efficiently burn free burning coal screenings.\n(2) Operate without objectionable smoke, as defined by the local smoke ordinance.\n(3) Automatically maintain the stipulated boiler pressure with present load.\n\nSeller further guarantees to exchange free of charge, f.o.b. Seller's warehouse, all parts of said Stoker proven inherently\ndefective in material or workmanship within one year from date of installation. Seller agrees to give 90 days' free service after installation of the Stoker. If the installation is made during the summer, the period of free service and guaranty against defective parts shall date from October 1st of the current year.\n\nControls\n\nWe have standardized on the Mercoid Controls and will provide on this job out fire, hold fire and safety limit controls on the boiler and a thermostat, if required. Our controls have no open contacts since they are all of the mercury tube type.\n\nElectrical Supply\n\nThis Stoker takes a l.H.P., 60 cycles, and either single, or three phase current. We would appreciate having information as to whether your current there is single or three phase.\n\nWe will install in each boiler a No. 15 Heavy Duty \"Mabury Combustioner\" complete with electrical wiring, controls, all brick work, and refractory material and also the dead plate assembly, all turned over to you in efficient working condition, for the sum of $825.00 for each boiler, so equipped.\n\nWe appreciate the privilege of being able to submit our quotation on the proposed work.\n\nYours very truly\n\nMABURY ENGINEERING CORP.

The volatile matter which causes smoke when firing by hand, is progressively distilled from the coal as it passes through the incandescent fuel bed. The carbon in the coal is then burned and practically every heat unit is converted into useful energy. The patented Mabury-Combustioneer gear box causes the fuel to be agitated during the process of combustion. The feed screw starts slowly, increases in speed until it reaches maximum velocity and then slowly stops. Due to the spongy nature of coal, this alternate compressing and releasing of the fuel causes the small particles of coal to pack momentarily and then spring apart. As this occurs from 60 to 90 times a minute, the air reaches and surrounds each particle of coal and supplies the right amount of oxygen to burn the coal completely. This is in contrast to the continuous feed type of gear box where the coal is under constant compression and the air cannot reach the center of the fuel in the retort.\n\nGEAR BOX. The patented Mabury-Combustioneer Gear Box is of the heavy duty intermittent type designed to produce the \"breathing\" action of the fuel bed which is so necessary to burn bituminous coal efficiently. There are only three rotating parts in the gear box. Positive splash and contact lubrication of all moving parts is provided. All parts subject to wear are hardened and ground. The bronze worm wheel, special alloy steel worm, heat treated steel drop forgings, large bronze bushings, ball bearings and the bronze and steel drop forged eccentric, insure long service life. All parts are machined in jigs and fixtures and are interchangeable. The coal feed can be changed without stopping the motor. Every part is accessible from the front of the gear box.\n\nSAFETY CLUTCH. The exclusive Safety Clutch automatically disconnects the coal feed worm from the driving gear in case of an overload caused by an obstruction to the feed worm. It is adjustable to suit any kind of coal used. The clutch is re-engaged by simply pulling a lever. It is as positive, simple and dependable as the clutch in your automobile. Antiquated shearing pins have been eliminated. Electrical connections to clutch lever can be arranged to stop motor and sound alarm bell in case the clutch is operated, thereby preventing the fuel bed from burning down in the retort.\n\nACCESS PLATE. The Patented Access Plate permits the removal of obstructions from the feed worm without emptying any coal out of the hopper. A crusher pocket in the base automatically reduces the lumps of coal to proper size so as to pass through the worm tube, thus insuring a uniform flow of fuel to the retort at all times.\n\nRETORT. The Retort is built up of sections to take care of expansion and contraction. They are constructed of special heat resisting iron, heavily ribbed to amply support the weight of the fuel bed and a portion of the dead plates. The sides and ends of the retort are so shaped as to allow free upward movement of coal to the tuyere blocks.\n\nTUYERES. The Tuyeres are of heavy construction and made of special heat resisting iron. Sectional type with ventura shaped air passages arranged to secure correct air distribution in fuel bed. The design of the tuyeres minimizes the possibility of clinkers forming and adhering to their sides. The correct amount of air passes out of the back of the tuyeres to complete combustion.\n\nFAN. The fan is carefully balanced and especially designed for quiet operation. The shape, position and arrangement of the blades is determined after years of experimentation and represent the latest development in fan design.\n\nAIR CONTROL. Patented, micrometer adjustment, stream lined Air Control permits the exact amount of air to be supplied to the fuel bed at the proper static pressure by changing the effective width of the fan. The entrance to the fan and the air duct are unobstructed by dampers, thereby eliminating surging of the air supply and uneven static pressures. The patented Mabury-Combustioneer Air Control minimizes the electric power consumption.\n\nGAS BACK ELIMINATOR. Air at fan pressure is introduced into the retort end of the coal feed tube from the air chamber, thereby preventing gas from being forced back through the hopper. The design eliminates long pipes which might stop up with coal.\n\nSHEET STEEL PARTS. Hopper, air duct and other sheet steel parts are made of heavy, rust-resisting, copper-bearing steel. The side of the hopper toward the boiler is ventilated. Two sheets of heavy gauge steel are used with a dead air space between. This construction prevents over heating of the rear sheet in contact with the coal and increases the life. Hopper is hinged to the heavy cast iron base and can conveniently be tipped to either side to facilitate cleaning of fires. Coal capacity approximately 600 lbs.\n\nCOAL FEED WORM. Mabury-Combustioneer \"Truflite\" coal feed worms are made of special formula chrome-manganese steel. Metal patterns are screwed out of the mould guaranteeing perfectly true flights throughout entire length of worm.\n\nLONG LIFE. The model 15 Heavy Duty Mabury-Combustioneer is of extra heavy construction throughout. It has been designed for the owner who considers low yearly operating cost more important than low purchase price.\n\nMABURY ENGINEERING CORP. LTD.\n\nVancouver, Canada\nRev.

F. McKenzie,\nSecretary, Dept. of Ind. Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. McKenzie:\n\nOn the strength of reports received from Mr. T. J. Arnall, Boiler Inspector of the Public Works Dept., and after consultation with him, acting upon his advice, I have asked for quotations from the companies who have been visiting the school in connection with Automatic Stokers for the boilers, which quotations are herewith enclosed. I am also enclosing copy of specifications given me by Inspector Arnall, a copy of which was enclosed in my letter to each company and their quotations were governed thereby.\n\nThe Sumner Iron Works are, I notice, slightly higher than Kolelectric, and Mabury Engineering Works is very much lower which denotes inferior quality or workmanship and I am inclined, therefore, to eliminate their quotation asking for the consideration of the Sumner Iron Works, reasons being that the Vancouver Island Coals Ltd., who have been responsible for considerably lowering our cost of heating, recommends these people as very reliable and will install into it the best of workmanship and material, they also have a service-man on the road.\n\nIt is a well-known fact that no matter how careful the resident engineer may be it is humanly impossible for him to keep an even temperature throughout the building and we find that the northwest end is very hard to heat entirely, and I find in doing so that the remainder of the building is heated to excess. Thermostats in this part of the building would govern the distributed heat and would therefore give us more uniformity. It is also a well-known fact that by doing this we would be able to use a less costly coal thereby saving considerably in the cost of heating operations; in fact the Automatic Stoker people maintain that over a period of three years their installation would be paid for in savings on the coal bill.\n\nThe District Medical Inspector has just paid us a visit and asks that temperatures be taken in the classrooms and in other parts of the building where uniformity cannot be held and which we have here-to-fore done. I find a considerable variance and find it im-\npossible to hold an even temperature.\n\nIt would appear that the installation of Automatic Stokers would benefit the school in more ways than one and would eliminate the necessity for a man to stay on duty for necessarily long hours during the extreme cold. Occasionally I have had to put on a second man which also adds to the cost and which would be eliminated by Automatic Stokers.\n\nYou have, I presume, a copy of Mr. Arnall's report and can see for yourself that he strongly recommends this change and, personally, I feel that the school would be very grateful for this benefit and would do all I could to facilitate such installations in taking care of men and hauling of material.\n\nI trust you will not feel that I have stepped too fast in asking for and forwarding these quotations. I feel, that if the Department should see fit to make this expenditure or allow the school to take care of the same out of coal purchase savings, it would be a very worth while consideration.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA.

GEORGE'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL\nSCHOOL ON THE 27th, 28th and 29th ULTIMO.\n\nOriginal on No. 165-0-6.\n\nI do not like the way in which the girls' dormitories are open to invasion from the fire escapes. This matter has been mentioned in a previous report. A suggestion was made by Mr. Phelan that Bells should be fixed up, but the Principal did not agree.\n\nI have suggested to the Principal that the Manual Training Class fix LIGHT hasps on the doors of the dormitories opening to fire escapes, and that these hasps be locked with VERY SMALL padlocks about the size of a 25\u00a2 piece. Further that the spare keys for these locks be kept in glass fronted boxes at the sides of the doors, and proper fire axes be also kept in glass fronted boxes near the doors.\n\nThe Principal thoroughly agrees with me that this would solve the difficulty. It will be remembered that the proper protection of the girls was one of the points brought up by Indians when they refused to send their children here. They claim that there is no proper protection of the girls in their dormitories. The above suggestion will solve the difficulty without increasing the danger in case of a fire. I would ask the Department to write the Principal with regard to this matter.\nOttawa, November 18, 1936.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Department understands from Mr. Inspector Barry's report that no steps have yet been taken to prevent anyone entering the girls' dormitories from the fire escapes. Mr. Barry also states that at the time of his visit it was suggested that light hasps be placed on the doors and these hasps locked with small padlocks. The Department is not prepared to approve this suggestion.\n\nPlease arrange to have each door leading from the girls' dormitories to a fire escape attached by wire to an electric bell. It should be arranged that this bell will ring in the supervisor's room in the event of anyone opening the door to the fire escape. This is considered the best method of preventing anyone from entering the dormitories, and, at the same time, leaves the doors unlocked so that they may be immediately opened in the event of fire.\n\nA copy of this letter is being forwarded to Mr. Agent Strang.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

He should be told that the Medical Officers are of the opinion that the present situation in the dressing rooms are not conducive to the best health of the children.\nOttawa, June 29th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn official letter of April 29th, last, you were requested to examine the heating system at the St. George's Indian Residential School on the occasion of your next visit to that school. As you have not yet replied, the Department presumes you have not had an opportunity of visiting the Lytton Agency.\n\nWhen you do inspect the St. George's Residential School in connection with the heating system, you should also ascertain if certain changes could be made in the building to permit dressing rooms being provided adjacent to the dormitories. Dr. A. L. McQuarrie, who was in Ottawa last week, is of the opinion that the present system of having the children undress downstairs and walk upstairs to the dormitories is a possible reason for their ill health.\n\nIn reporting on the heating system and any structural changes that you could suggest to provide dressing rooms near the dormitories, you should, of course, give an estimate of the cost. Funds for the purpose may be secured from the amount allowed this Department by the New England Company and we would be prepared to favourably consider any suggestions that you care to make and proceed with the work at the earliest possible date.

My own opinion is that the bathrooms should be on the same floor as the dormitories; at the present time they are located in the basement adjoining poorly heated dressing rooms with cement floors.\n\nI will arrange to visit St. George's School at an early date and will submit a report covering my investigations as requested.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

Dawson,\nDistrict Resident Architect,\nDept. Public Works,\nVictoria, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Heating St. George's Residential School,\nLytton, B. C.\n\nMajor Mackay, the Indian Commissioner, asked me to make a special report on the heating conditions of the above school during my last inspection. I now beg to submit the following report.\n\nFrom what I can find out, there has been trouble with the heating ever since the school was built. Several changes have been made from time to time so that it is very hard to arrive at a decision without making a proper investigation when the plant is operating under the full load condition. At present I can only give you hearsay evidence, and form an opinion on that.\n\nFirst, there is no doubt that the two boilers are not large enough to properly heat the school during very cold weather. I was informed that after the school was built, a new Chapel building was constructed, and was supposed to have been heated from a boiler in the school. Then this was found impossible to do, an engineer from an eastern firm was called in and he stated that the two boilers were not large enough to heat the school, much less the Chapel. He recommended that a new boiler be purchased and installed in another building, now used for a manual training school, and the new mains leading from the old plant cut. This was done, and now neither plant is giving satisfaction, and being so far apart makes the operation quite a difficult matter for one engineer to operate.\n\nAnother change made was in the heating of the Residency. This part was always cold, and I was told that a new steam main was taken from the boiler to lead direct to it. This was a good solution, but upon following it up I found that the new branch was taken from the steam main in the wing of the school nearest the Residency. There was also an air eliminator installed close to where the branch was taken off. Naturally seeing that this branch would be the one offering the least resistance, most of the steam would travel towards it, and the other wing, not having an air eliminator, would not get much steam until the pressure in the boilers was great enough to overcome the air pressure in the mains and force it out at the traps. This required steam pressure to be very high to obtain during cold weather, and the boilers would fired as they are at present. This condition can be considerably relieved if Automatic air valves are installed on the radiators on the end of the runs. I would say from 8 to 10 radiators would require valves.\n\nThe above is the situation as near as I can give it.\nReedy: The question has been suggested to install Automatic Underfeed Stokers in the main plant. From my experience I would say that they would increase the efficiency of the boilers to such an extent that it would relieve the underheating of the buildings as well as reduce the fuel bill considerably.\n\nI would also like consideration to be given to the following suggestions, which, if carried out, would in my opinion remove these difficulties. That is, to take out the new boiler now used to heat the chapel and manual training and bring it up to the main boiler room and install it on the same lines as the other boilers. This will give more steam capacity. Install a wood-burning hot air furnace in the basement of the chapel and also one in the basement of the manual training school, as both of these buildings will require intermittent heat.\n\nThen, with the two boilers equipped with stokers, and the new boiler hand-fired, this would give an additional boiler in case anything went wrong with the power line during severe weather.\n\nInstall automatic air valves on the above-mentioned radiators. This suggestion would also bring the whole heating plant of the school under one control point. The radiators now used in the chapel could then be used in various parts of the school where required.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT. J. Arnall\n\nT. J. Arnall,\nEngineer, P.E.\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI beg to refer to your 165-0-5 of the 25th of April and June 29th regarding the heating plant of St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton.\n\nAn examination of the heating system at this school was recently made by Mr. T.J. Arnall, Engineer of the Federal Department of Public Works and his report with recommendations are forwarded herewith. Mr. Arnall made his examination of the heating plant during the month of August when the system was inactive but he has inspected similar plants when in operation so that with his knowledge of such units, together with the information supplied by Principal Lett, the engineer in charge and the Agent, it is considered Mr. Arnall would be in a position to make the recommendations embodied in his report.\n\nBriefly, Mr. Arnall recommends as follows:\n\n(1) The installation of Underfeed Automatic Stokers to fuel the two boilers of the main plant.\n\n(2) The removal of the boiler heating the manual training department and Chapel to the main building and its addition to the main heating system as an auxiliary and emergency unit.\n\n(3) The heating of the manual training department and Chapel by separate wood burning hot air furnaces.\n\n(4) The installation of automatic air valves on 8 or 10 radiators.\n\nThese recommendations merit consideration and, I am inclined from my own personal investigation of the situation at the school, to agree that the suggested changes would go a long way to increase the efficiency of the heating unit to what is necessary for St. George's school.\n\nAutomatic Underfeed Stokers have been installed at Coqualeetza Indian Residential School and have greatly improved the heating situation for that school. Stokers have also been installed in a number of the Federal public buildings in this province and, I understand, have been found highly satisfactory.\n\nAn estimate of the cost of the stokers, hot air furnaces, automatic air valves, removal of boiler and installations, is placed at three thousand (3000) dollars. Mr. Arnall assures me that this work can be undertaken within the next four or five weeks without interfering to any important extent with the conduct of the school or endangering the welfare of the pupils and staff.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

There is available in this account an amount sufficient to provide for the cost of the improvements recommended by Mr. Arnall and Indian Commissioner MacKay.\nI would therefore appreciate receiving the authority of the Honourable the Minister to have Commissioner MacKay proceed with the work at once, so that it can be completed before the cold weather commences.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nCONFIRMATION\n\nOttawa, October 21, 1937.\n\nD.

This amount is intended to provide funds for the changing of the heating system, and also for the repairs to the Chapel. In connection with the latter, I am returning the account of $64.07 in favour of the Dominion Bridge Company, in order that you can issue cheque in payment of it.\nPayment for the changes in the heating system should not be made until you receive definite instructions from Indian Commissioner MacKay.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Necessary funds will be forwarded to principal.\"\n\nPayment of the cost of the changes in the heating system is being made from the funds provided by the New England Company, and a cheque is being forwarded to the Principal of the St. George's Residential School.

I note that the uniformity of heat in the building is responsible for very many favourable comments from the staff and one is greeted by faces of cheer as one goes from department to department.\n\nWe shall as soon as possible have the remaining changes made and when all the work has been done we shall again report to you.\n\nIn again expressing my thanks, may I say that whilst our comfort has been greatly added to, I shall also benefit by the saving in our fuel bill, which the manufacturers of the stokers claim will amount to quite a sum over the heating period.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6465, file 888-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nIn accordance with instructions contained in your 165-0-5 of June 23rd, I examined the dormitories in the St. George's Indian Residential School to ascertain if certain changes could be made to permit of wash and bathroom accommodation being provided in the present dormitory space.\n\nI found that this could be done and, although such alterations would probably necessitate some readjustment of the present sleeping arrangements, the Reverend Principal assured me that this could be done without much difficulty and would not mean that the bed cots would be crowded as other space, not being at present used for sleeping quarters, could be utilized for this purpose if necessary.\n\nFour dormitories would be involved in the proposed alterations; two on the first floor and two on the second floor. The estimated cost of the proposed alterations is approximately $3,000. The present arrangements are far from satisfactory and are probably to some considerable extent responsible for so much sickness at this School.\n\nThe installation of wash and bathroom accommodation in the dormitory space on the first and second floors of this School is recommended for favourable consideration and, if approved, should be carried out during the months of June and July, when the School is not in session.\n\nIt may be that the New England Company would favourable consider a grant covering the cost of these improvements.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of December 1st with reference to the dormitories in the St. George's Indian Residential School.\n\nI note that you estimate the cost of the proposed alterations at approximately $3,000. Please let me know what proportion of this would be expended in purchasing material. Do you consider the work could be done under the supervision of the Principal? In this event, would the school staff be able to supply some of the labour, or would outside workmen be necessary?\n\nWould you prefer to have the work done under the direction of the Surveys & Engineering Branch?\n\nFunds for the purpose are available in special trust account, in which the New England Company grant is deposited, but we desire to have any necessary repairs made at the most reasonable cost possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Training and Welfare,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am now able to submit the cost of installation of the new additions and changes to our heating plant. The following cheques were issued:\n\nNovember 15th, 1937 Canadian Sumner Iron Works $1000.00\nJanuary 24th, 1938 -d6- $47.24\n\nTotal of $1947.24 for complete installation.\n\nJanuary 24th, 1938 Andrew Sheret For two Hot Air Furnaces installed, one under the Chapel and one under the Utility Building. $665.00\n\nTransportation on these $110.00\n\nMaking a total in all expended $2722.24\n\nI had a quotation of $425 for the changing around of the steam boiler now installed in the Utility Building which formerly took care of this building and the Chapel, but which quotation I deemed too high, and last week was in conversation with Commissioner McKay, Vancouver, and he felt as I do so that other steps are being taken to have this boiler changed from its present position and placed in the school boiler room.\n\nThese installations have been inspected by the Public Works Dept. and passed by them.\nFebruary 4th, 1938\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nOttawa.\n\nA report of Mr. Arnall's visit no doubt has gone forward to you.\n\nI trust you will find the above satisfactory.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nPublic Buildings,\nVictoria, B.

C.\n\nDear Sir: Re: Installation of Stokers, Hot Air Furnaces, and alterations to Heating Plant at St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, B. C.\n\nOn January 13th, 1938, I made an inspection of the above plant and now beg to report as follows:\n\nAutomatic Stokers:\nTwo Model D \"Iron Fireman\" Automatic Underfeed Coal Stokers have been installed in a first class manner. They are operating very efficiently and giving a good CO\u2082% and a very low slack heat loss.\n\nHot Air Furnaces:\nThere have been two steel welded hot air furnaces installed, one in the Chapel and one in the Utility Building. The one in the Utility Building is giving every satisfaction. The one in the Chapel, although heating the building very comfortably in zero weather, could be improved by either installing a small fan in the long run which discharges near the Chancel, or by reducing the air flow from the outlet in the west end of the Nave. These improvements can be done by the school staff with very little expense.\n\nMain Heating Plant:\nThis plant is a low steam pressure having a gravity wet return, which has a slow circulation and is generally troubled with air pockets which prevent the steam circulating freely in the radiators.\n\nThe proper solution would be to install a Condensate Pump in the boiler room, this pump to be connected in such a manner that it can be used in conjunction with the present returns, that is, during peak loads in the daytime and very severe weather, the pump can be used, but during light loads, nights and during mild weather, the present return system can be used. The cost of pump installed would be approximately $550.00.\n\nAnother method can be adopted to remove most of the air from the radiators, that is, to install a small air relief valve on the air locked radiators. This I suggested in my previous report, and has been done in some parts of the building where much better circulation has been obtained, but there will be 15 or 16 more required to complete it.\nI also found that the system was out of balance, that is, some of the radiators were getting too much steam and others not enough. This can be remedied by inserting orifice discs in the steam valves at the radiator. I explained to the Principal of the school and to the Engineer the method of making and installing these discs. I was informed whilst at the school, that conditions this season were at least 40% better than they were before, if my suggestions for the air valves and discs were carried out, more improvements will be noted.\n\nThe steam boiler formerly used in the utility building, and which is proposed to be installed in the main boiler room, has not yet been removed, but this is going to be done as soon as time permits. When this is done the school will have a compact steam plant.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT.J. Arnall\nEngineer, D.F.W.\n\nTJA/IT\nPublic Building,\nVictoria, B.

This was discussed with Mr. T. J. Arnall, Boiler Inspector of the Public Works Department, who inspected the plant this last summer and he suggested the trouble may be due to cracks in the main brick chimney, and recommends that the chimney be examined by a competent bricklayer.

Topham recently inspected the main chimney at the St. George's Indian residential school and reports that the chimney is in good condition. However, the school engineer has advised the Agent that the chimney was not built for forced draft and the smoke backs up through the worm of the stoker filling the boiler room with smoke which filters through the floor of the auditorium just above. The school engineer considers that the only remedy is an extension of the chimney by another 15 or 20 feet to increase the draft. Mr. Topham offers to build the additional 15 feet for an amount of $485.00.\n\nAs you will no doubt be visiting the St. George's school in the near future in connection with the letter written to you some two weeks ago regarding the Principal, you might make further inquiries with a view to determining whether or not an addition is required to the chimney.\n\nWhen I was in British Columbia last year someone mentioned to me that it was likely that a new roof would be required on the St. George's residential school this summer. You might also investigate this as possibly if a new roof is required the addition to the chimney could be built at the same time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Lett, Principal of St. George's Indian Residential School for a new 1\u00bd-ton truck and a new car to replace the 1931 Chevrolet truck and Oakland car now at the school and which are reported to be in need of such extensive repairs that they should be replaced. A copy of Mr. Lett's letter in connection with the matter is attached for your information.\n\nA turn-in value of $300.00 on each of the old vehicles on the purchase of a new car and truck in replacement, has been offered by Brett's Ltd. of Lytton.\n\nNo provision was made in the current year's estimates for an expenditure of this kind and it may be that funds are not available unless there happens to be a balance in the New England Company's grant to this school from which the required amount to purchase the cars could be obtained.

GEORGE'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nLytton, B.C., November 28, 1938.\n\nMajor D.M. McKay,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major McKay,\n\nThe representatives of Bretts Ltd. who have lately built a new garage in Lytton, came some time ago absolutely on their own, to appraise and offer us trade-in values on our old truck and car, and last week appeared with a letter from yourself in recognition of their correspondence to you. May I make the following statement?\n\nBoth truck and car are 1931 makes, the car Oakland and the truck Chevrolet. I have not been able to use the truck to any great extent for the past year and during that time have been obliged to hire the local cartage man to haul our hay and also unload our coal, and as you will see, we are in need of a new truck.\n\nThe car has now done around 75,000 miles and is in need of considerable repair, and, one would feel the car did not warrant this expense providing a good trade-in value could be received. The offer made by Bretts was $600 as their trade-in value, but I feel that if a sale were being made, they would allow us $700.\n\nIf the Dept. could see fit to do business in this regard with these people at the present time, or give them a guarantee of the business being given them within the next few months, I feel it would be a good move as greater value could be realised at the present time because of the fact that they do not wish to carry over any 1938 stock.\n\nI shall forward a copy of this letter to the Office in Lytton.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n\"A. R. Lett.\"\nPrincipal.\n\nThe above trade in value is for both truck and car $300 each.\n\n\"A.R.L.\"\nOttawa,\nJanuary 19, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BAILEY\n\nRe: St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, B. C.\n\nIndian Commissioner MacKay has submitted a request that he has received from the Principal of the above school for a new truck and a new automobile for the Principal.\n\nThe Chevrolet truck at this school was purchased in 1931 and it has not been possible to use it to any great extent during the past year owing to its condition.\n\nThe Oakland car was also purchased in 1931 and has run approximately 75,000 miles. At the present time it is in need of considerable repair which is hardly warranted in view of the car's present condition.\n\nThe firm of Brett's Limited, Lytton, B. C., has offered to allow a turn-in of $300.00 on each of the above vehicles provided, of course, that a new car and truck were purchased from them. Funds for securing a car and truck for this school are available from the amount granted quarterly to this school by the New England Company.\n\nIndian Commissioner MacKay considers that the truck and car are necessary and suggests that he be authorized to obtain prices from firms on the approved list. Please let me know if it will meet your approval to have Major MacKay take the action indicated.\n\nR. A.

During the construction of the building, we were forced by the Labour Department - then under Mr. Heenan - to pay out the sum of $619.30 more in wages than we deem we had any right to pay. We of course charged this amount back to the Indian Department but have never yet been recompensed or the amount affirmed or denied. We now ask at this late date that, you will have some honest and otherwise disinterested official or judge, look over all our correspondence in both the Labour and Indian Departments and we will abide by his decision as to whether we are justified in asking the Government to reimburse us for the above amount. If his judgment is in the affirmative we ask that you will see that we are paid accordingly. Otherwise we ask that the Government grant us the right to sue in court for the amount.\n\nTrusting to get some action in the matter\n\nI am\n\nYours truly\n\n(Sgd) J.C.

From our former letter it must be perfectly obvious to you that it is impossible for us to pay the increased wage out of our own funds.\n\nWe certainly followed the letter of your specification in figuring the job and went beyond the spirit of your specification in paying the men $7.00 per day instead of $6.50, being the amount on which we based our estimates.\n\nIf, however, the government desires that a higher wage shall be paid than that which we could reasonably estimate, then we think the government, through the department involved, will surely have to make up that difference. It makes no difference at all to us how much we have to pay the men so long as we have been able to figure that amount into our estimates, and if you feel like allowing the difference to the men, we certainly will be pleased to distribute the amount when ratified by you or give you all the names and the amount of time worked so that it could be handled direct from your department, if you so wish.\nIn reference to the second clause in the Minister of Labor's letter, copy of which we enclose, he states that all the men who are employed have been brought from Vancouver. Would say it is possible that most of the men came from Vancouver, but, we did not bring them. They were hired on the job at Lytton, paying their own way there. It is only the fact that our head office is in Vancouver that Vancouver carpenters have easy access to us. Had we been contractors for Kamloops, for instance, this question never could have risen and we must maintain that we are in the same position.\n\nThe Minister of Labor refers to the Provincial Government building at Tranquill, on which they are paying $7.50 to carpenters. This, we understand, is quite true, but, you must note that the Tranquill contract was let quite a time after ours and in addition to that the Provincial Government took the precaution to state the amount of wages that were to be paid to carpenters, thus eliminating any necessity for the contractors to discover for themselves what rate was being paid in the district.\n\nTrusting that you will either ratify the increased payment or take this matter up with the department of labor further and have it eliminated, which, we think, as a matter of fact would be the better plan as we must assure you that all men being hired on the job knew well the wages that were being paid and agreed to same without question.\n\nWe are\n\nYours truly,\n\nADKISON & DILL, LTD.,\n\nper (Sgd.) J. C. Dill\n\nP.S. We are sending a copy of this letter to the Minister of Labor.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 17, 1926.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nRe: Carpenters' Wage Rate\nIndian School, Lytton, B.C.\n\nMy attention has been directed to a communication which has been addressed by your firm to the Department of Indian Affairs in relation to the subject matter of my letter to you of the 27th ultimo. I have read the contents of your letter carefully and am sorry if your tender for the work was based on a lower rate of wages than you have found it necessary to pay. I note that you were not furnished until recently with a schedule of current wages rates which had been prepared by Mr. Harrison, our Fair Wages Officer at Vancouver.\n\nThe contract with your firm does not contain any fair wages schedule, but does contain a fair wages clause providing that all persons employed in the construction of the work shall be paid such wages as are generally accepted as current from time to time during the continuance of the contract for competent workmen in the district in which the work is being performed for the character or class of work in which they are respectively engaged, and if there be no current wages in such district, then fair and reasonable rates. The Fair Wages Officer who investigated the complaint in regard to the carpenters' wage rate on the Lytton school, found that the men of this trade who are employed have been brought from Vancouver and that Vancouver rates are applicable for carpenters as far east as Lytton and indeed are being paid a hundred miles further from Vancouver on work which is being done for the Provincial Government at Tranquille.\n\nAfter giving consideration to the statements contained in your letter, I do not find any reason to change the direction which was given in my earlier communication, and would ask that this ruling be put into effect without further delay in accordance with the requirements of the Fair Wage Clause of your contract.\n\nMessrs Addison & Dill, Ltd.,\n319 Fender St., West,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) Peter Heenan\nMinister of Labor.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 17, 1928.\n\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nI have received your letter of the 11th instant enclosing a communication from Atkinson & Dill, Limited, of Vancouver, contractors for the Indian School at Lytton, B.C., regarding the directions which were given to them recently by the Minister of Labour in relation to the proper rate of wages payable to carpenters employed on this work.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

The contract in question calls for the payment to mechanics, labourers, etc., of such wages as are generally accepted as current from time to time during the continuance of the contract for competent workmen in the district in which the work is being performed. It is further declared that the minister of Labour may at any time and from time to time determine for the purpose of the contract what are the current or fair and reasonable rates of wages. In the present case enquiry has been made by the Fair Wages Officer of the Department of Labour which shows that the current rate of wages for carpenters is the same as that in Vancouver, namely, $7.50 per day, whereas it is represented to us that your firm is paying a rate of wages of $7.00 per day for this class of service.\n\nUnder the authority of the labour conditions of the contract, I am writing you to say that a rate of wages of $7.50 per day must be observed for carpenters on this building and that settlement must be made to individual carpenters who have received less than this rate for the amounts which may be severally due them, covering the full period of their employment.\n\nI should be glad to have word that this ruling is being put into effect.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) Peter Heenan\nMinister of Labour.\n\nMessrs Adkison & Dill,\nContractors,\nLytton, B.C.\nADKISON & DILL, LIMITED\n\nVancouver, B.C., January 5, 1928.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nRe: Erection of Indian Residential School - Lytton, B.C.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nWe enclose herewith copy of letter from the Minister of Labour to us in connection with the rate paid to carpenters on the above school and also copy of our letter in answer to this.\n\nWe wish here to advise that when figuring this building we enquired of the rates being paid to carpenters and other mechanics in that district and all up the line. We found that in Chilliwack they were paying from $5.50 to $6.50 per day. Kamloops being the largest centre actually in the Lytton district, we found that the wages paid carpenters were from $6.00 to $6.50 per day. We, therefore, figured our job at $6.50 for carpenters, believing that to be the proper rate to be paid. We found, however, about the time of starting this work that the men in Kamloops would soon be asking for a raise in wages to $7.00. We, therefore, started our work off at that price wishing to have no controversy in the matter. We are, therefore, as you will see, out fifty cents 50\u00a2 per day on every carpenter we have employed on the job.\n\nIf the letter from the Department of Labour is to be followed and the men paid $7.50 per day, we think it will be only right that the department should pay this difference and not ourselves as we have already gone half way at a loss to ourselves.\n\nWe do not see, however, that the department can possibly be correct in their assumption that $7.50 should be paid in this district. It is true we found out only a few weeks ago that Mr. Harrison, the fair wage officer of Vancouver had struck a rate of wages for this work being practically that which is paid in Vancouver. We, however, at the time of figuring and not until a few weeks ago were not cognizant of that fact and there is no rate of wages stated in the\nspecifications or any of the papers coming from your department at the time of figuring this work, merely a reference to wages usually accepted in the district which we have followed and gone one better by paying the men 50\u00a2 per day more than seemed right at that time and fully the amount which actually exists today in that district.\n\nWe ask that you will take this matter up with the Minister of Labour and if found necessary to pay the other 50\u00a2 per day, we trust that you will make it up to us.\n\nWe assure you, however, this objection has not come from any of our men but is merely the work of an agitator in the City of Vancouver.\n\nTrusting you will give this matter your immediate attention and greatly oblige\n\nYours truly,\n\nADRIAN & DILL, LTD.,\nper (Sgd.)

We wonder that nations cannot settle their differences by arbitration but surely in our own country it can be done. It seems that every difference of opinion must be made a cause for contention instead of being looked into in a reasonable way and decided on its merits. I made my appeal to you direct because I thought surely in the Dept. of Justice we will at least get a hearing and I asked that a disinterested official or judge - apart from ourselves or the departments affected - be asked to go thoroughly in to all the evidence and give a decision. I left the matter entirely in your hands and stated that we would abide by such decision without further question. We do not wish to put the Government or ourselves to further expense in the matter, but the conditions of our affairs are such that a settlement is very urgent. I therefore beg that you will have our claim fairly dealt with as above requested and the adjudication will be accepted by us as final.\n\nIn closing I think there will be no betrayal of confidence when I tell you that Dr. Duncan Scott the former Supt. of Indian Affairs told the writer personally, when he was in Vancouver, that he did not feel that we had been justly dealt with at the time, also the fact remains that none of my statements that were written at the time, together with a signed declaration of all the men who worked on the job and received the extra pay, have ever been disproved or refuted.\n\nThanking you for your forbearance and soliciting some interest in our case\n\nI am yours truly\n\nJ.

If the Department's position has been explained fully to this firm further communication would hardly seem necessary at present. However, I think it would be advisable to avoid telling anyone that they would or would not be entitled to a fiat. The various Government departments are asked for opinions with regard to the granting of fiats in matters affecting their work but any statement as to whether a person is or is not entitled to a fiat should be made only by the Department of Justice.\n\nChief Executive Assistant.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**PAY TO:** Vancouver Motors Limited,\n\n**ADDRESS:** Seymour at Smythe Street,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| May 5 | To one 1939 1\u00bd-ton Ford Stake Body Truck, for St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, B.C., as per attached account. | 1018.28 |\n\n**AUTHORITY:** Purchase Order No. 13661\ndated April 6th, 1939,\nFile No. 26655-15-11.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 506\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6465, file 888-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n**VANCOUVER MOTORS LIMITED**\n\n*Authorized Ford, Mercury and Lincoln Dealers*\n\n**SOLD TO**\n\n*Min.

One tube has\na hole in it about an inch below the sheet or top head, so could not\ncontain any test. In my 1934-35-36-37-38 reports I pointed out that\nit was much too small. It has now reached the condition where it\nwill have to be re-tubed or a new boiler installed. Should it be\ndecided to install a new boiler of 12 to 15 H.P., the old boiler\ncan be re-tubed and used as a hot water boiler or used as a steam\nboiler for sterilizing purposes.\n\nT.J.

Boiler No. 44008, at St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, in which it is advised that it is much too small and should be replaced by a new boiler of 12 to 15 H.P.\n\nThe Reverend Principal, Mr. Lett, has already made application for this replacement and I would like to be advised if provision has been made for this installation, which was placed in the current year's Estimates, and also for repair of the old boiler for hot-water or sterilizing purposes.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

Principal of the above-noted school has already made application for the replacement of the boiler at the institution.\n\nI have been wondering if this application for replacement was forwarded by either you or the Principal to the Department. I have had a detailed search made of the files but have been unable to locate a requisition for a boiler or any other supplies at Lytton. If the requisition has not been sent forward you might have one prepared for the use of our Purchasing Agent giving the fullest possible details. The money necessary for the purchase and installation of the boiler and the repair of the old boiler can be secured from the New England Company trust funds.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

The work can be carried out by the school engineer.\n\nAll prices quoted above are f.o.b. Lytton. Installation costs are shown but it is contemplated at this time that the school engineer and staff will attend to this without cost. No request has been received from the school to date for new smoke-pipe from the boiler to the school flues and I have no information as to the length required, but such pipe will cost approximately $2.60 per foot, f.o.b. Lytton, and I would request authority to purchase a reasonable amount to complete the installation. I would recommend that this equipment be supplied to the school and that I be advised as to purchase of same. I would point out that as steel prices are changing daily that it will be of advantage to proceed with the purchase without delay if the application is approved and that if it is not found possible to place the order almost immediately it will be necessary to allow for such fluctuations in price.\n\nWith reference to your inquiry of the 23rd ultimo, I would advise that no previous application has been submitted to the Department by this office.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI would advise that for some time past the 7 h.p. high pressure boiler at St. George's Indian Residential School in the Lytton Agency has not been giving satisfaction due to fact that it is too small for the school's requirements and had to be forced beyond its normal capacity, which has resulted in damage to the tubes, consequently the Rev. Principal has requested that he be provided with a 12 to 15 h.p. boiler. Therefore, Mr. T.J. Arnall, Boiler Inspector for the Dominion Department of Public Works, was requested to furnish specifications covering the school's requirements and tenders were called covering same, which are submitted herewith as follows:\n\n**Blaine Boiler Works**\n\nBoiler ............... $705.00  \nInstallation .......... 75.00 Total $780.00  \nTubes for old boiler $42.50\n\n**Vancouver Engineering Works**\n\nBoiler ................ $731.00  \nInstallation .......... 150.00 Total $881.00  \nTubes for old boiler $49.80\n\n**Patterson Boiler Works**\n\nBoiler ................ $770.00  \nInstallation .......... 120.00 Total $890.00  \nTubes for old boiler $46.00\n\nThe Secretary,  \nIndian Affairs Branch,  \nDepartment of Mines and Resources,  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nVancouver Iron Works ....\nVancouver Iron Works\n\nBoiler ......................... $744.00\nInstallation ...............

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nPrincipal Lett has just reported that the return condensate pipe of the heating plant at St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, B.C., is leaking and requires replacement. As the present installation runs under the cement floor and partitions for the full length of the school, repair and replacement of existing installation would involve the removal and replacement of cement flooring. This could only be done at very considerable expense. In view of this it is suggested that further use of the present pipe be discontinued and that a new exposed pipe line with condensate pump in boiler room be installed at an estimated cost of three hundred (300) dollars. In my opinion an exposed pipe line would certainly be much more desirable for a number of reasons than the replacement of the existing buried line.\n\nI would recommend the application for favorable consideration.\n\nAs the cold weather has set in it is important that steps be taken immediately to deal with the matter, and I would appreciate your instructions at an early date.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

As the present installation runs under the cement floor and partitions for the full length of the school, repair and replacement of existing installation would involve the removal and replacement of cement flooring. This could only be done at very considerable expense. In view of this it is suggested that further use of the present pipe be discontinued and that a new exposed pipe line with condensate pump in boiler room be installed at an estimated cost of three hundred (300) dollars. In my opinion an exposed pipe line would certainly be much more desirable for a number of reasons than the replacement of the existing buried line.\n\n\"I would recommend the application for favorable consideration.\n\n\"As the cold weather has set in it is important that steps be taken immediately to deal with the matter, and I would appreciate your instructions at an early date.\"\n\nOn October 14 arrangements were made to forward to you a cheque for $300.00 in order that the work recommended by Commissioner MacKay could be carried out.\n\nRev. A. R. Lett,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Indian Residential School,\nLytton, B. C.\nI am now in receipt of a letter from the Murray Plumbing & Heating Co., 1220 Seymour Street, Vancouver, B.C., in which they state that they did certain work at the St. George's School last fall and the total amount of their contract was apparently $605.59. They acknowledge having received from you $300.00 but have forwarded for our consideration copies of two letters to them dated December 12, 1939, and February 14, 1940.\n\nPlease let me know if you owe the amount claimed by the Company mentioned above. If so, it is evident that you incurred a much heavier expenditure than Indian Commissioner MacKay recommended. In that event you should let me have complete information why you did not limit the expenditure to the amount which you received; namely, $300.00. An immediate reply is requested.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

A. Hoey\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nI do not feel that the Department should be responsible for this amount as this is a matter to be adjusted by myself and The Murray Plumbing & Heating Co., and I shall be able to take care of it here. There is also a credit to the school for board and lodging to the amount of $36.00 which should show.\n\nI trust you will find the above a satisfactory report.

Hoey  \nDirector of Welfare & Training,  \nDepartment of Mines & Resources,  \nIndian Affairs Branch,  \nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAnswering yours, No:165-0-5, dated February 20/40, the cost in excess of the grant originally asked for was due to a forced change in the original plan of over-head return pipe to taking up the concrete floor and installation of box and pipe below floor level and again to the necessity of changing and re-insulating traps in different parts of the heating system. When I spoke of the excess cost of these changes, The Murray Plumbing & Heating Co., assured me that it would not be a great amount. I informed them that I had $300.00 with which to do the job.\n\nI again, when I realized that the grant was being over expended, approached Murray's man and asked him to be careful not to over-run too much as I would have to care for the extra out of school funds. I had to, eventually, take the man off before he had finished his suggested work, expecting to have Mr. Arnall, Public Works Inspector, judge whether any more work was necessary. Mr. Arnall reported no need of any extra which we could not do ourselves. In the meantime I had Mr. Murray's bill and I was very surprised at the amount and informed Mr. Murray that he would have to wait for his money and so the matter stood.\nAgent's Report on Lytton Agency for month of January 1940.\n\nSt George's Indian residential school was visited during the month and conditions on the whole appear fairly good.

The order for these tubes was based on the dimensions given by Mr. Arnall, Boiler Inspector, and the mistake is therefore not on the part of this office or the Vancouver Engineering Works Ltd., who supplied the tubes. The question of the replacement of the tubes supplied with those of the required length is being taken up with the Company.\n\nI note you will be in this city soon and I should like you to call, if convenient.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

Our order to Vancouver Engineering Works for new tubes was based on the information given by Mr. T.J. Arnall. The Reverend Principal has now reported that the tubes supplied are too short and instead of 34 inch tubes 36 inch tubes should have been provided. This Department is now confronted with the necessity of placing another order for tubes, as those supplied and which have to be paid for as the company will not accept their return, are unsuitable.\n\nIt may be that these tubes might be used in other boilers in our schools in this province, and I should appreciate information on this point from Mr. Arnall and also an explanation as to how incorrect dimensions with respect to the tubes required came to be supplied by him.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

It is an absolute mistake and it is unfortunate that they have been cut. There are no other boilers which these tubes will suit. The smallest one we have is a 34\u00bd\" tube.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"C. F. Dawson\"\nDist. Res.

There has been no suggestion that the school was responsible in any way. The expenditures in connection with this account should be met from the amount of $900 forwarded to you by the Department. School funds are not involved in this case.\n\nThe question of the return of the tubes now surplus to requirements has been taken up with the Vancouver Engineering Works Ltd., who are willing to take back these tubes and hold them until such time as an opportunity offers to dispose of them. You will therefore please arrange for the shipment of these tubes to the Vancouver Engineering Works Ltd., who supplied them. When they are sold the Company will turn over the returns of such sale to the Department.\n\nWhen the accounts are paid, the receipted bills should be forwarded to this office for submission to the Department.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

Arnall, Boiler Inspector, Department of Public Works. When these tubes were received at Lytton they were found to be two inches too short and had to be replaced by tubes of correct dimensions. The Vancouver Engineering Works supplied the tubes according to the dimensions given by Mr. Arnall.\n\nA copy of my letter to Mr. Lett explaining the matter is attached as well as copies of an exchange of correspondence with Mr. C.F. Dawson, District Resident Architect, Victoria, on the subject, for your information.\n\nThe first lot of tubes supplied were returned by Mr. Lett on instructions from this office to the Vancouver Engineering Works, who have agreed to dispose of the tubes on behalf of the Department at the first opportunity.\n\nI instructed Mr. Lett to pay for both lots of tubes out of the $900.00 supplied him by the Department as there was a sufficient balance remaining to do this.\n\nThe Vancouver Engineering Works Ltd. refused to furnish another lot of tubes in replacement at the Company's expense as\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\noriginal order was filled as per instructions received and they had no call for 34\" tubes and might not have for some considerable time.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

R. Lett, principal of St. George's Ind. Res. School, Lytton, B.C.\n\nI have each year for the last nine years supplied Mr. Lett with 150 twelve-weeks old Barred Rock pullets. I have always endeavored to send him good stock, and he has apparently always been well satisfied; our relationship, accordingly, has ever been pleasant and cordial.\n\nAt the latter part of June, this year, I forwarded the usual consignment to Mr. Lett, the price being exactly $100.00.\n\nOn July 8th, Mr. Lett wrote acknowledging receipt of the shipment in good condition, adding: \"Cheque will go forward for same during the month or first part of August.\"\n\nUp to present date, the cheque mentioned has never been received. Since first September I have written...\nHazelbank Poultry Farm\nProduction-Bred Barred Rocks\nSpecializing in Pedigreed Eggs and Stock\nJames Lambie, Prop.\nR.R. 1 Aldergrove, B.C.\n\nthree times to Mr. Lett regarding the matter, but can get no reply from him. (Am enclosing copy of my third letter to Mr. Lett.)\n\nConfidentially, I am of the opinion that Mr. Lett issued the cheque as he advised would be done, and that none of my letters have ever reached him.\n\nI expect that whoever may be intercepting my letters will also know what became of the cheque that was intended to pay for the consignment of pullets.\n\nMy hearing is not sufficiently acute to carry on a conversation over the telephone, otherwise I would have tried to get Mr. Lett over \"long distance\".\n\nSo, I could think of no other alternative to enlisting your aid in straightening out this matter.\n\nTrusting you will do what you can as soon as possible, and thanking you in anticipation.\n\nI am,\nYours sincerely,\n\nJas. Lambie\nHazelbank Poultry Farm\nProduction-Bred Barred Rocks\nSpecializing in Pedigreed Eggs and Stock\nJames Lambie, Prop.\nR.R. 1 Aldergrove, B.C.\n\nOctober 4, 1940\n\nRev. A. R. Lott,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Lott,\n\nI wrote to you first week of Sept., with regard to the fact that I had not received cheque for the pullets I shipped to you latter part of June, and reminding you that your letter of July 8th stated that cheque will go forward during this month or first part of August.\n\nAs no reply was received to my letter of early September, I wrote to you again in similar strain, on Sept 17th, and surmising that probably my letter & your reply had gone astray in the mail, I forwarded my second letter under registered cover.\n\nTwo weeks have passed, and still there is no acknowledgment, and it seems futile for me to attempt further to obtain an accounting of our transaction by the usual methods of corresponding. Accordingly, if there is no response to this letter within seven days, I intend to state my case to the Department at Ottawa, as I consider I am entitled to some consideration in this matter.\n\nHoping I may hear from you by return mail, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJas. Lambie\nOttawa,\nOctober 21, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant in which you advise that the St. George's Indian Residential School owes you an amount of $100.00.\n\nI am writing to the Principal today directing him to give this matter immediate attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Jas. Lambie,\nHazelbank Poultry Farm,\nR.R. #1,\nAldergrove, B.C.\nOttawa,\nOctober 21, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Mr. Jas. Lambie, owner of the Hazelbank Poultry Farm, in which he states that he supplied you early last spring with 100 pullets at a cost of $100.00. He further advises that although he has written to you on several occasions since that time he has received no reply and the account is still unpaid.\n\nIf Mr. Lambie's account is in order you should issue cheque immediately. At the same time you should advise the Department why you have delayed the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. A.R. Lett,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Residential School,\nLytton, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. Indian Agent Strang has applied for the following fire fighting equipment for St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton:\n\n1 only 50 ft. length 2\" Cotton Rubber Lined Hose\n1 only male Half Expansion Ring Coupling 2\"\n2 only 50 ft. lens. 2\u00bd\" Cotton Rubber Lined Hose\n1 only female Half Expansion Ring Coupling 2\u00bd\"\n\nThe cost of these items, including attaching expansion ring couplings to the hose, is $101.55.\n\nThe equipment is only available at the moment at Gordon & Belyea Limited, Vancouver. I would recommend approval of the application and would appreciate the Department's decision at an early date.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 17, 1941.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 11th instant you may purchase the fire fighting equipment for the St. George's Indian Residential School. It is noted that you can secure this material at a cost of $101.55. Payment of the account can be made from school funds and when the new Principal, Mr. Hives, arrives at the school he can review the financial situation and, if necessary, we will forward an additional amount from New England Company funds.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOctober 2, 1941.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. N. Stewart, Acting Principal of St. George's Indian Residential School, informs me that the problem of clothing for the boys and girls is a very pressing one as no clothes were ordered for them for this term, and their present clothing is practically in rags.\n\nOn the occasion of Inspector Barry's visit, Miss Jobling, the matron, and the Acting Principal discussed the matter with him and he thought it advisable that quotations be obtained on the actual cost of refitting each child with the necessary clothing for the present term.\n\nThese figures are now available. The complete outfit for the girls will amount to approximately $407.68 and for the boys, $328.00.\n\nMr. Stewart states that the question of dining room utensils is an urgent one. All utensils are apparently in poor condition and to replace them would require approximately $178.45.\n\nI should be glad to receive authority to proceed with the purchase of the clothing required at the school. With reference to the dining room utensils, I may say that I consider the purchase of such articles might well be left until the new Principal has taken charge of the school.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe St. George's Indian Residential School.\n\nI have received a letter from the Reverend Mr. Hives, newly appointed Principal of St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, requesting the purchase of muresco and kalsomine brushes to carry out certain redecorating of the Principal's residence at the school. I purchased the materials, with the exception of the kalsomine brushes, and had same shipped to the school in care of Mr. Stewart, requesting that the instructions issued by Mr. Hives with respect to the decorating be carried out. I hesitated about the purchase of three kalsomine brushes in view of the excessive cost of a good quality brush for this purpose and in case some brushes might be available at the school to do the necessary work. If there were none available at the school suitable for the work I suggested to Mr. Stewart that he endeavor to purchase a brush locally.\n\nI should appreciate being advised if it is the Department's wish that applications of this kind be first submitted to the Department for approval. I may say that I anticipate that Mr. Hives will wish to purchase new furnishings, etc., for the residence and possibly other items for the school immediately on his arrival here and I should like to know what provision has been made to meet expenditures of this kind. An early reply would be appreciated.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nOctober 6, 1941.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letters of the 29th ultimo and 2nd instant with reference to the St. George's Indian Residential School. You may purchase the quantity of kalsomine and brushes that you consider necessary.\n\nWhen Mr. Hives arrives at the coast you should purchase the furniture which you believe should be supplied for the Principal's residence. It is understood, of course, that reasonably priced furniture will be secured and no unnecessary expenditure incurred.\n\nYou may also purchase the clothing for the boys and girls and the dining room utensils. It is noted that the total cost of these will be approximately $913.00.\n\nIf there are any other small articles which you consider should be supplied at the present time authority is granted for your securing them. With reference to any other request made to you by the Principal you may use your own judgment as we wish Mr. Hives to commence work under as favourable auspices as possible.\n\nWhen you have made the purchases authorized in this letter you should forward me a list of them showing the total amount involved. We will then issue a cheque to the school from New England Company funds and all the accounts can then be paid by the school Principal.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.M.

Consequently it will not be possible to consider further payments from this trust fund for some time.\n\nThere is another side to the matter which should be discussed frankly with Mr. Hives at the earliest possible opportunity. He himself has stated in a letter, and the Department feels that this is the case, namely, that it should be possible to finance the operations of the St. George's Residential School on the per capita grant and the receipts from the farm. We do not want Mr. Hives to reach the position where he feels he must look around for possible avenues of expenditure in order to use the amount provided by the New England Company. We wish to treat the payments from the New England Company as a trust fund which should be used sparingly and only when some necessity arises.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nYou should, of course, make the purchase from the Alberta Lumber Company and have the Company forward the bill to the Principal. As stated above, funds for the purpose are being sent to him.\n\nSince writing the above it has occurred to me that the construction of tables for the children's dining room might well be considered a vocational training project. Might I suggest that you discuss this with Inspector Barry with a view to having the work done in the manner suggested and thus effect a saving.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMar. 14, 1942\n\nController of Supplies,\nDept. of Munitions & Supplies,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWill you kindly inform me if it is possible for me to buy two tires for my car (650, 16 x 6 ply).\n\nThe above school is operated by the Department of Mines & Resources. The car, for which I require the tires is my own, but it is used entirely in the discharge of my duties in connection with the School.\n\nWe have a school car, but I don't consider it to be reliable to drive over mountain roads. My work makes it necessary for me to drive my car.\n\nShould you require further information, I would be very much obliged if you would communicate with Mr. R. A. Heay, Supt. of Welfare & Training, Indian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nAn early reply would oblige.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nDear Mr Hoey:\n\nThe enclosed copy speaks for itself, and I would be very much obliged if you could help with the matter.\n\nThe school car is in terrible shape, and we cannot afford to do very much with it. I have just had the School Station Wagon, or \"Bus\", as we call it, repaired. The enclosed copy of statement of repairs will show you how badly it was in need of repairs. There is also a bill for four new tires for same ($35.00). Everything is the same here. Nothing has been taken care of.\n\nOur Refrigeration plant, which is an old obsolete Ammonia one is out of commission. I had an expert look it over the other day, and he said it was not worth fixing up. It is an important part of our equipment, for the weather, they tell me gets very hot here, and the flies are very bad. I can buy a seven and half feet by nine feet refrigerator, just taken out of a Safeway's store, with new unit for $25.00 installed in a room of our main building. This would be a tremendous asset to our work, and if there is money in New England Company funds, I do not know of any better use to which it could be put. Please do not think I have an idea that the New England Company fund is inexhaustible, but if it could be provided, I feel it should be.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr R.A.Hoey,\nSupt. Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nMarch 21, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI attach, for your information, a copy of a letter just received from the Principal of the St. George's Indian Residential School. I also enclose the account of Vancouver Motors Limited which he forwarded for our consideration.\n\nI desire to direct your special attention to the last paragraph of the Principal's letter in regard to the refrigeration plant. I should appreciate having your comments on this letter, having in mind the contents of official letter of January 26 last.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nYour File 165-0-5\n\nI have received your letter of March 21 enclosing a copy of a letter from Reverend C. Hives, Principal of St. Georges, Lytton, in which application is made for assistance to pay for certain repairs to the school station wagon and authority to purchase a second-hand refrigerator recently removed from the Safeway's Store, at a cost of $525.00.\n\nThese matters were discussed with Mr. Hives on Monday last, at which time I expressed the opinion that the Department would in all probability expect him, if at all possible, to pay the Vancouver Motor's account from school funds but that I felt some assistance might be forthcoming from the Department with respect to the purchase of a suitable refrigerator.\n\nThe price of the second-hand unit referred to by Mr. Hives is $575.00, not $525.00 as stated in his letter. This refrigerator is 7'x8'x3', (inside measurements) and according to Mr. Hives is almost new and would fully meet the requirements of the school. There is no doubt that a suitable refrigerator is necessary for a school the size of St. Georges and should be provided. In view of the existing conditions, it is doubtful if a new unit similar to the one supplied to the Alberni School could be obtained completely installed for less than $1,000.00.\n15th April, 1942.\n\nUnder the circumstances, I feel that the Department might favourably consider meeting half the cost of the second-hand unit available, the balance to be paid from school funds.\n\nAn early reply would be appreciated.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

Careful consideration has been given to the contents of your letter and it has been decided to forward a cheque for $525.00 to the Principal from New England Company funds.\n\nI believe it is only fair to point out to the Principal that on July 9, 1941, the balance in the New England Company fund, for use at the St. George's Indian Residential School, was $8,710.36. Today it is $1,415.86 and when the cheque for $525.00 is issued there will only be a nominal balance of $890.86.\n\nWhile I realize that the major portion of the expenditure in the last three months was made in order to cover the deficits incurred by the preceding Principal, and consequently the present condition of the fund is not wholly due to requests received from Mr. Hives, at the same time I feel that his attention should be again directed to the third paragraph of my letter of January 26 last.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nApril 16, 1942\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn relation to the matter of Refrigeration plant for our school, I have this information to submit to you. The Domino Electric Co. of Vancouver, have a box, 7 ft. by 8 ft. by 8 ft., which they have recently taken from a Safeway store. This box is in good condition; properly constructed with walls filled with genuine cork. It is also fitted with racks and shelves. The unit is new, and is an Adams-Campbell make. They would install this at a total cost of $575.00.\n\nI do not think we would be making any mistake by buying this. In fact, I think it is a very good bargain, especially as the unit is new, and has never been used.\n\nIn the matter of payment, I think we could manage half the price if the Department would take half. We really require it, and to have it installed in the building would be a great convenience and saving.\n\nThe Domino Electric will hold the outfit for a week, pending more information from us. I would be very much obliged if you would correspond with Ottawa over the matter by air mail.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nMajor D.M. McKay,\nCommissioner of Indians for B.C.\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to my letter of the 15th instant, with reference to the installation of the Refrigeration Unit at St. George's Indian Residential School, I enclose herewith a letter dated the 16th instant received from Reverend Mr. Hives giving further details of the refrigerator mentioned by him in previous correspondence.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor D.

Particularly in regard to main doors from girls and boys quarters. These doors are made of wood frames and V joint, and are in a very bad state of repairs. I am enclosing a list of what we require, and would be very much obliged if this could be procured quite soon, so that the work could be done before holidays. The biggest of our boys who have taken their training in the Manual Department will be leaving for good, and these boys are quite able to do much of the repair work if we have the material.\n\nThe work on the dining tables and benches for the children's dining room is proceeding satisfactorily but we short ordered on material for benches, and require fourteen pieces of 1\u00bd inch fir. 12 ft. by 12 inches to finish the job. I am therefore including this with the enclosed requisition.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nA. Strang Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nLytton, B.C.

GEORGE'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\n(COPY)\n\nLytton, B.C.\n\nJune 22, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs you are aware, the Junior Classroom of our school has been carried on under the Chapel, and in the Winter time, it is most unsatisfactory on account of the difficulty of heating. I tried to improve matters last Winter by putting in an auxiliary heater, but it was not satisfactory, owing to the difficulty of disposing of the smoke, which generally all came back into the room, causing the children to do a great deal of unnecessary weeping.\n\nWhile the Commissioner was here last week, I pointed out the matter to him and also recommended that we should use part of the Manual Training shop building. By moving a wall, which is a single board affair, about two feet into the Manual Training shop room, we would have an excellent classroom. This would have to be properly finished off inside, but when finished, we should have a room, in every way superior to the present situation.\n\nI would then propose to re-establish the steam heating system which is still in the Manual Training building, and which has not been used for some years.\n\nI am enclosing a list of material, which would be required for this work, as well as for sealing in the whole of the Manual Training shop, which has never been finished, and which is thereby a serious handicap in the proper conducting of the classes.\n\nWill you kindly place this matter before the Department, so that we may, if possible, have the work done before the beginning of next term. We can do all the work ourselves, and I assure you it will be a great improvement in the present system.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"Chas. F. Hives\"\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. A. Strang,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith copy of a letter from Reverend C.F. Hives, Principal, St. George's, Lytton, recommending that the practice of using the basement of the Chapel as a classroom be discontinued, and suggesting the alteration of the west end of the manual training building for use as a classroom instead.\n\nWhile at the school on June 18th, I looked into this matter and consider the change suggested by Mr. Hives should be carried out. The materials required for altering the section of the manual training building suitable for classroom purposes will cost approximately $263.00. The labour required will be done by the manual training instructor and some of the older Indian boys who decided to accept the offer of employment at the school during the summer holidays.\n\nThe Chapel basement has never been satisfactory as a classroom. It is poorly lighted, impossible to heat the place satisfactorily, and quite unsuitable in other ways.\n\nI would recommend approval of the application, and, as it is the wish to carry out the work during the vacation period, an early reply would be appreciated.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nDear Sir:\n\nI would like to do some painting in various parts of the main building. Particularly the dining rooms, playrooms and kitchen. We can do the work ourselves if we have the paint.\n\nWould you kindly place this matter before the Department, and if possible to obtain from them a sanction to buy twenty gallons of good paint.\n\nThere are also places in the basement floor, which require repairing. This should also be done while the pupils are away. We would require ten sacks of cement for this work.\n\nAlso there are many places in the walls, where plaster has fallen off. Particularly in the boys' playroom. This should also be repaired, and would require six sacks of wall plaster. We can do the work ourselves if we have the material.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nMr A. Strang,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith an application from the Reverend C. F. Hives for materials to carry out certain improvements in the main building of St. George's Indian Residential School, at a cost of approximately $93.00, plus freight from Vancouver to Lytton.\n\nThe work proposed by the Principal is necessary if the building is to be properly maintained and I would recommend that the purchase of the necessary materials be approved.\n\nAlthough the Department has been called upon in the past two years to expend a considerable sum on St. George's, it has been almost entirely in connection with the payment of outstanding accounts incurred by the former principal and not on improvements to the School.\n\nThe walls of the play-rooms are badly in need of repair and the painting required is necessary to prevent further deterioration and increased costs of maintenance.\n\nThere is much evidence that the former Principal could not have been greatly interested in the maintenance and care of the School property, with the result that there is a great deal to do now, which would not be necessary if a certain amount of repair work and improvements had been done each year. The need for repairs and improvements is much greater at Lytton than at any of our Residential Schools in B.C., with the possible exception of Sechelt.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M.

The new road will, in every way be an improvement on the old one. We have been very fortunate in securing the help of the Department of Highways, and the road is \"roughed\" out, and will soon be in good shape.\n\nIt will have to be fenced, and should have a good looking one, well built and with decent looking posts. We have the wire, but we need the posts. I can buy rejected railroad ties, which are 5\" x 10\" and eight feet long, for twenty-five cents each. These would make excellent posts if they are dressed on the part which would be underground. I would like to buy two hundred of these, if the Department would kindly allow us fifty dollars for that purpose.\n\nWill you kindly place this matter before the Commissioner.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr A.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Mr Hoey:\n\nIt is my unpleasant duty to report to you a fire, which occurred yesterday, and which destroyed our pig house, along with twenty-two pigs, most of which were ready for the butcher. It is a big loss to us, and one which must be replaced as soon as possible.\n\nWith the help of the entire staff and the boys, we were able to save the barns, but we had great difficulty in doing so, and we had to work very hard and constantly all afternoon until evening. There was a high wind blowing, as there generally is here, and the building was only about sixty feet from the barns. Had the wind turned a little, we could never have saved them. We seldom ever get any rain in this part of the country, and so the wooden structures are ready to explode into flame as soon as they come into contact with fire.\n\nThe fire was no doubt caused by a spark from the feed cooker, located in the building. This source of fire hazard should never have existed, but like a lot of other foolish ideas, which have been allowed to exist here, it was not adjusted in time.\n\nIt is a very serious loss to us. Especially the loss of the pigs, which were ready to help out in food and revenue. In many respects, the removal of the building is a good thing. For although it was an expensive one, it was much too near the main school building, and was therefore a nuisance in respect to sanitation. It bred swarms of flies, and produced terrible odours. Also it was not conveniently built.\n\nIt will cost one thousand dollars to replace it, and I would like to build a properly constructed pig house, conveniently and in safe proximity to the main\nbuilding. We can do all the work ourselves if we have the material. The biggest part of which would be the cost of cement.\n\nI would urgently recommend that the sum of up to one thousand dollars be spent for this purpose if that sum is available.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr R.A.

We have been reminded recently by the Purchasing Division that certain supplies, including building materials, are becoming increasingly difficult to secure. It is my hope, therefore, that you will experience no difficulty in securing the supplies necessary for the construction of the new building.\n\nI am sending forward a cheque for $1,000.00 from the funds contributed by the New England Company and you are authorized to proceed with the construction of the building. It is scarcely necessary to emphasize that the cost of the building itself should be kept down to the lowest possible figure.

Quite frequently, when pupils are ill, and the doctor finds it difficult to diagnose, the milk is blamed; although our cows are well and carefully looked after, and our milk is carefully taken care of.

The cost of this installed would be not more than one thousand dollars, and would have a capacity of fifty gallons, which amount would be sufficient for this institution. If the cost of this had to be taken from the New England Company funds, I do not know of any better way of using it at the present time.

Hives, Reverend Principal of the St. George's Indian Residential School, in which he requests assistance to the extent of $1,000.00 for the installation of a milk pasteurization system, which he discussed with Dr. Moore during his recent visit from Ottawa.\n\nWith reference to the item of a request for an advance from the Special Grant of $10.00 per capita pupils for the year 1942, I would recommend that this be forwarded in order to enable Mr. Hives to purchase his fuel supply at a cost of $1400.00 as the fuel situation in British Columbia is very difficult and uncertain. This, of course, is presuming that the grant was made as stated by Mr. Hives.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa,\nMay 22, 1943.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to a request of the Principal of the St. George's Indian Residential School for an amount of $1000.00 to install a milk pasteurization system. While I agree that such installations may be very desirable, at the same time it is difficult to understand why the Principal should decide to install one this year when both material and labour for such installations are needed for more necessary purposes. It might be presumed that the Principal is just looking for another method of spending the grant made by the New England Company and I should appreciate your again reminding him that there is no assurance that this payment is going to continue indefinitely. The Principal should review this matter very carefully and, if he still feels that it is absolutely necessary to make this installation, another letter can be sent for our consideration.\n\nWith reference to the second paragraph of your letter, a special grant at the rate of $10.00 per capita was paid from the appropriation for Indian education to all Indian residential schools for the year 1942. You were advised regarding this payment in circular letter dated March 26, 1943. However, no such payment was made either to the Mohawk Institute at Brantford, Ont., or the St. George's Indian Residential School at Lytton, B.C. Both of these schools are specially favoured by receiving payments from New England Company funds and consequently the special grant was not paid to either of them. With regard to the St. George's School, an amount of $4,575.00 was paid from New England Company\nfunds during the year 1942. I understand, of course, that some of this amount was in connection with the old debts but, with the amount provided for these deducted, the Principal received very substantial financial assistance and, as a matter of fact, a great deal more than any other Indian residential school in Canada.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nRev. C. F. Hives,\nPrincipal\n\nJune 14, 1943\nLytton, B.C.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nCommissioner for B.C. Indians,\nVancouver.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSometime ago I received a letter from the Director saying that the Residential Schools would be receiving a Special per capita Grant of ten dollars for the year 1942. On applying for this grant, I was informed that St. George's School, along with another were excepted, because they receive financial help from the New England Company.\n\nMy reason for applying for this Special per capita Grant at this time was to buy our supply of fuel for next Winter. We are being urged to do this, and warned of the difficulties we may encounter if we are not prepared with our fuel situation. I am very anxious to secure our supply.\n\nFuel prices have advanced $5% during the past year along with pretty well everything else, including salaries and wages. But fuel is something we cannot do without.\n\nA car load of coal cost approximately $375.00 by the time it is in our bins. We require four car loads, and I would like to secure it as soon as possible. One car load arrived a few days ago, and I expect another one shortly.\n\nWill you kindly state our case to Ottawa, and recommend that a cheque for the amount of $1500.00 be sent to us for the purpose of buying fuel for next Winter. And that this amount be taken from the New England Company funds. If required, I will forward receipted accounts showing that the amount is actually used for the purpose of buying our fuel supply.\n\nBelieve me, sir, I would not apply for this if I did not think it absolutely necessary. But in view of\nthe warnings we have received, and the serious situation of last Winter, makes it imperative that we secure our supply as soon as possible. And also, in view of the advanced cost of living, I find it extremely difficult to meet our financial obligations on the per capita grant.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nReplying to your letter of the 22nd ultimo, file 165-0-5\u2014which deals in part with the purchase of fuel for St. George's Indian Residential School from New England funds, I would advise that the contents of this letter were conveyed to Reverend Principal Hives but, apparently, he is still under the impression he should be assisted from this source in the purchase of fuel to the extent of $1500.00 for the coming winter as set out in his letter of the 14th, enclosed herewith.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\nOttawa,\nJune 23, 1943.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th\ninstant, it has been decided to forward a cheque\nfor $1500.00 from New England Company funds to\nthe Principal of the St. George's Indian\nResidential School.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nRev. C. F. Hives,\nPrincipal\n\nJune 17, 1943\nLytton, B.C.\n\nMr A. Strang,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nA few years ago, a small frame building was constructed, for the purpose of accommodating the cannery equipment. The building was very poorly constructed, and had there been a fairly heavy fall of snow during any winter since its construction, would, no doubt have caved in. It was built near to the electric light and power transformer. In fact, in order to save the trouble of moving the transformer, the roof of the building was made very flat, and the transformer lodges against and on the roof.\n\nThis creates a hazard, which has been pointed out to me by electricians as a very serious one. The building is convenient to the boys' playground, and boys have a propensity for climbing on building, even though they are punished for doing so a dozen times in a day. This they do, and I am afraid they will one day play around with the transformer, and either be electrocuted or cause serious damage.\n\nThis hazard could be eliminated by pulling down the poorly built cannery, and erecting another in close proximity, but a safe distance from the transformer. Mr Coleman, Inspector from the Vancouver office was here yesterday and took a snap shot of the situation.\n\nTo pull down and reconstruct this building would cost approximately two hundred dollars. We could do the work ourselves as part of the Manual training programme, but we should require extra material.\n\nWill you kindly recommend that this matter be looked after.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nRev. C. F. Hives,\nPrincipal\n\nJuly 24, 1943\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Mr Strang:\n\nThe enclosed is a list of material required for the rebuilding of the cannery. On account of the building being so poorly constructed in the first place, not very much material can be salvaged fit for using on another building. We have, however, made an estimate of what we think can be salvaged, and the enclosed list is supplement to that estimate.\n\nThe work will be done entirely by the Manual Training class in the Autumn, and will be good workmanship throughout.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nChas.

I enclose herewith in this regard, a letter with accompanying list of material from the Rev. Hives, and would respectfully recommend that the Principal's request receive the favourable consideration of your Office.\n\nA. Strang,\nIndian Agent.\n\nMM.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Strang's letter of the 29th instant together with that of the Reverend Principal Hives of St. George's Indian Residential School of the 24th instant and 17th ultimo requesting authority to expend $175.00 for the reconstruction of a small building mostly used in connection with the canning of fruit and vegetables.\n\nThe present building was constructed so close to an electric light and power transformer that a part of the overhanging eaves of the low built roof of this building was cut around the transformer which is reported by Mr. Strang to be carrying a current of 2350 volts. The low end of the roof is about eight feet from the ground and with boy pupils playing around the pole, there is always danger that one of them might climb the roof and come in contact with the input wires of the transformer with fatal results.\n\nIf the building is reconstructed, it would be moved away from its present location and this hazard would be overcome. If funds can be provided for this purpose, I would recommend approval of the application but consider that in any case steps should be taken by the school to remove the present risk.\n\nFor D.M.

There is a considerable length of small wooden flumes and a number of wood pipes across fields, roadways, etc. All require some repairs. It is not believed that the bill of material contained in Mr. Hives request of November 15 is excessive and that it all could be usefully employed except possibly the creosote which is not necessary. Mr. Warren suggested that Mr. Hives order 200 lbs of Barrett's plastic elastigum and 50 lbs. of ships oakum for repairing leaky flume joints; also that additional supports be provided for the flume boxes, that is, a 12' or 14' flume box should have a support on the middle as well as both ends. It is thought that the lumber can be secured from the local sawmill.\n\nA full report on the irrigation system will be forwarded at an early date. The information contained herein is substantially the same as will appear in the report to be submitted and is offered now in order not to delay unduly the securing of the necessary materials.\n\nThe work of repairs could readily be undertaken by the school authorities as has been done in the past and at much less cost for labour than would be the case if supervision of this service should be required.\n\nG.E. Webb\nDistrict Chief Engineer\nPer: W. C. Warren.\nRev. C. F.

The wooden pipes are in very bad shape, and the flumes which water the various fields and garden are decayed. I would like to do as much as possible in the matter of making new flumes during the winter; and much of the pipe could be replaced also.\n\nWe require four hundred feet of wooden pipe, costing $60.00 per one hundred feet. 3000 Sq.ft of flume lumber at $56.00 per m. 2 kegs nails $0.00 40 gals creosote $6.00. 1000 ft 2 x 4 lumber for supports for flumes.

Mr. Inspector McArthur urged me to get these chairs in order that we might have a Kindergarten room equip't. We have made the tables in the Manual Training shop. Mr. McArthur assured me that I would be able to purchase the chairs from Moyers for $1.75 each. The cheapest I could buy them for in Vancouver was $2.25 each. I therefore felt justified in sending to Moyers. When the invoice arrived I found they are of very good quality, and priced at $4.05 each. Mr. McArthur wrote later on and said he had made a mistake in the firm, or rather he gave me the wrong name of the firm.\n\nDo you think you could get the Department to pay for these chairs? If it is going to embarrass you in any way, I will look after paying for them. But they really should be the Department's responsibility; and the inspector was so insistent in urging us to secure them as soon as possible.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(SGD) Chas. F.

I phoned the Purchasing Branch this morning and they have asked for quotations on the 180 mattresses for the school, but have not yet placed the order.

Strang,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have several important jobs that should be attended to immediately, but which will entail a cost of approximately $1,000.00.\n\nNearly three years ago, our Pig house was destroyed by fire. The Department allowed us $1,000.00 from the New England Company funds to replace this building. Owing to the difficulty of securing competent labour, the work of rebuilding has been slow. But what we have done is of excellent workmanship, and has been done entirely by the Manual Training class under the supervision of the Manual Training Instructor. The building is 28ft. x 50ft. It has good substantial walls built to a height of four ft., and cement floor. Above the cement is a shiplap lumber wall on 2 x 6 studding. The roof rafters are 2 x 6 and No. 1 cedar shingles. We require more lumber for siding and lining. Also paint to finish off this building. I reckon the cost will be $400.00 for the material.\n\nWe also require 2,000 cedar posts to replace that number required on the farm. These will cost $300.00. We also require some good wire fencing and gates to the amount of about $300.00.\n\nI would be very much obliged if you would present to the Department a request for $1,000.00, if possible from the New England Company funds.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nLYTTON, B.C.

Apparently this amount was not sufficient and a further $400.00 will be required to complete the structure. The balance of $600.00 is required for fence posts and wire fencing.

Mackay, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of\nthe 26th ultimo, arrangements are being made\nto forward a cheque for $1000.00 from the New\nEngland Company funds as requested by the\nReverend Principal of the St. George's Indian\nResidential School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Sir:\n\nWill you kindly give consideration to the following recommendations, and forward the same on to the Department. They represent some of our most urgent needs; and if there are sufficient funds in the New England Grant to pay for these, I do not know of any better way of spending the money.\n\nSwimming Pool: You can bear me out when I say that during the Summer this is a very hot place. Yet there is no natural safe swimming place nearer than fifty miles away. Years ago a small valley was dammed up with cement, in which the boys spent many delightful hours; but the cement has given way, and the swimming hole has disappeared. I would like to put this place into proper repair again. In fact, with a little more work than was put into it before, this place could be made into a very good swimming pond for the pupils. We should require 300 sacks of cement. This would cost, including freight, $350.00.\n\nDairy: At the present time, we have a building used as a dairy, situated near to the cow barn. The Herdman with the boys attend to the care of the milk, making butter, and washing dairy equipment. In spite of all the care we may exercise, Indian boys are not to be trusted in the safe and sanitary handling of dairy equipment, and the disposal of milk. Since coming to Lytton, I have noticed that although nearly all these Indians have cows, very few ever milk cows, or use cows' milk. If they use milk at all, it is the canned article from the store. I think it is a great pity, for the pupils must miss it greatly during vacation time, or after they are discharged from school; for they have it three times a day while they are here in school. I would like to change our system, and provide for a position of Dairy Maid Supervisor, who should teach the girls the Dairy business; so that after the boys have done the milking, the milk is delivered to the dairy, and the Dairy Maid Supervisor then take charge of it; teaching the girls how to make butter and cheese. If this were done, I feel sure the girls would then carry on after they leave school in their own homes. We\nshould require a properly constructed Dairy located near to the main building, so that it would be convenient for the girls, and also could be connected with the steam pipe from the high pressure steam boiler. I estimate that this would cost $1,200. It should be constructed of cement, and if funds would allow, have the inside walls lined with white tile. The Manual Instructor would look after the construction of the building with his class of boys.\n\nIrrigation pipe: We have to depend entirely on irrigation for the watering of our crops and pastures. A considerable amount of wood pipe was laid underground for the purpose of conveying the water. This pipe has become decayed, with the result that some of the fields are becoming useless. Wood pipe, such as is used, is bought for 72\u00a2s per foot. I would like to put in 600 ft. this fall. This would mean an expenditure of $450.00.\n\nPlayground equipment. This part of the school life is very important; for the pupils must make this their home, and we want them to be happy. We could help in this matter if we could spend $400.00 on new equipment.\n\nRepairs to cars and trucks: During the war years, very little has been done to vehicles. I am not asking for any new ones, but I would like to have our truck, station wagon and car put into good repair. We should require $1,000.00 for this purpose.\n\nWill you please place this matter before the Department as soon as possible, so that we may get to work on looking after these things in the near future. I have looked over the estimates made above very carefully; and I assure you that we would do our best to use all money to the best advantage.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. A.

Mr. Hives, Principal of the St. George's Residential School. I enclose, for your information, a copy of the latter letter.\n\nYou will note that Rev. Mr. Hives requests an amount of $3,400.00 from the funds provided by the New England Company.\n\nFor your personal information I may say that at the present time there is an amount of $4,488.00 in this Trust Account. Consequently, we can handle the whole expenditure recommended by Mr. Hives.\n\nHowever, I am not exactly satisfied that all the expenditures requested by the Principal are justified at the present time. I would therefore appreciate it if you would consider his letter and let me have your recommendation.\n\nEncl.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nYour File 165-0-5\nSt. George's Indian Res. School\n\nI have to refer to your letter of June 25th regarding the application submitted by Reverend Principal Hives for an advance of $3400 from the funds of the New England Company for the purposes set out in his letter to Mr. Indian Agent Strang of June 18th last, to which you have referred. This matter has been discussed at length with both Mr. Hives and Mr. Indian Agent Strang and I am satisfied that provision should be made for the following expenditures:\n\n| Item                  | Amount |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| Dairy Building        | $1200  |\n| Playground            | 400    |\n| Repairs to the cars   | 1000   |\n| Swimming Pool         | 350    |\n| **Total**             | **$2950** |\n\nThe above estimates are only roughly approximate.\n\nThe purchase of irrigation pipe could be held over for another year as replacement this year does not appear necessary.\n\nIt would be appreciated if the necessary funds could be forwarded to Mr. Hives as soon as possible in order that the work in connection with these projects may be put underway well before the commencement of the new school term.\n\nD.M.

I understand from him that he has discussed the contents of the Principal's letter both with Mr. Hives and yourself and the Department now approves the following expenditures:\n\n- Dairy Building $1200.00\n- Playground $400.00\n- Repairs to the cars $1000.00\n- Swimming Pool $350.00\n\nTotal: $2950.00\n\nWe will forward the cheque to the Principal for $2950.00 from the New England Company Fund.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nLytton Agency\n\nAGENT'S REPORT FOR THE QUARTER ENDING DECEMBER 31st 1945.\n\nSt. George's Indian Residential School: Various visits to the above school reveal that it has been, as usual, ably managed during the recent quarter. The Reverend Principal is experiencing great difficulty in making ends meet financially and the writer has recommended his application for a further grant of $2000.00 with which to make repairs and replacements within the building and on the farm.\n\nAttendance at the school has very nearly reached the maximum. The recent release of several pupils from the Boothroyd Indian Day School and their subsequent admission to the St. George's school will bring the attendance to the maximum. The recent admission of several Indian pupils from Hazelton, B.C., all of whom appear to be of excellent character, will no doubt serve to promote a degree of rivalry among the pupils from local areas.\n\nThe Reverend Principal of the school has lately managed to secure four young men of apparently good ability for his teaching staff. One of these, the farm manager is a man of excellent ability, having previously had charge of the school farm for some years.\n\nA.

Over a month ago the hot water jacket ceased to function on account of the alkaline deposit filling up the channels in the jacket heater. It seems impossible to avoid this trouble under the circumstances; and when it happens, the jacket heater bursts and becomes useless. After this happened, in order to supply the building with hot water, we had to connect the high pressure steam boiler with a coil in the tank. This did effectual work until two days ago, when the flues in the boiler leaked so badly, we had to discontinue. We are now heating the water by means of one of the low pressure boilers used for heating the building. This method is unsatisfactory, slow and harmful to the system.\n\nWe have a low pressure steam boiler, not in use, and standing, dismantled, under the Manual Shop. This boiler was at one time used for heating the Chapel and the building it is now in; but owing to the fact of it being expensive to maintain, hot air furnaces were installed in the Chapel and the Manual Shop. I have been told by the Provincial Engineer that this boiler could be used for the purpose of supplying hot water through the main building, by installing it in the boiler room of the main building, and connecting it with the steam coil in the water tank. This would necessitate buying a pump to force the condensate water back into the boiler. It is important that this should be done in order to avoid the alkaline deposit forming in the boiler. There would also be required certain fittings and aquastat control. I have made careful inquiries regarding these extras, and in all the cost would not exceed $400.00. We would do all the work of installing the system.\n\nLast December, I engaged a young man as Manual\nInstructor. This young man had just recently been discharged from the army, where he had been Carpenter Instructor for three years. He had recently been married, and his wife is now holding a teachership on my staff, where she is doing excellent work. I am very anxious indeed to hold these young people, as they are both desirable acquisition to the life of this institution. But, in order to that, they must have a home to live in. We have several cottages for the married people. The one they will have to occupy is unfit to live in. The inside of the building has no lining on the studding. To finish it off will require 4000 ft. of shiplap, and 2000 ft. of finishing material. Also a sink, some plumbing, and electric wiring. The total cost for this material would be $340.00. We can do the work, but we have not funds to buy the material.\n\nOur water main is a wood pipe, and is one thousand feet in length and six inches in diameter. We have had to replace three sections of this pipe during the last two years. It is leaking in numerous places, and appears as if the pipe line is in a state of collapse, and should be renewed as soon as possible. I asked for and received prices of six inch wood pipe from the manufacturers yesterday. The price is 64.50 per 100 ft. If pressure creosoted, as they recommend it would be 10.50 extra. I understand that this process doubles the life of the pipe.\n\nWill you kindly place these important matters before the Department at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. A.

Hives' requests appear practical as well as necessary for the proper running of the school I would respectfully recommend that they receive early and favourable consideration.\n\nA. Strang,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI am forwarding Mr. Indian Agent Strang's letter of March 15th, and a letter of the same date from Rev. C.F. Hives, Principal of the St. Georges Indian Residential School, in connection with the Domestic Hot Water Heating system, proposed replacement of the water main to the school, and an expenditure of approximately $340.00 for completing a cottage for two of the staff. The Surveys Engineering Branch have been requested to investigate the matter of the Domestic Hot Water supply system and it is thought that the question of completing the cottage can be dealt with in the new fiscal year when it is known what funds are available for improvements and repairs to this school.\n\nFor D.M.

Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, enclosing\na communication from the Principal of the St. George's Indian\nResidential School.\n\nI am interested in the desire of Mr. Hives to\nprovide a small residence for the two teachers recently added\nto the staff of the school. If these teachers are as good\nas the Principal considers, I feel we should encourage them\nto stay, by providing some accommodation for them.\n\nThe domestic hot water system and the main water\npipe evidently require attention. No doubt, you will write\nagain, as soon as you hear from the Surveys and Engineering\nBranch.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRev. C. Hives, Principal of the St. George's Indian Residential School at Lytton recently advised that boiler No. 44913, which was supplied to the school in November of 1939, was leaking badly and that a number of tubes should be replaced. The matter was immediately taken up with the Vancouver Engineering Works who recommended that in view of the alkaline content in the water at Lytton the boiler should be shipped to Vancouver as it was thought that an inspection of the boiler would indicate that all tubes should be replaced. As there appeared to be no alternative I authorized Mr. Strang to have the boiler shipped to Vancouver and will submit an estimate of the cost of retubing in the near future.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nFurther to my letter of March 29th in connection with the boiler No. 44913 at the Lytton Indian Residential School, I am advised by the Vancouver Engineering Works Ltd. that the cost of completely retubing this boiler will be $240.00, and in addition there will be freight and cartage charges to Vancouver and return.\n\nAs there appears to be no alternative to having this work carried out, I have authorized the Vancouver Engineering Works to proceed with the matter.\n\nD. M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nFurther to my letter of April 10th and previous correspondence in connection with repairs to boiler No. 44913 at the Lytton Indian Residential School, I would advise that in addition to having the boiler retubed it has been necessary to purchase a steam pressure regulator at a cost of $67.20, and as this expenditure was unavoidable I have placed the order with Crane Limited in Vancouver.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nTruck at 460\n\nBal today = 3004\n\nMay 9/46\n\nD.P.\nOttawa, May 10, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nWith reference to your letters of April 10 and May 7, in connection with the boiler at the St. George's Residential School, the action that you have taken is approved.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to place before you certain matters, which have become very difficult problems in the work connected with our institution; and which are continually being forced on my mind, causing grave concern about the future maintaining and financing of our work.\n\nDuring the years of war, we had to, more or less, mark time, with the result that very little progress has been made in the matter of development or extension. In fact, it has at times, seemed extremely difficult to maintain and keep in order what equipment we now possess. But, I feel the time has now come, when we must progress by improving and modernizing our equipment and our methods, or else be subject to adverse criticism from the general public, as well as from the people whose lives we are trying to improve. Moreover, I feel we are at present actually leaving ourselves open to adverse criticism and even ridicule unless ways and means are provided by the Department to improve and modernize our methods and equipment capable of coping with present day problems and ideas. I know we are all looking to the time when our problem regarding training and welfare of Indians will be solved; but at the rate we are going, it will take a long time. Comparing methods and equipment with those of any Provincial system of education and training, we lag far behind. And yet, ours is the only project of education for which the Dominion Government is responsible. We have not even an Inspector to visit our schools and classrooms, and to give us advice, encouragement or profitable criticism. We do leave ourselves open to ridicule, and such a condition makes it very difficult obtaining proficient and enterprising teachers.\n\nThe Indians are becoming more and more persistent in their demands to be, not only released from all restraining influence; but also to be given financial aids of tremendous proportions. I am of the opinion that they are not ready to be released from the restraining influences exercised by the Department; and they certainly are not yet ready to entrusted with responsibility that accompanies the spending of large sums of money. Yet their voice is ever increasing in volume;\nand public opinion is becoming more and more aroused, and spurred on by those who are looking for self aggrandizement. We know we have the welfare of the Indians at heart. We have the feeling that we know what is best for these people, because we have studied them and understand them. But we do require new life and zeal and interest. We do require more backing from the Dominion Government. The constant struggle to make ends meet; and at the same time to feed and clothe our children properly on the meagre grant allowed us, is a strain that could and should be eliminated. Instead of which, the strain and the worry remains, giving one the impression that our main object in life is to curtail expenses. I am afraid this idea and this impression is all too evident to all who pass by.\n\nThere is talk of a change in the policy of caring for and educating Indian children. I have been in the residential school work for over thirty years; and although I am fully aware it is not the ideal system, yet I am of the opinion that it will remain for sometime, for there will be, for sometime, many problem children to be taken care of.\n\nThe property on which the school stands, comprises 396 acres. About two thirds of this is of such rough terrain as to be looked upon as waste land. A great deal of money has been spent on developing the land to its present state; but the work that has been done is of such a temporary and makeshift nature, much of it has fallen into decay, so that the whole system of fencing and irrigation requires renewing and making safe and permanent.\n\nOur farm should be the centre of instruction and attraction to all the Indians of this district. And I have no hesitation in saying that it could be made so if the property were developed, improved and set in order. This can only be done by the aid of proper modern machinery and equipment; for it is only with the aid of modern machinery that the waste land can be brought to the state where it can be irrigated.\n\nOur farm is extremely vital to our living. We depend entirely on its produce for fruit, vegetables, cereals and cow feed; and we certainly could not operate without it. Moreover, there is not a better fruit country in B.C.; and if we had our land planned properly, we could quite easily plant two thousand apple, peach, apricot, plum and cherry trees on its terraced slopes that would greatly supplement our present income, and make us become more self-supporting; as well as to make us the centre of attraction and instruction.\n\nOur fences need to be pulled down and new ones built in some systematic order. Our whole system of irrigation\nrequires a complete re-survey and re-adjustment. We would require two thousand fruit trees to plant. Our buildings which have not seen paint for over ten years, and are in a very shabby condition, require a two coat job. The roof of our main building is leaking in places, and requires a thorough going over. Our water main leaks in many places. This is a wooden pipe, and has had to be replaced in several sections during the last two years. Our plumbing requires a lot of replacements. Our floors, which are all fir wood, require renewing. To do all this work, and buy the necessary machinery and equipment, such as a bull dozer and other machinery, I estimate would represent an outlay of twenty thousand dollars. But I assure you, sir, we would have something worth while to show for it. Something the general public would not ridicule. Something that would be constructive, instructive and attractive. And something which the Department would be proud of.\n\nIt seems to me, that in order to progress these days, money has to be spent. There was a time when we could pick and shovel our way along with these people, and lead them on. That way has become extinct, and we should recognize that fact. I would like to see our work take on a new lease of life.\n\nAfter reading the above over, I would be very much obliged, sir, if you could see fit to endorse what I have written.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nCommissioner of Indians for B.C.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of a letter dated May 4th from Reverend C.F. Hives in connection with repairs and improvements required at the St. George's Indian Residential School, the overall cost of which he estimates would be approximately $20,000.00. Very briefly, the proposals include:\n\n(1) Complete re-survey and improvement where necessary of the irrigation system.\n\n(2) Replacement of the present school fences.\n\n(3) Replacement or repair of the domestic water main.\n\n(4) Machinery and equipment, including a bulldozer, for extending the farming activities of the school.\n\n(5) Extensive repairs to the buildings, including painting, repairs to the roof, replacement and repair of the plumbing facilities, and replacement of the fir floors throughout the building.\n\nI have requested Mr. Indian Agent Strang to discuss items 2, 4 and 5 with the principal and to let me have a detailed report with respect to each, giving as much information as possible with respect to the materials and labour involved and the estimated costs and will advise you further upon receipt of this information.\nItems 1 and 3 should be the subject of investigation by the Surveys and Engineering Branch, and it would be appreciated if these items could be referred to that division for attention.\n\nD.

The Reverend Principal has made requests for extensive repairs to the irrigation system for the farm and the matter has been referred to the Dominion Water and Power Bureau for investigation and report.\n\nDuring the quarter repairs were necessary to the hot water system in the school. Purchase of a Steam Pressure Regulator was made at a cost of $68.09 and re-tubing of one boiler was carried out at a cost of $243.75.\n\nA. Strang.\nIndian Agent.\nSt. George's Ind.Res.

Strang,\nIndian Agent.\nMEMORANDUM\nre\nDomestic Water Supply\nfor\nSt. George's Indian Residential School\nLytton, B.C.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn accordance with your instructions, I visited St. George's Indian Residential School, 4 miles north of Lytton, B.C., on July 12, and inspected the domestic water supply system, paying special attention to the following items:\n\n1. The present 6\" wooden pipe line from reservoir to school.\n2. Sanitary conditions from spring to intake dam.\n3. Silted of the reservoir and pipe lines with the consequent discoloration of water and damage to valves.\n\nInformation\n\nThe domestic water supply for St. George's school is fundamentally as shown on drawing accompanying report by S.H. Fredercroft, dated May 20, 1926, regarding proposed water supply for Lytton Residential School, and is as follows:\n\n(a) Spring (b) Creek bed\n(c) Intake dam (d) About 500 ft. of 5\" wood pipe to (e) Overflow chamber - see Sketch 1.\n(f) Reservoir as shown in Mr. Fredercroft's report, capacity of which is 25,000 U.S. gallons (12' x 12' x 25').\n(g) About 1700 ft. of 6\" wood stove pipe from reservoir to school building, branching to 4 hydrants in yard and entering north end of\nOttawa, 17 September 1946.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nEnclosed for your information is a copy of a letter which the Principal of the St. George's Indian Residential School forwarded to Indian Agent Strang.\n\nCan you secure what he requires in Vancouver? If so, you may make the purchases and at the same time advise us so that we can forward to the Principal from New England Co. funds the amount required to cover the expenditure.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, 17 September 1946.\n\nMr. A. Strang, Indian Agent,\nLytton, British Columbia.\n\nWe have your letter of the 10th instant enclosing a communication from the Principal of the St. George's Residential School with a request for hospital beds and bedding for the infirmary. We are communicating with Indian Commissioner MacKay regarding this request.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSt. George's Ind. Res. School,\nLytton, B.C.\nSept. 7, 1946\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWill you kindly place before the Department our need of paint and floor dressing for certain rooms in the main building and gymnasium. The playrooms are urgently in need of a coat of paint, as well as the bathrooms and toilet rooms, and stair wells. The cost of this paint is $4.50 per gal.; and we would require sixteen gallons. Also three gallons of thinner at $1.35 per gal.\n\nThe floor of the gymnasium urgently requires a three coat dressing, as well as the floor of the Assembly Hall. This will not only improve their appearance, but will add years to their life. The dressing I would like to put on is Penetrem; a preparation made by the Tremco people, whose products are reliable. A half drum of thirty five gallons would be required for this work, and would cost $150.50. Paint brushes $20.00.\n\nThe total cost for this material would be $243.10. We would do the work as part of the Manual Training programme.\n\nWe have quite a few visitors looking over the school, and it gives us a great deal of pleasure showing them our institution; especially when the building and equipment are kept in good repair.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. A.

Box 70, VANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nI enclose herewith a letter addressed to me by the Reverend Principal of St. George's Indian Residential School, relative to certain materials requested for maintenance within the building.\n\nIn this respect I beg to advise that the condition of the rooms indicated was noted by Colonel H.M. Jones, Supervisor of Family Allowances, on his recent visit to the school, and Mr. Jones agreed with the Reverend Principal that the rooms should receive attention as quickly as possible.\n\nI would respectfully recommend that materials as requested be provided for the school.\n\nA.

Unsworth's report dated September 11th in connection with the domestic water supply for St. Georges Indian Residential School. This report, a copy of which you have no doubt received, indicates that the condition of the present supply system is far from satisfactory and as it will not likely be possible to have the work carried out this year I would recommend that an amount of \u00a31,930 be provided in the 1947-48 estimates for this work in accordance with Mr. Unsworth's report.\n\nThese estimates have already gone forward to the Department but if this suggestion is approved a note will be made on the copies retained at this office.\n\nD. M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am in receipt of a communication from Reverend C.F. Hives, Principal of the St. George's Indian Residential School advising that the twelve sewing machines at the school require a complete overhaul, and suggesting that they all be shipped to Vancouver for this purpose. I have contacted the Singer Sewing Machine Company who are prepared to undertake the work, but are not, of course, in a position to give even an estimate of the cost.\n\nMr. Hives, in his letter, does not indicate that he would be prepared to meet the cost of the work from school funds and before taking any action in the matter it would be appreciated if you would advise if the Department has funds available from appropriation for this purpose.\n\nI may say that four of the machines are tailor Singers which are used to a large extent in repairing and remodelling clothing for the children, but the other eight machines are household Singers and are used for instructional purposes, and the cost of the repairs might be met from the technical education division of the B.C.

Here it branches into 2 - 2\" iron pipes; one for fire line under full pressure of 74 pounds per square inch, the other through reduction valve to 54 pounds per square inch for domestic use.\n\nIn regard to Item 1 - condition of 6\" pipe line. Three lengths of pipe have been replaced in the past two years, and the wood in these was apparently quite poor. However, a careful examination of the growth along the pipe line would indicate no further leaks. A check was made of the pipe in one place and the wood fibre and wire binding were still in good condition. According to the manufacturers (Canadian Wood Pipe and Tank Company) a pipe line like this could be expected to last 25 to 30 years, or a further five to ten years. However, they pointed out that the odd stave may rot and leak, and hence require replacement of such a length from time to time.\n\nRecommendation\n\nIn regard to Item 1, pipe line from reservoir to school, it is recommended that the pipe line be left as it is, a yearly check be made for signs of leaks and 25 feet of 6\" double wrapped wood stave pipe be kept on hand at the school, together with instructions on how to replace pipe. This pipe would be in the following lengths: one each of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 feet, which combination will replace any length from 3 to 18 feet.\n\nCost of pipe, plus couplings, plus four split couplings would be $40. delivered to school. Labour\nfor such emergency replacement would have to be obtained by the school authorities.\n\nIn regard to Items 2 and 3 - sanitary and silting conditions. There are three springs shown on sketch 2 as E1, E2, and E3. These springs are shown as 2 on exhibit A Water Rights sketch with Final Licence No. 3140, order No. 2506. The water from these springs flows through a steep ravine heavily wooded with poplar, alder, willow, briers, and underbrush. The soil is a light clay and silt.\n\nThe flow from each spring is as follows:\n\nE1 - 1\" over 90\u00b0 V-notch weir full contraction = 1.96 gpm = .0052 cfs.\n\nE2 - 2 9/16\" over 6\" rectangular weir full contraction = .16 cfs.\n\nE3 - about 1/8 times E1 by estimate = .008 cfs.\n\nSanitary conditions at E2 are not good, especially when the water supply is for some 200 people. One hundred square feet of ground has been cleared close to the spring, and is used by an Indian family resident on the property, for laundry and bathing area. Water is heated over a small grate beside the stream. The used water is then turned out beside and into the stream.\n\nOn July 15, Mr. Hives, Principal of the School, told the son of this Indian (a man about 21 years) the importance of keeping the water supply clean. The man replied that he did not know that such was harmful as he was under the impression that the school had a purifier. However, he said he would keep the water supply clean. There was no change\nin the next few days, and Mr. Indian Agent Strang saw the conditions of this spring on July 18. He will endeavour to arrange that this area be kept clean.\n\nSpring E1 is 46 feet north of E2, and was untouched by man.\n\nSpring E3 is about 200 feet south of E2, and part of the flow has been diverted to a drinking trough for animals.\n\nSometimes the tail water from irrigation flows into the ravine above the present intake; such was the case on early morning of July 17, causing the water to be very muddy.\n\nThe dam at 'c' is fenced, keeping animals away, but it is accessible to man, and is often used as a source of supply for passing motorists and sometimes campers. I am told that in winter when other sources of water fail, local families get their water supply here.\n\nThe dam 'c' silt up quickly and must be cleaned at least once a week. Even though this is done, much silt collects in the reservoir and pipelines, scoring valves and discoloring water. The reservoir is cleaned once a year. The water is drained through the pipe line to the school, leaving four or five inches of water in the reservoir. The silt is removed by buckets lifted through the manhole. Since water remains in the reservoir it is difficult to do a good job of cleaning.\n\nOn July 18 at 5 p.m. a standard sample of\nwater was taken from a faucet in the school and another one taken at the spring E2. These were delivered to the Provincial Board of Health, Vancouver, on afternoon of July 19. The results of the tests were as follows:\n\n| Specimen                  | Coli-Aerogenes Test |\n|---------------------------|--------------------|\n|                           | 0.1 cc.            | 1 cc. | 10 cc. |\n| No. 1 Faucet              | 0/2                | 3/5   | 5/5    |\n| No. 2 Spring (source of water) | 0/2                | 0/5   | 1/5    |\n\nThese tests would indicate that the water at the spring is clean, but is contaminated by the time it reaches the school. From the foregoing observations of conditions along the line of flow, the contamination could be from man.\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nTo improve existing conditions I would suggest that the total flow from spring E2 be collected by works shown on Sketch 3 and piped directly to the overflow chamber 'e' of the reservoir. The spring and adjoining land should be fenced, and to cover the riparian rights and good-will of the Indian occupant, conditions at E3 should be improved so as to collect more of the flow of this spring for his use. Water licence No. 3140 will have to be modified to cover new point of diversion and arrangements made to permit the fencing of the area around the spring. The reservoir area should be fenced and the overflow chamber be improved and provided with a new cover as a protection from contamination by animals or man.\nThe direct pipe line from spring to reservoir should not only insure clean water, but should eliminate the necessity of cleaning the reservoir annually.\n\nThe estimated cost to install a suitable water collecting box; 3\" wood stave pipe line to connect with the present pipe line at dam 'c'; to improve the overflow chamber 'e'; to drain the reservoir and spring SE areas and improve connections at spring SS is $1,930.00.\n\nLocal Indian labour can be obtained, but in addition it would be desirable to have at least one white man from the school. The work can be done anytime the ground is free of frost - March 15 to October 1. Suitable gravel for concrete work can be obtained within 5 miles, and material can be delivered to site by truck or wagon.\n\nIt should be noted that the proposed 3\" pipe line connects with the present 5\" pipe line 'd' near dam 'c'. This 5\" pipe line 'd' has been in use for 20 years and has a probable further life of 5 years. When replacement is necessary the 3\" main should be continued to the overflow chamber and then to the reservoir.\n\nThe gate valve now installed at the intake dam site should be moved to the pipe line between the overflow chamber and the reservoir.\n\nA. Unsworth\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6465, file 888-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, December 2, 1946.\n\nMr. Hoey,\n\nRe: St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, British Columbia.\n\nIn reply to your memorandum of May 30th, 1946, requesting a report on certain works at the above mentioned school, a report in connection with the domestic water supply has been submitted by the Engineering and Construction Service, a copy of which is attached. The recommendations contained therein are concurred in. It will be noted that the cost of the proposed work is $1930.\n\nAt the time Mr. Unsworth visited the school to investigate the water supply he also made a very extensive report on the domestic water supply system within the school, apparently at the request of the Indian Commissioner.\n\nFrom a report of Mr. Unsworth dated September 12th and from subsequent data, analysis shows that the failure of the domestic water supply system is due mainly to two causes; firstly, the evident lack of a full appreciation of the hot water requirements in a building of this kind; and secondly, trouble caused by untreated water, which has resulted in a rapid deterioration of equipment by scaling.\n\nIt is pointed out that several methods of heating water have been tried and all have failed for varying reasons. After a full consideration of the requirements and taking into account existing equipment which could be used to better advantage, it is recommended that the following operations be carried out:\n\n(a) Provide water softening equipment, of an approved design, which will neutralize the effect of hard water.\n\n(b) Provide new indirect steam fed heater of tube and shell design and connect to present heating boilers, in a method to be outlined later.\n\n(c) Clean existing storage tank; remove existing\nsubmerged coil, and examine present temperature regulating valve. If same is found to be unsatisfactory, and unequal to the work required, remove and replace with new valve of proper capacity.\n\n(d) Disconnect high pressure boiler from domestic hot water service.\n\n(e) Make necessary piping revisions, as may be required, to carry out the above work.\n\nThe estimated cost of the above operations at this time can only be approximated as conditions discovered when work is actually undertaken may reveal the necessity for additional operations. However, an amount of not less than $4,500.00 should be available at the outset.\n\nIt should be mentioned that Mr. Unsworth has strongly recommended water softening equipment and has gone into considerable detail regarding capacities and performances. We concur fully with him regarding the urgent need of this equipment.\n\nIf you wish to proceed with the installation as outlined above, plans and specifications can be prepared by our Engineering and Construction Service. Your further advice in this regard is awaited.\n\nWe have been unable as yet to have a report prepared on the irrigation system, but as soon as one is available you will be advised.\n\nDirector.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa, 14 December 1946.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of May 14, 1946 in connection with repairs and improvements at St. George's Indian Residential School, I enclose for your information a copy of the memorandum received from the Surveys and Engineering Branch. I understand that you can obtain a copy of Mr. Unsworth's report from Mr. Webb's office.\n\nWhen you have had an opportunity of studying the report and memorandum, I would appreciate having your comments.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nRev. Canon C. F. Hives  \nPrincipal\n\nDec. II, 1946  \nLytton, B. C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th inst., relative to Singer Sewing machines. This I have read over very carefully, and feel very disappointed with the decision made by the Department. I am finding it daily increasingly difficult to meet even ordinary financial obligations connected with the administration of this institution. In fact, unless prices subside, or the maintenance grant increased, I cannot see how we can continue to function. It might be possible to find someone with more business ability, or someone less conscientious to administer under the present financial arrangement; but I doubt if you'll find one more sincere in endeavour, or one who works harder at his job.\n\nThe machines were bought by the Department some years ago. During the war years, five of which I have seen here at St. George's, our slogan has been to economize as much as possible; always living in hopes that at the end of the war, proper adjustments would be made as a reward for doing our best during those difficult times. These machines are used by classes of girls as part of their domestic training. These classes of girls make all dresses and garments for 100 girls enrolled in the school. We have no auxiliary to send us bales of clothing or goods to help us out. This is a Department school. Its equipment and its maintenance, is, or should be, I would think, the responsibility of the Department.\n\nBelieve me, sir, this is not, by any means an easy letter to write; and I certainly would not attempt it, were I not quite certain of my duty and also of the justification for doing so.\n\nI have to say, therefore, that our finances do not permit of my sending in the machines.\nto Vancouver to have the extensive and necessary repairs required in order to put them in first class condition.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nCommissioner of Indians for B.C.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nReverend C.F. Hives was advised of the content of Mr. Neary's letter of December 4th regarding payment of the cost of repairing the sewing machines at St. Georges School from school funds and in reply has forwarded me the attached letter.\n\nIn the last paragraph of my letter of November 28th in this connection I pointed out that a number of the machines were used for instructional purposes and recommended that the cost of repairs for these machines be met from the Technical Education Division of the B.C. Special Vote. It is thought that there should be funds available from this source and I can only reiterate my previous recommendation.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAIR MAIL.\n\nOttawa, December 27, 1946.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, British Columbia.\n\nYour letter of the 14th instant reached us today.\n\nIt is difficult for us to agree with the opinion expressed by Reverend Mr. Hives. Might I point out that the following payments have been made to him by the New England Company funds during the current calendar year: January, $2,000.00; May, $2,000.00; December, $1,500.00; Total: $5,500.00. In addition, we have sent to him a cheque for $1,200.00 towards the expense of purchasing a new car.\n\nThe authorized pupilage of this school is one hundred and eighty and $5,500.00 was forwarded to him for general expenses. This works out at approximately $30.00 per pupil. In addition the school received a Per Capita of $180.00 and also a special grant of $15.00. This makes a total of $225.00 a pupil which is more than is being paid to other Indian Residential Schools in British Columbia.\n\nThe amount required to repair sewing machines will not likely be excessive. In view of the information given in the first part of his letter, it is felt that it would be only fair to pay such expenditure from school funds. You should, therefore, notify the Principal of our decision in the matter. It is felt that he will arrange to have the machines repaired immediately and payment made as we desire.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI am writing you in reference to the matter relative to our domestic water equipment. During the Summer and Fall, there have been several surveys made of the situation, and reports sent in regarding the need of repairs and extra equipment. One of the recommendations is that of an electrically driven pump that would send the condensate back into the high pressure steam boiler against 110 lbs pressure. This is a very important matter.\n\nAs you are aware, the alkaline deposit on the inside of our boilers has ruined several jacket heaters and steam boilers during the past five years. While our domestic water was heated by jacket heater, the amount of water that had to be heated and therefore which had to go through the jacket heater system, was very great, and consequently left a great deal of deposit on the inside of the heater, resulting in the channels of the heater being filled up, and making the heater useless.\n\nAt the present time we are heating the water by means of a steam coil in the hot water tank, connected to the high pressure boiler. This has done very good and effective work. But the drawback of such a system is that the high pressure steam boiler requires so much additional water to make up for that used up in the steam coil, and each replenishment of water in the boiler means more alkaline deposit in the boiler tubes, which means, in the near future again, either a new boiler or new tubes. Both of which, or either of which are expensive replacements.\n\nIf we could have installed, a pump to handle the condensate water from the steam coils in the\nhot water tank, so that the condensate water, which is now devoid of any alkaline, could be returned to the boiler, I see no reason why much of our problem would not be solved, and the life of the boiler increased.\n\nThis matter is part of the responsibility of the Department. It has always been a problem, and a very difficult one. I believe a recommendation regarding this matter has been made, and I would like to know if there is any hope of that recommendation being carried out in the near future.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMajor D.

Hives.\n\nIn a letter to this office dated December 11th, 1946, a copy of which is attached, Mr. Hives suggests the installation of a pump to handle the condensate water from the steam coils in the hot water tank so that the condensate water, which is devoid of alkaline, could be returned to the boiler and thus obviate the necessity of using fresh water in the boiler with resulting heavy alkaline deposits. This suggestion has been referred to Mr. C. R. Webb, District Chief Engineer, who will no doubt pass same on to the Surveys and Engineering Division at Ottawa, for attention when the various proposals for meeting the problem that exists are being considered. I should appreciate being advised in due course of the views of the Engineering division with respect to Mr. Hives' proposal.\n\nD. M.

GEORGE'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nJanuary 23, 1947\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am again placing before you the matter of the urgent need of a high pressure pump for the purpose of forcing the condensate water back into the high pressure steam boiler.\n\nYesterday, we made an examination of the hot water tank after using the live steam coil in the tank for heating the water for a period of six months. After draining the tank, and taking off the man hole, we found an alkaline deposit on the outside of the steam coil, which immediately peeled off as it dried, leaving the copper pipe coil exposed and clean. This examination proved to us that the steam coil system of heating is a success, and better than any other system so far used during the last five years.\n\nThe only drawback to the system is the loss of the condensate water. A great deal of condensate water is made in the heating of water for a building with 200 residents. Every bit or drop of fresh water that goes into making that steam leaves an alkaline deposit on the tubes and crown of the boiler. This deposit will ruin the boiler as it has done in the past.\n\nIf we had the high pressure pump, electrically driven, to force the condensate water back into the boiler, I feel assured that the present boiler would stand in good repair for years. The cost of the pump was approximately $400.00.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"Chas F. Hives\"\nPrincipal\n\nMajor D. M.

The boiler room equipment was found to be in good condition and with few exceptions, the piping arrangement was of good design.\n\nThe high pressure boiler, originally designed to serve laundry and canteen requirements, has been pressed into service to heat domestic hot water. Since it is not possible to return more than half the condensate from these three sources, raw make up water must be used. This has caused failures through corrosion in the boiler tubes as the water is exceptionally hard. It has been responsible also for the rapid burning out of every type of jacket heater used.\n\nEmphasis is placed on the need for water softening equipment to protect the heating apparatus, in a hook-up with the present heating boilers along with a new indirect steam fed heater, to provide the necessary amount of domestic hot water. The heating boilers, stove fired, are ample in capacity to heat the building and the domestic hot water, and full advantage should be taken of this. Generatively few piping changes will be involved and the work could be carried out with little, if any disturbance to the normal school routine. The high pressure boiler when used for laundry and canteen purposes only, as was originally intended, can be fed with the treated water and should last for years.\n\nAs stated in our memorandum of November 20th, 1946, it is thought that for the operations recommended an amount of approximately $4500.00 should be provided by Indian Affairs.\n\nPrincipal Hives raised a point not heretofore brought to our attention. He complained about the unsanitary range closets, and asked if any consideration may be expected for new W.C.s to replace this arrangement. While it is true that these closets flush periodically, it is also true that between these periods, they can be very unsanitary.\n\nJ.M.

These efforts, alone however, are not sufficient to combat the effects of excessively hard water which is supplied to this School, and if the work outlined in our recommendation of April 15th is delayed beyond the 1947-48 fiscal year, it is possible that some items of boiler room equipment as well as some of the piping, will become affected to the extent that major replacements of a much more costly nature will be necessary.\n\nNevertheless if the Indian Affairs Branch find it more convenient to defer action until funds are received later in the year from the New England Company, no immediate trouble should result, and there would normally still be time to carry out the necessary operations before the full heating demand is required.\n\nWhether or not the work is completed during this fiscal year, after funds are made available, depends entirely on the volume of work occupying local tradesmen, and the availability of material for the work.\n\nWe anticipate being able to prepare drawings and specifications in the near future, and consider it undesirable to delay operations any longer than necessary.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ.M.

For this purpose, I would be very much obliged if the Department would allow the Manual Training Instructor's monthly grant to continue during the months of July and August.

It is not known here just what funds are available for improvements at the school this year but if it is possible to extend assistance for the purpose referred to I feel the expenditure would be justified. As you know, the heat during the period of the summer the school is in session is quite intense and the pool would provide opportunities for bathing and instruction in swimming that would be helpful to the pupils. I realize, of course, that it may be difficult to find funds for the purpose at this time, but I feel it is something that should be provided when it is possible for the Department to do so.\n\nD.

Mr. Hives has already been written directly concerning a swimming pool at his school.\n\nIn view of the other expenditures which we already have under way, it will not be possible to consider this item this year.\n\nWe are faced with an expenditure of some $4,500. for repairs to the heating and plumbing plant. Mr. Hives has also complained about the unsanitary range closets. This will also involve a large expenditure at this school.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nBFN/MGD\nRev. Canon C. F. Hives  \nPrincipal  \nJuly 4, 1947  \nLytton, B. C.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,  \nDirector of Indian Affairs,  \nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI am taking the liberty of writing you a personal letter relative to a matter which is causing me some deep concern. It is in connection with the matter of the installation of a water softening plant in our school, which has, I believe been recommended by the Water and Power Commission.\n\nTwo years ago, because of the trouble we were having with our hot water heating equipment, by the alkaline deposit in the boiler ruining the tubes of the high pressure steam boiler, I recommended that an electric pump should be installed for the purpose of returning the condensate water, made in the steam coils in the hot water tank, back to the high pressure steam boiler. This pump was to cost $400.00, and it would, by pumping back the condensate water, eliminate, I reckon, 80 per cent of the trouble, and prolong the life of the boiler.\n\nAfter much correspondence the matter was referred to the Water and Power Commission who sent a man to make a survey of the situation. He came and stayed with us for about two weeks, and made quite an elaborate report, which, I believe, was quite a thorough one. Later, another man came, who stayed a few days, and made another survey and report. And still later, a man came from Ottawa, and made another survey and recommended a water softening plant, estimated to cost $4500.00.\n\nSome years ago, before my time here, a water softening plant was installed, and used a few years. After which it was taken out and lies in a decayed state in one of the out buildings. I believe it was similar to the one recommended now to be installed. It was taken out and scrapped because it was considered a nuisance and an unnecessary expense.\nI have no doubt a water softening plant should be of value where the water has such a large alkaline content; but there are so many other equally important requirements, which we shall certainly be unable to secure if that large amount of money is taken from the New England Company funds. I feel quite sure that my request for an electric pump would have answered the purpose of protecting and prolonging the life of the high pressure steam boiler. I did not ask for the water softening plant.\n\nWe require a swimming pool in the worst way for our pupils. Such an acquisition would protect the lives of our pupils. We also, very urgently need a new poultry house. These things, I feel, could honestly be paid for from New England Company funds. I doubt if we are honestly spending those funds by installing an elaborate water softening plant, which we have not asked for, and which, will no doubt be quite an expense to maintain when and if it is installed.\n\nI am quite willing to go by your judgement in this matter; but as it stands, it does give me some concern. I also feel that we should show to the Indian people that we are possessed of human sympathies. I doubt if they would ever recognize a water softening plant as of as much importance for their children, as they would a safe swimming pool, or a good poultry house for the production of eggs to feed their children.\n\nIf you can deal with this matter without others having the feeling that I have been presumptuous in going over their heads, I shall be much relieved. I know you and your staff are always greatly concerned both about our welfare and the proper expending of money. Yet, because we are remotely situated from you, I feel sure that direct and first hand information is also welcomed, in dealing with problems.\n\nWith kindest regards and every good wish.\n\nI am, Yours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, July 23rd, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, SURVEYS & ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nRe: St. George's Indian Residential School\n\nI desire to refer you to your memoranda of April 11th and April 24th in connection with the above school.\n\nFor your consideration I attach copy of an extract from a letter recently received from Rev. Charles F. Hives, Principal of the St. George's School.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nPP/MDG\nOttawa, July 25th, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Hives:\n\nI received your letter of July 4th with reference to certain matters affecting the St. George's Indian Residential School.\n\nYour remarks regarding the proposed installation of a water softening plant have been referred to Surveys and Engineering Branch whose officials have visited the school and are giving the situation careful consideration.\n\nThe other matters mentioned in your letter will have to wait until we get final advice from the Surveys and Engineering Branch regarding what should be done at St. George's and the expenditure involved.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDirector\n\nRev. Canon C.F. Hives,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Indian Res. School,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nPP/MGD\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: St. George's Indian Residential School,\nLytton, British Columbia.\n\nIn connection with Mr. Hoey's memorandum of July 23rd bearing your notations of the 26th instant, together with attached copy of Principal Hives' letter of July 4th, you are advised as follows:\n\nWe have prepared plans and specifications covering the revisions to the hot and cold water equipment at the above and are sending 5 sets of each to Mr. Webb requesting him to obtain prices for the installation of the work and to forward same to this Service.\n\nWith reference to Principal Hives' comments in his letter of the 4th instant, we still hold to our opinion that the high pressure return pump would not provide a satisfactory solution to the present difficulty. As pointed out in our memorandum of July 23rd, 1947, no more than half the condensate can be returned to the high pressure boiler as the nature of some of the equipment served makes it impossible to trap and return the waste steam. Consequently at least half of the water charged for the high pressure boiler would be raw makeup, and it follows that the life of the boiler could only theoretically be extended 50% longer by the use of this pump. The pump installed would provide no help in prolonging the life of the other items of the domestic hot water equipment.\n\nWith a proper type of water softening equipment, the units in the boiler room and laundry could be served and we agree with the statement which appears on page 7 in Unsworth's report of Sept 12th, 1946, to the effect that a 75% saving in soap and at least 10% annual saving in washable clothes could be effected.\n\nOur recommendations are based on reports prepared by Messrs Unsworth and Strilkeff of Mr. Webb's office and on a personal inspection made by our own officer early last March.\n\nFollowing the receipt of prices from Mr. Webb, you will be further advised.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ.M.

Two of the applications were not completed as the forms were not declared to by someone having the power to take an affidavit. These, therefore, have not been received by headquarters. Of the remaining eleven it is found that two of them are not residents of the competition district and, therefore, would not be considered eligible providing a competent person is found within the remaining nine. Very few of the applicants have had any experience as Inspectors of Construction, though most of them have filled positions as Superintendent of Construction which is an entirely different thing.\n\nI am attaching hereto the applications of the eleven applicants above referred to with rating sheets appended thereto. The applicant receiving the highest rating is Mr. Charles Macdonald, Vancouver, B.C., who apparently has had the most experience. He was Inspector of Construction at the Edmonton School and was offered the same position at the Cardston School, so I take it that his services were eminently satisfactory to our Department. On this account it might be proper for you to attach to his application a letter of recommendation for the position, for I think it is only right that the Department should have something to say in connection with the appointment of a person who will have the oversight of such a large expenditure of the public funds.\n\nAttached also is the printed poster advertising the vacancy, which was displayed in the window of my office from the 24th of June to the 4th instant inclusive.\n\nW.B./K.D.\n\nEnclosures:-\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6465, file 888-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nJuly 13th, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Foran,\n\nI am enclosing herewith applications for the position of inspector of construction at Lytton, B.C., with rating sheets furnished by the Indian Commissioner, Mr. Ditchburn. There are 13 applications in all. Of these two, Nos. 12 and 13 have not been dealt with by Mr. Ditchburn because they were not accompanied by the necessary affidavits. Of the remaining 11, two are from points outside the district advertised in.\n\nI regret that these applications do not on the whole appear very satisfactory. This is an important position; the appointee must not only have the requisite technical knowledge, but he must be a person of undoubted integrity owing to the necessity of most careful supervision of the work and the oversight of a large expenditure of public funds, in this case approximately $150,000.00. There is no doubt that Mr. Charles May of Vancouver is the best qualified man and he is rated highest by Mr. Ditchburn. Some three years ago Mr. May, who was then a resident of Edmonton, was inspector of construction on the large industrial school which\n\nWilliam Foran, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nCivil Service Commission,\nOttawa.\nwe erected in the vicinity of that city. So satisfactory was his work that we endeavoured to obtain his services to supervise the construction of a new school a year later on the Blood reserve. He was, however, on the eve of taking up residence in Vancouver and was not available. It would be very satisfactory to the Department to have him engaged on this work and I hope the Commission will be able to issue a certificate in his favour.\n\nWe have already let the contract for this work and immediate action is necessary as building operations cannot in any event be delayed if the work is to be completed before the winter sets in.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nBoy 593\nPhillevack O.C.\nJuly 26, 1927\n\nDuncan P.

I will be glad to keep your name before me, however, for future work.\n\nI take this opportunity of expressing to you the Department's appreciation of the very satisfactory manner in which you have carried out your duties as Inspector of Construction on the new St. George's School at Lytton. Your services have been exceedingly satisfactory and judging from your reports the contractors have performed good work on this building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing, Asst.

I remain\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6465, file 888-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFeb 16 '29\n\nTo J D McLean\nand Deputy Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIt would assist me very much in my efforts to obtain new employment to have possession of a letter from my last employer certifying as far as you know of as to my personal character\u2014honesty, integrity, trustworthiness during the period of my appointment as Inspector of Construction. I am somewhat of a stranger here & find it difficult to get employment or to have such a letter\u2014if only brief would assist.\n\nI might further observe that one makes but few friends as Inspector of Construction for the more severe, or vigilant, one is the more he is disliked & on the other hand if he is too lenient, he loses his job.\n\nNo one could be more vigilant an Inspector at Lytton but there were\nmay adverse factors against me\nwhich I could not control such\nas winter building, some interference\nfrom local officials, etc., etc.\n\nI was at all times conscientious in\nmy work or put in my whole time\non this job with the exception of\nwhen I was assisting Mr. Lott in\nbuilding the new Horse Barn, Garage,\nGranary, or Root House. I supervised\nthe erection of these buildings also\nput in upwards of 250 hours of\nmanual labor, carpentry, cutting\npatens, pouring concrete, bending\nfinishing, laying hollow tile, applying\nstucco, directing unskilled Indians\nin the use of tools, the mixing of\ncements or Plasters, believing it to be\nin a good cause. I also applied\nmy personal labor in installing\n$2,000 worth of new school fixtures.\nI consider the value of my labor\nalone to be worth $300.\n\nI might mention that I built all\nthe walls of a Hollow Tile Root House\n22 ft x 60 ft.\nsingle handed with the help of an\nIndian helper, laying 1200-12x12 hollow\ntile staked out & leveled foundations\nof all 4 buildings. In consideration\nof all my energy in this direction\nI received a cheque of $25.00 from\nMr. Lott, gratuity.\n\nI nevertheless kept close track of the\nconstruction work of the school, and of\ncourse when a large force of men\nwere there I could not leave them.\nI made all the designs of the \u00a32,000\nfixtures, tables, bookcases etc etc.\n4 sets of all the drawings, as I am\na competent draftsman.\nI always did my best for the Depart-\nment no one can say otherwise, and I am\nsorry to say it did not get me anywhere\nfor Lytton. As an extremely isolated place\n160 miles from Vancouver, so I had to virtually\nforego all my business connections in\nVancouver to go there.\n\nTrusting you will send me letter of\ncommendation asked for.\nI remain Sir\nYours Truly\nFrank W. Baker\nFeb. 22, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to a letter of recommendation I would refer you to the Department's letter to you of April 13th of last year.

Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nWith reference to your No. 7-11-4 of the\n2nd instant, we are requesting the Departmental Purchasing\nAgent to secure 12 beds and mattresses for the St. George's\nResidential School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOctober 22, 1947.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: St. George's Indian Residential School,\nLytton, British Columbia.\n\nFurther to our memorandum of August 7th relative to the above, you are advised that we are in receipt of a letter from Mr. Webb in which were enclosed two tenders covering the work outlined on our plan and specification for the above.\n\nBelow is a summary of the two tenders received:\n\nAcme Plumbing and Heating Service, 114 Water St., Vancouver\u2014$7,895.00\nBarr and Anderson Ltd., 1060 Homer Street, Vancouver\u2014\u2014\u2014 $5,185.00\n\nMr. Webb had some difficulty in interesting any firms to offer tenders, and their reluctance to bid is directly reflected in the tender prices which are fantastically higher than our considered estimate of $4,500.\n\nIf the boiler room, laundry, domestic hot water equipment, and domestic water piping systems are to be protected against costly and rapid deterioration brought about by excessively hard water, the work outlined by this Service should be proceeded with; but we do not feel justified in recommending the acceptance of either of the above tenders as it is felt that they are unreasonably high.\n\nHowever, the vertical high pressure boiler which serves the laundry equipment should have some individual protection. This unit is being supplied with raw make-up water, as it is not possible or feasible to return more than 50% of the condensate.\n\nIt is suggested therefore, that the high pressure boiler be provided with an individual water treatment system along the lines of that offered by Goddard and Company of Sidney, Vancouver Island as outlined in their letter of September 25, 1947.\n\nIf this protective treatment were supplied for this boiler, it could be made to work in conjunction with the equipment outlined in our original recommendation and would therefore not be lost should the entire renovations be carried out at some later date.\n\nIt is not to be considered however, that the above is an alternative to our original recommendation; as this equipment would only provide protection for the high pressure boiler.\n\nWhen Indian Affairs decide what steps they are prepared to take after considering this report, we will, upon receiving instructions, institute the necessary action to carry out their wishes.\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6465, file 883-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMEMORANDUM\n\n31st October, 1947.\n\nRe: St. George's Indian Residential School,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nFurther to our memorandum of October 22nd, you are advised as follows:\n\nMessrs. Goddard & Company of Sidney, B.C., who are the manufacturers and dispensers of A-K Water Treatment, have kindly outlined the procedure to be followed in using their compound, along with the approximate cost.\n\nThey are prepared to test a sample of water, provide a testing kit with full and easily followed instructions to the operator, and to recommend the exact amount of Treatment required. As a check, they request the operator to submit monthly samples of water for a laboratory test so that corrections as to the amount of compound may be made. This also ensures that the Treatment is being used regularly.\n\nThe smallest amount of compound which is practical to supply to any plant is a 50 lb. keg. This amount, it is estimated, would last for one year under normal operations.\n\nFrom our knowledge of the operations carried out at St. George's School which include canning as well as a considerable amount of laundry service, we would recommend that a 100 lb. keg of Treatment be obtained. This would cost $50.00.\n\nGoddard & Company state in their letter of 14th August, 1947, that the only cost attached to their service is the original cost of the Treatment; and that they supply all necessary sample bottles.\n\nThe boiler room staff at St. George's is, in our opinion, well qualified and able to use this Treatment intelligently; and we have no hesitation in recommending that it be adopted and applied to the high pressure boiler which in this case should have protection against the very hard water which is being supplied to the building.\n\nChief Engineer,\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys & Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, November 1st, 1947.\n\nMr. Hoey\n\nRe: St. George's Indian Residential School,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nWith further reference to previous correspondence relative to proposed revisions of the hot and cold water equipment of this school, I am enclosing for your information copies of memoranda from Mr. Mills, dated October 22nd and October 31st, which are self-explanatory.\n\nIt will be noted that in his memorandum of October 22nd, Mr. Mills states he does not feel justified in recommending the acceptance of either tender received on the ground that they are both unreasonably high. This view is concurred in.\n\nAs a temporary alternative to accepting one of these tenders, Mr. Mills suggests making use of an individual water treatment system offered by Goddard and Company of Sidney, Vancouver Island. Details concerning this proposed procedure for treating the water used in the high pressure boiler are given by Mr. Mills in his memorandum of October 31st.\n\nWe concur in Mr. Mills' recommendation regarding the adoption of this treatment as a temporary measure until more reasonable prices can be secured for revisions to the domestic water supply of this school.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, November 5, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, SURVEYS & ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nRe: St. George's Indian Residential School,\nLytton, British Columbia.\n\nWe are in receipt of your memorandum of November 1st with reference to the proposed revisions of the hot and cold water equipment at the above school.\n\nIt is noted that your Branch is not prepared to recommend the acceptance of either tender that has been received on the grounds that both of them are unreasonably high.\n\nWe approve the temporary alternative suggestion by Mr. Mills and it is understood that your Branch will take the necessary action.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP/MGD\nDear Mr. Kelan:\n\nI am writing you because I know you will understand our circumstances better than anyone else there, then I tell you of them. Your comprehensive knowledge of residential school work, and the many problems you have had to tackle makes it almost necessary that I should write to you in respect to matters that concern our needs.\n\nWe have a full school. The largest number in the history of the school. Of course, I knew this would happen. As you are aware, I have had great difficulty in filling the school since I came. The people, parents of children in St. George's district, have shown very little real interest in school and education until some thirty new pupils came from the north. Now, like all true Indians, they think they are missing something that someone else is getting, and they are flocking into school. I have had to turn many away. We now have a full school of nearly 200 pupils, and we are not adequately equipped to handle that number.\n\nQuite a few boys and girls are lying on the floor instead of a bed at night. I am still waiting for the small dormitory beds and mattresses and blankets which you thought you could get for us while I was with you in your office. I do hope they will come soon. Many of the beds, which we are using have been on the go for so long, they should be either repaired properly or scrapped.\n\nThe kitchen stove. It is altogether too small and too antiquated for our crowd. I believe it was taken out of the old school twenty years ago. Having such equipment in such an important department not only makes the work difficult, but causes much discouragement to the staff who have to work in that department, so that we have too many changes, which is bad for the school generally. Surely there must be good kitchen ranges with war Assets that would suit our needs.\n\nLaundry. I don't know how long the\nequipment there has been on the go, but it is not in good shape. And being so far away from any means of getting a proper repair job done on the washer, which is too small anyway, it has become leaky and castings etc., worn and slack. Our electricity is so expensive, we have to use the old flat iron, heated on a little stove. I cannot allow electric irons, for our light bill now is around two hundred dollars a month, which is more than we can afford. We need a steam flat iron machine in order to take care of the work in the laundry. With the staff, we have over two hundred persons whose clothing have to be taken care of.\n\nI was over at the War Asset warehouses in Vancouver recently. They have a lot of material there that we need in the worst way. Chairs and tables and kitchen and diningroom equipment. Our chairs in the Assembly Hall have been knocked around for twenty years, and are the cheap collapsible kind. They have hundreds of these at the war assets at two dollars each. We need fifty very urgently.\n\nIt takes every bit of the grant allowance to feed and clothe, pay salaries, which are higher than ever before, and all the rest of the general expenses. We simply cannot buy the things which I have mentioned and which we need so urgently.\n\nCan you do anything for us to relieve the situation. The work is going along fine. I have good workers, and I want to keep them. You want our work to be a success. Please, if you can possibly do something for us, we would be very grateful.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Phillip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 24, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Hives:\n\nWith reference to your letter of November 2nd, purchase order No. 23770 was placed with Simmons Ltd., Montreal, Quebec, on October 24th, 1947, for twelve single institutional beds, 6 x 3 and twelve mattresses for the above.\n\nWe ordered the size stated as they are much easier to obtain than the smaller size.\n\nIt is regretted that no arrangements can be made for the purchase of blankets.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. Canon C.F. Hives,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Indian Res. School,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nPP/MGD\nRev. Canon C. F. Hives  \nPrincipal\n\nNov. 8, 1947  \nLytton, B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nLast week I wrote you in reference to our urgent need of certain articles. Mention was made of a kitchen range to replace the one we now have, and which is quite inadequate to meet the demands made on the kitchen.\n\nSince writing you I have been over to the War Assets warehouses in Vancouver. I was shown a large kitchen range with two fire boxes and four large ovens. This range would suit our purpose very well. I have no doubt such a range would cost, when new, in the neighbourhood of two thousand dollars, and which we could purchase for $500.00. It is in excellent shape. The man in charge has reserved it for us pending a reply from you to this letter.\n\nThey have also much kitchen ware material and other articles urgently needed here to replenish and replace articles that have worn out or have been broken during the war years.\n\nWould it be possible to have $800.00 at this time for the purpose of purchasing the kitchen range and other articles for the kitchen, dining-room, and collapsible chairs for the assembly hall. Is that amount available in New England Company funds? I am confident that it would be worth while securing these articles at once if at all possible.\n\nI would be very much obliged if you would send me a wire authorizing me to make these purchases from War Assets, to be paid for from New England Company funds made available in the future.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6465, file 333-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, November 25, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Hives:\n\nI regret that there has been some delay in answering your letter of November 8th.\n\nIt is impossible for us to provide $800.00 out of our current year's appropriation as it has been practically all assigned due to very heavy demands throughout the country.\n\nHowever, if you are able to finance it yourself at the present time we have no objection to you spending $800.00 on the items mentioned in your letter, and as soon as the next payment from the New England Company is received, the $800.00 will be sent to you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

For Waterback see page 13.\n\nFor Specifications see Page 15.\nDear Major McKay:\n\nWe are very urgently in need of certain equipment in our school. The most of which can be purchased from War Assets Corporation, if those in charge of sales are approached in the right way, and immediately. I have already investigated this matter with War Assets, and have quotations at hand, which are extremely attractive and reasonable. Moreover, the chance of a lifetime presents itself in this matter, because the material in question is of the very best procurable, and in the ordinary way would be prohibitive to our limited finances.\n\nOur kitchen range is an ancient one, which, I understand, was taken out of the old school over twenty years ago. I can buy one from War Assets, a replica of the cut attached, for $150.00. I have priced this range at the factory, and find it to be worth, new, over $700.00. The one at War Assets is good as new. A steam cooker, which would be of tremendous value in our kitchen. Made of cast aluminum and equipped with necessary valves and stand, would be worth approximately $200.00 new, I can buy for $50.00 from War Assets. Kitchen equipment, consisting of six six gallon cast aluminum pots, five eight gallon cast aluminum pot without faucets, two gallon kettles, platters, dishpans, jugs, pans of all descriptions for kitchen use. Three hundred new white enamel plates, cups, soup bowls, etc., etc. For the most part still in their factory cases, and valued by the Sales Supervisor at $350.00 bottom factory prices, I can buy the lot for $150.00. White enamel beds, such as we require in our school. (Twelve of our pupils have been sleeping on the floor for over a month.) I can buy these beds for $6.00 each. Mattresses, new, in bundles of ten, I do not know the price, but I think they would be $5.00 each. Chairs, collapsible for Assembly Hall $150.00 each.\n\nI would be very much obliged if you would present this matter to the Department, as something most urgent, and I would appreciate very much immediate action.\nas the chance will not last for long, and our need is very urgent.\n\nSometime ago, the Department sent me a cheque for the amount of $1,500.00 from New England Company fund. It came at a time when we had to admit fifty new pupils, and much clothing etc was required for them. I am telling you this, in case mention should be made of this grant.\n\nFor the purchasing of the material described above, we need six hundred dollars. If that sum is available from New England Company funds, I do not know if any better or more profitable use that could be made of it, and would respectfully ask that a special grant for the amount of $600.00 be made.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nCommissioner of Indians for B.C.,\nVancouver.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am enclosing a letter dated November 22nd from Rev. Canon C. F. Hives, Principal, St. George's Indian Residential School, wherein he asks that the Department make a special grant of $600 either from New England Company funds or from appropriation for the purchase of the following listed items which he considers are urgently required at the school and which are immediately available from the War Assets Corporation at prices considerably less than their actual value:\n\n(1) One only Gurney 3-oven heavy duty range, condition as new, factory price $700; Available for ...........................................$150.00\n\n(2) One only cast aluminum steam cooker with valves and stand, price when new approx. $200..................................................$ 50.00\n\n(3) Kitchen equipment, consisting of six 6-gallon cast aluminum pots, five 8-gallon cast aluminum pots without faucets, two gallon kettles, platters, dishpans, jugs, pans of all descriptions for kitchen use. 300 new white enamel plates, cups, soup bowls, etc. Condition new, value $336..................................................$150.00\n\n(4) White enamel beds, at least 12, available at $6.00 each.............................................$ 72.00\n\n(5) Mattresses, new, in bundles of ten. Approx. $5.00 each. Canon Hives does not state how many are required but presumably not less than twenty.............................................$100.00\n(6) Collapsible chairs for Assembly Hall $1.50 each.\n\nThe equipment above referred to is no doubt required at the school, particularly the kitchen range, and it is very unlikely that another opportunity will present itself to secure these articles at such reasonable prices. I would recommend that if at all possible the Department approve an expenditure of $600.00 from New England Company funds, if possible, or otherwise from appropriation.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, November 27, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 25th instant,\nfile 7-11-4, enclosing letter from the principal\nof the St. George's Residential School with re-\nference to purchasing certain equipment that he\nconsiders necessary.\n\nWe received a similar letter from the\nprincipal and he was advised that if he could\nfinance the matter at the present time he could\nbuy the articles mentioned in your letter and\nthat as soon as the next payment is received\nfrom the New England Company the amount would\nbe refunded to him.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nRe: St. George's (Anglican) Indian Residential School, Lytton, British Columbia.\n\nAn Officer from this Division visited the above last March during the course of an extended inspection trip covering the number of schools.\n\nThe Principal, Rev. C.F. Hives, had been advocating the installation of a high pressure boiler feed pump to return condensate to the vertical high pressure laundry boiler, in an effort to overcome the destructive effect of raw make-up water.\n\nThe result of our Officers' inspection confirmed our previously stated opinion that the installation of this pump, is not the proper solution, as only slightly more than 50% of the condensate could be returned, necessitating the introduction of raw make-up water.\n\nFollowing an analysis of the complete data obtained as a result of this inspection, recommendations were made to the Indian Affairs Branch, outlining the installation of suitable water softening apparatus along with certain revisions to the existing boiler room piping and equipment. These recommendations are fully outlined in our memoranda under date of November 20, 1946, and April 11, 1947.\n\nSubsequently Mr. Webb, District Engineer, of Vancouver, was asked to obtain tenders based on plans and specifications prepared by this Division. After a considerable delay occasioned by the reluctance of West Coast contractors to take on additional work at this time, two tenders were received. These tenders were nearly 100% higher than our considered estimate of $4,500.00, and we did not feel justified in recommending that either one be accepted.\n\nIt was felt, however, that some means of protection against hard water should be provided for the high pressure boiler, which is one of the more expensive items of equipment. With this in view, we outlined in a memorandum dated October 22, 1947, a system of feed water treatment consisting of prescribed compound, testing apparatus etc. While this treatment is not to be considered as an alternative to our original recommendation, it would provide a satisfactory measure of protection for the high pressure boiler only, and could be incorporated into the original proposal, at such time as it may be possible to obtain a more favourable price for the entire work.\n\nAs a result, the Indian Affairs Branch authorized this Division to request Mr. Indian Agent Strang to place an order with Goddard & Company of Sidney, Vancouver Island, to supply the necessary boiler compound and testing kit to the school. In this connection we wrote to the Goddard & Company, outlining the requirements. We also wrote to Mr. Indian Agent Strang and Principal C.F. Hives, and we are advising Mr. Webb of the action that is being taken.\n\nR.A.

S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nSt. George's Indian Residential School\n\nInspector Davey's reports upon the classrooms at this school have been noted. It would seem that this residential school is one for which we will have to consider the provision of a classroom block at some future date. We will be in a better position to decide this matter by the time our next year's estimates are being prepared.\n\nInspector Davey's comments concerning the manual training have been drawn to the attention of Mr. Doucet and it is likely that you will hear further from him in this regard. It is suggested that a requisition be forwarded for the type of mangle which is recommended for use in the laundry. The purchase of this will depend largely on the amount of money that is required to re-surface the floors in the boys' senior dormitory. Therefore we will be able to definitely decide about the provision of the mangle when an estimate is obtained as to the cost of re-surfacing the floors. However, we would like to know the approximate cost of the mangle, as recommended.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMay 4, 1948.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nReverend Canon Hives, principal of the St. George's Residential School visited the Department this week.\n\nHe pointed out that the roof of the main building requires repairs and he also recommended that the exterior of the building be painted.\n\nWe have approximately $3,500.00 provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at the St. George's School and I would appreciate it if you could give the matter your early attention and let us have a recommendation regarding what repairs you consider should be made.\n\nIf possible, you should obtain a quotation for the work required in order that we may submit same for the Minister's approval.\n\nPP/MGD\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Repairs - St. George's Residential School\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of May 4th (file 165-0-5 E.I.), I have discussed with Canon Hives the question of repairs and maintenance of the above mentioned school buildings and recently had an opportunity of discussing the matter further with a representative of the Tremco Company. While we have yet to secure all the details it is anticipated that the school management will provide labour for painting the buildings, the Department will be asked to provide the necessary paint and the Tremco Company will tender on material and labour necessary for repairing the roof of the main building.\n\nPaint, and particularly white paint, is in extremely short supply which will necessitate securing small quantities as and when available and it might be necessary for me to ask for authority to purchase small amounts from time to time within a specified total cost. The matter will be the subject of a further communication at an early date.\n\nW. S.

Strang,\nSuperintendent,\nLyttton Indian Agency.\nRev. Canon C. F. Hives  \nPrincipal\n\nSept. 7, 1948  \nLytton, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWill you kindly endorse my request to the Department for the amount of two thousand dollars from New England Company grant for the following purposes:\n\nWe urgently need mattresses and blankets for the dormitory beds. I was able to purchase beds from War Assets Corp. for a very reasonable price, but no mattresses or blankets were available. Our farm truck, which is a very necessary vehicle, and which we use for hauling fuel and goods, has to be either replaced with a new truck, or reconditioned. I would recommend that, under the circumstances, the truck be reconditioned, and the cost will be $650.00. This year, the pupils have come, flocking in, on time; so that we are having to turn some of them away for lack of accommodation. Our present milk supply is hardly adequate enough for the number of children we have; so that we should purchase two more cows. These will cost, at least, $250.00 each. I would also like to renew our old fences, which are in very poor shape. And for this purpose we require wire fencing to the amount of four hundred dollars.\n\nI would be very much obliged if you would present this matter to the Department as soon as possible.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr A.

Strang,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 7th instant, file 14-4, enclosing letter received from the principal of the St. George's Residential School.\n\nIt has been decided to forward the principal a cheque for $2,000.00 from the New England Company funds. This will leave a balance in that fund of $101.36.\n\nBernard F.

C.\n\nForwarded you herewith is a copy of a letter in duplicate addressed to me by the Reverend Principal of St. George's School in connection with certain requirements relative to the electrical wiring in the building.\n\nAs suggested by Rev. Hives, it would appear best that a competent person examine the wiring in the school and a report be submitted.\n\nA. Strang,\nSuperintendent,\nLytton Indian Agency.\n\nAS:B\nSt. George's Indian Residential School\n\nFeb. 21, 1949 Lytton, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am writing you in reference to the electrical wiring system of St. George's School. From one's observations of the workmanship which was put into the construction of this school, I am of the opinion that not too much care was exercised by those responsible, and particularly in connection with the electrical wiring.\n\nIn the whole of the building there was not one wall or floor electrical connection in the way of a receptical installed. Consequently, during the years since the completion of the building, a great deal of amateurish work has been done; and all the staff rooms have extensions connected in some way from the ceiling drop light to their bed or table. This condition is not safe, and I feel sure would not pass the inspection of any fire department or fire insurance underwriter. We have had a very hard winter, and lights have had to be used a great deal, although there are no electrical appliances in the way of heaters etc. in the staff room.\n\nWe have two hundred children in school, and, as you must realize, Indian children are not always responsible for what they do.\n\nI would urgently recommend that an inspection of our whole system be made by an authorized expert, and his findings reported to the Department without delay.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd.) Chas. F. Hives.\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. A. Strang,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nLYTTON, B. C.\nAIR MAIL\n\n19th March, 1949.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th instant, regarding St. George's Residential School, the Department approves of your suggestion of having the wiring inspected by a competent electrical contractor, with a view to obtaining a tender for modernizing the wiring at this school.\n\nBernard F.

I am sorry you have made this decision, as I was hoping that the England Company funds would accumulate sufficiently to enable us to buy a very much needed farm truck. The one we have has been on the go for twelve years, and is now just a bit of expense trying to keep it in repair. We cannot do without it, for all our fuel has to be hauled from the station three miles away, or from the bush twelve miles away.\n\nWe also need the kitchen equipment, which, according to the list sent out by the Department, is equipment which the Department should buy. So far, I have tried in every way to use the New England Company funds for extraordinary expenses. We receive financial help from no other source other than the per capita grant allowance; which, comparing it with that of other schools is no larger than those. We simply cannot run this school much longer on this grant, and keep up repairs and a decent appearance.\n\nI do hope you will reconsider this matter of Kitchen equipment, and allow the New England Company fund to remain intact for the Farm truck.\n\nWill you kindly tell me how much there is in the New England Company fund now.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nColonel E.

S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\nOct. 29, 1949\n\nSecretary,\nPower Commission,\nVictoria.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am writing you to express our deep concern over the light and power situation here at St. George's School. The light is very poor indeed, especially when it is most needed. This is the first time that I have made any complaint about it, but I really think something should be done to improve the situation.\n\nIt seems to me that the plant which supplies the light and power is entirely inadequate and overloaded. We are at the beginning of the dark season of the year. We have to depend so much on it. We have two hundred children in school, and several times we have been thrown in darkness, at very inconvenient times, when we have to take to coal oil lamps and candles. Some years ago the power was off for forty-eight hours, when the temperature at that time happened to be 23 degrees below zero. We have power stokers on the heating plant; you can therefore well imagine our position at that time.\n\nUnless the Power Commission takes the matter in hand, I see no reason why we shall not be subject to the same condition of inconvenience, fire hazard and all that again this winter.\n\nI would respectfully and urgently ask that this matter be treated as paramount importance by your Commission.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nPrincipal.\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nWe have had a very enjoyable visit from the Primate, the Most Rev. Archbishop Kingston and his wife. It was really a very delightful visit, and I feel sure that he enjoyed seeing our school and our work amongst the Indian children. We also had a visit a few days ago from General Turner of the Residential School Administration. He also was very much surprised and pleased with what he saw.\n\nI felt very embarrassed when, during the service, the lights were so poor, we could hardly see to read, and we had to sing without the organ, which being electric, went quite flat.\n\nBut that is not my worst fears. Winter is coming on, and we have some dark, cold nights; and as our heating depends on the electric power to drive the stokers, it would be terrible to have to go through what we experienced the first Winter I was here, when the Spencer's plant failed, and we were without light or power for forty-eight hours, and the temperature was 23 below zero. The plant is over-loaded now, and when these new storages are completed, the load will be increased.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of a letter which I am sending to the Power Commission. I believe a letter from you might add a great deal of weight, so that they would take action.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. Canon C. F. Hives\nPrincipal\n\nMajor D.M.

The 28 foot walls on each end of the dormitories have windows built close together for the full width of the room.\n\nWith the proposed alterations, the two new rooms which are now sewing rooms would be 17\u00bd x 27 x 10 feet. A short wall would have to be built to change these rooms so they could be used as dormitories and the rest of the material would be used for building shelves and cupboards so smaller rooms could be used for sewing rooms.\n\nI enclose quotations on materials required, having been advised by Canon Hives that the work could be done by employees and pupils of the school. Canon Hives also advises that he will also require 20 beds, 5 foot size with mattresses.\nAlthough the air space is not 500 feet per pupil, it is no doubt far more than we find in the average Indian home, and with so much window space in each dormitory I do not think the pupils will suffer from the shortage of space.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD.M.

This, of course, makes the provision of additional dormitory space even more imperative and I would ask that the Department endeavour to make funds to the extent of approximately $400 available and that the Purchasing Agent be requested to secure twenty beds and mattresses, requisition for which is attached hereto.\n\nW.

Your File 7-11-3 (165)\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th ultimo regarding the dimensions of the dormitories at the above school, it is noted that you recommend provision of extra dormitory space. We approve the suggestion contained in your letter and will allow an amount not exceeding $400.00 for the purchase of the material.\n\nIt is noted that Acting Superintendent Hett states that the school management will provide the labour without cost to the Department.\n\nThe present authorized enrolment at this school is 190, and in authorizing extra space it is to be understood by all parties concerned that this is not to be an excuse for enrolling additional pupils. We are simply authorizing this to provide increased accommodation for the number of pupils presently in the school.\n\nWe do not understand the Principal's request for 20 additional beds and mattresses as he has had 190 children in the school for some time, and presumably each of them has had a bed.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST Chief, Education Division\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Your file 888-10 (E1)\n\nFurther to my letter of November 12th in which I requested that the Department endeavour to make available funds to the extent of approximately $400.00 in order to provide additional dormitory accommodation at the St. George's Residential School, I shall appreciate receiving the Department's decision with regard to this request as we are hoping to have the majority of this work completed during the Christmas holidays.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMemorandum to Mr. Webb:\n\nRe: Domestic Water Supply System\nSt. Georges Indian Residential School\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDuring my visit of November 2 to the above mentioned school in connection with an electrical survey, I also made a brief inspection of the domestic water supply system. This system appears to be in an unsanitary sanitary condition, and in need of repairs, since the six inch wood stave supply line running from the reservoir to the school is over twenty years old, is leaking badly in several places, and has had to be repaired frequently during the past two years.\n\nMr. Unsworth's Report of September 11, 1946 regarding the subject\n\nIn general, the whole question of the present water supply system is dealt with in Mr. Unsworth's report on this subject.\n\nSanitary Conditions\n\nAn Indian family holds several acres of land which drain into the creek conveying the water from the present supply spring to the reservoir intake. This makes for unsanitary conditions for the following reasons:\n\n(1) Cattle and horses graze over this land causing possible contamination during the rainy season and irrigation periods.\n\n(2) The ground which is cleared close to the spring from which the water supply is taken, appears to be still used by the Indian family resident on the property above for a laundering and bathing area. As stated in Mr. Unsworth's report, water is heated over a small grate beside the stream. The used water is turned out, to run into the stream feeding the school water supply system.\n\n(3) During the irrigation periods when the ground above is flooded, considerable sediment is washed into the stream, causing the domestic water to become discoloured.\n\nA collecting box connected to a pipe line to feed the present reservoir should improve the unsanitary conditions mentioned above. If, however, it was found that there were still signs of contamination due to percolation through the soil during the rainy seasons or irrigation periods, a chlorinator could then be procured for use during these intervals.\n\nRecommendations\n\nTo put the above mentioned system in order, I would suggest that the following work be done without delay:\n\n(1) A water collecting box at the supply spring be installed as outlined in Mr. Unsworth's report.\n\n------To cost about $500.00\n\n(2) A 4\" No. 12 gauge spiral welded steel pipe asphalt dipped, asbestos felt wrapped, be laid from the collecting\nbox to the present reservoir.\n\n------- To cost about $2,500.00\n\n(3) A 6\" No. 12 gauge spiral welded steel pipe, asphalt dipped, asbestos felt wrapped, be laid from the reservoir to the school.\n\n------- To cost about $3,250.00\n\n(4) A 6\" No. 12 gauge spiral welded steel pipe, asphalt dipped, asbestos felt wrapped, be laid to connect the fire hydrants to the main supply.\n\n------- To cost about $1,250.00\n\nTotal cost is about $8,200.00\n\nThe protected steel pipe which has an expected life of 40 years, against 20 to 25 years for wood stave pipe, has been recommended since the school is a permanent structure and, as stated by the Indian Commissioner for this Province, is expected to be used for a long period. An approximate breakdown of the costs for items 2, 3 and 4 is attached.\n\nThomas A.G.

Beeching of the Engineering and Construction Division and you will note from Mr. Beeching's memorandum of December 5th, copy of which is attached, that repairs are estimated to cost $8,200. I think it is apparent that improvements to this system cannot be delayed any longer and I would ask that consideration be given to providing the necessary funds immediately after April 1st so that the work may be proceeded with under the supervision of the Engineering Branch.\n\nW.S.

Hastings St.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDecember 5, 1946.\n\nMemorandum to Mr. Webb:\n\nRe: Domestic Water Supply System\nSt. Georges Indian Residential School\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDuring my visit of November 2 to the above mentioned school in connection with an electrical survey, I also made a brief inspection of the domestic water supply system. This system appears to be in an unhealthy sanitary condition and in need of repairs, since the six inch wood stave supply line running from the reservoir to the school is over twenty years old, is leaking badly in several places, and has had to be repaired frequently during the past two years.\n\nMr. Unsworth's Report of September 11, 1946 Regarding the Subject\n\nIn general, the whole question of the present water supply system is dealt with in Mr. Unsworth's report on this subject.\n\nSanitary Conditions\n\nAn Indian family holds several acres of land which drain into the creek conveying the water from the present supply spring to the reservoir intake. This makes for unsanitary conditions for the following reasons:\n\n(1) Cattle and horses graze over this land causing possible contamination during the rainy season and irrigation periods.\n\n(2) The ground which is cleared close to the spring from which the water supply is taken, appears to be still used by the Indian family resident on the property above for a laundering and bathing area. As stated in Mr. Unsworth's report, water is heated over a small grate beside the stream. The used water is turned out, to run into the stream feeding the school water supply system.\n\n(3) During the irrigation periods when the ground above is flooded, considerable sediment is washed into the stream, causing the domestic water to become discoloured.\n\nA collecting box connected to a pipe line to feed the present reservoir should improve the unsanitary conditions mentioned above. If, however, it was found that there were still signs of contamination due to percolation through the soil during the rainy seasons or irrigation periods, a chlorinator could then be procured for use during these intervals.\nRecommendations\n\nTo put the above mentioned system in order, I would suggest that the following work be done without delay:\n\n(1) A water collecting box at the supply spring be installed as outlined in Mr. Unsworth's report.\n\n-------To cost about $600.00\n\n(2) A 4\" No. 12 gauge spiral welded steel pipe asphalt dipped, asbestos felt wrapped, be laid from the collecting box to the present reservoir.\n\n-------To cost about $2,500.00\n\n(3) A 6\" No. 12 gauge spiral welded steel pipe, asphalt dipped, asbestos felt wrapped, be laid from the reservoir to the school.\n\n-------To cost about $3,850.00\n\n(4) A 6\" No. 12 gauge spiral welded steel pipe, asphalt dipped, asbestos felt wrapped, be laid to connect the fire hydrants to the main supply.\n\n-------To cost about $1,250.00\n\nTotal cost is about $8,200.00\n\nThe protected steel pipe which has an expected life of 40 years, against 20 to 25 years for wood stave pipe, has been recommended since the school is a permanent structure and, as stated by the Indian Commissioner for this Province, is expected to be used for a long period. An approximate breakdown of the costs for Items 2, 3, and 4 is attached.\n\n'sgd' Thomas A. G. Beeching\n744 W. Hastings St.,\nVancouver, B.C.,\nDecember 6, 1949.\n\nW.S.

Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI would like to take this opportunity of explaining the method of figuring our prices on the Request for Quotation under the above file number. The quantity of pipe required will total approximately 31,000 lbs., and I have therefore figured the 50,000-lb. carload rate, paying head weight on the 19,000 lbs. additional. This means a saving in freight over l.c.l. shipment of approximately 10 cents per foot and 12 cents per foot, respectively, on the two items quoted.\n\nTRANSITE Pressure Pipe is furnished in standard thirteen ft. lengths, with up to ten per cent. of the total footage allowable in random lengths, but no length less than seven feet. All pipes are machined at each end for Simplex Couplings. Up to four percent of the footage may be furnished, if desired, in standard fractional lengths machined over all without extra charge.

C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI would like to take this opportunity of explaining the method of figuring our prices on the Request for Quotation, under the above file number. The quantity of pipe required will total approximately 31,000 lbs., and I have therefore figured the 50,000-lb. carload rate, paying dead weight on the 19,000 lbs. additional. This means a saving in freight over l.c.l. shipment of approximately 10 cents per foot and 12 cents per foot, respectively, on the two items quoted.\n\nTRANSITE Pressure Pipe is furnished in standard thirteen ft. lengths, with up to ten per cent. of the total footage allowable in random lengths, but no length less than seven feet. All pipes are machined at each end for Simplex Couplings. Up to four per cent of the footage may be furnished, if desired, in standard fractional lengths machined over all without extra charge. The prices quoted include one Simplex Coupling and two Rubber Rings with each length of pipe.\n\nThis quotation is made subject to acceptance within thirty (30) days from this date and subject to our ability to ship. If we should be unable to ship within one hundred and fifty (150) days from the date of our receipt of your acceptance of this quotation, the portion of the material unshipped after one hundred and fifty days will be invoiced at prices in effect at the time of shipment, unless previously cancelled by you.\n\nShipment can be made immediately from Toronto Plant, and we have equipment which we will loan to you to install the pipe. I will be glad to have one of our engineers be on hand to start the job, in order to assist you in every way.\n\nIf we can assist you in any manner, please do not hesitate to call.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nL.

Service of the Indian Commissioner's Office, in writing, that the work is ready for inspection at such time as will permit of inspection being made before any work or portion thereof is liable to be concealed.\n\nWhen the contractor reports, in writing, that the installation is completed and ready for acceptance, an operation test shall be made by the contractor in the presence of a representative from the E. & C. Service to ascertain whether it complies with the specifications and contract. Should it fail to do so, the contractor shall at once remedy all defects. The contractor shall have a representative present during all tests. Final acceptance by the E. & C. Service will be given within ten days after completion and final tests if the installation is found to comply in all respects with the specification and plan.\n\nA Guarantee:\n\nThe contractor shall furnish a guarantee covering all labour and material for a period of one year from the date of final acceptance of his work and shall agree to repair and make good, at his expense, any and all defects which may develop in his work during that time, if, in the judgment of the E. & C. Service such defects arise from defective workmanship or materials.\n\nElectrical Current:\n\n2300V 60 cycle three phase current will be obtained from the local power company at a point about 600' distant from the main school building, where a pole top disconnect switch is to be installed.\n\nMetering:\n\nThe contractor is to install the following meters in conjunction with the B.C. Electric Power Company:\n\nMain School Building, Church, Manual Training Building and Cannery.\n\nThe metering of the single phase three wire lighting power and the three phase motor power for the above-mentioned buildings shall be accomplished by two meters, located in the main school building.\n\nFarm Buildings\n\nThe metering of the single phase three wire lighting power supplying these buildings shall be accomplished by a meter connected to the secondary side of a pole mounted transformer supplying these buildings.\n\nStaff Residences\n\nThe five residences shall be fitted with individual outside mounted meters.\n\nOutside Distributing System:\n\nGeneral:\nGeneral:\n\nThe contractor is to erect and install an outside primary distribution system with a secondary network, and service wires as shown on Plate I of Plan 106. The British Columbia Electric Power Company will supply the transformers and make the necessary installation and connections for the transformers at the poles upon which they are mounted. This entire system is to be installed in a manner to conform with the rules for the construction of overhead electric lines in British Columbia, passed by Order in Council under the \"Electrical Energy Inspection Act\" 1922.\n\nPoles:\n\nThe poles are to be winter cut and conform to Class \"B\" specifications of the B.C. Electric Power Company's Code. Each pole must be given a good brush coat of creosote on the butt, for a distance of seven feet from that end.\n\nPoles supporting both primary and secondary feeders are to have a minimum length of 40 feet and those supporting the secondary feeders alone are to be not shorter than 35 feet.\n\nSetting of Poles:\n\nIn normal firm ground the poles must be set to a depth of 6 feet and 5 feet respectively according to their length.\n\nIn digging and excavating pole holes, as little material as possible in excess of that necessary to admit and erect the pole is to be removed or disturbed. The diameter of holes dug in earth must be the same from top to bottom and sufficiently large to permit the use of a tamping bar on all sides of the pole.\n\nPoles are to be set to stand perpendicular when the line is completed so that no pole is more than 2\u00b0 out of line with the others. Poles at line terminals, angles and other points of abnormal stress are to be given a slight rake against the direction of the stress. Poles with a bend are to be placed with the bend in the direction of the line.\n\nIn straight runs alternate poles are to be set facing in opposite directions. Poles next to corner poles are to face the corner. Poles next to end poles are to face the end of the line.\n\nAfter a pole is in position, only one shovel is to be used in filling the hole, while three tampers continuously tamp until the hole is completely filled. When available, small size rocks should be used in the filling.\n\nGuying:\n\nGuys are to be installed wherever the wires tend to pull a pole or cross-arm out of place and when installed are to take up all of the strain so that the pole acts merely as a strut. The only exception to this rule is to be for angles up to ten degrees, when poles which carry not more than 4 No. 6 wires or 2 No. 4 wires are to be raked and the ordinary straight line construction used.\n\nLine Grading:\n\nThe length of the poles, if possible, is to be so proportioned to the contour of the ground that the difference between the level of the wires on adjacent poles shall not change by more than 10 feet.\n\nGround Clearance of Secondary Distribution Lines:\n\nThese lines shall have a minimum clearance of 20 feet to ground at the poles and no less than 18 feet to ground at any point over their span lengths.\n\nRacks:\nRacks:\n\nAll secondary distribution and service connection wires are to be supported on the poles by racks to give 3\" spacing between conductors. The racks should be attached to the poles by means of a 5/8\" through bolt at the top and a 1/2\" lag screw at the bottom as long as no service feeders are attached, in which case 5/8\" through bolts must be used at both points of attachment.\n\nPrimary Distribution Lines:\n\nThe existing supply wire is to be utilized for the primary distribution lines which will be carried on crossarms.\n\nSecondary Distribution Lines:\n\nThese lines are to be #4 Medium Hard Drawn Double Braided Weather Proof Wire.\n\nTransformers:\n\nThe transformers are to be of capacities as shown on Plate 1. Each transformer is to be protected by two expulsion cutouts fused appropriately adequately grounded, and mounted on the poles located on the above-mentioned drawing.\n\nClearance to Buildings:\n\nThe distribution lines are to be not less than five feet in a horizontal direction or eight feet in a vertical direction from any window, balcony or other part of any building.\n\nService Conductors:\n\nThe minimum size for the service conductors to the homes or other buildings is to be #6 Double Braided Weather Proof wire supported at the structure at a distance of not less than 15 feet from the ground level or sidewalk by end connectors.\n\nService Drops:\n\nThe service drops in all the outlying buildings, other than the Manual Training Building are to be No. 8 Thermoplastic-covered single braided wire carried in a 1/2\" galvanized conduit. Those in the Manual Training Building and Church are to be installed as shown on the plans. The service entrance cables are to be equipped with an approved rain type service head. Drip loops are to be formed on each conductor and a minimum of 30\" left for splicing.\nMemorandum to Mr. Arneil:\n\nRe: Modification and Renewal to the Electrical System - St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, B.C.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn accordance with your instructions, I visited St. George's Indian Residential School on November 2nd, 1949, to inspect the electrical system at the school and obtain sufficient information to draw up plans to improve the lighting in the class rooms and also bring the entire system up to date to meet the requirements of the B.C. Electrical Code.\n\nGeneral Existing Conditions\n\n(1) The illumination in the class rooms, sewing room, manual training shop, kitchen, etc., was entirely inadequate.\n(2) The electrical distribution system to the main school and adjacent buildings is in poor condition, since the poles are badly decayed, and should be replaced.\n(3) The service entrance panels in all buildings are ungrounded.\n(4) The wire and conduit runs in the farm buildings in most cases are partially pulled down and many of the existing fixtures broken.\n(5) The wiring runs in the staff homes are in poor condition, the fixtures inadequate and not installed in accordance with B.C. Code requirements.\n(6) The staff rooms in the main school building have no utility outlets. At present, drop cords in most cases have been connected to the ceiling fixtures in a precarious manner.\n\nIn general, the entire system is in poor condition and requires many modifications. With this in mind, the attached specification and plans have been drawn up to bring the installation up to first class shape.\n\nProposed Alterations\n\nMain Supply Distribution System\n\nTo be rebuilt and modified as shown on the attached plans.\n\nMain School Block\n\n(1) New light and power service boxes and installations to be installed to feed the main school building, manual training building, and Church.\n\n(2) New multi-breaker panels to be installed to feed all circuits.\n\n(3) Fluorescent lights to be installed in class rooms, sewing room, staff dining room, scullery and kitchen.\n\n(4) Utility receptacles to be installed in the staff quarters.\n\n(5) Domestic purpose receptacles to be installed in laundry and sewing room.\n\n(6) Any existing fixtures in disrepair to be repaired or replaced.\n\n(7) Wiring is to be run in \u00bd\" conduit using #14 gauge Theroplastic wire except as shown on plans.\n(8) Fire escape and exit lighting, and fire alarm system shall be installed as hereinafter specified.\n\n(9) The entire system to be modified to conform with the B.C. Electrical Code requirements.\n\n**Manual Training Building**\n\n(1) New light and power service box assemblies to be installed.\n\n(2) New multi-breaker panels to be installed to feed all circuits.\n\n(3) Fluorescent lights to be installed in the class room and manual training room.\n\n(4) Utility outlets and motor outlets to be installed as shown on plan. All permanent motors to be solidly connected.\n\n(5) Any existing fixtures in disrepair to be repaired or replaced.\n\n(6) Single phase circuits to be run with #14 ga. wire except as shown on plans.\n\n(7) The entire system to be modified to conform to the B.C. Electrical Code requirements.\n\n**Church Building**\n\n(1) Multi-breaker panel to be installed to feed all circuits.\n\n(2) Lamp holders to be replaced in basement outlets.\n\n(3) Any existing fixtures in disrepair to be repaired or replaced.\n\n**Farm Buildings and Teachers' Residences**\n\n(1) Each of the above-mentioned group of buildings is to be provided with a new service entrance installation with multibreaker panel.\n\nThe following is a list of the buildings with a general resume of the work required to bring their electrical installations to satisfactory standards.\n\nFor full details see appropriate plans attached to this report.\n\n**Cannery**\n\nTo be completely rewired in conduit with water-tight fixtures. Juicer to be wired with R.W. or T.W. wire.\n\n**Blacksmith Shop**\n\nTo be almost completely rewired in conduit.\n\n**Root House**\n\nTo be completely rewired in conduit using R.W. or T.W. wire.\n\n**Dairy Building**\n\n(1) Service entrance and multi-breaker panel to be installed.\n\n(2) Water-tight switches and one water-tight receptacle to be installed. R.W. or T.W. wire to be used.\n\n(3) Water-tight lamp holders to be repaired or replaced.\n\n**Dairy Office**\nDairy Office\nTo be completely re-wired in non-metallic sheathed cable.\n\nPig Barn\nTo be completely wired in conduit with water-tight fittings, and R.W. or T.W. wire.\n\nGranary\nTo be completely re-wired.\n\nHorse Barn\n(1) Service entrance and multibreaker panel to be installed.\n(2) Water-tight switches and light fixtures to be installed. R.W. or T.W. wire to be used.\n\nDairy Barn\n(1) Service entrance and multi-breaker panel to be installed.\n(2) Water-tight fixtures installed throughout, and R.W. or T.W. wire to be used.\n(3) Existing conduit requires additional supporting brackets.\n(4) Compressor motor required connecting.\n\nNo. 1 Chicken House\n(1) Service entrance and multibreaker panel to be installed.\n(2) Switches and lamp holders to be overhauled.\n\nNo. 2 Chicken House\nTo be completely re-wired in non-metallic sheathed cable.\n\nStaff Residences (4)\n(1) Service entrance and multibreaker panels to be installed.\n(2) Utility outlets to be installed and wired with #12 ga. wire.\n(3) Most of the homes will have to be considered as being entirely re-wired since the fixtures, switches and connections are in such poor condition that it will take as much time to modify the electrical system in these homes as it would to completely re-wire them.\n\nMETERING\n\nMain School Building, Church, Manual Training Building, and Cannery\nThe metering of the single phase three-wire lighting power and the three phase motor power for the above-mentioned buildings will be accomplished by two meters, one for each supply.\n\nFarm Buildings\nThe meterings of the single phase three-wire lighting power supplying these buildings will be accomplished by a meter connected to the secondary side of a pole mounted transformer supplying these buildings.\n\nStaff Residences\nStaff Residences\n\nEach residence will be fitted with an outside mounted meter.\n\nRates\n\nThe Residential School is presently supplied with electric power by the Lytton Electric Company which will be taken over within two months by the B.C. Electric Power Company.\n\nThe B.C. Electric Power Company has not definitely set its rates for diesel generated electric power in this territory. However, tentatively it is expected the rates charged to the school will be approximately as given below:\n\nLighting and 230V Single Phase Power - Commercial Rate\n\n0 - 1000 K.W. @ 6.5\u00a2 per K.W. Hr.\n1000 - 2000 K.W. @ 4.5\u00a2 per K.W. Hr.\n2000 - @ 2\u00a2 per K.W. Hr.\n\nThree Phase 230V Power\n\n0 - 300 K.W. @ 5\u00a2 per K.W. Hr.\n300 - 0 @ 2\u00a2 per K.W. Hr.\n\nDomestic Rate for Homes with Individual Meters\n\n0 - 30 @ 6.5\u00a2 per K.W. Hr.\n30 - 230 @ 2\u00a2 per K.W. Hr.\n\nRecommendations\n\nIt is recommended that the work suggested above be carried out this summer as outlined in the accompanying plans and specifications to eliminate the fire hazard which presently exists and provide the classrooms and staff accommodation, etc., with modern light and power facilities when the school re-opens in the fall term. To initiate this project, tenders should be obtained in the near future from several reliable electrical contractors.\n\nThomas A.G.
