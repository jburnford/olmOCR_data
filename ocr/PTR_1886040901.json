Mr. McIlwain.\n\nFRIDAY, APRIL 9, 1886.\n\nA CRINGE NECESSITY.\n\nThe commercial community here are under considerable discomfiture owing to the want of a money order office. It is almost incredible to think a town of this size and size of Prince Albert has to get its money under the registered letter system but such is the case. As a business centre Prince Albert takes the lead in the Northwest and thousands of dollars are sent forward to the various branches in the express line. The responsibility attached to money sent per registered letter is not very widely known throughout the community. The government pledges itself to the money order system but they are in no way bound to restore the full amount of the lost cash. The Registered Office has been closed for two weeks and we have heard nothing from Ottawa about the establishment of a Post Office here. It is badly needed and with such an institution in our midst another crying necessity will disappear.\n\nMILITARY DESERTIONS.\n\nUnfortunately for the poor tax payer a \"poor\" was recently arrested for deserting his post. He was found sleeping in a ditch near the railway station. Under a constitutionally government a semblance of control over the national purse strings rests with the electorate, but even when the utmost vigilance is exercised occasional flaws will creep into the tender people's discordancy very discordant indeed. We are led to make these remarks over the desertion of Sunday. If said desertions were the all and only all we could afford to let the matter off with a modest local, but we have the best reason for believing that the runaways on Sunday are the very initials of a serious matter.\n\nThe men who took French leave are J. Thompson, D. H. McKenzie, J. Baird and J. C. Alliston. Very probably the boys were tired of the trees but of the pernicious system which blankets red tape over the back bone cities of the Northwest.\n\nAs a matter of fact there are no barracks here. The men are quartered in the happy-go-lucky frame shells of Goschen and where the nights are spent in the old Government building, may be witnessed by private and staff sergeant moving their bedding down stairs where the Government store sheds its upgrading armament.\n\nOf the officers commanding the Northwest Mounted Police in Prince Albert we have no desire to say one word\u2014not a word derogatory of their noble profession\u2014but we have a public duty performed and that is to denounce the foul language so often used in the mouth of a private would like to claim a hearing.\n\nMen should be treated as men. We are no longer in the Dark Ages when the absolutism of official arbitrary rules the roost. Prince Albert as we noticed last week is a self-governing city. We have never pondered to dispute the party and there are hundreds of little things essentially necessary for the public good that have never received consideration at Ottawa. To use the lawyer's phrase, the \"right of justice and, need of patient waiting we desire to express our feelings on matters deeply concerning the commonwealth of this province.\"\n\nWhy should not Prince Albert have its military barracks? Here we occupy a central position in the Territories\u2014a very important position for our rulers in the event of an emergency. The most important part of all public buildings has as yet received the drafter's notice.\n\nThis is not as it should be. Of the ability and genius of our Canadian soldiers there can be no question, but we fear that in the mind of important State Affairs Sir John A. Macdonald trusts too much to the shallow-minded undertakers who have been converted into possessors for whom they care nothing but well fitted. This feeling as it should naturally exist. Discord is rampant in the neglected portion of the Territories and no man can cast his unanswerably cast on a hard working industrious people will breed wind, the general public of Canada to a matter of pure and simple right.\n\nTo the coming from a few months ago, C. F. P. has been forced to meet a sufficiently strong substantive for Prince Albert, and if the people of the latter grumble occasionally where's the wonder?\n\nThe establishment of a barracks here is no sentimental grievance. It is one touching the people's pockets, and we strongly doubt whether the public will stand the neglect any longer. About a score of other individuals have been tried out in the same manner, and calmer reflection shows that the whole situation we are forced to the conclusion that there is something rotten in the state of Denmark and we have occasion to correct this matter again.\n\nTHE REBELLION TRIALS.\n\nMr. Justice Murray, sitting on Mr. Blake, stated that the total number of halfbreeds committed for trial in connection with the Northwest Rebellion was 47. Eighteen of them were convicted of treason felony, one for high treason, one for sedition, and seven were charged on their own confession, from which confessions, eight were discharged to appear again when called for, one, Mr. Ashby, was discharged on the motion of Mr. Middleton, and two others, who were brought before trial and were found to have been tried before, were discharged. The proceedings being discontinued on no further action, for others were discharged. Of the Indians, forty-four were sentenced to various terms mostly all treason felony\u2014one was for manslaughter, three for arson, five for forgery, one for coin stealing, one for breaking and entering, two were convicted of treason felony. Ten were discharged on promising to come appear when required. In the case of one charge with treason felony no evidence was elicited and he was discharged; three were convicted. Five of the Indians charged with various crimes were discharged. Two who were charged with stealing appear to have been discharged, one's name not known. Of the whites, two were held for trial, one W. H. Jackson, accused of treason felony, and one for assault on the ground of insanity. T. Scott, accused of the same, was acquitted.\n\nQU'APPELLE.\n\nFrom the Editor.\n\nThe assessor, Mr. E. Buchanan, has started on his rounds.\n\nThere has been a great improvement in the seating accommodation of the Town Hall.\n\nMr. G. Gould has purchased from Mr. Macdonald, Nelson, the large stable on Company Avenue, near the river.\n\nThe mill is again running order, and being fitted with the most improved machinery, the settlers can rely on getting first class flour.\n\nThe warm weather of Tuesday has almost cleared the valley of snow; but yesterday afternoon came with a blizzard from the northwest.\n\nWe learn that Mr. Tanner is about to open a new school at the Indian Head in the near future. The probabilities are that the college will open with sixteen students.\n\nPROCLAMATION.\n\n[Proclamation by the Governor General of Canada.]\n\nCall and examine before purchasing elsewhere.\n\nDRY LUMBER.\n\nMOORE & MACDOWALL\n\nWish to inform the Public that they have on hand and for sale a Half Million Feet of Dry Lumber, consisting of Matched, Dressed and Undressed.\n\nDressed Flooring, $48\nUndressed do., 42\nDressed Siding, 48\nUndressed do., 42\nSheeting, 30\nCommon Lumber, 35\nDimension do., 40\n\nOver 15 feet extra.\n\nLath, 75 cts. per bundle.\n\nShingles, $6.50 per M.\n\nWe are prepared to Contract for Buildings as cheaply as any firm in Town.\n\nBuilders paying Cash or giving good security for LARGE Orders, will have a reduction made.\n\nJ.

The Tailoring Department will be superintended by Mr. Tanner.\nCOMMUNICATIONS.\n\nTHE MAIL ROUTE QUESTION.\n\nTo the Editor of The Times:\n\nSir,\u2014While thanking you for the publication of my last letter on the mail route question, will you be good enough to state whether or not your statement that \"a particular standpoint\" is a little disquieting.\n\nIn the arguments in favor of the proposed new route commend themselves to the people of Prince Albert, it does not matter how strongly they may be advanced. The motives which prompt them may be of the most necessary and salutary character; if the result were a practical benefit to the general public, then they deserve public consideration. You might just as well argue that the Princess Royal should have no weight in moulding public opinion and thought in a community where the influence of personal opinions had influenced its policy and was embarking in the enterprise. I realize the difficulty and fallacy of such an argument, but opinions which are so devoid, as they would seem to be, of all reasonable considerations and entirely removed from \"a particular standpoint,\" but at the risk of creating a little misunderstanding, I must honestly tell you, that I fail to see any argument in your article against the adoption of the new route. We all recognize the importance of having the prospect of a railroad to Prince Albert, we are equally disposed to credit the possibility of the enterprise being brought to the enterprise of the town assisted by government patronage, and so far as the question is concerned, the question of having had a right of railroad communication with the C. P. R., but all that is past. The question of the Prince Albert and Long Lake would not be a substantial benefit to the town, as it certainly would not be to the people of Long Lake, as you say, it is extremely problematical that a main line of track will be laid on the Long Lake route, and that the whole scheme falls to the ground. No further agitation is necessary, but it seems to me useless to continue to expend our time and money in pursuing a course which the present plan of a change would not have answered.\n\nThat the people of Prince Albert are anxious to see a railroad built through their town is not consonant with the notion that they are an enterprising, energetic and a self-supporting people. It is the story of the legend of the farmer who went to the mill with his grain in order to get flour, and a stone in the other hand, and came back with a load of flour, because his father and grandfather before him had done the same thing. While the connection between Long Lake and Prince Albert is \"straight and short,\" will require more than the expenditure of a few thousand paper pieces to give it weight.\n\nI have already intimated the limits I had intended to lay down, and must now make a declaration of the reasons why I believe the proposed new route possesses advantages not enjoyed by the present one.\n\nPRO EDO PUBLICO.\n\nOUR NAME.\n\nThe report of the Board of Trade for 1885, shows that the land thereon has been purchased for the exclusive purposes which have been mentioned, and that the same has been used for the purpose of the original purpose of the Board of Trade.\n\nMr. Macdonald reports that the new route into the country by last spring's troubles have been thoroughly examined and found to be practicable. The route is now open to the occupation, and has been used for the purpose of sending large amounts of goods to the interior. The route is now being used extensively for the purpose of connecting with educational purposes, but the fact is that this has been the case for many years, and the difficulties which have arisen at various points have been overcome during the past year, and the result has been very satisfactory.\n\nFrom the Report.\n\nWe understand that the Queen is going to celebrate her jubilee year by opening all the houses of the crown, and inviting the people to visit them. This will be a great opportunity for the people to see what the crown is doing for them.\n\nThe Prince Albert Times\n\nAND\n\nSAASKTCHewan REVIEW.\n\n$2 50 PER ANNUM.\n\nThe Times is the best medium in the Territory to advertise your business in.\n\nSubscribe for The Times and get the latest news and happenings around town.\n\nJOB PRINTING\n\nOf all descriptions done neatly, quickly and cheaply\n\nJ.

BAYTON.\nTHE MILITIA REPORT.\n\nThe report of the general officer commanding the militia is an excellent one. He recommends the formation of one or two corps of mounted infantry for Manitoba. Mr. Macdonald, in his report, says that the present militia force does not rank among other militia officers of the same rank; in consequence of the imperfect organization that prevails, that the old language is being withdrawn and the value of the militia is much lessened than it was before. Better methods are needed that will substitute for the present bad habits; and a religious spirit of patriotism should be cultivated by the militia. The militia should be drilled regularly every year, and in increasing the strength of the militia, the government should be encouraged to make the militia more efficient.\n\nWM.
