Mr. Macdonald lost the election by a large majority, but there is no occasion to suspect that the municipal councils of the town have been treated with disrespect. Mr. Macdonald is in every way qualified to fill the chair, and he will have in the other members of the council men who are fitted to assist him. However, we shall not predict great things for the Council, preferring to rely upon them by their acts rather than run the risk of sharing the fate of the popular Waggons.\n\nTHE DIFFERENCE\n\nThe hollow sound of the assertion that it makes little difference to the Northwest what party is in power at Ottawa may be heard in almost every quarter, and the fact that free trade would have the cattle interests of the Northwest. How would the poor struggling farmers, so few head of cattle, ever be able to compete with the American cattle kings? How could it be that before the Northwest went to the polls, the prices of beef and dairy products would reach record rates? During the campaign of the North-Western Council, it will be remembered, Major Logan, manager of an American cattle company, visited Prince Albert with the purpose of inducing the Council to exert their influence with the Dominion Government to prevent the importation of American cattle and the price of beef and dairy products would reach record rates? During the campaign of the North-Western Council, it will be remembered, Major Logan, manager of an American cattle company, visited Prince Albert with the purpose of inducing the Council to exert their influence with the Dominion Government to prevent the importation of American cattle and the price of beef and dairy products would reach record rates? During the campaign of the North-Western Council, it will be remembered, Major Logan, manager of an American cattle company, visited Prince Albert with the purpose of inducing the Council to exert their influence with the Dominion Government to prevent the importation of American cattle and the price of beef and dairy products would reach record rates?\n\nALLEGED HALF-BREEDS\n\nAs a result of a meeting as was held to provide the effect of the recent testimony of twenty-five Halibreed residents of the South Branch, who assert that but for Red River they would have no more rebellion, the Globe of December 31st insinuates that the affair is \"purely\" part of the scheme of the alleged Saskatchewan Halfbreeds. As yet no one has been able to give the geographical position of the claimants of the Halibreed movement, although they are all personally known to many of the residents of Prince Albert, the weaknesses of the affair's plot are evident, and its prifal inability. But since that journal claims at the same time that the evidence given by the Halibreed residents supports its plea that the rebellion was caused by the \"corral and callous neglect of the Government,\" it seems at a loss how to know what should seek to defend their effect by casting doubt upon their statements. As to the statement of the affidavit, all that can be said is that it cannot be anything in turn to justify petty revenge, much less rebellion. But the Globe is retained by the party, and\n\nEDITORIAL NOTES\n\nIt seems that the Dominion elections will come on immediately, but as the House of Commons generally meets early in the month of February, I think it possible that there can be any foundation for the rumor.\n\nMany of our Northwest contemporaries are anxious for the new Province. Some may ask, \"What is a name?\" There is a great deal in a name, however, when applied to a province or a city. For instance, \"Saskatchewan\" or \"Assiniboia\" are names that have appeared on the map of the world for some time, and either name would set the appearance of the new province point out the location of the Province. We want a name of local significance, and there should be no trouble in settling one. The name \"Prince Albert\" is quite as expressive as the Latin and a good deal better understood in the North.\n\nThe London Times\u2014Speaking of the Northwest, says:\u2014\"Our correspondent has returned from his trip from sea to sea across the Dominion, and he has seen very much. It has been a new world which he has traversed\u2014much like the old world of Europe ten years ago, and a vast opened up for settlement and settlement since the Canadian Pacific Railway has been completed, it joining ocean to ocean, and affording a cheap route to intermediate points. This great railway is in advance of the present state of the country, and will supply in excess of the demand, but tending to create a demand which no one can calculate.\"\n\nTown. Towns are already springing into existence at various stages along the line of the railway, and the prairie is being broken up, and is yielding its potential wealth in unmeasurable quantities of grain, cattle, and general, but it is here. Pass a few years and the whole face of the country will be changed. Towns will have expanded, villages will have grown into towns, and settlements will have numbers peopling up isolated to them. The processes will have been completed, providing the settlers in abundance, and drawing to itself new settlers from among the growing population of the Eastern States. It has been the Canadian Pacific railway that has made the process possible, and will continue its pace as to crowd the work of settlement into the span of a single life.\"\n\nMUNICIPAL ELECTIONS\n\nThe election of Mayor and Councillors took place on Monday last, and resulted in the election of the following gentlemen:\n\nMayor\u2014James Macdonald.\nCouncillors\u2014H.

Hopes are entertained that they are forerunners of a more substantial body of Indians in the troop. Should the proposed extension of the Regina and Long Lake Railway reach Naskatoon, it will be an important place, not only as the crossing point of the South Saskatchewan, but also as a port of entry. Indians at the present time are very scarce owing to increasing imports of horses and cattle from the States.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, the 15th, a very pleasant social gathering was entertained at the house of Mr. Andrews. During the evening Mr. Andrews' \"sea\" house,\" Mr. Andrews, as hostess, surpassed her usual entertaining powers, and the party enjoyed the evening in anticipation of what it could not be prolonged.\n\nMr. Gerald Willoughby, brother of Mr. Willoughby, formerly a resident of Naskatoon, arrived here last week with an outfit of goods. He intends opening a store in a few days.\n\nMr. Gurney's new stone hotel is now finished and will be opened in a few days. It is a two-story building, but should it become popular demand, it is not anticipated that it will be able to accommodate all guests.\n\nThe telephonic communication with Clark's Crossing is not yet opened owing to a want of wire and poles. It is to be hoped that this want will soon be supplied, as at present owing to the badly managed fortnightly mail we are practically cut off from the outside world.\n\nBATTLEFORD.\n\nThe Herald of Dec. 13th says:\n\nThey have a new engine at the barracks, and the work is done by means of wood-pile tips.\n\nMr. Reed, Assistant Indian Commissioner, accompanied by Indian Agent McKay, made a tour of the Indian reserve on Monday.\n\nMenulock and several feet were broken out and spread widely amongst the Indians near the North River reserves. Fever shows signs of spreading into the Cross at Eagle Hills, but though the sickness still affects the exceptions of Mr. H. F. Proctor, the fever has not yet recovered, it was confined to its limits and finally stamped out.\n\nThe annual meeting of the Battleford Rifle Association was held in the schoolhouse on Tuesday evening, the 26th December, when the following officers presented their resignations and the following officers were elected: President, W. H. Scott; 1st Vice-President, F. Collins; 2nd Vice-President, R. A. Macdonald; Secretary, Capt. Nash; Sergeant-Major and Storekeeper, Corporal Ross; Messrs. C. Smith, J. D. Parker, J. H. Head, R. C. Laver, and F. Macnaght.\n\nOne day last week Major Cotton and Lord Strathcona were engaged in being inspected by the troops at Battle Bridge. As they were driving across the bridge, became frightened and jumped over the side of the road, landing fifteen feet below, and, strange to say, without sustaining any serious injury. Before they could get up, however, they got out, and in their haste to do so were pretty well shaken up but not much hurt.\n\nOn Tuesday evening last Major Cotton delivered a lecture in St. George's Church on \"Canada\u2014the past developments and future prospects.\" Mr. Lawrence Clarke acted as chairman, and Col. Spence moved a vote of thanks to the lecturer.\n\nEDMONTON.\n\nThe Bulletin, Dec. 11th, says:\n\nThe weather is fine in the new telegraph line to Fort Saskatchewan.\n\nThe telegraph office has been removed to the new building near J. A. McKeen's sawmill.\n\nThe fur trade has been fairly brisk lately. Prices are very high, having been raised considerably during the past year. The market is good, and there is a great catch of other fur.\n\nThere is a considerable quantity of new wheat, which is universally of excellent quality, but so far they have been principally anxious of wheat at any price. The market is improving, and what is bought will be at something less than $2 a bushel. There are willing buyers at $1.50 to $1.75 a bushel and better at the\n\nLETHBRIDGE.\n\nFrom the News of Dec. 22.\n\nSome of the Indians who have been hanging around town lately started pilfering from the stores. At least three of them were shipped by Mr. Boyd & Co., and sold for $1 to a man on the bottom. Capt. McLeod ordered them off the river on Monday morning, and since then they have been kind of quiet. The Indians have been arrested and confined in custody until the arrival of Capt. McLeod to try him.\n\nThe N. W. C. & N. Co. saw mill sent down for the first season on Saturday last. The mill has been running night and day since it started last July, and has turned out about one mile of lumber. The mill has been used in the building operations between the place and Macleod.\n\nMr. Murray and baby and Lord Boyle were passengers on Sunday evening's train. They went on to Macleod on Tuesday morning.\n\nMEDICINE HAT.\n\nThe Times of Dec. 25th says:\n\nThe biggest wolf story comes from Bowell. Mr. Bowell is authorizing the statement that a man named Staples killed a white wolf weighing 600 pounds.\n\nThe farmer for the benefit of the Presbyterian church building fund was a success. The proceeds amounted to $300.\n\nThree Indians sporting the Blackfoot Indians stole a horse belonging to the Indians who were quartered near the town. Most of the Indians were driven away without accomplishing their purpose.\n\nW. L. Reid lost six head of cattle several days ago. On Wednesday Mr. Geordie came in and reported that he saw a number of Indians that had killed a partly cut up oxen, cattle, and that the work was unmistakably done by Indians.\n\nA hall was given by the new commandant of the officers and members of the N. W. M. P., at this place lately, and was a great success.\n\nThe Hungarians, who were brought here to work in the mines, and were afterwards quartered on the emigrant train, have been sent back to White Rock to take up land this winter. It seems that before they left Hungarian County Emigration and Land Office, etc., etc., it is said that Edmonton has already hinted that the government will not take any of these.\n\nWe are informed that they have killed a large elk east of town on last Saturday night.\n\nCALGARY.\n\nThe Tribune, Dec. 24th says:\n\nTrain No. 2 left Fort on time last night, but encountered a big snow storm. The snow was so deep that the engine was placed on the train and the large engine was attached just to push the train through. But after a while it was found impossible to push it even with the three engines attached. The train was then stopped and the sleeper and first-class car sent up to the safety switch at the top of the hill. The second-class car was started up with the second-class coach and the mail car, and when about half way up the hill the mail car fell off the track and started down the hill at a tremendous speed. There were about twenty persons in the convey, consisting of passengers and baggage. The train was sent to assist in clearing the track. All efforts to stop the cars by the application of the safety switch they arrived at they left the track and the coach was dashed over on its side, breaking the wheels and axles, and which went about 200 yards beyond where the unfortunate coach lay shattered. Mr. J. H. Neville, the owner of the Neville, was so seriously injured that he has since died, but the rest of the passengers escaped with slight injuries.\n\nBeef, Pork, Mutton, Sausages, Bacon, Ham, and Game in Season.\n\nBranch Stalls\u2014Qu'Appelle Station, Fort Qu'Appelle, and Prince Albert.\n\nRUSSELL & DAVIS, BROWN'S BRICK STORE.\n\nMISS MACK & CO.\n\nFirst Door East Telegraph Office.\n\nRUSSELL & DAVIS.\n\nWHOLESALE & RETAIL\n\nButchers.\n\nGAME IN SEASON.\n\nJ.
