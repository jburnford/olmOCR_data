Booth,\nIndian Agent,\nMoose Jaw, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter #102-1-5 dated May 13, 1941, I wish to submit the following report:\n\nThe Day School on the Assiniboine Reserve is possibly one of the outstanding Day schools in the Province, both as regards to the work accomplished and to the average attendance, which is very high considering the distance some of the pupils have to travel to school.\n\nThe Indians on the reserve are very poor as they have had, until this year, nine complete crop failures. This condition has made it very difficult for the parents of the pupils to provide a satisfactory lunch.\n\nThere is no doubt that the lunch provided at the school is very beneficial to the health of the children and if the Department grant us the usual $10.00 per month, the cost per lunch for each child is approximately 1\u00bd cents.\n\nI would be very pleased to receive the authority as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Booth\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept.

It would necessitate an expenditure of $12.00 per month for the five winter months.\n\nThis mid-day meal is of great value to the Indian children as some of them drive over six miles to school and a hot meal is nearly a necessity on cold days, almost no doubt encourages better attendance.\n\nFrank Booth,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, November 9, 1945.\n\nMr. Frank Booth, Indian Agent,\nMuscow, Sask.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant, the Department will allow an amount of $10.00 a month for a period of five months for the purpose of providing supplies for a midday lunch at the Assiniboine School. In addition, we have ordered the usual quantity of biscuits.\n\nThe amount provided for midday lunches is the same as last year. It is reasonable to suppose that, in view of the payment of family allowances, the Indian children will receive better food and quite probably will bring better lunches to school. We are not discontinuing our allowance for midday lunches, but in view of what has just been said, we do not feel that it is necessary to increase the amount over last year's.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION       | PRICE | AMOUNT |\n|----------|------------------|-------|--------|\n| 27       | Taps Towelling   | .25   | 6.75   |\n| 20       |                  | .35   | 7.00   |\n| 1        | Case Lux Toilet Soap |     | 8.25   |\n| 25       | Laundry Soap     | .25   | 6.25   |\n| 1        | Knife            | 1.65  | 1.65   |\n| 1        | Knife            | 2.95  | 2.95   |\n| 6        | Knives           | .19   | 1.14   |\n| 1        | Spoon            | .35   | .35    |\n| 2        | Back             | .45   | .90    |\n| 2        | Pins             | .72   | 1.44   |\n\nTotal: $36.60\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Nov 8 | Goods supplied as per attached L/C for the Assiniboine Day School.

It will be necessary to take out all partitions and stairway, change entrance, build cloak-rooms 14' x 14', build 8 new windows in east wall, new tin roof 10 X 10, repair all plaster, complete paint job, new coal bin in basement, new cupboard, benches and table for 30 pupils, and basement lights.\n\nIt will also be necessary to build three outdoor toilets, the two for the school children will have to have a 30 ft fence erected between them.\n\nMr Erickson tender for this work is $2375.00\n\nThe building that we propose to use for a teacherage will necessitate some alterations and painting, the proposed work and tender is submitted, I may say that the building is in first class shape and will be ideal for such purposes, there also is a furnace in the basement which could be put in good working order for approximately $25.00.\n\nWe have a large implement shed 60 x 26 that is not used and this could be taken down and the most of the material used to build a rat-proof ration house. Mr Erickson has submitted a plan and tender for this work, quoting labor only, I do not consider that the extra material needed to complete the ration house would be over $200.00.\nI am enclosing all plans and tenders from Mr Erickson and also to inform you that Mr Erickson is willing to provide labor only for all this work, the Department providing all material, at the following wages.\n\nForeman: $1.20 per hr\nCarpenters @ 1.00 per hr.\nLaborers @ 60c per hr.\n\nWe certainly would have a very fine school unit if this work was completed and would be able to have accommodation for 60 pupils.\n\nI know that I am rather late asking for this work but I have been unable to get quotations from other firms and carpenters as everyone has more work ahead of them that they can do this year. Mr Erickson will commence work immediately so as to have the buildings ready for September 1st if he is awarded the contract.\n\nFrank Booth,\nIndian Agent.\n\nSchool $2,375.00\nStonework 525.00\nTotal $3,597.00\nBERNARD F NEARY\nDEPT OF MINES & RESOURCES INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH OTTAWA ONT\n\nRE YOUR WIRE JULY THIRTIETH NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN ERICKSON'S TENDER FOR SCHOOL HOUSE TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS THIS PRICE INCLUDES LABOUR PAINT AND ALL MATERIAL COMPLETE JOB GUARANTEED TENDER FOR TEACHER SIX HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN DOLLARS INCLUDES LABOUR PAINT AND ALL MATERIALS TENDER FOR RUSSIAN HOUSE AND OFFICE FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS THIS AMOUNT IS FOR LABOUR ONLY ALL LUMBER FROM DEPARTMENT IMPLEMENT SHED WILL BE USED AND THE DEPARTMENT WILL HAVE TO PROVIDE SOME LUMBER CEMENT AND PAINT TO COMPLETE THE JOB\n\nFRANK BOOTH INDIAN AGENT\n\nMR FRANK BOOTH\nIndian Agent\nMUSCOGEE SASKATCHEWAN\n\nRE LETTER JULY SEVENTEENTH ASSINIBOINE DAY SCHOOL -stop-\nFROM ERICKSON TENDER UNDERSTAND HE WILL PROVIDE LABOUR MATERIAL AND PAINT FOR SCHOOL BUILDING LABOUR AND MATERIAL FOR TEACHERAGE BUT LABOUR ONLY FOR STORE ROOM -stop- HOWEVER TOP PARA PAGE TWO YOUR LETTER STATES ERICKSON WILLING TO PROVIDE LABOUR ONLY FOR ALL THIS WORK -stop- ADVISE BY NIGHT LETTER WHAT ERICKSON WILLING TO DO FOR TENDER -stop-\n\nCharge Indian Affairs\nMines and Resources\n\nBernard F Neary\nOttawa, August 5, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nAssiniboine Indian Day School\n\nThe growth in school population on the Assiniboine Indian Reserve is such that we will have to open an additional classroom this September.

A.\n\nOctober 7, 1946.\n\nI have received your letter of October 4th in reply to mine of the 22nd in connection with the rebuilding of an implement shed on the Assiniboine Reserve into a ration or store house.\n\nYou did not return to me the account of Montmartre Co-operative Assoc. which was sent to you with letter of the 22nd.\n\nI may say that the reason the account was returned was that the voucher (No. 477) was directed for payment to the Agencies Division, who had no knowledge of the work, and on account of the wording that the work was to provide a ration or storehouse no one in the Agencies Division realized that the matter was one which should have been referred to the Schools Branch.\n\nUpon receipt of your letter of the 4th, however, the Agencies Division made a search for the Purchase Order referred to in your letter (No. 22044), and could not find it. However, Purchase Order 22040 was finally located and the School file drawn, when it was discovered that the matter should have gone in the first instance to the Indian Education Service.\n\nI give you this information to show you how much trouble can be caused by a voucher not being completely worded. When sending in the voucher in this instance please state on it that the implement shed being remodelled is for the use of the School, being part of the group of buildings at the Assiniboine Agency required for school purposes.\n\nM.W.

Wage increases and pay boosts made in all cases, it was announced jointly recently by D. H. F. Black, deputy industrial executive, and C. G. Palmer, regional director of the Canadian Congress of Labor, parent body of all four unions.\n\nThe increase affects approximately 270 employees at the Government and Public Works Department, the Moose Jaw tannery at Regina of Saskatchewan Leather Products, the Moose Jaw woolen mill of Dominion Wool Products, the brick plant at Estevan of Clay Products, and the Government Insurance Office at Regina.\n\nIncrease in pay of five cents per hour \"across the board\" was granted the employees of the Moose Jaw Dominion Workers Local 32, representing employees of the sheep shearing and tannery, under the \"last end\" clause of their contract of the union. The new agreement, which took effect immediately upon its negotiation, makes the pay boost retroactive to August 1. The agreement concerns wages only and does not constitute a gaining agreement with the union does not expire until December 7.\n\nAnother agreement calling for five cents per hour increase, retroactive to June 1, was reached with the Dominion Woolen Mill employees represented by Dominion Workers of America Local 759, representing woolen mill employees.\n\nWorkers of the Saskatchewan Clay Products Workers Union Local No. 3 and the Saskatchewan Insurance Employees' Union had a new collective bargaining agreement to replace those which had expired on July 1. The agreement included changes in conditions were involved, as well as wage increases. Pay boosts in the case of the insurance office were retroactive August 15, while in the case of the Insurance Office they were retroactive to July 1.\n\n\"All negotiations with industrial employees have been completed except those with employees of the Saskatchewan Power Commission,\" Mr. Palmer said.\n\nCommenting on the new agreements, Mr. Palmer said they had resulted in very satisfactory feeling among employees.\n\nBig Machinery Imports\n\nREGINA\u2014Agricultural machinery to the value of $11,683,946 was imported into Saskatchewan from the United States through provincial ports of entry in 1947 according to a compilation made by W. J. Hansen of the Trade Services Division of the Department of Commerce. In addition, there were imports coming through eastern or western Canada for which would be higher in price and more expensive to the person in need.\n\n\"If the self-help program is properly carried out, there should be no great necessity for liquidating valuable livestock,\" he added.\n\nTwo Bus Routes Added To Service\n\nREGINA\u2014Opening of two new bus routes by the government-owned Saskatchewan Transportation Company was announced recently by W. T. Bunn, company manager. The new route connects Regina with Yorkton, operating daily except Sunday, and Regina to Kipling, daily through the week.\n\nThe company, which operates 32 bus routes, owns 49 buses, and with the addition of the two new routes has increased its mileage in its present system. More than 3,500 route miles are covered by these buses,\" said Mr. Bunn.\n\nIncreasing use of the service was also noted by Mr. Bunn who stated that a total of 4,662 persons traveled to and from Regina in the company's vehicles during the Labor Day weekend.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6250, file 601-5, part 6)\n\nFodder Still Serious In Areas, But Self-Help Program Assists\n\nREGINA\u2014While still serious in some northern areas, the feed and fodder shortage in Saskatchewan had eased considerably during the past few weeks, Agriculture Minister I. C. Nollet said recently. He added that improvement has resulted through the efforts of farmers engaging in the self-help program instituted by the department of agriculture.\n\nWhile the feed and fodder deficiency in some districts will \"still serious,\" the department stood a better chance of meeting the anticipated demands for fodder which may arise after November 1, he said. The minister urged farmers to make every effort to salvage all available feed in drought areas in order to more nearly meet the department's requirements.\n\nUp-to-date lists of locations where hay and other fodder can be obtained on a basis by anyone willing to harvest it, are maintained by the agricultural extension division of the department. It is also available for purchase, Mr. Nollet pointed out. The cheapest hay, except that which he reserves for seed, will be that put up or moved under the department's fodder policy, thus providing the farmer with freight assistance until November 1, 1947, together with transportation costs of buying hay.\n\nIn the case of farmers who make hay for their own purposes, hay from available sources of supply, in-ward freight assistance in the amount of $2 per ton will be given. The suggestion that the government undertake full responsibility for the program and do the job alone is not a feasible program, but to do so, Mr. Nollet said, \"would mean that only a limited amount of fodder would be available and supplies...\"\nLOCAL RADIO MAKES GOOD\n\nONE OF THE most important new aids to education is radio, and school radio broadcasts have developed to such an extent that the Saskatchewan Broadcasting Corporation and the various provincial education departments co-operate in producing programs for each of the five school days.\n\nDramatic productions bring to life history, literature, science and many other school subjects in a manner that holds children's interest so that learning becomes both easy and entertaining. Just how valuable these broadcasts can be is illustrated by the fact that one Saskatchewan radio station has received series of letters from during its evening program and received an enthusiastic response from its adult listeners.\n\nBut it was discovered in Saskatchewan, as it has been found in other parts of Canada and in the United States, that whereas programs which were recorded in the studio in good shape were not getting into the class rooms satisfactorily. After complaints had been received from Saskatchewan teachers James Kent, supervisor of the School Broadcasts Branch of the Department of Education, set out to investigate.\n\nReception Not Good\n\nFrom first hand investigation Mr. Kent found a situation here similar to what had been found in other places. Radio receiving sets in use were simply not suitable for class room use. There were old sets, purchased to fit the budget of the local district, but even the newer sets were not satisfactory in school use, for which they were designed. Volume control, \"muffled\" sound effects were indistinct and music reproduction was inferior. In addition, many sets did not have enough power to enable children to tune without strain. If more power was used distortion became so bad as to ruin the program completely.\n\nIt was evident that what was needed was a radio receiving set which was built for class room use, instead of home use, and would perform satisfactorily under school conditions. Manufacturers in Canada were consulted, but all except one were not interested in producing a special type of receiver for school use. One manufacturer would agree to make a special set but only under conditions which were prohibitive.\n\nProblem Could Be Solved\n\nThat was the state of the problem when it came to the attention of G. L. Powell who was in charge of maintenance of Saskatchewan Film Board movie projector equipment. Mr. Powell was an electrical engineer whose technical developments of radio from almost its earliest days. Years ago he had been one of that happy group of amateurs who had constructed their own receiving sets when radio was still a novelty and not the commonplace thing it is today.\n\nMr. Powell felt there was a way to solve the school radio problem, and he set out to find a solution. Initially the problem was a simple one. You had to produce a radio set that would give fine reproduction of the full range of audio tones at high volume from programs broadcast from nearby stations during the daytime.\n\nSetting about to do this, Mr. Powell drew on his broad grasp of the techniques of radio. Ordinary hearing radios are fine for the purpose for which they are designed. In which tone necessarily sacrificed for great selectivity and static suppression, to which the school receiver was not required. Mr. Powell's problem was to design a radio having the characteristics wanted for school use, instead of those needed in home radios.\n\nThe first experimental set was finished in December, 1945. After tests and adjustments, the new receiver demonstrated that it was the answer to the school receiver problem. It did the work for which it was designed even better than had been hoped. Pleasantful realistic tone was matched by phenomenal power, which enabled the set to operate the same type of speakers required by set-oil receivers.\n\nAs Mr. Powell explains, he had worked out principles and invented something new and revolutionary. He had merely applied known principles to the making of a set capable of fulfilling a scientific purpose. By sacrificing selectivity, which is not needed in a school radio, and by providing for adequate power output, he had produced a machine which filled the bill perfectly. Addition of a phonograph pickup and turntable was made to allow teachers to use records for music instruction.\n\nProduction Started\n\nBy September, 1946, Department of Education officials had been convinced of the advantages of the new machine and the School Broadcasts Branch was given permission to produce them in quantity for Saskatchewan schools.\n\nSince then till the end of August thirty-five 125-watt tube and electric radio-phones had been produced and delivered. During that time 150 orders were received from schools, and more are coming in every day.\n\nThe project has grown in size so that there is now a special division in the Department of Education, the Radio Production Branch, to make the radios. Mr. Powell is in charge and he has two young Saskatchewan veterans holding him, Roy Smith and Lawrence Babin. Mr. Smith, who comes from Rocanville, was a radio mechanic in the Air Force during the war. Mr. Babin, a Delisle, who was also in the Air Force, took a year's course in radio at the Moose Jaw vocational training school before joining the new branch.\n\nSaskatchewan Made\n\nThe radios are an entirely Saskatchewan product, except, of course, for the various parts which are made by radio manufacturers, and these are purchased through Saskatchewan dealers.\n\nCabinets, for instance, are made by local cabinet makers in Saskatchewan at Regina, Qu'Appelle and Beechy. The steel chassis were first made by a local manufacturer, but when he was unable to obtain new sheet metal, and now they are made by a sheet metal fabricator in Regina.\n\nThe cabinets are another feature of the school radios which are specially designed for this use. Not made for display purposes, so much as for utility, they are nevertheless quite attractive. But they are made much stronger than ordinary radio cabinets. Batteries are fully enclosed and the lid locks securely over all controls. This prevents accidental damage, and unauthorized\n1947 Seasons and Bag Limits For Game Birds Announced\n\nREGINA.\u2014Official 1947 migratory bird seasons and bag limits were announced recently by E. L. Paynter, game commissioner, as follows:\n\nSeason for ducks, geese, coots and Wilson's snipe in that portion of the province north of south line from boundary of township 50 is set at September 22 to October 31. North of township 50 and south of township 60 season for these birds opens September 15 and closes October 31. North of township 60 the season on all four species will run from September 8 to October 31.\n\nA closed season is in effect on elder and wood ducks, swans, cranes, and all migratory non-game and insectivorous birds.\n\nBag limits are set as follows: daily\u2014seven ducks, five geese, 10 coots, and five snipe; season limit\u201456 ducks, 20 geese, 50 coots and 25 snipe; possession limit\u201414 ducks, 10 geese, 36 coots and five snipe. Possession of migratory birds killed during the open season is allowed in Saskatchewan until March 31.\n\nThe use of any weapon other than a shotgun or bow and arrow is prohibited.\n\nDespite all difficulties and trials, the products of a new little industry in Regina are going to schools throughout the province. And as thousands of Saskatchewan children listen every afternoon to the exciting dramatizations of their school work, they will have Mr. Powell to thank that every word is as clear and precise as if spoken in their own class rooms.\n\nCommenting on the contest, Game Commissioner E. L. Paynter said that one boy has accumulated over 2,000 points before the contest closed. Bouquets of five cents per pair of crow's legs, and 15 cents per pair of magpie's legs were awarded the campaigners. Points were credited on the following basis: one point for a pair of magpie's legs, two points for a pair of crow's legs, one point for each crow egg, and two points for each magpie egg.\n\nWinners of the contest will assemble at Prince Albert, with the fish and game league paying their expenses to the extent of $100. The response department will take over, and the winners will ride on the Saskatchewan transportation agency's first bus run to Lac la Ronge. Inspection tours will include the Hudson Bay post offices and the government's fish plant. Following an air trip to Island Falls, the children will be sent to Prince Albert where the fish and game league will assume responsibility for their return to their homes.\n\nTrip for Kids In Crow Contest\n\nREGINA.\u2014Two Saskatchewan children obtained the highest score in the campaign against crows and magpies, sponsored jointly by the game branch of the Department of Agriculture and the Saskatchewan fish and game league, will receive a bus and airplane trip to Lac la Ronge and Prince Albert. Winners of the contest, which closed September 1, have not yet been announced.\n\nName Northern Lake After Jerrold Smith\n\nREGINA.\u2014Large, newly-named Jerrold Lake, in the rocky pine belt of the northern Saskatchewan, about 20 miles west of Cree Lake, will honor the memory of F/O Jerrold Smith, who died in action while engaged on air operations in August, 1943, and presumed dead in April, 1943. F/O Jerrold Smith's parents live at 3982 18th avenue, Regina.\n\nEnlisting with the air force in 1940, F/O Smith was commissioned and went overseas in 1941. He took operational training as a fighter pilot in northern Ireland, was posted to the Royal Air Force there in 1942, and there gained for himself the reputation of being an efficient combat pilot during the bitterest of the German attacks.\n\nThe name Jerrold Lake has been approved by the National Geographic Board, and the necessary documents of the action will be filed in the provincial archives as part of the province's history, according to Mr. Paynter.\nDantow Named Health Officer\n\nREGINA \u2014 Dr. Matthew Dantow, B.Sc., M.B., Ch.B., D.P.H., has been appointed medical health officer of the North Eastern Health Region No. 19, succeeding to a similar appointment by Deputy Health Minister Dr. C. F. W. Hames.\n\nSince November, 1946, the medical officer of the newly formed region has worked with the Provincial Services Plan and the Regional Health Service Division of the Saskatchewan Department of Public Health.\n\nBorn in New York City in 1909, Dr. Dantow received his bachelor of arts degree from the University of New York in 1930, and his bachelor of surgery and medical degree from the University of Glasgow in 1936. The following year he took a three-month course in tropical medicine at the University of London. In 1946 he received a diploma in public health from the University of Toronto.\n\nIn 1936 and 1937 Dr. Dantow was house surgeon in the Royal Infirmary at Doncaster, England. From 1938 to 1944 he engaged in private practice in the United Kingdom, including Scotland, serving also as part-time medical health officer. He was medical health officer of the town of John's, Newfoundland, from 1944 to 1946.\n\nCorman Asks for Vigorous Action Against Price-Fixing Combines\n\nREGINA \u2014 A statement from the Saskatchewan government requesting the Dominion government to take more vigorous action against monopolies and cartels was issued by Acting Premier J. L. Corman following the announcement of Justice Minister J. L. Isley that a combine in restraint of price competition existed in the dental supply industry.\n\n\"The people of Saskatchewan are convinced that price-fixing combines exist in many other industries and that action by the federal authorities is long overdue,\" Mr. Corman said. \"With government price controls practically gone the public is entitled to protection against exorbitant prices fixed and maintained by monopolies and cartels.\"\n\nMr. Corman pointed out that criminal information has recently been filed against a combine in the province alleging a conspiracy to fix automobile tire prices. And he added that the war crimes act of Great Britain documents had been introduced linking 53 United States and seven Canadian firms with former German combines.\n\n\"The people of this province are demanding that the Canadian counterparts of those German big shots be investigated from top to bottom and where they failings end police control is established that they be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,\" the attorney-general added.\n\nMr. Corman said the Saskatchewan government considers that the absence of price control meant that control merely passed to large corporations engaged in monopolistic practices, and he added that failure to take action against all combines, monopolies and cartels would confirm this view.\n\nCar Crashes Cut\n\nREGINA \u2014 Saskatchewan citizens killed or injured in motor vehicle accidents during the peak summer driving period last year were less in number than for the corresponding period in 1947, according to the Saskatchewan Government Insurance office. There were 21 people killed and 587 injured in the first five months of the present license year, and in the same period in 1947 there were lost three lives and 706 were injured.\n\nA total of 1,100 claims for collision damage were made up to the end of August, an indication that motorists were not involved in accidents where collision damage exceeded $100 in the case of non-registered vehicles under the provision of the A.A.A. for other vehicles.\n\nThree Clinics Operating To Treat Polio Patients\n\nREGINA \u2014 With a total of more than 160 recorded cases of poliomyelitis in Saskatchewan up to the early part of September, the expansion of clinic facilities to cope with the increased incidence of the disease was outlined recently by Dr. H. M. Doyle, director of the Division of Communicable Diseases in the Department of Health.\n\nTwo new clinics, Regina and Moose Jaw, have opened to provide additional facilities since the original clinic at St. Paul's Hospital in Saskatoon, which opened in July, 1943, was not sufficient to handle the epidemic.\n\nA 50-bed clinic was opened at the Regina general hospital with the cooperation of local health authorities; the staff of the hospital included physicians. The Department of Health provided special equipment while both city and county health departments provided extra nurses. The Department also provides a nurse specifically assigned to each clinic for re-education, while contracts were made with orthopedic surgeons to supervise physical treatment to patients.\n\nA similar new summer clinic was also set up in Moose Jaw. In all three cases the hospitalization and nursing services were provided free of charge, while hospital doctors' fees were not paid. Practically all of the 160 recorded cases in the province have been treated at the clinics.\n\nThe Department of Health feels that treatment of polio, which in cases of paralysis patients may run into months or years although many cases are cured in a short time, will prove an economic catastrophe to most families, and therefore it is our policy to provide so-called \"treatment\" free,\" said Dr. Doyle.\n\nThe clinic in Saskatoon, which has been in operation since 1943, was designed to reduce disability and prevent the appearance of new deformities. Of the 100 cases treated during the year, the clinic provided treatment for an indefinite time using a modified type of the Jonas technique.\n\nFrom January, 1944, to March this year 77 cases were treated. Of this number 74, including three cases of long standing, 50 were discharged free of handicap, 14 were discharged with some handicap, and there was one death.\n\nRoyal Fisheries Report Available To Public\n\nREGINA \u2014 Now available to the public is the report of the Royal Commission on the Fisheries of Saskatchewan. Resources Minister J. L. Philips said recently.\n\nTotaling more than 250,000 words, the 130-page report deals with fish resources, present and improved methods of supply, sustained yield marketing and many other aspects pertinent to the fisheries of Saskatchewan. Copies of the report may be obtained on application to the Department of Natural Resources, Regina, at a charge of 51 per copy.\n\nWilliam Turner Retires\n\nREGINA \u2014 Thirty-five years of service with the provincial government ended recently for William Turner, an only employee of the Civil Service Superannuation Board, secretary and examiner designate to the Public Service Commission, when he retired on superannuation.\n\nJoining the civil service in 1912 as a clerk in the highways department, Mr. Turner was called into the British Imperial Army in 1914 and after the war served in the Royal Flying Corps. He returned to the Saskatchewan civil service in 1919 and in 1922 transferred to the civil service commission as a clerk.\n\nTeacher Shortage Still Great, But Increased Training Helps\n\nREGINA \u2014 The present shortage of teachers in Saskatchewan will result in some rural schools remaining closed temporarily, Education Minister Woodrow Lloyd said today.\n\nAbout 1,300 teachers of an approximate total of 4,500 who had taught school in 1946, gave up their teaching jobs at the end of the school year. The Ministry of Education's addition of a total of 900 new teachers, but there is a pressing need for at least 500 more teachers in the province.\n\nWhile the present situation was serious, said Mr. Lloyd, he felt that the future looked far more encouraging, in that registration at the college of education at Saskatoon had reached 1,500 and was expected to be 560 by the time classes began. The minister pointed out that this number was an increase on record for teachers taking advanced training. They would eventually be absorbed into the educational stream to provide higher teaching standards.\n\nConforming to the policy of previous years, the Ministry of Education is releasing a number of normal school students at the end of October to fill the gaps in teacher ranks. This means that some of the students sent out as temporary teachers would have only about six weeks teaching experience.\n\nAdditionally 200 more students had enrolled for normal school training this year than in 1946, the aggregate to reach a total of 500 with the possibility of an additional 100 students registered next fall, Mr. Lloyd said that school boards were enlisting the aid of former school teachers to help meet the present educational emergency. These teachers would be employed for the whole or part of the school year until the situation eased.\nGOVERNMENT OF THE PROVINCE OF SASKATCHEWAN\n\nCANADA\n\nDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\n\nNovember 28, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Vincent:\n\nThank you very much for your letter regarding the combination radio phonograph produced by the Department of Education for classroom use.\n\nWe are enclosing a copy of Saskatchewan News which outlines the background concerning the production of radio phonograph equipment.

PERLAN,\n\nAssiniboine Indian Day School.\n\nOn Mr. Hoey's recommendation of August 5th, 1947, the contract was awarded to Mr. H.L. Erichson of Fort Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan. His recommendation reads, \"You will find attached the three tenders which Mr. Erichson has submitted for the work required to open this extra classroom. The total cost is $3,597.00. You will note that Mr. Erichson will provide labour, paint and materials for all alterations with the exception of the store-room, which will involve labour only. Most of the lumber for the store-room will be provided by tearing down the implement shed. We may have to provide a small quantity of lumber, cement and paint to complete this latter job\".\n\nIt appears that this expenditure of $361.42 for Montmartre Co-op Assn, is for this additional material that is required to build the store-room from the torn down implement shed. This account should not be charged to Purchase Order 22040 as indicated by the Agent. Mr. F. Booth in his letter of July 17, 1947, indicated that this extra material would cost not more than $200.00.\n\nThe last paragraph on the Purchase Order 22040 reads as follows: \"The above price ($3,597.00) includes labour, paint, and materials for all alterations with the exception of the store-room which would involve labour only\".\nThe following sums have been paid to Mr. Erichson in connection with this work:\n\nOct. 22 V.R. 495 Labour & Material $800.36\nOct. 24 V.R. 496 Trucking of Lumber 22.00\nNov. 3 V.R. 509 To complete job on School room 2432.87\n\nTotal: $3255.23\n\nOne more thing, I am not sure whether this is the same job, but on September 11, by voucher #147, Purchase Order #23522 we paid Mr. Montmartre $231.33 for lumber in connection with Assiniboine School, when Mr. Erichson was supplying the labour.\n\nM.F.

(RG 10, Volume 6280, file 601-5, part 6)\nMarch 10, 1948.\n\nMr. Frank Booth, Superintendent,\nIndian Agent, Muscow, Sask.\n\nRe: Purchase Order 22040\n\nThe above covered the alterations and repairs to the buildings at the Assiniboine Agency in order to provide a second class room for the Assiniboine Day School. If you will review that purchase order you will note that it was divided into three sections, (a), (b) and (c).\n\nYou submitted voucher 495 for $800.36. Of this amount $525.00 was shown in item (c) of the purchase order and we presumed the amount over and above $525.00 was some of the material approved by section (b) and consequently paid the whole voucher at a total amount of $800.36.\n\nYou subsequently submitted voucher 509 for $2,432.87. The purchase order only authorized $2,375.00 but we arranged to pay the additional amount requested. You also submitted voucher 496 for trucking lumber; this amounted to $22.00.\n\nThe total amount already paid is as follows:\n\n- Voucher 495: $800.36\n- Voucher 496 (trucking): $22.00\n- Voucher 509: $2,432.87\n\nTotal: $3,255.23\n\nYou now submit voucher 84 for $697.00 and you quote purchase order 22040 as authority for the expenditure. After making the payments shown above\nthe balance left in this purchase order is, therefore only $341.77 ($3,597.00 - $3,255.23).\n\nIn the meantime you also submitted voucher 582 for $354.67 in favour of Montmartre Co-operative Association. We had to secure a special purchase order for this particular item.\n\nIn view of the information given in your letter of January 19th we would like to know why the total amount of purchase order 22040 has been exceeded. We would also like a further explanation of voucher 582 in view of clause (c) of purchase order 22040 which mentioned $525.00 as the cost of rebuilding the implement shed into a ration house and further states that \"the above price includes labour, paint and materials for all alterations with the exception of the store room which would involve labour only\".\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Outstanding account - $697.00\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd inst., regarding the above mentioned account, I wish to inform you that I contacted Mr. Erickson about this account and he found out that he had not forwarded me the account; this he immediately did and I am sending it on to you under Voucher #84 of February 29th, 1948.\n\nFrank Booth,\nSuperintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th inst.,\n#102-1-5 (e.l), I wish to submit the following report.\n\nStatement of expenditures, order # 22040.\n\n(a) Amount of order $2375.00\n   Voucher #509 $2432.87 overdraft 57.87\n\n(b) Amount of order $697.00\n   Voucher #84 $697.00\n\n(c) Amount of order $525.00 for labor only.\n   Voucher #495 $525.00 labor. H.Erickson material 275.36\n   \" #582 Material.Montmartre Co-op 354.67\n   \" #496 Trucking material 22.00\n\nIt will be noted that the material purchased to complete the store room cost $642.03 and that in section (c) only $525.00 was allowed for labor only, although the labor involved the erection of cement piers, double floors, wall board, shingles, brick chimney, etc., not any amount was requisitioned for this, and all the material mentioned above could not be salvaged from an implement shed and had to be purchased; therefore I can readily see now that I should have asked for another purchase order instead of going ahead with the building.\n\nI certainly regret this misunderstanding occurred and will govern myself accordingly in the future but I am pleased to report that this store room built at a total cost of $1107.03 is I consider a better building than the store room built at the same time on the Mossepetung Res at a cost of $2395.00\n\nFrank Booth, Superintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nI would be pleased to receive an accountable advance of $60.00 for freighting supplies required by the Assiniboine Day School during 1948-49, as soon as it may be convenient.\n\nFrank Booth,\nSuperintendent.\nApril 14, 1948.\n\nMr. Frank Booth, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Muscow, Sask.\n\nAssiniboine Indian Day School\n\nWith reference to your letter dated April 6th, file G-7E (114), we are today arranging for our Treasury Office to forward you an accountable cheque in the amount of $60.00 to cover cost of freighting materials to the above named school.\n\nBernard F.

Edwin Ryder was placed in charge of the furnaces but I should have immediately asked you for the authority to hire a fireman.\n\nAs it is necessary to have this man hired to care for the furnaces during the winter months, kindly give the authority.\n\nFrank Booth,\nSuperintendent.\nJanuary 30th, 1950.\n\nMr. F.

(RG 10, Volume 6280, file 601-8, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, March 21, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your report on the Assiniboine Day School and the matter of the enlargement of the basement and improvements to the cabin erected for the use of the Indians who bring their children to school in order that it may be made fit for a teacher's residence I have to ask you to be good enough to submit an estimate of the cost of this work, at the same time stating how you would propose to have it done. I may say that both of these suggested improvements meet with the approval of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nExtract from Mr. Inspector Graham's report on the Assiniboine Day School, dated February 28, 1912.\n\nLast year I received your permission to enlarge the basement of this school but owing to a very busy fall and the unfortunate conditions at this Agency, I was unable to get the work done. The want of a large basement is much felt and I hope to get the work done this spring. In this connection I would ask if it will be necessary to have a renewal of your authority.\n\nThere is another matter that I would like to bring before you for your favorable consideration. When the school was built a small shell of a cabin was erected for the use of the Indians who might bring their children to school. It was found that this building was not used very much in view of the fact that the children were driven to and from school by an Indian hired for the purpose. Miss Lawrence, late last fall, converted this into a living house and she resided there ever since. She asks that the Department spend $150 to $200 in lining this cabin and adding a small lean-to kitchen for her cook stove, etc. I would strongly advise that this be done. She is doing excellent work and deserves encouragement. Might I at the same time ask permission to buy a foot-ball for the use of the pupils. Miss Lawrence has asked for this several times.\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No.334701/5, dated the 1st instant.\n\nIn reply I will say that the work at Assiniboine school and the teacher's shack could be done without engaging skilled labor. I have a fair knowledge of cement and concrete work myself. I could supervise the carpenter work, which can be done by some of our Indian boys.\n\nKindly specify what has to be done with the school and the teacher's shack. The farm instructor and myself will attend to this matter.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 17, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased to know that you will undertake the supervision of the repairs and changes at the Assiniboine School. Mr. Inspector Graham has been written to with reference to the details of the work to be done and as soon as this information is received you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. E. Donnelly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSintaluta, Sask.\nI beg to inform you that I visited the Assiniboine Agency on Tuesday last and in accordance with your instructions submit herewith particulars as to the work that should be done in connection with the Day School and teacher's residence at that point.\n\nDay School\n\nThere are about three hundred and fifty yards of earth to be excavated from underneath the building. This will give a full sized basement of 32x26. It will be necessary to build a concrete wall 32 feet long on the East side of the basement and another wall 20 feet long on the north side. The floor of the new basement will have to be cemented and three extra windows put in.\n\nThe Teacher was very anxious to have a galvanized iron cistern put in the basement so that she could use the soft water from the roof. I would advise that her request be granted as they use a great deal of water at this institution.\n\nTeacher's residence.\n\nThe little cabin that the teacher is now using is only a mere shell. The idea is to line this building with building paper and V joint ceiling and it can then be used as a kitchen. An addition 18' X 14' X 8' should then be added.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nbe built to it. This could be made very comfortable if built on the following lines: - 2x4 studdings set at 20\" centres, lined inside and out with ship lap, covered with paper and siding on the outside and paper and V joint on the inside. The most of the work in connection with this little house and the basement of the school can be done by the Agent's staff and Indians at a cost of about $600.00.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspr. of Indian Agencies.\n\n442138\nOttawa, May 30, 1942.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith memorandum of the repairs and improvements in connection with the Assiniboine School submitted by Mr. Inspector Graham. The Department desires to have this work done by day labour under your supervision and you may commence work on the residence at once. The work in connection with the school-room may be left until the school closes at the end of next month. Indian labour should be used as much as possible and the rate of wages allowed should be fair. I am enclosing herewith pay sheets, which you will be good enough to submit to the Department weekly. Payment will be made for the material upon the presentation of vouchers. I am sending you, under separate cover, an accountable cheque for $100.00 for the payment of wages. The Department trusts that you will have this work carried out expeditiously and at a reasonable expense.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. E.

Edwards was received, but owing to the steel shortage the furnace was not immediately available, and the old one was used. This furnace a 21\" is now on hand being received a few days ago. I have contacted Mr. Edwards and he will install this furnace this week.\n\nEnclosed herewith is a requisition for a 19\" furnace required for the Teacherage \u00a7 This furnace is also on hand), and is urgently needed.\n\nWe have two very good teachers at this reserve, they get on very well at the schools and the teacherage, we have Grades 1 and 2 with several grade 7 in No. 1 school and the rest in the new No. 2 school. The attendance is very good being much improved since the school sleigh started in mid November with 23 pupils taking advantage of this conveyance.\n\nIf authority is granted for the other furnace the two can be installed at the same time making one trip do the two installations, as the roads are very bad.\n\nAuthority is also requested for the installation of the furnace in School No. 2 at a cost of $65.00 this furnace was purchased last year. I might add that we have not received instructions regarding the new toilets required for school No. 1 (See letter of September 27th.)\n\nW. J. D. Kerley,\nSuperintendent.\nDecember 20, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nRe: Attached requisition for furnace for Teacherage - Assiniboine Reserve.\n\nPurchase order 35033 has been issued for a new furnace for the Assiniboine School, but Indian Superintendent Kerley now advises that a furnace is also required for the teachers' residence on this reserve.\n\nThe present furnace is burnt out and corroded, the collar on the smoke pipe is broken and the grates are burnt out. The Superintendent considers that the cost of material and labour to repair it would amount to more than half the price of a new one and we would still have an old furnace.\n\nHe has secured a quotation of $250.00 for a Prairie Pride, all steel 19\" furnace, installed with all new hot and cold air pipes, from A.M. Edwards, Wolseley, Sask. Mr. Kerley states that Mr. Edwards has this furnace in stock and he is prepared to install it immediately.\n\nUnder the circumstances, we would appreciate it if you would issue purchase order at once and wire Mr. Edwards to install the furnace in the teacherage.

As this Band are now nearly all located on their reserve with the understanding that they would be assisted in making a start something will have to be done towards making them self-supporting.

There is nothing on file to show what the terms of his engagement were and the Department would like to be advised on this point.

Isbister of the Big River School, I would say that he having been in our employ elsewhere in the same capacity and having had no complaint, the Commissioner had no hesitancy in giving him his present appointment. However, it was not mentioned that it was for one year, or more or less. It has been always understood that these appointments were during pleasure, and terminable on reasonable notice. In the present case although the Inspector reported as early as January as to the inefficiency of this man it was not contemplated that his engagement should end before the end of the fiscal year. The school is conducted in conjunction with the Church Missionary Society and Rev. Mr. Hines, who is in charge of the district program, may have hired Mr. Isbister one year; but this office had nothing to do with this arrangement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary,\nAsst.

(RG 10, Volume 6280, file 602-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 14th instant, I would say that Mr. Hines some time ago selected Mr. William Bear as teacher for the Big River school, and the selection has been confirmed by Archdeacon Mackay. I should like therefore to be definitely advised whether Bear is to be employed at the beginning of the new school term, or Mr. Isbister continued in the position. You have reports as to Mr. Isbister's qualifications. Mr. Bear has taken the public school leaving examination, and is a graduate of the Battleford Industrial School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

And the proper person to Represent our Cause. We have decided and are determined, with your help, to have a Competent to replace the Rev. Mr. Sexton, who is the present teacher and has been for some years. Under his teaching the children literally know nothing; there is not one of them can speak ten words of English and barely know more than the alphabet after going to school from 15-20 days.\n\nWe must have the Government give us someone to teach our children. If we cannot get a good teacher, then Lord Mr. Chisholm, the Inspector of Schools, to come and see this school, and \"close it.\"\n\nVerry Poor Copy\nBut we trust you will be able to help us and get us our just demands.\n\nKindly let us know as soon as possible what we can expect to get from the government; as regards a teacher we shall wait an answer from you by the April mail\u2014\n\nSigned on behalf of the Heads of Families\n\nJoseph X. Morris\n\nMark\nEx'd.\n\nOTTAWA, 25th May, 1905\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the letter from Joseph Morin, addressed to you on the subject of the Green Lake school, I beg to say that there is only one school on Kenemotayoo's reserve (No. 118) in the Carlton Agency which and it is conducted under the auspices of the Church of England. It is at present in charge of William Bear and is known in the Department as the Big River school.\n\nWe have never had a Roman Catholic school on this reserve to the Department's knowledge, and no such teacher as Rev. Pere Teston is connected with any recognized school, so far as the records show.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nJ.H. Lamont, Esq.\nHouse of Commons,\nOTTAWA.\nIndian Office\n\nMEMO.\n\nIndian Department\nOttawa Ont.\n\nI find it very discouraging to learn the Indians of Big River Indian Reserve have been doing things that would be of use to them. They are wood Indians and were taken to trading and hunting and the Green Lake Trail runs through the Reserve. They bring the Indians in contact with a number of very bad men also a lot of Halfbreeds settle around the Reserve that encroach upon the Indians in Idlewood. I ask if you could immediately transfer me to some other Reserve also my wife that is teaching school at Big River. Some Reserve where I could earn a living and my wife teach school.\nMEMO.\n\nHave never addressed a letter to Bartlett at Carleton as they are not in town. I am glad to hear from you soon.\n\nYours,\n\nJ. C. MacLeod\n\nMontreal\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6280, file 602-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nNo.\n\nConcerning Farming Instructor J.C. Macleod of the Big River Reserve, I have the honor to report that the relations between him and the Indians under him have been strained from the beginning of his work there. Umbrage was first taken by them at his exclusion of them from his dwelling. His predecessor had allowed them the freedom of the house and invited them to the table whenever their visits coincided with the meal time. The change was very marked and antagonized them.\n\nMr. Macleod has a very forceful and masterful manner in directing their work which they resent, and the unpleasantness between them has steadily increased, until a recent occasion when he lost his temper, and struck the orphaned boy Daniel Metmaker son of the late Hector (Mynneekikwonape H.M.No.14). This furnished a desired opportunity to the Indians and those outsiders whom he had antagonized; proceedings have been threatened and so much outside out of it that his influence over these Indians has been lost. He resigned this fact and after first tendering his resignation has replaced it with a request for a transfer to some other reserve where his wife could also be employed in teaching. I recognize that Mr. Macleod has been most earnest in the discharge of his duties, and that his failure has been chiefly due to over zeal and an uncontrollable temper. I also recognize the excellent qualities of his wife; the kindly sympathy with which she attracted the Indians' children, while maintaining a strict firm discipline over them. She will be missed from the Big River School, and I very much regret that her husband's hasty temper should apparently render impossible her continuance in the work.\n\nWith the hope that the Department may know of a suitable exchange such as asked for by Mr. Macleod which will also continue Mrs. Macleod's services to the Department,\n\nI have the honor to remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 9th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo in reference to the transfer of Mr. McLeod, farming instructor on the Big River reserve, to some other reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as you have been advised, the Department has asked for the appointment of new teachers at the Ahtahkakop and Sturgeon Lake schools. Could not an exchange be effected between Mr. McLeod and either Mr. Campbell at Ahtahkakop or Mr. Isbister at Sturgeon Lake? Mrs. Macleod's services as teacher could then be utilized.\n\nThe Department would like you to consider this matter from both the school and farm point of view and report fully.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nThos. Borthwick, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMistawasis, Sask.\nThe Soc.\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI desire to nominate Mrs. M. Lord wife of the\nFarming Instructor at Sandy Lake, the teacher in\nthe Day School on that Reserve at Big River.\n\n1. George Crane has left as there were no children to come to\nschool in the quarter March 5 May 31st - Parents away.\n2. It is at best a small school, & the parents, mostly\nPapans, are quite indifferent about it.\n3. The Farming Instructor, Mr. Lord, seems interested in the\nwelfare of the Indians, & his wife would like to teach.\nShe seems capable of doing so, & they have both taken an\ninterest in this sort of thing in Manitoba.\n4. I can not get a certificated or trained teacher for\nyour $300 salary, & I think the school as yet\nhardly requires one.\n5. I have told her to begin from June 1st so as not\nto lose time, & that I hope you will appoint her.\n\nI beg to remain\nYrs faithfully,\nJ. H. Saskatchewan\nEXD.\n\nOttawa, June 10, 1909.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 3rd inst., and in reply I beg to say that the Department approves of your action in placing Mrs. McLeod in charge of the Big River school.\n\nThe Department recognizes how difficult it is to secure teachers with proper qualifications for schools on outlying reserves. Much good work may be done, however, by Mrs. McLeod, if she is interested in Indian work. The enrolment at this school is not as large as it should be, and if, after a fair trial, Mrs. McLeod is able to show an improvement in this and other respects, the Department will be pleased to continue her services.\n\nThe Department does not wish Mrs. McLeod to confine her efforts to the school work alone, but would like her to pay attention to the betterment of the home life of the Indians on the reserve in respect to cleanliness, neatness, ventilation, cooking, etc., working in conjunction with her husband, whose aim should be to raise the standard of husbandry among these Indians.\n\nRight Rev. J.A. Newnham, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6280, file 602-1, part 1)\nMrs. MacLeod's retention in the position will depend upon her success, and I have to request Your Lordship to be good enough to communicate with her and outline the Department's wishes in connection with the management of this school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, April 9th, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI beg to refer Your Lordship to official letters of March 3rd, last, in which you were asked to advise the teachers of the Ahtahkakoop and Sturgeon Lake schools that their services would not be required after June 30th, next.\n\nIn this connection I beg to inform Your Lordship that the Department has under consideration the transfer of Mr. MacLeod, the farming instructor on the Big River Reserve, to either of the reserves above mentioned. In the event of this change being finally decided upon the services of Mrs. MacLeod would be available as teacher of the school. Excellent reports on her work at the Big River school have been received and presumably Your Lordship would have no objection to her appointment at Sturgeon Lake or Ahtahkakoop.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev.

The interior woodwork also requires another coat of paint. You will be good enough to obtain an estimate of the cost of having these improvements made and submit it to the Department.\n\nIn order that Mrs. McLeod may teach sewing to the girls you will be good enough to see that she is supplied with the following material:\n\n1 piece, (about 36 yards), of chambray, for making dresses and pinafores.\n\n12 spools of crochet cotton, for crocheting.\n\n12 crochet needles.\n\n1 doz. spools No. 24 cotton thread.\n\n1 doz.

If a new teacher is to be appointed without any connection with the Department it must be remembered that this is a Church of England school and His Lordship Bishop Newnham will have the privilege of making the nomination.

I would ask you to take the matter up with Bishop Newnham with a view to getting a teacher with better qualifications and I would ask you at the same time to state what accommodation there is for a teacher on this reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nThos.

The reports on Mr. Ahenakew's work at Ahtahkakoops were not satisfactory and it is thought that no progress can be made at a school conducted by him. I would, therefore, ask Your Lordship to be good enough to make inquiries with a view to securing the services of a more suitable teacher.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev.

Additional note.\n\nI am not sure whether I informed you that acting on a letter from Mr Borthwick, Indian Agent, I instructed Mr Louis Ahenakew, so long a faithful teacher at Sandy Lake, to take up the work of teacher at the Big River Reserve near Sandy Lake. There is no teacher there now. Mr Borthwick seemed content with his appointment, and I should like the approval, or acceptance, of this appointment by the Department. In view of the long service of Mr Ahenakew, and the position and expense of Big River, I should be pleased if you could give him $400., not $300.\n\nYours truly\n\n(sgd.) J.A. Saskatchewan.\nBattleford, Sask.\nDec. 22nd 1911\n\nSir,\n\nYour letter No. 17332/1 of the 17th inst., addressed to the Bishop of Saskatchewan has been forwarded to me. Referring to the Big River School, I beg to state that there is no proper accommodation there for a teacher. Mrs. McLeod was the wife of the former instructor, and that solved the difficulty, while she was teacher. I am intending to visit the Big River Reserve next week, and I shall see into the matter and confer with the Agent, and send you a full report.\n\nWe are grateful to the Department for its efforts to improve the schools, and we desire to do everything in our power to help forward the work.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. H. MacKay\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nReferring to your letter No. 192747/1 dated Nov. 8th, I have the honor to state that in obedience to your wishes, I called up His Lordship Bishop Newnham each time I have been at Prince Albert lately; but each time was informed that he was away from home. I now learn that the Bishop is in Germany, and will be away for five months.\n\nIn a post-card mailed by him Sept. 29th, (but only received today through a mistake in the address) His Lordship admits that Louis Ahenakew is no an AI teacher but says he is the only man available. As any new pupils secured for the Big River School would not understand English, Louis would be better able to give them their first lessons than a teacher who was unfamiliar with the Cree language, and I would therefore suggest that Louis Ahenakew be accepted as a temporary appointment for a short time, say 3 months, until a suitable teacher can be secured.\n\nIn view of the temporary nature of the appointment which would not justify the expense of moving his family, I would suggest that his salary be increased for the time.\n\nI have the honor to remain,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 2, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant in further reference to the temporary appointment of Mr. Louis Ahenakew as teacher of the Big River School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that rather than have the school kept closed the Department will consent to the temporary appointment of Mr. Ahenakew, but will only allow him a salary of $300.00 per annum, it to be understood that he will vacate the position immediately upon receiving notice, should the services of a qualified teacher become available. No action should be taken by you, however, until you hear again from Archdeacon MacKay, who is being asked to communicate with you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. Borthwick, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMistawasis, Sask.\nOttawa, January 2, 1912.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter of November 22nd, last, I beg to say that rather than have the Big River School closed the Department considers it would be well to place Louis Ahenakew temporarily in charge and the Indian Agent has been so advised. He has, however, been instructed not to take any action until he hears from you. If you have nobody in view for the position kindly advise Mr. Borthwick so that Mr. Ahenakew may take charge, if the terms are agreeable to him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon J. A.

I beg to thank the Department for this decision, as, after a visit, from which I have just returned, I do not see any better arrangement open at present. In accordance with your letter, I am writing to Mr. Barthelemy informing him that I have nobody else in view at present for the position of teacher at Big River.\n\nI am also suggesting to the Agent that it might be a help to Mr. Ahenakew's efficiency if he would spend a day or two with Mr. Hutchinson, in the school at Sandy Lake, before going to Big River, in order that he might get a little insight into methods of teaching and discipline. His weak point is not so much lack of knowledge as lack of up-to-date methods of imparting that knowledge.\n\nI am\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ. A. MacKay\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to request authority to transport the Big River children to school, during the very severe weather, that is, for the next three or four months. Mr. Ahenakew, the teacher, is doing very well, and expects an attendance of at least 12 children, should authority be granted. The rate of $1.50 per day is asked, owing to the distance some of the children have to be fetched.\n\nI have the honor to remain,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 14, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant in reference to the transport of children to school on the Big River Reserve during the winter months.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange to have these children driven to school and the Department will pay for the services at the rate of $1.50 per day, if these are the best terms you can make. It is noted that only $1.00 was previously paid for this work and, owing to the very small number of children who could attend, it is thought that this should be sufficient now.\n\nThe attendance at this school has been so small that if some improvement cannot be effected the Department will have to take into consideration the closing of it and sending the children to one or other of the residential schools. The Department would like to know whether the teacher, Mr. Ahenakew, makes any effort to interest the parents in the school work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

The Department desires to know what supplies are furnished by you for the purpose of providing this meal and what quantities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

He informs me that at times he is apt to get a little discouraged, principally due to the small attendance. This however being rectified now that the children are being transported.\n\nTaking into consideration that the majority of the Big River Indians were only half civilized a few years ago, one can see at a glance that the education which a few of these children have received, has had a very good effect on the Band as a whole, caused undoubtedly by Mr. Ahenskew's efforts.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nBig River Reserve,\nSept. 30th, 1913.\n\nT. Borthwick Esq.,\nDear Sir,\n\nKnowing that through your recommendation much can be done by the Indian Department, beg to request that you will be kind enough to recommend me to the said Department and ask them to raise my salary, near to, or equivalent to the salaries paid to other teachers on different reservations. I have taught school for a long period and my teaching has not been without fruit: for instance, Edward Ahenakew, clergyman; Alex Ahenakew, H.B.C.'s book keeper; Adam Ahenakew, Shem Ahenakew, Edwin Ahenakew, and Allan Ahenakew, ambitious young men, are all my old scholars.\n\nBut if it turns out contrary to my wish and the Indian Department is not able to grant us our request, then, I wish to resign my position as teacher on Big River Reserve at the end of October 1913, and hope that the said resignation will be accepted and granted.\n\nI remain\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLouis Ahenakew.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a copy of a letter this day received from Mr. Louis Ahenakew teacher of the Kenemotayoo's school in which he applies for an increase of salary, etc.,\n\nIn endorsing his application I beg to point out to the Department that great difficulty will no doubt be experienced, if his application is unfavorably received, and his resignation is accepted, on the grounds that the teacher's residence at Big River is in such a dilapidated state, in fact hardly habitable, which would necessarily mean that Mr. Ahenakew's position would be hard to fill.\n\nMr. Ahenakew, on the other hand, is certainly trying to advance the education of the children under his charge, and latterly it is felt his exertions have met with very good results, in view of which, I would suggest that his services be continued, with an increase of salary, at least until a new residence for the teacher is erected.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 17, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant enclosing a copy of a letter received by you from Mr. Louis Ahenakew, teacher of the Kensmotayoo's school, applying for an increase in salary.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of Mr. Ahenakew's long service and your favourable report, the Department will pay him at the rate of $400.00 per annum from the first of the current quarter. It is understood that Mr. Ahenakew's services are only to be retained until a qualified teacher can be secured.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. STEWART\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nThos.

I know that the Department has in some instances increased the salaries of teachers of ordinary day schools to $400.00, but I do not know whether the condition of things in connection with the Big River school would be considered by the Department to justify an increase of salary. Mr. Louis Ahenukew has served for many years and has been a fairly successful teacher considering the disadvantages under which he has worked, and, if the Department could see its way to grant his request, it would be an incentive to greater effort.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 6, 1913.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo in reference to an increase in salary to Mr. Louis Ahenakew, teacher of the Big River School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that previous to the receipt of your communication Mr. Agent Borthwick was advised that the Department would increase Mr. Ahenakew's salary to $400.00 per annum from the first of the current quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Pruden\nDear Mr. M. Lear,\n\nI desire to nominate to the I.D. Int. Gull. Pruden as teacher at Big White Fish Lake Reserve (Big River Reserve) where the school is now vacant & closed. She is the daughter of Mr. & Mrs. Hutchinson, teacher & matron at Star-Blanket's Reserve, Sandy Lake, & has had experience under them in teaching & in the matron's hygienic work. This her school-education should fit her for the work at Big River. She is, I believe, 25 years old. Her husband is away in military service, which is, perhaps, an additional claim in your consideration. If you accept, as I hope you will, her services, will you kindly correspond with her as to terms, date of commencement, etc. This will save time, as I am somewhat of a wanderer.\n\nI have also asked Mr. Le Clair to correspond directly with you as to the Mistawasis Reserve School.

Saskatchewan,\nBishop.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nHis Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan in a memorandum states that the Big River School in the Carlton Agency has been vacant for sometime.\n\nIn November, last, the question of appointing a teacher and re-opening this school was brought to the attention of the Department and Mr. Acting Agent Weir was instructed to inform His Lordship that the Department would pay a salary at the rate of $600.00 per annum for a suitable teacher, and that he should endeavour to obtain the services of a teacher. Nothing further has been heard from either the Agent or the Bishop since that time.\n\nThe Bishop now states that the salary is insufficient to secure a proper teacher. There is no doubt that in the Province of Saskatchewan it is impossible to secure a qualified teacher for a salary of $600.00 per annum.\n\nI shall be pleased to be informed as to what salary will be allowed for a qualified teacher for this school.\n\nThe Bishop also states that both the schoolhouse and the teacher's residence are in a shocking condition and need repairs. The teacher's residence is the property of the church and they should have it repaired and made comfortable to provide suitable accommodation. I am not aware as to what repairs are needed to the school building, but, if it is decided to have the school reopened, the Agent should be requested to state what repairs are needed and the probable cost of the same.\n\nThe\nThe enrolment at this school when it was open was 20, with an average attendance of 6. The Indians of the Big River Band take very little interest in education.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6280, file 602-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, April 15, 1920.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's memorandum of the last ultimo regarding various matters in connection with the Indian day schools under your auspices in the Province of Saskatchewan.\n\nIn reply, dealing with the case of each school in the order in which they are mentioned in Your memorandum, I beg to say, first,- with reference to the Fort a la Corne Day School, as you were informed by letter of January 13th, last, the question of providing educational facilities for the James Smith's Reserve is being considered by Mr. Commissioner Graham. He has asked that this matter stand in abeyance until next summer, when he will personally investigate and advise as to the best plan to provide educational facilities for the children on this reserve. He will consider the erection of a teacher's residence at Fort a la Corne; moving the residence from the James Smith's School; the re-opening of this school; or the removal of these schools to a more central point on the reserve, and report as to which of these schemes he considers to be the most advantageous.\n\nSecond,- Thunderchild's Reserve. The question of providing a day school for the children of this reserve cannot be favourably considered at the present time. It is hoped to be able to provide for the education of these children in residential schools.\n\nThird,- Red Pheasants. It is noted that the teacher will be leaving on June 30th, next. The Department will be prepared to pay a salary at the rate of $900.00 per annum for a teacher with a Normal School Certificate. There is no need for the services of a married couple at this school, as the field matron work has been discontinued and there is no need for a dispenser. It is considered that a single female teacher would best meet the requirements at this school, and the Department will be pleased if you will endeavour to secure the services of a female teacher with a Normal School Certificate in time to take charge upon the re-opening of the school after the summer holidays.\n\nFourth,- Big River School, Osilton Agency. In November, last, Your Lordship brought to the attention of the Department the question of re-opening this school and appointing a teacher. Mr. Agent Weir was instructed to inform you that a salary at the rate of $600.00 per annum would be provided and to request that you endeavour to obtain a suitable teacher. The Department will be prepared to pay a salary at the rate of $900.00 per annum for a teacher with a Normal School Certificate.\n\nWith\n\nRight Rev. D. H. Newnham,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nWith reference to the accommodation, the present house is owned by the Church and it is considered that Your Lordship should arrange to have it repaired and made comfortable to provide the necessary accommodation. Mr. Commissioner Graham is being written to regarding school matters on this reserve and requested to advise the Department as to his views in connection with the carrying on of the day school and the repairs necessary to the school building. As he is familiar with the conditions at this point the Department will await his decision regarding the re-opening of the school.\n\nFifth.\u2014Regarding the salaries the Department is prepared to pay for qualified teachers I beg to say that a salary at the rate of $900.00 per annum will be paid to teachers having Normal School Certificates. The names, qualifications and experience of teachers nominated by you should be submitted for approval in each case.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, April 15, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nHis Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan requests that the Big River Indian Day School in the Carlton Agency, which has been vacant for some time, be re-opened. He states that both the school-house and the teacher's residence at this point are in a shocking condition and need repairs.\n\nHis Lordship is being informed that this matter is being referred to you to furnish a report concerning educational matters on this reserve and whether, in your opinion, you would advise that the school be re-opened. I shall be glad if you will at your earliest convenience report as to your views concerning the Bishop's request.\n\nThe Department will be prepared to pay a salary at the rate of $900.00 per annum for a teacher having a Normal School certificate.\n\nAs far as the Department is aware the teacher's residence is owned by the Church authorities, and, if so, they should make the necessary repairs. Any repairs required to the school building should be stated and the probable cost of having the work done.\n\nThe last reports from this school when it was in operation shows that there were about twenty children enrolled, but the average attendance was only six.\n\nYour consideration and report as to the best means of providing educational facilities for this reserve will be appreciated at an early date as possible, in order that the Bishop can be informed as to what the Department is prepared to do regarding his request.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, informing me that His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan, has made a request that the Indian day School on the Big River Reserve, Carlton Agency, be reopened and pointed out that both the school house and Teachers residence are in a shocking condition.\n\nThis is quite true, the school and residence are in a shocking condition. The buildings are old log structures and I doubt if they can be made habitable. The school has been nothing more or less than absolute failure, during the last two years that it was open.\n\nThe Indians in this Reserve are hunters and are away a great deal of the time, and naturally this makes it hard to keep up a school. The Indians take little or no interest in education and although there has been a school on this Reserve for years, I doubt if you can find a child on the reserve that shows any appearance of ever having attended it.\n\nIn view of these conditions, I cannot advise the re-opening of this school, infact it would be a mistake to do so.\n\nBut how to find educational facilities for these children and the children of other Reserves, that are under the auspices of the Anglican church is a question that will have to receive the serious consideration of the Department, as the day schools in this District are not a success. The sooner we can provide an up-to-date residential school that will take care of all the Anglican children on the north, the better it will be for the Indians and the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nCommissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, April 29, 1920.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nWith reference to previous correspondence regarding the re-opening of the Big River School in the Carlton Agency I beg to say that the Department has received a report which bears out Your Lordship's statement that both the school-house and teacher's residence are in a very poor state of repair and are unfit for school purposes.\n\nAs it would appear that considerable expenditure would be required to place these buildings in a suitable condition, it is considered that, owing to the indifference of the Indian parents and the lack of interest taken by them in education, the expense involved would not warrant the Department in having the necessary work completed in putting the buildings in good condition. In view of these conditions, it is advisable that the re-opening of this school be postponed for the present.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newnham,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nOttawa, April 29, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 20th instant regarding the re-opening of the Indian day school on the Big River Reserve, Carlton Agency, I beg to say that His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan is being informed that, in view of the present condition of the buildings and the lack of interest taken by the Indians in education, it is considered that the Department would not be justified in making the expenditure required in repairing the school building and teacher's residence and that it is, therefore, advisable that the re-opening of this school be postponed for the present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

He was informed that this arrangement would be satisfactory. We have not been informed as to the action taken by His Lordship to carry out the above suggestion, and we are communicating with him in the matter.

(RG 10, Volume 6280, file 602-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nExtract from Report of Inspector Murison on the Big River Indian Day School.\n\nI visited this school on January 29th, it is situated on the Big River Reserve about forty miles north of the Agency. This school was re-opened in September 1924 with Mr. R.B. Settee in charge as teacher. Mr. Settee had been teacher at the Montreal Lake Day School for a number of years, but I am informed did not make a success of that school. It is my opinion that he does not possess the personality required to make a success as a school teacher. While he is very respectable he does not possess the force of character which is necessary to command attendance at an Indian Day School.\n\nThe old class room has been repaired and I found it very clean and nicely decorated with spruce branches. The Church Authorities have not made provisions for proper housing accommodation for this man, and he is living in the old farm house which is in a very poor state of repair.\n\nThere are twenty-six pupils enrolled, twelve boys and fourteen girls. They range in age from six to sixteen years. The average attendance for the past month is shown on the register as 12.61. The children have to come from two to four miles, and I am told that many cannot come during the cold weather on account of poor clothing. The members of this Band largely subsist by hunting and take their children along with them when following this pursuit. It would be a difficult matter to operate a Day School successfully under those conditions. In my opinion I think it would be advisable that an increased effort be made to have these children attend the Boarding Schools. A start has been made already in this direction, but I think a more determined effort should be made to have these children properly cared for.\n\nCommissioner Graham forwarded the above under cover of his letter of February 19, 1926, and states:\n\n\"I would draw your attention to what the Inspector says about Mr. Settee, teacher at the Big River Day School. It seems to me that steps should be taken to place a qualified teacher here but the question is, could we get a teacher to go and live under the conditions that Mr. Settee is living under. The buildings are very poor and isolated, and I am quite sure we would have difficulty in getting any person who was a qualified teacher to go out there.\"\nExtract from Report of Inspector Drimmie on the Big River School - dated September 30th, 1926.\n\nOriginal on file 107-2-6\n\nMr. John Sutten.\n\nQualifications - His qualifications are meagre. He has had practically no training.\n\nSuccess - Fair - In a somewhat crude way he is teaching pupils to read, spell and work a few simple questions in Arithmetic, of a rather mechanical nature.\nInspector Morrison's report on schools, Carlton Agency.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on the day schools in the Carlton Agency, which I visited when making my last inspection this year. Day schools are in operation on the following reserves:\n\nBig River,\nSturgeon Lake,\nWahpaton Sioux,\nSandy Lake,\nMontreal Lake.\n\nThe day school on the Mistawasis Reserve has been closed by the Department, but it has been reopened and is being operated as a boarding school by the Continuing Presbyterian Church at their own expense. I visited this school, however, and am submitting a report as to conditions there.\n\nBIG RIVER DAY SCHOOL.\n\nI visited this school on November 23rd, and found 3 boys and 4 girls in attendance, out of an enrolment of 21, 7 boys and 14 girls. The classes are divided as follows:\n\n| Standard | I   | II  | III | IV  |\n|----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n|          | 11  | 2   | 6   | 2   |\n\nThe average attendance for the September quarter was 14.86, but there has been a falling off in the attendance owing to the cold weather and the fact that a large number of the parents have been away from the reserve working out and hunting. The people on this reserve are W. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6280, file 602-1, part 1)\nBIG RIVER DAY SCHOOL (Cont'd.)\n\npoor, and I found that the children had not adequate clothing for the cold weather. The girls in attendance, with one exception, were clad in a single print dress with an overall apron. The exception had a sweater only in addition. They all had 1 pr. of stockings and moccasins. This is not sufficient protection for winter weather, and as some of the children have to come from three to four miles from their homes, a regular attendance cannot be expected during the winter months. It is a wonder that they turn out at all during the severe weather.\n\nThey are provided with biscuits, tea and beef and rice soup for a mid-day lunch. The teacher had a garden and gives the children potatoes and turnips while they last.\n\nOf the children enrolled, eight are from 12 to 15 years of age, and I think it would be a good thing if the parents of these children could be induced to send them to a boarding school.\n\nThe school building is log, willowed and plastered outside. It has been whitewashed inside and out, and was very clean, tidy and comfortable. The old double desks are in a very poor state of repair.\n\nMr. J. R. Settee is still in charge as teacher at this point. This man's qualifications are well known to the Department as he has been teaching day schools for over 30 years. He also has charge of the missionary work on the reserve. He was living in the old farm house, but has now fixed up what was formerly a small blacksmith shop as he found it very hard to keep the old house warm. It would be quite impossible to expect a qualified teacher to take over this school and put up with the conditions as they exist. I found the children rather backward in answering...\nBIG RIVER DAY SCHOOL (Cont'd.)\n\nanswering questions. I believe Mr. Settee is a man of good moral character and means well, but he is not aggressive enough to make a success of this school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Marison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., December 28th, 1927\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to forward herewith Inspector Murison's report on the Day Schools in the Carlton Agency, which was inadvertently omitted when my letter of the 23rd. instant went forward to you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the five Day Schools in the Carlton Agency, which were inspected by Mr. Murison during the latter part of November and the early part of December.\n\nThe Big River Day School has never been considered satisfactory. The attendance is irregular and the building is poor. I cannot see that any improvement has taken place since the last inspection. In forwarding a report on this school on February 14th, last, I stated that I was in doubt as to whether it would be advisable to build a new school or not, and I am still of this opinion. The children in this northern part of the country will, sooner or later, have to be brought to a Boarding School, as none of the Day Schools at this point are doing what I consider to be good work.\n\nThe average attendance at the Sturgeon Lake Day School is not bad, considering the conditions under which the Indians are living. This is undoubtedly the best school of the lot. You will note that the teacher has no desk. It might be a good idea to send one from Eaton's, as it would cost very little. There is nothing in the Estimates to provide for a floor for the teacher's residence. This, however, would not cost more than $25.00. The heating stove in the building should be replaced without delay. This will cost about $35.00.\n\nYou will note that the Sandy Lake Day School is a log building sheeted on the outside and wainscoted inside with V-joint. The Inspector says it should be re-kalsomined and painted inside, and I may say that there is an amount in the Estimates for this purpose. You will note that there is indifference here on the part of the Indians about sending their children to school.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nWith reference to the Wahpaton Sioux Day School, I may say that, in my opinion, it has never amounted to anything and never will.\n\nRegarding the Inspector's remarks in connection with the Mistawasis Day School, I think this is a decidedly bad arrangement to have children housed up in rooms of that size with no fire protection, and with no control over the feeding of them. The teacher cannot begin to feed, clothe and house children on the small amount he is receiving.\n\nI have been of the opinion for a long time that there should be an Anglican Boarding School in the northern part of this province to take care of the large number of children who are getting a very indifferent education in Day Schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nJanuary 5, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 303-11 of the 23rd ultimo, enclosing Mr. Inspector Murison's report on the five day schools in the Carlton Agency. I note your opinion that one residential school should be provided so that these more or less unsuccessful day schools could be all closed. I am giving the situation at the Mistawasis Reserve serious consideration.\n\nIn connection with the Ahtahkakoops Indian Day School, I may say that we are arranging for desks and blackboards and I am authorizing the agent to repair the fence in the spring. At a later date, I will send you the necessary authority for the renovating and repairing of the interior of the school building.\n\nYou will receive a further communication regarding the improvements required at the Sturgeon Lake Indian Day School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF MR. COMMISSIONER GRAHAM, dated 18th May, 1928, forwarding Mr. Inspector Drimmie's report on the Big River Indian Day School.\n\nI enclose for your information a copy of the report by Provincial School Inspector Mr. W. J. Drimmie of his visit on May 9th to the Big River Day School. This is not a satisfactory report and I would call your attention to previous remarks I have made concerning this school when forwarding Inspector Murison's reports of his visits, particularly to my letter of the 23rd December last.\n\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. INSPECTOR DRIMMIE, dated May 9, 1928, on his inspection of the Big River Indian Day School.\n\nThe school is being managed about as well as we can expect from a man who has had no professional training but until trained teachers are placed in charge of such schools, satisfactory progress cannot be made.\n\nThe attendance was very low on the occasion of my visit. This low attendance is due to the fact that a large number of the Indians are away hunting rats.\nKINGCHOTAYO DAY SCHOOL (BIG RIVER)\n\nThis school is under the auspices of the Anglican Church with Mr. John R. Settee in charge as teacher. This school was visited on March 13th, when I found 5 girls and 4 boys present out of an enrolment of 26. The average attendance for the December quarter was 16.42. The pupils were poorly, but fairly warmly clad. Their parents are poor and subsist by hunting, fishing and working out for settlers. These occupations take them away from the reserve a great deal and affect the regularity of the attendance. A bowl of hot nourishing soup, as well as tea, is given the pupils at mid-day. I was present and noted that the children thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nThe school building has been repaired and a frame lean-to porch added. I found the building bright, clean and comfortable. A wash basin, as well as a water cooler, has been furnished.\n\nThe teacher is still living in the old farm house, a very dilapidated building, and I feel that more fitting accommodation should be provided. The house is really not fit to live in during the cold weather, or at any time for that matter.\n\nMr. Settee is very easy going and does not appear to have any ambition to help himself. Conditions at this point do not change much from year to year and it seems to me that they are simply marking time under the present conditions.\nRegina, Sask., April 15th, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to submit herewith Inspector Murison's report on the various schools in the Carlton Agency.\n\nIt seems to me there is room for a change at the Big River Day School, but I do not know what to suggest. The school has just been started and perhaps another year will make it clear as to what should be done. I hesitate to recommend a new building for the teacher. However, if one could be built of logs for four or five hundred dollars it might be a good investment. I doubt if Mr. Settee is the man for this job, in fact I do not think he is.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nEXTRACT FROM ANNUAL REPORT OF MR. J. R. SETTEE,\nTEACHER OF THE BIG RIVER INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\n---\n\nOriginal on No. 1929-1F - Sask.\n\nI consider that I have done my duty on various Indian Reserves and also in Indian day schools for 34 years. On Big River Reserve for 3 years and 8 months. I am not certificated but I have had more experience than any of the school teachers in Carlton Agency so I think its about time the Department of Indian Affairs should consider this. They should increase my salary and give me a suitable dwelling house. The building or house that I am using was the farm instructor's dwelling house years ago. When it rains in the summer the water comes right through. I don't see why I shouldn't get the help which the other teachers in Carlton Agency get. They can't do and will not be able to do any better than I can. My wife helps me a lot for she also has had a college education.\nOttawa, April 24, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that, at the request of Mr. John R. Settee, teacher of the Big River Indian Day School, the Department has decided to grant him an increase, from the 1st instant, of $5 per teaching month in his salary. This will make the salary allowed him at the rate of $65 per teaching month. I have to request that you will inform Mr. Settee accordingly.\n\nThe Department has no funds available this present year to erect a new residence at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Weir, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 107-3-1 of the 24th ultimo, advising me that the Department has decided to grant Mr. John R.

J. Drimmie of a visit early this month to the Big River Day School.\n\nI would again draw your attention to the unsatisfactory condition existing at this school. The teacher is utterly incompetent and it is only a waste of time and money to have a man of this calibre employed. This situation has been brought to the attention of the Department on various occasions, and I really think that something should be done to remedy matters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 25, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 308-11 of the 22nd instant, enclosing the Provincial School Inspector's report on the Big River Indian Day School. I believe the time has come when it is necessary to erect a residence at this school and secure the services of a properly qualified teacher. An item will be put in the Estimates and the church authorities will be written in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, October 28, 1929.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI wish to inform Your Lordship that the Department is not at all satisfied with the services of Mr. Settee, teacher of the Big River Indian Day School. I believe the time has come when a properly qualified teacher should be appointed to this post, and the Department will arrange to erect a teacher's residence next year. I shall be pleased if Your Lordship will keep this in mind, so that a nomination can reach the Department next summer - Mr. Settee's services to be discontinued as from June 30th, next.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

November 14th, 1929.\n\nInspector Murison's report on schools in the Carlton Agency.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on the Big River (Kinematayo), Ahtahtakoops, Sturgeon Lake, Little Red River, Wahpaton Sioux, and Mistawasis Indian Day Schools, which I visited during the month of October last.\n\nBIG RIVER DAY SCHOOL (Anglican)\n\nI visited this school on October 22nd, but did not find any children in attendance. The teacher stated that there had been a dance over the weekend and the children had not turned up. The dance had broken up before our arrival. It is very evident that the teacher, Mr. Settes, has very little influence over these Indians. He made no attempt to get the children, and I attribute the poor attendance at this school, to a great extent, to his lack of aggressiveness. If the children come of their own accord it is all right, but if they do not turn up I am of the opinion that the man is too listless to make an effort to correct the parents. It appears to me that this school, under present conditions, is not of any value, insofar as providing the Indian children with an education is concerned. It would be much better to close it up and endeavour to have the children placed in residential schools.\n\nI would again call your attention to the teacher's residence. In the event of making a change of teachers, I am of the opinion that it would be hard to get a qualified, self-respecting teacher to take up residence.\n\nM. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6280, file 602-1, part 1)\nBIG RIVER DAY SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nin the building now being occupied by Mr. Settee. The need for a new residence at this school is a pressing one if the school is to be continued in operation.\n\nThe schoolroom is in good condition and I found it very clean and tidy. It has been kalsomined and painted.\n\nThere are 25 pupils enrolled, 13 girls and 12 boys. The average for the 15 school days in October was slightly over 11, or less than 50%.\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith Inspector Murison's report on the various schools in the Carlton Agency.\n\nBig River Anglican School.\n\nThe report on this school is very unsatisfactory. In Department letter No. 107-3-1 dated October 28th, last you state that you believe the time has come when it is necessary to erect a residence at this school and secure the services of a properly qualified teacher. It would be a mistake to put a residence here and let Mr. Settee occupy it, and I think that if it is proposed to reorganize the work it would be advisable to retire Mr. Settee at once and if necessary close the school until such time as a proper teacher can be secured.\n\nAhtahtakoops Day School.\n\nI question very much if it would be good business to supply drivers at this school. It would be a pretty expensive business and it seems to me that the children who live at great distances from the school should be sent to Boarding School. With reference to the repairs required to the classroom and teacher's residence, the Agent has placed nothing in the Estimates for this work.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSturgeon Lake Day School.\n\nYou will note the attendance has not been at all satisfactory here. This is not the first time I have received complaints about this school and the Agent has been written to but apparently is unable to improve matters.\n\nMistawasis Indian Day School.\n\nYou will note what the Inspector says regarding the matter of bringing the children back into residence. I am of the opinion that this would be a mistake. You will remember that we have had a lot of correspondence on this matter. However, I do not think it would be wise to take any steps until something develops.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n(2)\n\nA priest who can speak no Cree, just at the present time would seem fatal to our work as a Church. Mr. Settee, being able to converse freely with the old people in Cree is gradually winning them over to Christianity. I know the house is not like that of a good white housewife, and I know that the school attendance has not been good, though I am doubtful if that is the teacher's fault. But as a missionary, I believe he has given teaching which a non-Cree-speaking man could not give. Under these circumstances we should like to keep him there as missionary, and he could visit Chitek Lake also. Would the Department pay the new teacher a sufficient salary for him to live on without any additional salary from the Church? Also would it approve of appointing his wife as field-matron, so that the salary would be added to in that way?\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. L. J.

I wish to draw your attention to the significant statement of the Agent in the column of 'Remarks'. The report of his visit in January contains no remarks at all. The fact is that Mr. Settee's services have long ceased to be of any use, and I have constantly drawn this matter to the attention of the Department during the past year or two. Last October under cover of your 107-3-1, you expressed the opinion that the time had come when it would be necessary to erect a residence at this school and secure the services of a properly qualified teacher. Apparently no action has been taken to secure the better education of the children of the Big River Indians, and, in my opinion, the time for a change is past due.\n\nI trust that I can receive the Department's assurance that action will be taken in the very near future, if it has not already been taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Mr. R. J. Settee has been in charge as teacher for about five years, but is being replaced, and I understand a new teacher has been appointed. When at the reserve I made complete arrangements for the erection of a residence for the teacher, and the work was well under way before I left the Agency. It is to be hoped that with the appointment of a new teacher, something more will be accomplished at this school. It certainly has not been a success in the past.\n\nSgd. W. Murray\nAsst. Indian Affairs\nKINEMATAYO INDIAN DAY SCHOOL, BIG RIVER RES.\n\nA new man, Mr. D. E. Eastmead, has just taken over this work, and I would expect good results from his efforts. The children are very backward, and will scarcely speak.\n\nThe roll\nKINEMATAYO INDIAN DAY SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nThe roll calls for 20, and I found 9 present. They are graded as follows:- 15 in Grade I, and 5 in Grade II.\n\nThe school is a log building with the windows on both sides. It was clean, and I found the room bright and cheerful.\n\nA new residence was erected this year for the teacher. It is a five roomed bungalow, and is well built and very comfortable.\n\nA garden should be ploughed in readiness for next year, as the teacher wishes to help the children along this line, and it will also be a means of supplying vegetables for the noon meal. The garden, school, and residence should be fenced.\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of Inspector Ferris' report on the Big River Day School, Carlton Agency, which was inspected by him on the 16th of the present month.\n\nI would draw your attention to the small number of pupils present, and it looks to me as if the Department are not warranted in keeping this school open. It is absurd to keep a school open for an attendance of 1 boy and 1 girl. Of course, this may have been an off day, but I have looked over the return of a year ago, and I find that there were only 2 boys and 8 girls in attendance. This does not signify what the average was - it may have been 3 or 4.\n\nI think the Department would do well to investigate this matter and see whether it is advisable to keep this school open at this particular time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Since this time he had had between ten and fifteen daily.\n\nI might mention that the Indians of Big River reserve make their living from hunting and trapping, which means that at times they take their children with them as they cannot be left behind.

In this connection I would refer you to Provincial Inspector R. H. Ferris' Report of an inspection, which he made of this school on November 28, 1932. The Inspector's report indicates very satisfactory progress, and I can hardly think that the work has gone back very materially since that time. Before acting on Mr. Davis' report I would like to visit this school again personally.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

It appears to me on checking back returns that, since Mr. Eastmead was engaged four years ago, that children who were in Grade I are still in this grade, and if a change is not made we will have pupils in Grade I on the old age ration list.

I would appreciate your keeping the matter in mind, and I would request you to inspect the school when you next visit the Carlton Agency.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. Maclean,\nActing Secretary.\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nI visited this school on February 19th and found 5 pupils in attendance out of an enrollment of 16. I noted from the register that 7 of these pupils attended very regularly, practically 100%, the balance of the pupils attending very intermittently. Practically all the children come from homes within a radius of 3 miles of the school. The 5 pupils in attendance were all in Grade 1. I asked them questions in English, but they did not appear to understand me. They did understand Cree and would answer me in that language. In so far as the academic work is concerned at this school, I consider it very unsatisfactory.\n\nFifteen of the pupils are classed in Grade 1 and 1 in Grade 2.\n\nWhen on the Reserve the Indians complained to me that their children were not learning anything and they charged that the teacher was not giving the time and attention to work in the classroom that he should. Mr. Eastwood holds a First Class Permanent certificate. His academic standing is good. However after seeing the school and the teacher, I am of the opinion that he is out of his element in an Indian day school. The Indians apparently have no confidence in him and I question if he has the personality to inspire the necessary confidence to enlist the cooperation of the Indian parents. I am now quite in accord with Mr. Davis in that there should be a change of teachers at this point, if we are to expect even a measure of success in connection with the work of the school.\n\nI found the school building neat and tidy, as well as the teacher's cottage and premises. I am sure the children are not below average in intelligence and they are capable of being taught, but it is a question of obtaining a teacher who can impress his personality on the Indian parents and make the school work attractive to the Indian pupils. The Chief and Councillors were sufficiently interested in this question to make a special trip of nearly 40 miles to the Agency to see me for the purpose of having another talk and put in a further appeal to have this teacher transferred and a new one appointed. With that feeling towards a teacher existing, it will be impossible to look forward to much success.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Pupils show little capacity in this direction.\n\nSuggestions: I would suggest that the teacher continue to stress that phase of the classroom work which may be classified as \"manual training,\" sewing, knitting, and hand-work of that sort. Every possible effort should be made to induce the children to talk in the English language. Pupils are disposed to be very shy and reticent.\n\nREMARKS RELATIVE TO THE EXAMINATION OF THE PUPILS\n\nAll pupils present on the above date were classified as Grade 1, though there were two or three divisions of the grade. Some of these children have been in attendance off and on for the past two years. Those who have attended two years submitted specimens of WRITING which were neat and legible. Those in attendance from 1 year to 4 months are getting the form of the letters but their performance is not as yet of high quality.\n\n(This section of the report is continued on sheet 4.)\n\nSignature of Inspector:\n\nNOTE\u2014This form to be used for Indian Day Schools only.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6280, file 602-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe average attendance for the current quarter, as indicated by the school register, is a little higher than that recorded in previous reports on this school. Some of the children reside as far as five miles from the school and this may be regarded as a valid excuse for irregular attendance. Those living within reasonable distance of the school have been fairly regular in attendance.\n\nRegularity in attendance can be attained only through the cooperation of parents and teacher. The teacher's part is to endeavor to make school life sufficiently attractive to induce children to attend more or less of their own accord. The hot mid-day meal is an important factor in this respect.\n\nORDER, CLEANLINESS AND DISCIPLINE\n\nPUNCTUALITY. Pupils frequently late in arriving at school.\n\nCLASS ORGANIZATION Satisfactory.\n\nPRESERVATION AND ARRANGEMENT of Furniture Good.\n\nCARE OF MATERIAL Good.\n\nCLEANLINESS of Pupils With one or two exceptions, pupils were clean.\n\ndo School-house Good.\n\nOBEYDENCE Good.\n\nCONDUCT of Pupils in School Good.\n\ndo out of School Enter cheerfully into play activities.\n\nSCHOOL FURNITURE\n\nPlease indicate what classroom equipment should be supplied\n\nINVENTORY.\u2014Teacher's Desk 1 Desks 23 Benches 0 Chairs 1\n\nCupboards 1 Blackboards 1 Stoves 1 Stovepipes 25 Washbasins 2\n\nBrooms 1 Axes 1 Soap nil Towels nil Pails nil\n\nDrinking Cups 1 Looking-glasses Other equipment Pictures of King and Queen; map of Prairie Provinces.\n\nNew equipment required: Heater for schoolroom.

The most that the teacher can hope to accomplish with the material at hand is to develop habits of cleanliness and encourage better living conditions. If pupils acquire a knowledge of the principles of healthful living and some measure of skill in hand-work, that is about all that can be expected. Possibly a little more emphasis on oral language work could be introduced to good advantage.\n\n\"Please turn over\"\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6280, file 602-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nNUMBER WORK OR ARITHMETIC: In this line of activity pupils displayed little more than the ability to count as far as \"ten\". It is apparently very difficult to build up any real or lasting number concepts. At one moment the sum of 2 and 4 is \"6\", but five minutes later it may be \"3\", \"4\" or \"7\". It will take long and patient effort to teach these pupils the fifty-five addition facts required for grade 1.\n\nREADING: Pupils read from the \"Joe-and-Ruth\" Primer for me. One improvement noted was that pupils now speak out so that they can be heard from a short distance at any rate. Pronunciation was good with the exception of those sounds with which children of this race experience special difficulty,- \"f\", \"v\", \"l\", and \"th\". They evidently have some idea of what they are reading, but it is very difficult to induce them to make any attempt to express this idea in their own words.\n\nWORK BOOKS: The work books which accompany the readers referred to above were examined. Some of the pupils show an appreciation of color and a measure of skill in drawing. Other show very little capacity along this line.\n\nThe most valuable part of the pupils' training and the one in which the greatest measure of success is being achieved is in the field of hand-work already referred to. It would appear that this is about the only line of work that the children have the capacity to grasp.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMarch 25, 1935.\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General.\n\nReferring to my memorandum of the 8th instant, relative to dispensing with the services, as from June 30th next, of Mr. David E.

Especially at this time of the year, the whole band seems to go off after muskrats, only one or two leaving their wives and children. All those living within 3 miles attend whenever they are on the reserve.\n\nOne man always sends notice when he is going away, and sends his children as soon as he returns. Another has built a house one-half mile from school, so as to give his children a chance, but has gone back to the North end of reserve for trapping. There are one or two more who need no urging to send their children but in many cases I have to try to get them by talking to the parents. The two councillors help, but the chief is not very keen. They too part of the band resides mainly at Stony Lake, twenty miles directly N.E., and only see those children when they visit here. Even at that they usually come to school. On the whole the average attendance by percentage had remained about stationary for the last ten years.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. B. MacLeod\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 1C, Volume 6280, file 602-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nREGINA, Saskatchewan,\nJune 4th., - 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReference Your No.107-3-1 of May 15th.\nBig River School.\n\nIn reply to this letter I shall attempt to give my ideas and reason for the conclusion at which I have arrived.\n\nIn a survey of the Reserves on which we have day schools, we find certain reserves where agriculture predominates, others where hunting and trapping are the chief source of subsistence. On the farming Reserves there are farming instructors, on the others the only contact we have is through the occasional visits of the Agent, or through the School teacher.\n\nIn the appointment of teachers I think consideration should be given to each particular type of Reserve. For example, on an agriculture Reserve there is a farming instructor, the Indians are more advanced. On these Reserves a more intensive programme of education can be carried on, sewing, knitting and housekeeping should be stressed, and I think the teacher should be required to visit the homes, organize the women and give half a day a week instructing them in sewing, knitting, handicraft and\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nhousekeeping work, using the school room for that purpose. The farming instructor should, during the winter, give half a day a week to instructing the boys in the use of the hammer, saw, etc. He could do this on the day the teacher had the women's class, and the girls could work with their mothers.\n\nThe carrying out of this policy would necessitate the employment of women teachers, or a married man whose wife would undertake to instruct the girls and women in sewing, etc.\n\nOn Reserves where hunting and trapping predominate I think a man teacher who would fill the dual position of Teacher and Overseer would be in the best interests. This man should, of course, be carefully selected and with the understanding that his wife would be required to instruct the girls in sewing, etc., and also organize the women for the same purpose.\n\nThe Indians on these Reserves are very backward. We cannot hope to make any great advance in either education or farming in this generation. Consequently a man and woman with the ability to impart knowledge and a propensity to social work, together with a fair education and a knowledge of gardening and farming should be selected for the position.\n\nWith a closer co-operation with the Church and a better understanding of what our aims and objects are, I do not think we should have any difficulty in securing satisfactory men and women for these positions.\n\nKinistino Reserve - We have had a farming instructor on this Reserve for some time but these Indians are very backward. They do not believe in education and do very little agricultural work. I may be wrong, but it is my opinion that a man and woman of the type mentioned will for the next few years do better work than a separate farming instructor and teacher and at less expense to the Department.\n\nBig River Reserve - This is another place where in my opinion we should have a man as teacher and overseer. We have, however, in Miss. Merrett a splendid teacher and one whose services should not be lost to the Department. As there is no other school to which she could be transferred, I would recommend that no action be taken this year. This will give us time to give the matter\nFurther consideration, and if next Spring a change is considered advisable, the probabilities are that a transfer could be arranged.\n\nI am in accord with the necessity for security of tenure and that the teacher should not be dismissed for not doing work they were informed came under the contract. At the same time I do not think that a teacher who takes no interest in anything outside his school, more particularly on Reserves where there is no other representative of the Department, is the type of person we want in the service.\n\nIt appears to me that there is not the cooperation between the different branches of the service that there should be. The Teacher, the Missionary, the Clerk, etc., seem to feel that theirs are separate units or machines, that their work is circumscribed by certain limits, and that the cooperation, assistance or advice of one Branch is not asked for, appreciated, or wanted by the other.\n\nI believe if we could impress upon the minds of the members of each Branch, including the clergy, the fact that they are not separate units but that they are vital cogs of one machine, working for the advancement of the Indian, that the success of one depends upon the success of the other, that their cooperation, assistance and advice is not only welcome but vitally necessary, we would make much greater progress.\n\nIn conclusion I wish to say that I believe we have not paid enough attention to the Indian woman. The Indian woman has great influence on the destiny of the Indian, she makes or breaks him.\n\nWe spend a lot of money educating the girls in cleanliness, housekeeping, etc., yet when they marry we let them go into homes when they have nothing to work with, nothing in which they can take any pride or that will keep up their morale. I am satisfied the fault is greatly ours that so many of them fail and that $75.00 or $100.00 spent in supplying these young couples with household equipment would do more to advance them than $200.00 spent on horses, etc.\n\nI trust I have not worried you with my ideas.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThos. Robertson\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nOttawa, June 11, 1937.\n\nDear Dr. Robertson:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th instant and to thank you very heartily for the information contained therein.\n\nIt is my hope that, with the active cooperation of the church authorities, we shall be able to move steadily toward the objectives you have in mind. When the new school at Kinistino is built, we have in mind a very capable teacher, who has had agricultural experience and who, with his wife, should be in a position to proceed with a worthwhile community programme at that reserve.\n\nI note, also, your suggestion that the sum of $75.00 or $100.00 be spent in supplying young Indian couples with household equipment. We are making a number of such grants at the present time, but the appropriation at our disposal is somewhat limited. I shall be glad to keep your recommendations in mind, however, in the hope that this appropriation may be substantially increased in the year ahead of us.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A.

Pratt\nPrivate Secretary.\nDear Omer:\n\nRe: Your letter of July 16, Big River Reserve.\n\nWith reference to the Big River School I might point out that our Schools both Residential and Day are run under the auspices of either Church. That Church nominates the Teachers, and so long as that School continues that Church has this privilege. The Big River School is under the auspices of the Church of England, consequently the Church of England has the right of nominating the Teacher. Any effort to have a Roman Catholic appointed to this School would simply stir up trouble, as any effort to have a Protestant appointed to a School under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church would. Father Faquette should know this and I would be very sorry to see him take any further action in the matter.\n\nNo religious instructions are given that exception can be taken to by any Church, but I am sure that arrangements can be made whereby the School will be made available to Father Faquette to give the children of his denomination religious instruction.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nMr. Omer Demers, M.L.A.,\nMattoe, Saskatchewan.\n\nTR/AM\nMattes, Sask.,\nLakeview Farm,\n19th, July 1938\n\nDr. Thos. D. Robertson\nSupt. Indian Affairs\nFederal Bldg.,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Doctor;-\n\nRev. Father G.E. Paquette O.M.I., who is in charge of the Catholic Mission of the Big River Indian Reserve has asked me to help him in securing the services of a Catholic Teacher for the School on that Reserve. He has perhaps written to you about this matter, but in case he hasn't I thought that I should bring this request to your attention and if possible assist him in getting the teacher he is asking for.\n\nIt appears that his claim is justified in view of the fact that the majority of residents and the majority of children attending that school are of the Catholic Faith.\n\nI am not sure that this matter is a matter which can be dealt with through your office but hope that you will be able to give your assistance to Father Paquette. Anything you may be able to do will be appreciated by him and myself as well.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6280, file 602-1, part 2)\nDear Sir:\n\nI am attaching a letter received from Omer Demers, M.L.A. together with my reply regarding the Big River Day School, Carlton Agency, which I trust will meet with your approval.\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nTR/AM\nOttawa,\nAugust 12, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Big River Indian Day School\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of Mr. Pratt's memoranda of July 30 and August 5 enclosing correspondence from Dr. H. R. Fleming, M.P., Omer Demers, M.L.A., and Rev. G. E. Paquette, O.M.I., requesting that a Catholic teacher be employed at the above-mentioned school.\n\nAbout thirty years ago the Anglican Church authorities brought to the Department's attention the necessity for having a day school on this Reserve. The Big River School was started at that time and ever since the Anglican Bishop of Saskatchewan has been allowed to nominate the teacher.\n\nThe statistics regarding the religion of the Indians of the Big River Band as supplied in Mr. Demers' letter are practically the same as shown in our official census of 1934. From this it is evident that the Catholics on the Big River Reserve greatly outnumber the Anglicans.\n\nAs our day school return forms do not require the teacher to state the religion of the pupils attending the school I am unable to advise you whether or not the information regarding the religion of the children of school age is correct.\nI am under the impression that very few of the Catholic Indian children have been attending the day school but they have usually been enrolled at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School. Owing to the general increase in school population the Duck Lake School apparently finds it impossible to accept as many children as formerly from the Big River Reserve. As a result the Catholic children of school age on the Big River Reserve are apparently attending the day school in larger numbers and, as the Catholics are in the majority on the Reserve, the Missionary, Rev. G.E. Paquette, O.M.I., considers that the teacher should be a Catholic.\n\nIt will be difficult to change the teacher for the academic year 1938-39 due to the fact that the school year opens within the next few weeks and the same teacher who was in charge of the school last year is, I understand, prepared to resume duties.\n\nOn the other hand the Catholic Indians have the right, under the Indian Act, to demand a school conducted under Catholic auspices, provided they have sufficient children to justify operation of a day school. From the information now available it would appear that this is the case. However, I am communicating with Inspector Robertson requesting him to obtain definite information regarding the religion of the children of school age on this Reserve in order that we can ascertain how many of them are Catholics and how many Anglicans.\n\nI return the correspondence which was forwarded with the two memoranda mentioned above.\n\nActing Director.\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo enclosing letter received by you from Mr. Omer Demers, M.L.A., also a copy of your reply in connection with the teaching services at the Big River Indian Day School.\n\nThis matter had already been brought to the Department's attention. If you refer to the last official census you will note that the Catholics on the Big River Reserve greatly outnumber the Anglicans and consequently it was to be expected that at some time they would demand a Catholic teacher. I realize, of course, that it would be awkward to change the teacher for the coming academic year but in view of the provision in the Indian Act there is no question that if the Catholics ask for a day school on this Reserve, and if they have enough children to justify operation of a school, the Department would be obliged to provide a day school for the Catholic children. Apparently the majority of the Catholic children in the past have been attending the Duck Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nI would appreciate if you would instruct Indian Agent Davis to obtain the following information at once and forward same to me through your office:\n\n1. Number of Catholic children on Big River Reserve between the ages of 7 and 16.\n2. Number of Anglican children on Big River Reserve between the ages of 7 and 16.\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n3. Number of Catholic children on the Big River Reserve under 7 years of age.\n\n4. Number of Anglican children on the Big River Reserve under 7 years of age.\n\nAt the same time Indian Agent Davis should state the number of both Catholic and Anglican children of school age who are at present attending any Residential School. The name of the Residential School should also be given.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos. McGoogin,\nActing Secretary.\nOttawa, October 8, 1936.\n\nDear Miss Merritt:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 27th ultimo, in which you submit, for departmental consideration, a number of problems confronting you in the operation of your school.\n\nI must express regret that the funds at our disposal did not permit us to proceed with the reconstruction of the kitchen at your school. However, if you are urgently in need of a stove, you should submit your request to the Indian agent and have him forward it to the Department. If this is done, an attempt will be made to purchase a stove at the earliest possible date.\n\nThe earlier part of your letter suggests that an attempt is being made to have a Roman Catholic school established on your reserve. If such is the case, this action is in no sense due to dissatisfaction with your work. It is my opinion that your work at the school has been uniformly good and uniformly satisfactory over a period of years. The Department has not the right, however, to send Roman Catholic children to a Protestant school or to a school conducted under Protestant auspices. Section 10 - subsection 2 - of the Indian Act reads:\n\n\"No Protestant child shall be assigned to a Roman Catholic school or a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices, and no Roman Catholic child shall be assigned to a Protestant school or a school conducted under Protestant auspices\".\n\nI have been informed that this has been the law in Canada since -\n\nMiss Cora Merritt,\nTeacher,\nBig River Indian Day School,\nShell River P. O., Sask.\nsince Indian day and residential schools were first established. I note your reference to the fact that no religious instruction of a sectarian character is given. It is just possible that the majority of the parents may be satisfied with the instruction provided. On the other hand, there may be parents, particularly Roman Catholics, who may be anxious to have definite religious instruction provided from day to day. Possibly, the Roman Catholic parents might be satisfied if their Priest were given an opportunity to conduct religious exercises or provide religious instruction for the Catholic pupils in attendance, after school hours, for at least two days each week.\n\nThis whole matter was referred to Dr. Robertson on August 12, last. No action will be taken by the Department until a full and complete report has been submitted by the Inspector and by the Indian Agent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nRef: Your 107-3-1 of August 12th,\nOmer Demers, MI.A., Letter.\nRe Big River Anglican Day School.\n\nI beg to submit the following information:\n\n1.

He states, however, that the above list is as accurate as he can obtain.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTho Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies, Saskatchewan.\n\nIndian Affairs.

He left the school to join the Army. He is a veteran of the last war. He was passed by the doctor here in Prince Albert but rejected by the Medical Officer in Regina on account of varicose veins. He is returning to the School at Big River today. I am most happy about this as Mr. Farebrother has done such splendid work among the Indians of Big River during the past year.\n\nI also nominate Mr. Edward Harry McGowan, of Davis, Sask., as teacher for the day school on John Smith's Reserve. Mr. McGowan has taught for many years both in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Latterly, he has been farming but feels now that he would like to go back to teaching to help us in the present difficult situation.

Behind this request is the fact that if these parents have nowhere to leave their children when they go hunting, then, out of necessity, the children must go with them, and this, of course, prevents the children from attending school.\n\nI hope you will give this matter your consideration and also, if possible, help these people out.\n\nI am, faithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBp/1\nOttawa, 25th January, 1946.\n\nDear Bishop Martin:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant with reference to the Big River C.E.

J.A. Glen,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReverend Father G.E. Paquette, O.M.I., ministrant at Big River, Indian Reservation, in Saskatchewan, and who comes from my own city, calls the following facts to my attention and asks me to make them known to you. In his letter, he states:\n\n\"Since September, we have difficulty in getting certain children to attend school. They say that at the Anglican school they can stay away as much as they like and that the family allowance is granted to them just the same. The Department had set five days for absenteeism. If the children are absent over five days per month, they do not get the allowance. At the school here, the teacher is strict about this. Last fall, young Sam Lachance of the Anglican school spent almost two weeks in front of the Catholic school waiting for the pupils to go and play. The nuns have, like myself, seen young Lachance play truant. The allowance was granted for that month such as in the case of the pupils who attend school regularly. I would not have said a word if the councillor Thomas Whitefish whose children go to the Anglican school had not stated before three or four Indians at our school, \"at the Anglican school the children are absent as often as they like and the allowance is granted regularly.\" That is a source of annoyance for us and it seems to me that the same law must apply to the children of other denominations as well as to the Catholic pupils.\n\nRecently an Indian woman, Mrs. Benjamin Netmaker went to the Ste. Famille hospital at Prince Albert. After having been examined, the doctors stated that she took too great a quantity of Indian medicine and that her internal tissues are destroyed. That is what Dr. Tucker of Prince Albert said here to a family on the reserve, and he tried to find out who gave her the medicine. First, this woman got indian remedies from Frank\nNetmaker and in addition, he bled her at the elbow. I have proofs concerning what I state. Then, Charlie Lachance also gave her medicine. When they have wheedled as much money as possible from the patient and when they see that there is no more hope, those two men call for a doctor and, if the latter is not successful, they accuse him of being inefficient, etc. I think that this is the good time to bring those two nitwits to their senses, particularly in this case; it is thought, according to the doctor's report, that the woman has blood poisoning. I would ask the Indian Department to get busy and to see that the two men get severe punishment. Then the whites who live near the reservation will stop to believe that the Indian Department is not doing its duty in this respect and that the Department appoints unqualified doctors to look after the Indians.\"\n\nI believe that those facts certainly deserve your personal consideration and that of your department. Hoping to hear from you soon, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\nLionel Bertrand,\nM.P. Terrebonne.\n\nTranslation\nApril 14/48.\nApril 16, 1948.\n\nTo the Deputy Minister\n\nAttention Director of Indian Affairs\n\nAttached please find letter to the Minister, dated April 13, 1948, from Lionel Bertrand, Esq., M.P., House of Commons, Ottawa, concerning representations made by Rev. Father G. E. Paquette, O.M.I., Ministrant at Big River, Indian Reservation, Saskatchewan, with regard to getting certain children to attend school, claiming that at the Anglican school they can stay away as much as they like and still receive the family allowance. He also makes representations concerning an Indian woman, Mrs. Benjamin Netmaker, now in Ste. Famille Hospital, Prince Albert, with blood poisoning having been treated by one Frank Netmaker and one Charlie Lachance before a doctor was called.\n\nPlease have a letter prepared for Mr. Pratt's signature to Mr. Bertrand, in French.\n\nLeita Vail Allingham,\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nFor draft reply as requested.\nOttawa, April 19, 1948.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDR.

Day School\nBig River R.C. Day School.\n\nPlease find attached a letter which has been received from Lionel Bertrand, M.P., concerning correspondence which he has received from Reverend Father G.E. Paquette, O.M.I., Missionary at Big River.\n\nThe first paragraph of this letter refers to an Educational and Family Allowances matter. The second paragraph refers to the Indian Health Services and is, therefore, being passed to them for attention.\n\nWith regard to Sam Lachance, our records here show that he was absent fourteen days in September (toxic illnes) five days in October (sore arm) and three days in December. Since then we have received no monthly reports from the Big River C.E. School. Therefore, it will be necessary for us to be provided with local details in order to answer this letter. We should also have the monthly reports from the Big River R.C. School for January, February and March, 1948. A copy of this letter is being sent to Indian Superintendent Jones so that you can correspond directly with him.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nEnclosure\nBFH/RM.\nOttawa, April 19, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Bertrand:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of April 13th concerning representations made by Reverend Father G. E. Paquette, O.M.I., Missionary on the Big River Indian Reservation in Saskatchewan.\n\nIn view of the local details provided, it has been necessary to refer this matter to our field officials in Saskatchewan. As soon as a report is received from them, we will provide you with further information.\n\nAs the second paragraph of Father Paquette's letter refers to a medical matter, it has been passed to the Indian Health Services for their attention.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.

Father Paquette, OM.\n\nMr. Smith, Teacher at the Anglican Day School has been written requesting him to supply certain information. When this has been received a full report will be made as requested.\n\nFor your information I would advise these charges made by Father Paquette will in all probability amount to very little. However, the seriousness of same will not be overlooked.\n\nR. S. Jones,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Day School and the Big River R.C. Day School, I am enclosing herewith copy of a letter received from Superintendent E.S. Jones, of the Carlton Agency, relative thereto.\n\nBoth train service and road travel is so disrupted in that area that it is impossible for Mr. Jones to visit the Big River Reserve at the present time. I had a discussion with him when I visited his agency two days ago, and he intends to thoroughly investigate the matters referred to by Reverend Father Paquette as soon as he can possibly reach that reserve, after which he will report to the Department, through this office.\n\nI may say in this connection that Mr. Jones is of the opinion that Mr. Smith, the teacher at the Anglican Indian Day School, is doing a fairly good job and that his attendance records are properly kept. However, the matter is serious enough that Mr. Jones will give it the desired attention as soon as possible.\n\nJ.H.B.

Not having received a reply within a reasonable time he wrote again on May 11th but has still received no reply.\n\nI shall be at the Carlton Agency on the 1st and 2nd of June, and I shall bring the matter to the attention of Mr. Jones at that time.\n\nJ.P.B.

The reason for the delay is due to the fact that we have not received any report from our field officials and when Mr. Bethune's memorandum was received, we sent a signal to Regional Supervisor Ostrander.\n\nHe has replied by air mail in a letter dated May 26th, as follows:\n\n\"With reference to Army Signal of the 26th instant in connection with the letter of Reverend Father Paquette on matters of school attendance, etc. at the Big River Reserve, formerly of the Carlton Agency, now of the Duck Lake Agency, I have to say that as Mr. Jones was unable to reach the Big River Reserve because of the condition of the roads, he wrote Mr. Smith Atimoyoo, the day school teacher, asking him for a report on the matters under consideration.

A report on the attendance at the Church of England Day School, Big River Reserve has been received from Mr. Smith Atimoyoo. A copy of his letter and report is enclosed herewith.\n\nSome of the members of the Big River Band have refused to accept Family Allowances and for this reason we have not pressed the regulations regarding school attendance to the limit. In this way we hoped to encourage all parents to register their children for payment.\n\nI asked Mr. Atimoyoo to submit a report on several children who were habitually absent from school, a copy is attached hereto. Any necessary adjustments in their cases have been made.\n\nConsidering the nomadic mode of life these people live, the school attendance of their children can not be regarded as poor.\n\nE. S. Jones,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\nBig Whitefish Lake,\nVictoire, Sask.\nMay 10th, 1948\n\nMr. E. S. Jones,\nCarlton Agency,\nLeask, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed is a report of the children's attendance for the months of September 1947 to April 1948 as you requested.\n\nDifficulty in getting mail from Victoire is a matter that has given me some inconvenience due to the lack of transportation (no horses) and the flooded river, therefore I have been dealing for the most part at Pascal which is closer and more people go there from this direction. So in future do you mind if you would address all mail to Pascal, Sask.\n\nHoping the report above has been satisfactory.\n\nYours truly,\n\nS.

Jones, of the Carlton Agency, also report from Mr. S. Atimoyoo, the day school teacher at the school in question, regarding the attendance of Indian children since the beginning of the present term.\n\nThe attendance is certainly not good and I am writing to Mr. N.J. McLeod, now Superintendent for this reserve, which is about to be transferred to the Duck Lake Agency, asking Mr. McLeod to give special attention to the attendance at that school in the future.\n\nJUN 15 1948\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nOttawa, June 24, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nWith reference to Mr. Adams' memorandum of June 22nd, the only additional information that we have received is contained in a letter from Regional Supervisor Ostrander and Superintendent Jones. I enclose copies of both these letters.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP/MGD\nOttawa, June 30, 1948.\n\nLionel Bertrand, Esq., M.P.,\nSte. Therese de Blainville, Que.\n\nBig River Indian Reserve.\n\nI am now able to provide you with further information concerning the situation mentioned in my letter of April 19.\n\nYou will recall that the Reverend Father G. E. Paquette, O.M.I., of the Big River Indian Reserve, made certain representations with regard to conditions on this reserve. The delay in answering has been caused by the fact that our field officials have been unable to reach the reserve because of the condition of the roads. However, we have now received a report from our Indian Superintendent and also from the teacher of the Church of England school on the Big River Reserve.\n\nThe essential fact in this situation seems to be that some members of the Big River Band have refused to accept family allowances. For this reason, our field officials have not pressed the regulations regarding school attendance. In this way it was hoped that the parents would be encouraged to register their children for payment.\n\nThe teacher at the Big River Church of England School is an Indian named Mr. Smith Atimoyoo who is a graduate in Theology from Emmanuel College. He has submitted a report upon his pupils' attendance during the year. Unfortunately, this\nreport was delayed because of lack of transportation and the flooded river.\n\nIt shows that Sam Lashance was absent during September because of toroid illness.\n\nOur local Indian Superintendent will be giving special attention to the attendance at this school in future.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA.G.L. Adams,\nPrivate Secretary.\nApril 19, 1949.\n\nMr. J.F.B. Ostrander,\n304 Post Office Building,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nRe: Big River Indian Day Schools\n\nWe have had within the last two days two letters from Members of Parliament concerning the situation on the schools on the Big River Reserve. The first was from Mr. Castleden who had received a complaint relative to the maintenance of the schools in that area and who raised several questions concerning the two schools.\n\nThe second was from J.F. Pouliot, M.P., who attached a letter from William Joseph, an Indian of this reserve. I have made a copy of this letter which I attach for your information. I have arranged to have a duplicate copy of this letter sent to you and also an extra copy of Mr. Joseph's letter, as you will presumably wish to get in touch with Mr. McLeod concerning the complaints made against Mr. Atimosee.\n\nAs I dictated this letter, I received a long list of names from Father Plourde which totals 54 children who will be of school age next September and also 11 children whom Father Paquette claims to be attending school at the Anglican Day School. If Mr. McLeod wishes copies of these letters, I will be pleased to forward these to him. In Mr. McLeod's letter of March 16, he advised that he would be seeing Father Paquette in the near future concerning the request for additional classroom accommodation at the Big River R.C. School.\n\nBernard F. Keary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education.\nBig-River Indian Reserve\nApril the 4th 1949\n\nMr. Fran\u00e7ois Pouliot\nMember for Temiscouata\nHouse of Commons.\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wrote twice to Mr. Casselden, member for Yorkton, after he promised the Indians in a big meeting at Prince-Albert to help the Indians to have my attention from Indian Department and he never answered me back and no improvement. Then, I am asking you to help me in order to have a better school teacher or to demand to the Indian Department that the Anglican school teacher would be on the job, not on the road. Because I heard from an official of the Indian Department, we, Indians of this reserve, we are fifty years behind of the other reserves. I did not know if this is true or not, but I know the things are going that is true for since fifty years. On this reserve, we have two schools, the one runs on the auspices of R.C. for ten years from now, and the other one by the Anglican Church. This one has a very poor school teacher because since last January, he was on the job for fourteen days. The 21st of January, this school teacher was on the road to Victoire Store and to Pascal Store to get the family allowance cheques in time for the assistant, Indian Agent. He was seen at 2 o'clock at Pascal by Mr. Walter Charpentier and John Breaver, councillor of this reserve. The school teacher was on the road with Thomas Whitefish, the other councillor of the reserve. Besides, John Lewis of whom his children are attending Anglican School reported me in my own houses, the children of this school did not attend school for ten days, last February. Furthermore when the saw outfit came on the reserve to saw wood, the sawman reported when he saw the wood for the Anglican school, the children were playing outside of the school the whole day and the school teacher in the house the whole day. This was the 17th of February. Today, the fourth...\nof April, he was seen at Pascal at noon by Mrs. R. Paul, Baptiste Gaudry, my \nfe., William Joseph and the Sterekeeper, Mr. Walter Charpentier and by Father \nPascal. That means, no school for the children today. He was using the horses \nof the Ass. Indian Agent. This is not too bad for three months and I am not \nsurprised that we are fifty years behind the other reserves. After that, they \nput the blame on the Indians. I will appreciate very much if you report this \nto the Indian Department at Ottawa to make them know what happens on this re-\nserve concerning education.\n\nThank you very much and I am yours truly!\n\nWilliam Joseph\nOttawa, April 8, 1949\n\nMr. B. F. Neary, Superintendent,\nEducation Service, Indian Affairs Branch,\n220 Queen Street,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nPlease find herewith attached letter from Mr. William Joseph, an Indian of Big River Indian Reserve, which is self-explanatory.\n\nKindly let me know what can be done in that case.\n\nWith thanks, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois Pouliot.\nOttawa, April 16, 1949.\n\nJ.F. Pouliot, Esq., M.P.,\nRiviere du Loup, P.Q.\n\nDear Mr. Pouliot:\n\nI have for answer your letter of April 8 addressed to the Superintendent of Education. On the Big River Reserve we have two Indian Day Schools, one for the Catholic children and the other for the Anglican children.\n\nIt is evident that the Indian from whom you have received the letter attached to yours of April 8 is complaining against the teacher at the Anglican school.\n\nThis teacher is Mr. Smith Atimoyoo who is himself an Indian. He attended high school in Prince Albert and after four years of study graduated from Emmanuel College in Saskatoon with an Associate in Theology. He taught for five years at the Shoal Lake Indian Day School and transferred in September, 1947, to the Big River C.E. Day School.\n\nWe have written to our local Indian Superintendent under whom this teacher works and have requested a full report concerning the complaints listed in Mr. William Joseph's letter.\n\nYou can anticipate hearing from me again when I have heard from the Indian Superintendent concerned.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nDirector\n\nDictated by S.F. Henry.\nOttawa, April 7, 1949\n\nMr. B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent,\nEducation Services,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nI have received a complaint from the Big River Indian Reserve in Saskatchewan relative to the maintenance of the schools in that area.\n\nWould you kindly send me a report which will give me a picture of (1) the reserves in this agency, (2) population on each reserve, and (3) school facilities provided for the children on this reservation.\n\nI would also like to know whether or not there are any reserves in Saskatchewan where there is no provision for the education of the children. I have received several complaints about the education in different parts of Saskatchewan, some of them quite petty, but they indicate that there is apparently a lack of supervision. I would like to know what inspection services are maintained and how often these schools are visited by inspectors of your branch.\n\nThanking you, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG. H. Castleden,\nMember for Yorkton.\nOttawa, April 16, 1949.\n\nC.H. Castleden, Esq., M.P.,\nYorkton, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Mr. Castleden:\n\nI have for answer your letter of April 7 addressed to the Superintendent of Education. The information which you requested is as follows. On the Big River Reserve there are two day schools in operation. One of these is for the Roman Catholic children (the 1944 census shows 199 Catholics) and one for the Anglican children (the census shows 65 Indians for this denomination).\n\nBoth schools are located on the reserve about a mile and a half apart. They are identical in size and structure, but the classroom operated for the Roman Catholic children is crowded, and we are now investigating the possibilities of enlarging it. The teacher at the Anglican school is an Indian named Smith Atimoyoo who attended high school in Prince Albert and then attended Emmanuel College for a period of four years. There he received his Associate in Theology. He taught at the Shoal Lake Indian Day School from 1942 to 1947. He began teaching at the Big River C.E. Indian Day School in September, 1947.\n\nThe teacher at the Big River R.C. Indian Day School is Sister Marie Ladislas. She holds a First Class Teaching Certificate for the Province of Saskatchewan and has had three years of experience in private and provincial schools. She was appointed to this position on the 1st September, 1948, and replaced Sister Bernadette Marie who also had a First Class Teaching Certificate with some ten years of experience in provincial schools.\n\nOur Educational Survey Officer spent a considerable part of last Spring in Saskatchewan, and as a result of his inspections, we are planning the building of a number\nof day schools in that province. As you are aware, we have completed the schools at Meadow Lake, Nut Lake and Poorman. The new two-room school at Thunderchild is just now beginning construction.\n\nWe will shortly be advertising for tenders for other schools.\n\nThese schools are inspected by both the Provincial School Inspectors and by our own Indian Superintendents. The school inspectors naturally concentrate on classroom technique and teaching methods, whereas our superintendents check on the condition of the building, cleanliness of the children and school administration generally.\n\nThe Provincial School Inspectors visit these schools at least once a year, and our own superintendents visit them as often as possible, usually once a month.\n\nI hope the above information provides you with the facts you are seeking.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nDirector.\n\nDictated by B.F.

The Gordon's Residential School has been closed for major repairs and the provision of an adequate water supply. It will re-open in September, 1949. Even with one school being closed, the enrolment at our residential schools in Saskatchewan has increased by 46 this year over the number enrolled last year.\n\nThe Day School statistics are as follows:\n\n| Year   | Number of Schools | Enrolment | Average |\n|--------|-------------------|-----------|---------|\n| 1947-48| 31                | 900       | 761     |\n| 1948-49| 33                | 1009      | 829     |\n| Increase| 2                 | 109       | 68      |\n\nI feel that our school building program this year and next year will go a long way towards alleviating the present school shortage in Saskatchewan.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\nAugust 8th, 1949.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of\nIndian Agencies,\n304 Post Office Building,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nRe: Big River C.E. Indian Day School\n\nUpon receipt of your previous letter of July 13th, I sent a memorandum to the Minister's office concerning the anticipated letter to Mr. Pouliot, M.P., from William Joseph.\n\nThis letter has now been received by Mr. Pouliot, and forwarded to our Minister's office. It has been forwarded by the Minister's Private Secretary to the Director with a request that it be dealt with Departmentally.\n\nI attach a copy of the letter which has been received from Mr. Joseph in duplicate, so that a copy may be sent to Mr. McLeod.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n\nAttachs.\nTo enable this file to be made available to researchers it has been necessary for IAND officials to exclude some material in accordance with Cabinet Directive No. 46 of 7 June 1973.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nCLOSED FILE\n\nFILE NUMBER 602-1 VOLUME 2\n\nSUBJECT BIG RIVER\nDAY SCHOOL\nGENERAL\n\nCORRESPONDENCE FROM MAY 1937\nTO Sept 1948\n\nNO FURTHER CORRESPONDENCE\nTO BE PLACED ON THIS FILE\n\nNOTE: For subsequent correspondence relevant to the subject matter of this closed file see\nFILE 602-1 VOLUME 2\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 1C, Volume 6280, File 602-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(RG 10, Volume 6281)\n\nFile 602-3, part 1\nCarlton Agency - Big River School -\nTeachers' Salaries. 1913 - 1937;\n1942 - 1947\n\nFile 602-5, part 2\nCarlton Agency - Big River School -\nEstablishment - Building Maintenance\n- Supplies - Accounts. 1933 - 1940\n\nFile 603-1, part 1\nQu'Appelle Agency - Muscowpetung School\n- General Administration. 1887 - 1896,\n1950, 1912, 1917, 1937 - 1941\n\nFile 603-9, part 1\nQu'Appelle Agency - Muscowpetung School\n- School Land. 1887 - 1888\n\nFile 604-1, part 1\nPelly Agency - Cote School - Teachers -\nGeneral Administration. 1913 - 1935\n\nFile 604-1, part 2\nPelly Agency - Cote School - Teachers -\nGeneral Administration. 1935 - 1947\n\nFile 604-3, part 1\nPelly Agency - Cote School - Teachers'\nSalaries. 1916 - 1930, 1943 - 1946\n\nFile 604-5, part 1\nPelly Agency - Cote School - Establish-\nment. 1914 - 1915\n\nFile 604-5, part 4\nPelly Agency - Cote School - Building\nMaintenance - Supplies - Accounts.\n1931 - 1935\n\nFile 604-5, part 5\nPelly Agency - Cote School - Building\nMaintenance - Supplies - Accounts.\n1936 - 1938\nProvince of Sask\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nTEACHERS' SALARIES\n\nFOR QUARTER ENDED June 30 1913\n\n| NAME OF TEACHER | NAME OF SCHOOL | Annual Grant or Salary | Amount Dec. | Address to which Cheque is to be sent |\n|-----------------|----------------|------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Louis Ahnakee   | Big River      | $8                     | $7          |                                     |\n\nNo. of School days in quarter: ...........................................\nNo. days School was open: ..................................................\nNo. holidays: ............................................................................\nGrant asked for: ..........................................................................\n\nRemarks:\n\nCERTIFIED CORRECT\n\n16.7.13\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct.\n\nSup't. or Agent.\n\nNOTE.\u2014The number of school days in the quarter and the number of days for which payment is asked should be stated; payment will only be made for days school was open and authorized holidays.\n\nForm 14.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I write this to let you know that it would be a great help to me if I were to get any pay just at the end of each quarter. The men that supply us things we need such as provisions and gas etc., want their pay, and if I can't pay them on time or sooner they won't give us anything which makes it hard for me and for them. If it is the policy of the Department to keep me waiting for a month and a half after the end of each quarter you please let me know, and they see fit to them.\n\nI have a pretty good school, and I am glad to say that the children have done very well so far. It is only during the hunting season that the attendance is down as the Indians go out to trap and take their children with them as they have no place to leave them.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJohn R.

Prince Albert on Sept. 1st, and I wanted to see him.\n\nThe dates of his itinerary were changed so that I did not know when I started on my holiday exactly when he was to be there, or I would have written to ask formal permission. As it was I phoned the Agency and was given permission to stay to see him.\n\nI have already made up one day, Labour Day, and should prefer to make up the other three, if necessary, on odd days rather than at Christmas. I shall be glad to know if this meets with your approval.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nKinoomootayas Day School\n\nMiss Merrit phoned me from Prince Albert and I gave her permission. This letter is a type of her attitude since she went to Big River. I wish you would drop her line informing her to deal direct with me instead of endeavouring to go over my head as she is doing.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, November 4th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to letter of the first ultimo from Miss Cora Merrett, teacher of the Big River Indian Day School, forwarded to the Department with the September quarter return, you may advise her that her letter has been received and that whatever arrangements you make with her regarding her teaching certain days to make up for time lost at the beginning of the term will be satisfactory to the Department.\n\nMiss Merrett is not being written.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

A. Hezy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nR. S. Davis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 15, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Big River C.E. Indian Day School No. 608\n\nIn my memorandum of December 15, 1941, I advised you of the resignation of the former teacher, Mr. J. Kevin Ross, effective January 1, 1942.\n\nTo succeed him the Department has appointed Mr. Brooks L. Owen at a salary of $50.00 a teaching month plus bonus. Mr. Owen began duties on January 25, 1942. I enclose copy of letter of appointment, also National Defense Tax form and war savings pledge.\n\nAs Mr. Owen is a single man without dependents I presume it is unnecessary to forward a declaration of head of household form.\n\nStaff questionnaire is being prepared and will reach you shortly.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 16, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Big River C.E.

Indian Day School, No. 602.\n\nIn my memorandum of the 16th ultimo I advised you that Mr. Percy Farebrother had resigned, effective October 1, 1945. Please do not take any action toward returning any amount he may have to his credit, as it is likely that he will resume duties at this school in the near future. As soon as I have definite information on this point I will advise you further.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nOctober 28, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Big River C.E. Indian Day School, No. 602.\n\nI desire to refer you to my memoranda of September 18 and October 9, in connection with Mr. Percy Parbrother. This gentleman endeavoured to enlist, but was refused for medical reasons and has, therefore, decided to resume duties. He re-opened the above-mentioned school on October 9 and should be paid at the same rate as formerly from that date.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, December 16, 1944.\n\nMr. E. S. Jones, Indian Agent, Leask, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to the teacher of the Big River C. E. Indian Day School. You may notify Mr. Farabrother that his resignation is accepted, effective at the end of the current month.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, March 10, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY.\n\nRe: Big River C.E.

I do not consider it necessary to forward you a staff questionnaire, due to the fact that Mrs. McLeod was employed to December 31, 1944, as teacher of the James Smith Indian Day School, No. 608.\n\nPlease note that Mrs. McLeod is an Indian employed on a reserve and consequently is not subject to income tax.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\nOttawa, May 20th, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nCHIEF TREASURY OFFICER\n\nRe: Big River C.E.

A. Hoey Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Dept. Branch, Mines & Resources,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith receipts for material purchased for school dinners for the Big River Indian Reserve Day School.\n\nWhen the grant was reissued last year it was given for this school on a basis of a possible 14 to 15 pupils. I received $30.00 for the winter months with biscuits in addition. This year I was given to understand that the amount would be increased & the biscuits discontinued, so began making school dinners as soon as I returned in Sept., trusting that with careful administration the grant could be made to cover the whole. I continued dinners last year till the end of June, and bought a sack of rice then to finish off the season and to help at the beginning of this. With this and the produce from my own garden I was able to carry on through Sept and part of Oct.\n\nMr. Davis told me that the Dept. had cut the grant to $5 for this school, though the next school with no more pupils was to get $10, but that he had written to have the matter adjusted as they were still thinking the biscuits were also supplied. The only way to plan at all economically was to buy in sufficient quantities to last the season, which I did. By buying a hind quarter of beef I was able to get it at 6\u00a2 per lb. though this meant cutting up the meat myself.\n\nPotatoes and some meat I purchased from the natives, and used in addition all the potatoes I had grown here, unfortunately not a good crop.\n\nA letter was received later from the agency warning me not to exceed the $5, as no answer was forthcoming to his letter, but by that time the material was purchased. I wrote to the Dept. through Mr. Davis, and eventually received notice that the grant had been increased to $8. per month for 6 months making $40. in all. There were 23 children on the roll till Christmas, with an average of 20. Since Christmas there have been 20 with an average of 18, except for two weeks when some of them were down with the 'flu'.\n\nKnowing the conditions of their homes, and that fish and rabbits were very scarce, during the very cold spell I\nwas giving the children cocoa on their arrival and a piece of bread when they left. Neither the cocoa, sugar nor bread is included in the receipts and so far has been paid for out of my own pocket.\n\nThe dinners are supposed to be discontinued this month which would mean that the children are not even getting one meal a day. I realise the necessity of economy, but surely to neglect the health of the younger generation is the poorest economy. No grant is made on this reserve for a matron, and I have had to pay someone to cook the dinners; neither is there any grant for the issuing of medicines.\n\nThe School Inspector's report must be a sufficient comment on the improvement in the pupils on this reserve who have hitherto had a reputation for being too stupid to learn. I am perfectly sure that the marked change is due to the fact that they have been better fed. Practically all the pupils live over two miles from school, some over three, and yet they I think their attendance record will compare favorably with most other reserves.\n\nSurely it is in the interests of economy to build up the health of the younger generation, and it hardly seems right to expect the teacher to bear part of the burden of this. I do not suppose there is any other branch of the civil service where the members contribute anything out of their own salary, at least not those of a salary of $1000. or under.\n\nI am writing to you direct, as minister of Welfare hoping that something definite can be done about the matter. I asked for a grant of $75 for the year, which would have ensured a good daily meal throughout the school year. I shall be glad if you will return the receipts as soon as possible as I believe the accounts have to be in before the end of the month. I delayed writing, hoping to see the agent first but was unable to do so.\n\nYours truly,\n\nP.S. Lard & Baking Powder have also been paid for by me.\nOttawa, April 1, 1937.\n\nDear Madam,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 12th ultimo, enclosing receipts for articles purchased for midday meal purposes at the Big River Indian Day School.\n\nAs it is necessary to have a voucher from the Indian Agent, I am returning the receipts to Mr. Davis and requesting him to prepare and forward the necessary voucher, when payment will be made.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

It is in a very decayed condition and is really a menace to the users thereof, as it may fall down at any time.\n\nThis work should be undertaken as soon as possible.

That she be supplied with a 5 gal. kettle, 1 dish pan, 3 hand bowls, 6 enamel plates and a table for serving dinners, washing dishes, etc. at a cost of $12.00, that the teachorage be painted on the outside and the fence be repaired. She states she can have the fence repaired at a cost of $20.00 in rations, that the Indians will do the work if supplied with rations.\n\nMiss Merritt also asks that she be allowed $100 for the midday meal for the ten months, if no biscuits are supplied, or $75.00 if the biscuits are supplied.\n\nThere is no question that all she asks is badly needed but it is too late to consider painting the building this fall although the paint might be bought this fall, if funds are available. I am doubtful whether the fence could be repaired at this date, but if so it could be done as a relief measure.

This is from November 1st until March 31st.\nPlease forward the bills through this office,\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.S. Davis\nIndian Agent\nBig River Indian Reserve,\nShell River P.O?\nSask.\n\nNov 18th.1937\n\nTo Mr. Hoey,\nSupt. of Indian Welfare,\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nThank you for your letter of Oct.19th, which I have delayed answering, waiting to hear from Dr. Robinson with regard to the school dinner allowance, as I had a letter from him saying if it were insufficient he would try to get it increased.\n\nNo doubt you will remember that last year I was allowed $40. and had a difficulty in getting $4.00 spent in excess of this amount. When I mention that the next reserve, with an attendance very little, if any, higher than ours was getting $55 you will perhaps see one of the causes for disagreement, at least between the agent and teacher on this reserve. This is just one of the many little things.\n\nI received the enclosed Nov. 8th. You will notice that it provides for dinners from Nov. to March only. $10 per month is a sufficient allowance, but why for five months only? The children are just as hungry in Sept and April as in December in fact often more so as often there is no fish to be got then and what few rabbits there were have been trapped in the winter.\n\nAs I mentioned when in Ottawa, I would like to give them a drink of hot cocoa before school during the winter. They come two or three miles to school, and are very regular, and I feel that after that walk often in a bitter wind, they need something before beginning work. Then instead of a sweet at noon, I believe a piece of bread and lard or peanut butter at four o'clock is better. $75.00 and biscuits or $100 without biscuits would cover the cost, as I have been able to purchase beans peas etc. at wholesale prices, and by getting a quarter of beef at a time, and cutting it up myself I am able to get it at 7\u00a2 per lb.\n\nThe men with children attending school gave me each a sack of potatoes when the agent refused to allow me any out of the community garden. (the gophers got into mine, and in fact the whole garden, whilst I was away) This only meant ten sacks but it showed also that the people do appreciate to some extent what is being done for them.\n\nWe have started a manual instruction class this year, but are badly handicapped in that we have no room for a bench, the pupils, three boys, are only 10 and 12 yrs. old and we have no lumber. They have done various repair jobs around the school, including making a new set of steps for the\nentrance, out of old lumber. Now they are trying to convert an old packing case into a respectable looking cupboard. At present they are using my tools, and really until we have a new school building it does not seem advisable to launch into anything else.\n\nI do wish it were possible for you to see this same school building. For three years it has been condemned as unsafe. Two years ago it was discovered that the wood in the structure was so rotten that it crumbled when touched, thus doing away with the possibilities of successful repair. The plaster is held in place with unbleached cotton, which is all there is inside the laths to keep out the cold. This wobbles whenever there is a strong wind, and I am in fear of it falling on the children. The wind blows up through the boards like a knife, so that the desks on the wind side have to be dragged away from the walls, thus those children are roasted on the one side and frozen on the other whilst the poor teacher is frozen the whole time as the only possible place for the desk is straight opposite the door, which nothing could make fit, and backing to a wall through which the wind blows on even the calmest day. The toilets, only one of which I have been able to get screened in the three years I have been here, are so old that in spite of constant scrubblings with strong lysol, and the application of lots of lime, they smell most horribly. I know the provincial inspector reports from time to time on the state of the school building but nothing ever seems to come of it, which is still another reason for the appointment of a supervisor for the Indian Dept., though I do realise that the tendency is to cut officials rather than increase them these days.\n\nI wonder, by the way if there is any chance of the Indian Commissioner making any change in the near future. Do you think it would be any use getting in touch with him? So far as the Province is concerned I lost whatever chances I had when I left them for the Indian Dept. I also lost years of service towards pension, as one year with the Indian Dept. cancels all previous years of service under the Provincial Pension Scheme. I hope some time there will be a scheme under the Indian Dept. which will include teachers.\n\nThank you for the consideration which I feel you gave my previous letter. At present it seems seems advisable to remain where I am, though perhaps in the Spring something better will turn up. The chief drawback here is the isolation. No Officials seem to be able to get any further than Sandy Lake and I find it very difficult to get a companion as there is no white company on the reserve at all. Consequently I live alone. I think however that in the Spring something may be arranged so that I am transferred to a reserve with a farm instructor, and possibly a missionary.\n\nAgain with thanks,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Order by the number shown on back of each sample.\n\nWhen decorating, always add borders to walls\u2014be sure to overlap them slightly around the top of walls\u2014nothing improves the appearance of a room so much as a pretty and effective border. Also order ceiling paper to finish room.\n\nBe Sure You Order Enough\n\nAlways order a little more paper than you think you need, rather than run short and have the job delayed. Extra wallpaper is almost always needed later for patching, and later shipments of wallpaper sometimes differ slightly in shade in spite of the utmost precaution\u2014another reason why you should be sure and order full requirements to begin with.\n\nAll Wallpaper and Ceiling Paper are Sold by the Single Roll\n\nIt is put up and sent to you in double rolls for your convenience and economy in cutting. A single roll covers 50 square feet. There are two single rolls in a double roll. Therefore if you order and pay for 10 single rolls, you will receive 5 double rolls.\n\nBorder Prices are Quoted for Single Yards\n\nBorders are printed twice on one width of paper\u2014border on the width of paper. Thus if you order 2 yards of border, and it is printed twice on the one width of paper, you will receive 4 yards of border which you would cut down the center, making 2 yards of border. Three printings on one width of paper make 3 yards of border; four printings make 4 yards of border. It is advisable to order 2 extra yards of border to allow for wastage on corners and matching.\n\nHow to Measure Your Room Correctly\n\nThe number of feet around the room multiplied by its height gives you the number of square feet in the walls. Deduct 20 square feet for each opening, then divide the balance by 30, for the number of single rolls required for walls. For ceiling multiply the length of room by the width, and divide total by 30 for number of single rolls required.\n\n\"Sun-Tested\"\n\nAll the samples marked Sun-Tested are of papers which are printed in fast colors. These papers are dependable and will give you long, durable service.\n\n\"Sunworthy\"\n\nAs the name implies, such a paper assures you that it is practically non-fading\u2014good for years of service.\n\nHELPFUL HINTS TO DO A GOOD JOB\n\nPaper Ceiling First\n\nAlways paper ceiling first. Cut each strip 4 inches longer than room length so that 2 inches overlap at each end. This makes the job easier when hanging. Draw a guide line for your first strip by driving a nail 10 inches from sidewall each end of ceiling. Stretch a cord smeared with charcoal or chalk tightly between nails. Pull tight and stretch around against ceiling, leaving an even chalk line.\n\nMatching Strips\n\nSometimes there is a slight shading in Wallpapers. Examine each roll carefully. Have all the lighter paper on dark side and the darker paper on light side of rooms, doors and windows. This avoids unsightly shadows. Unevenness caused by tapering can be avoided by pasting before trimming. Kalomining and tinting must be washed off with warm water and sponge before papering, and walls should be again cleaned after papering. All surfaces should be well sanded before decorating with wallpaper.\n\nWooden Walls and Ceilings\n\nCover with Decorator's Cotton, tacking it about 2 inches from edge and corners before papering. A coat of glue size will shrink it tight to the wood.\n\nEmbossed Paper\n\nEmbossed or other heavy papers should not be rolled at the corners when hanging. They must be trimmed at both edges and butted instead of overlapped to secure the necessary smoothness.\n\nTreating New Walls\n\nNew walls, which have never been papered, should be treated with a thin coat of size. Make by soaking 1 lb. of ground glue in hot water. (Use wallpaper paste if directions on package.) Use Acorn Sizing Glue. Before sizing walls, fill cracks or holes with Paste Patching Plaster mixed to a paste with water. Apply evenly with a brush. Wash walls with warm water. If walls are rough, smooth off projections before sizing; if very rough, apply a thin coat of paste.\n\nFor Painted Walls\n\nRemove all grease and oil from these by applying a solution of one part ammonia and six parts water.\n\nDelivery Charges Extra on Wallpaper and Wallpaper Supplies\n\nPlease allow sufficient money to cover shipping charges. To estimate weight of your order, figure that Wallpaper weighs approximately 1 lb. per single roll.\n\nIndian Affairs.

A water tank was at the school, but in the summer holidays, when the school was closed, the wind blew it away and completely broke it.\n\nIn regard to the toilets requested, I was given authority to have these built last fall but it was impossible to build them for the amount allowed, that of $20.00 in all. I would recommend that they be built during the holidays.\n\nThe interior of the house has not been done for a period of three years and should be redecorated. A little painting was done only.\n\nThis teacher's residence is badly in need of paint on the outside and if there is money available it should be done this year. It will cost $60.00 for paint and $35.00 for labour in order to have this building painted. This residence has not been painted since it was first built. If there is not enough money to paint the building this year then I will include it in the estimates for the coming year; it was not included this year as I felt that there would be sufficient expenditure at this point if a new school was erected as included in our estimates.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Can.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, June 11, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to repairs required for the school and teacher's residence on the Big River reserve.\n\nIn letter of concurrent date, I am advising you regarding the amount available in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at the day schools in the Carlton agency. If you recommend the painting at Mistawasis, it would mean that there would only be $110 left in the appropriation. If, however, you recommend the painting at Little Red River, there would be $135 left.\n\nIn either event, the amount remaining could be spent at Big River. I am, therefore, returning the list forwarded to you by the teacher, in order that you can decide what items on it you consider are most necessary this year, keeping in mind that the total expenditure must be kept within the appropriation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nR.

The amounts are as follows:\n\n| Description                        | Amount |\n|------------------------------------|--------|\n| Big River Day School Residence    | $129.81|\n| Big River School, toilets          | 44.68  |\n| Little Red River School & residence| 177.30 |\n| **Total**                          | **$351.89** |\n\nIt was my intention, at first, to paint the residence at the Mistawasis school but after checking over the building it was found that the siding would have to be taken off and re-nailed. This condition was due to the fact that nothing has been done on the outside of this building for 16 or 17 years owing to the small amount of money that has been allotted for repairing the day schools and residences of this agency each year.\n\nThe Teacher's residence at Big River reserve, the Teacher's residence at the Little Red River Reserve and the school at the same reserve are all fairly good buildings and are the only ones in this agency that could be suitably repaired on the small amount of money granted this year. Sandy Lake School and Residence, of course, will be re-modelled this year as I understand that the Dept. are calling for tenders for this work. The Sturgeon Lake school will do for another year.\n\nMost of the schools (Day) are old log buildings and it is just a waste of money to spend much money on them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.S. Davis,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn connection with that portion of your letter of the 21st instant which recommends the erection of two new toilets at the Big River School you may purchase, from firms on the approved list, the material required at a cost of $34.68.

(RG 10, Volume 6281, file 602-5, part 2)\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Big River Indian Day School, Big River Reserve,\nCarlton agency.\n\nThe above mentioned is a very old School with no accommodation for cooking or serving a meal or other work. Miss Marrett, the teacher has had an old log building moved near the school which she proposes to fix up and use for preparing the midday meal, washing the children's clothing etc.\n\nShe is asking for lumber, wire, nails, etc for fixing up this building. A clothes wringer, washing board etc. to be used for washing clothes. A Jubilee Range to be used for cooking the meal and heating the water for washing. The Indians on this Reserve are very backward. It is Miss Marrett's intention that the children have two sets of clothing in order that they may be properly washed and have a clean suit ready for changing, the washing of these clothes to be done at the school under her supervision.\n\nShe also proposes to teach the boys carpentry work and is asking tools for that purpose. She also proposes canning meat to be used in the summer when fresh meat is not available. If the funds are at all available I would recommend that her request be granted, as I feel the goods asked for will be put to good use.\n\nThe lumber, nails etc., could be purchased from the West Lumber and Supply co., at Debden, Sask. The other goods are from prices in Eaton's catalog. If this request is granted these goods should be supplied at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector Indian Agencies, Saskatchewan.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 1, 1938.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo with reference to the Big River Indian Day School. As no special provision was made in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements to the Big River school it is practically impossible to provide the amount requested on the purchase requisitions forwarded with your letter.\n\nIn addition the school situation on this Reserve is in a nebulous state. In this connection I would refer you to official letter of August 12. The Department does not feel disposed to incur any heavy expenditure at Big River until a final decision is made regarding the school situation on this Reserve.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. Thos.

Robertson, Inspector of Indian Agencies, has forwarded to the Department the information which you supplied to him regarding the children of school age on the Big River Indian Reserve.\n\nFrom the information contained in this letter I am inclined to feel that in making proper provision for the education of the children two day schools should be established, one under Roman Catholic auspices and the other under Anglican auspices. The figures that you have submitted indicate that there are sufficient children for two schools.\n\nCould the present school be renovated in order to provide for the education of the Anglican children? If so, please let me have an estimate of the amount that you believe would be required to place both the school and teacher's living quarters in good condition.\n\nIf, however, you consider that it will be necessary to provide a new building for each of the schools please let me know if a log building would be sufficient in each case or if you would recommend a more pretentious building.\n\nIn either case it is understood that teacher's living quarters would be provided in connection with each school.\n\nR. S. Davis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nIf you consider log buildings suitable it is possible that you could arrange to have the logs cut this winter.\n\nPlease let me hear fully from you regarding the above suggestions before the end of January as it is possible that we may have some funds on hand from the current year's appropriation which would permit us to purchase at least some of the supplies that would be necessary.\n\nIn order to permit us to do so it would be advisable, when you are replying to this letter, to give detailed information regarding the lumber etc. that would be necessary.\n\nIt is understood, of course, that you will also give an estimate of the cost of the labour required either in renovating one building and building one new building or in constructing two new buildings.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

(RG 10, Volume 6281, file 602-5, part 2)\nLeask, Sask.,\nJan 24th 1939\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of January 6th, file 107-3-5, in regard to the building schools at the Big River Reserve; I quite agree that two schools should be established on this Reserve. While there is a lot of children on this Reserve their homes are pretty well scattered and they are hunting Indians and consequently wander quite a bit during the year. Therefore, I do not believe that the attendance at either school will be large but owing to the religious difficulties it would be advisable to build two schools.\n\nIn building these schools I believe that schools 18' x 20' would be large enough with a full size basement. At any time, if we found it necessary to close one of the schools, it could be moved to the other site. The teacher's residence that we now have is in fairly good condition though it will need a little bit of decorating. The present school, however, is beyond repair. Therefore, if the proposed plan is carried out, it will be necessary to build two schools and one small residence.\n\nWith reference to putting up a log building I do not believe that this would be satisfactory at this point.\n\nI am very busy at the present time but in the course of a few days I will submit the information that you require in regard to the lumber and building materials and also the labour. I am of the opinion that these buildings could be erected cheaper by hiring a foreman and Indian labour than by contract.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S.

Dept of Mines, & Resources,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nCan you please advise me as to whether it would be wise for me to go away for any length of time during the forthcoming summer vacation.\n\nAs I have mentioned before the only time I leave the Reserve is during this period, and last year I could not make any plans as all manner of rumors were rife anent either a transfer or dismissal.\n\nThe Indians are all away during the summer, in fact this week there are only five children left to attend school, though the attendance during the year has been good, and this year I had planned to go to Vancouver, and San Francisco, but can find out nothing definite as to buildings etc., except that there are to be the two schools.\n\nI have asked Mr. Davis's advice, and he says 'Go' but as he is leaving in the near future I do not now feel that it is of any real value. I had planned to leave Prince Albert on the 15th of July, but do not know whether I should go ahead with the arrangements or not.\n\nThe proposed plans for the buildings which are to be erected are, I believe, to have the residence over the school, and the present residence, which I spent the whole Easter vacation redecorating, removed to another reserve. Mr. Davis tells me that these plans do not include a water system, except one which will necessitate carrying all supplies up from the basement. This would mean carrying every drop of water needed for the house up two flights of stairs. Do you know if such plans have passed as yet? and do please if it is at all possible prevent such arrangements being made. The difference in cost cannot be so very great in comparison with the difference in convenience.\n\nI am so sorry to seem a nuisance, but when eleven months have to be spent in a place with no possible outside interests, comfort and convenience in the house do count for so much.\n\nI am enclosing one of the Grade 5 books.\nto give you some idea of the standard of work carried on here.\n\nFive books are being sent for Exhibition at Prince Albert and Regina, together with samples of handwriting needlework, laundry, and handicraft. Most of the handicraft of the older boys has consisted of keeping the school buildings in running repairs, as I have had neither convenient place, nor tools for a real course of carpentry, together with the garden. As they have only been in school four years, and the oldest is only 13, I really am rather proud of their progress, particularly as every girl has an apron for domestic science, in addition to other personal garments including stockings and mitts made as part of the school routine.\n\nYou will possibly notice, from the English exercises in the enclosed book, that we were able, with no outside help, to make the trip to Saskatoon to see their majesties. It was really quite an interesting experience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6281, file 602-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, June 26, 1939.\n\nDear Miss Merrett:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 19th instant, in which you seek information with respect to your vacation of this year and the building of the schools on the reserve.\n\nThe question of whether you should leave the reserve or not at this time is a matter in respect to which we can give you little advice. We can assure you, however, that no change is contemplated at your school and that ample notice will be given you when a change is decided upon. It is unfortunate in my judgment that you are at all influenced by rumors that may be in circulation from time to time on the reserve. A school teacher can afford to ignore such rumors at all times and be governed wholly by the instructions that reach her from time to time through official sources.\n\nThe actual construction of Indian day schools comes under the Surveys and Engineering Branch of the Department. I have not seen, nor have I had an opportunity to study, the plans prepared for the construction of the two schools on the Big River reserve. I am of the opinion, however, that these plans will be somewhat similar to the standard plans prepared for the construction of such schools throughout the Dominion. Indian day schools built in recent years are up to date and convenient in every -\n\nMiss Cora Merrett,\nTeacher,\nBig River Indian Day School,\nShell River P. O.,\nSaskatchewan.\nevery sense. The Missionary from Berens River, where a school was built last year, writes:\n\n\"The Indian day school erected last year is perfect. It is all that an Indian day school should be\".\n\nIf you have any representations to make to the Agent with respect to conveniences that might be installed, I feel sure the Agent will give them sympathetic consideration. In the case of the Big River schools, it is altogether likely that the actual construction work may be undertaken by the Surveys and Engineering Branch, under the direction of the local Indian Agent.\n\nI am returning herewith the books sent forward with your communication. The work of the pupils appears to be very neat and in my judgment very creditable. It is my hope that sufficient space will be provided in the basement of the new school for the organization of worthwhile handicraft projects.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of June 2nd, file 107-3-5, enclosing a plan for the proposed schools and residences at Big River Reserve, would it be possible to have the Engineering Branch estimate the material required for these buildings? I am leaving on the 21st to pay Annuity in the north and will be away for about two weeks; and on my return will be very busy as the work on the Reserves and in the office will be far behind. It will be over a month before I could submit an estimate on these buildings.\n\nWith reference to the plan, I feel that each school large enough for 20 pupils should be sufficient. One bedroom for the teacher is not going to be very satisfactory as the teachers require a room for use as a kitchen as well as a bedroom. Further in the winter time it is necessary for extra accommodation for Department officials.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S.

Mr. Jack Sanderson recommended Mr. J. Pare of Debden as foreman carpenter for these schools and he estimated the amount of materials and labour required for the construction of the same.\n\nMr. Pare estimated the labour cost at $1500.00 for each school, this will include the gravel, freighting of the lumber and the excavation of the basement. I feel that this estimate is a little high and think that each building should be built for $1200.00.\n\nIn your telegram you asked me to wire for the advance required but I have just received the estimate today and, being Saturday, the Air Mail will reach you as soon as a telegram. I would appreciate receiving an accountable cheque for $2000.00 and if I require a further advance I will let you know.\n\nI am making arrangements to start the excavation of the basements next week.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

The other items on the requisition are being ordered by the Purchasing Branch and they are being requested to rush delivery.\n\nFunds for the Big River C.E. school were provided in the main appropriation, while funds for the R.C. school were voted in the special supplementaries. Consequently, two separate cheques for $1000.00 each are being forwarded to you and you should forward separate accountable vouchers for these advances.\n\nA supply of labour return forms will also be sent to you.\n\nThe Department will depend on you to see that the buildings erected are sufficiently large to accommodate the number of pupils that will probably attend them. In a report dated December 24, 1938, Dr. Robertson,\n\nR. S. Davis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nInspector of Indian Agencies, stated that the number of Catholic children on the Big River Reserve between the ages of 7 and 16 was 35, and the number of Anglican children on the Reserve between the same ages was 28. I mention this because in your letter of June 19 you stated that you considered that a school large enough for 20 pupils would be sufficient in each case.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BAILEY\n\nThe Department is erecting on the Big River Reserve two new day schools.\n\nI attach requisition for the materials required for the Big River C.E. day school and I also attach a requisition for the materials required for the R.C. day school. This latter requisition states that the same materials are required for the R.C. day school as are requested for the C.E. day school.\n\nIt is important that the materials for both schools be ordered at the earliest possible date and I should appreciate it if you would give the matter immediate attention.\n\nYou will note that there is one requisition for the heavier material including the lumber and another requisition for the paint and hardware.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nJuly 18, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

On both accounts there is a charge of $5.00 for freight.

Under these circumstances you should forward separate vouchers for the expenditure at each school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nR. S.

In this regard I may say that the Department finds it possible to only allow the same amounts as last year; namely,\n\nSturgeon Lake Day School ......................... $50.00\nMistawasis ........................................... 60.00\nBig River ............................................. 50.00\nLittle Red River ..................................... 50.00\nMontreal Lake ....................................... 90.00\nAhtahkakoops ....................................... 60.00\n\nThe amount available in the appropriation for Indian Education toward the cost of midday lunch at day schools will not permit our authorizing at the schools in the Carlton Agency the amounts mentioned in your letter. As a matter of fact the food served at noon at Indian day schools should consist of a light lunch. If conditions are as serious in the Indians' homes as stated in your letter; namely, that the meal obtained at school is the only good meal that the child gets in a day, you should communicate again with us in order to determine whether or not the relief allowance should be increased.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

We write to you to ask if you can see your way clear to make application to the Government for a grant to help carry on this school.\n\nWe are encouraged in making this application by seeing the interest the Indian Department is taking in the civilization of the Indians, and we hope through our combined efforts to accomplish a good work among the children of these reserves.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\netc., etc., etc.\n\nSgd H.

It will be observed from Mr. Reid's letter that the Indian Commissioner for the North-West Territories proposes to contribute at the rate of the usual grant to day schools, namely $30.00 per annum, to the institution in question, until the Department has considered the propriety of making a special grant towards it.\n\nMr. McKay's institution is similar in character to the institution conducted under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church at Round Lake, in the Crooked Lakes Agency. The latter institution receives an annual subsidy from the Department at the rate of $30.00 per capita up to 60 pupils.\nThe undersigned considers it would be desirable to grant a similar subsidy to the Presbyterian Boarding School near Moosejaw agency. He would however state that it is not likely that a number equal to more than one half\u2014(or say about forty)\u2014of the pupils who attend the institution at Round Lake could be accommodated, at least for some time, at the institution now under consideration. He would therefore recommend that an item be inserted in the supplementary estimates giving assistance to the boarding school referred to, to the amount of $1200.00 per annum.\n\nRespectfully submitted\n\n[Signature]\nF.

Hugh MacKay, Superintendent Missionary of the Presbyterian Church, and one from Mr. J. H. Smith, respecting a boarding school which has recently been established opened adjoining the missionary agency, in regard to which I state that until the Department considered the propriety of making a special\nGrant, the usual one to teachers of day schools will be made, as the boarding school will take the place of a day school to which Muscowpetung Reserve is entitled.\n\nI beg to inform Mr. [illegible] that there was no provision made for a day school for Muscowpetung Reserve. An estimate was made for the establishment of a day school to be established on Pasqua's Res., the cost being \u00a3450. But so much as it appears that no school has been established.\non Pasquale's Res., \nand as it was further \nappear from your \nletter that there is \nno likelihood of \none being established, \nand as the boarding \nschool adjoining \nMuscowpetung Res. \nwill take its place \nof the said day school, \nI see no objection \nto your carrying out \nyour expressed intention \nof paying the grant \nto the boarding school \nbefore mentioned. \nI do not think \nhowever in any case \nwe will give the \nfull amount of $500, \nbut to limit it, \nuntil the matter of \nthe assistance to be \ngiven to the said boarding \nschool is finally \ndetermined.\ndetermined, to\nthe annual grant\nof $300.00 given\nto mission day\nschools on\nReserves\nJane\nOFFICE OF THE\nIndian Commissioner,\n\nNORTH-WEST TERRITORIES\n\nRegina, 22nd June, 1888.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to refer to your letter of the 3rd February last, in which a temporary arrangement was authorized for the assistance in the upkeep of the Presbyterian Indian boarding school under the Rev.

On April 1st, the school received a grant at the rate of $75 per pupil, for the preceding quarter, while on 16th April, the number had increased to 16, on May 1st to 21, while now there are 28 children.\n\nThe Right Hon.\nThe Lieut.

Of the others, some are the children of parents who are not in treaty relations, but who are as destitute and as ignorant as the majority of Indians, and others are children who have been refused admission to the Regina School, or who are not capable of being admitted to that school on account of constitutional disease. It is our intention to give special attention to children of this latter class. The Principal of the school, the Rev George Arthur,\nB... has taken three sessions of a medical course, and he is assisted by a Matron who is a trained nurse. We hope, therefore, to do what such appliances are capable of doing for the rescue and restoration to health of children who otherwise would very likely be extremely short lived.\n\nAt the time of my visit to the school a few days ago there were only two children on the roll who were available for admission to the Regina or any other Industrial School, and it is hoped that the parents of these children may soon be so accustomed to separation from them that it will be possible to persuade them to allow the little ones to be taken to Regina.\n\nIn accordance with an interview which I had with you when you were last in Winnipeg, we are counting upon the favorable presentation of the case which you promised to make to secure an increase of the grant to the Birtle School, so that we will receive support for 40 children, which number the building can easily accommodate, instead of for 25 as at present.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nDear Sir,\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa, ONT.\nOTTAWA 12th March 1896\n\nRev: Sir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant advising the Department of the re-opening of the Lakesend Boarding School and in reply I beg to say that the Department will, as requested have its Agents and Inspectors instructed to include this school in their periodical visits, and furnish reports thereon.

As I have no doubt every one interested in the Indians also feels my suggestion would be that when boys are educated at an Industrial school and are trained in any particular line, such as farmers, carpenters and blacksmiths, the Department should see that when it comes to the time that those boys leave the institution they should be apprenticed in some way in the trade which they have learned, and should not be allowed to drift back to the reserve where they generally do nothing but look wise and live in idleness.\n\nYours &c.\n\nGlen Campbell\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nWinnipeg, Manitoba\nMarch 30, 1912.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nA delegation of Indians from Muscowpetkung, Piapot and Pasqua Reserves came here yesterday to interview me with regard to their grievances.

At the present time, the children of the Indians upon the Reserve have to attend the Lebret Industrial School. They complain that it is altogether too far to send their children and that it would be much more convenient to the parents of the Indian children if a small school was located upon the Reserve. I am enclosing herewith a list of the Indians who are anxious that a school be started.\n\nIf it is possible for you to meet the request of these Indians, I should be glad if you would do so as quickly as possible and let me know when you expect to be able to do anything. I believe the Indians on this Reserve have subscribed something like $1000.00 to Patriotic and War Funds and they feel that some consideration is due them for this.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW. B.

Education being compulsory, the law leaves us no alternative, it forces us to place our children in a religious school from the age of seven to sixteen. From childhood they are taught that religious laws are of first importance, religious duties enter their daily life, classroom work and academic learning is sadly neglected, concentration of thought, strengthening of will power and mental power are not taught them, therefore gradually coming under complete subjugation of religious authorities, as a result they lose the quality of character, integrity and manhood.\n\nTherefore we suggest that you provide us with a day school, so as to enable the Indians to assume responsibility for raising their children. By this method the Indian children would be raised in the environment in which they will eventually have to make their living.\nUnder the present system after a child have been in a boarding school for ten years they are completely unfit to take their place in the life of the reserve, also they are not sufficiently educated to compete with the white man off the reserve in any trade or profession.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nChief Ben Paquah, X\nCouncilor Sam Peep, X\nStrong Eagle, X\n\nWithout signature,\nAndrew Gordon\nMr. F.

A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nF. Booth, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuscow, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to advise that a delegation of the Pasqua and Muscowpetung Bands has waited on me with a proposition that a day school be operated on their reserves. They suggest that a building that has been used as a day school for the children of the Agency for the past four years (which school has now been discontinued) be used for the purpose of inaugurating a school. This room is a part of the ration house and would accommodate about ten children. It is equipped with one teacher's desk and eight children's desks. If started, it would mean buying all the necessary equipment with the exception of the desks mentioned.\n\nThis delegation has asked that I take this matter up with you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nTR/FMc\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Attached Letter, Delegation, Pasque and Muscowpetung Bands, School.\n\nI might say that there is constant agitation among the Indians of these Bands for the establishment of day schools. They object to sending their children to residential schools. They want them at home. I have, however, pointed out to them that I could hold out no hope for the establishment of day schools on their reserves for some time to come, and that in view of the war situation, it would be impossible to find funds for the purpose. They, however, insisted that I submit their proposition to you.\n\nThere is no doubt that this school could be established in the present building at a small saving to the Department. It would, however, only accommodate about ten children, and immediately it was started, nearly every family on the reserves would want to send their children there, and those who could not send them would consider they were discriminated against. Consequently it would be a constant source of trouble.\n\nPersonally, I feel it would be a great mistake to establish a school on these reserves until such time as one could be built that would accommodate all the children who would wish to attend it.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos.

Under these circumstances it will be impossible to consider the opening of any new day schools during the coming fiscal year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nRegina, Saskatchewan,\nFebruary 27th, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to inform you that a delegation of Indians from the Qu'Appelle Agency, that is from the Pasqua, Muscowpetung, and Piasot Bands, were here in Regina some time ago for the purpose of meeting Mr. Coldwell, the C.C.F. leader.\n\nThese Indians informed me that the reason they wanted to see Mr. Coldwell was to get him to take up the matter of securing for them Day Schools instead of having to send their children to Residential Schools. However, Mr. Coldwell was not in the city at that time and they interviewed Mr. Williams, the Provincial C.C.F. leader, who advised them he would let them know when Mr. Coldwell arrived in Regina. Later, they again came in to Regina and I believe met Mr. Coldwell, but it just happened that I was ill at home with a bad cold and was unable to meet them after this meeting with Mr. Coldwell.\n\nThe Indians assured me that they had no complaints whatever to make against the Institutions with which they had been dealing, namely the Lebret and File Hills Schools, but they thought the time had come when they should have Day Schools instead of Residential Schools.\n\nThis is simply for the information of the Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.

It now appears that such is not the case; but the site in question is required by the Presbyterian Church for a school on account of which they have made no application to this Dept. for aid in the erection of a building or in the maintenance of the institution.\n\nIt would appear to be, therefore, necessary that the Order in Council of the 1st Oct. last which vested the land required for the school site in the Capt.

(RG 10, Volume 6251, file 603-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nconsiderable expense in connection therewith, is naturally anxious about the possession of the site.\n\nIn reply to the Department's letter of 22nd of October last, in which it was stated that, on account of certain reasons therein explained, it had been thought well to vest the title to the land, in the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, it was pointed out in Mr. Reed's letter of even No. of 14th ultimo, that the Commissioner was inclined to suppose that some misapprehension had led to the land being vested as described.\n\nI have now to inform the Department that the Presbyterian Church has, through the Rev. Mr. Moore, expressed its very strong desire to have the title to the land vested in itself. Mr. Moore asks if it might not be possible to vest the land\u2014apart from it having to pay for it\u2014in the Church, for so long as its use is limited.\nlimited to mission or school purposes; failing this, whether it might not be possible, in this case, to modify the existing regulations relative to homesteading, as to allow the Rev. Mr. Moore to homestead the land, dispensing with the oath which binds him to affirm that it is for his own individual use.\n\nThe school promises to be a success, if the promises of the Indians to send their children to it, can be regarded as a criterion; and if successful, it will supply a want sorely felt, and practically solve what has proved a peculiarly hard problem with regard to the education of the children of the Reserves.\n\nThe Commissioner is not aware of what difficulties\u2014if any\u2014may exist in the way of gratifying the desire of the Church people, but, in thinking the matter over, he is of opinion that, should any concessions be given\nthe Presbyterian Church in the direction herein indicated, for school or mission purposes, other denominations not at present enjoying the same privilege will most likely consider it their right to have the same concessions granted them.\n\nIt is a question in the Commissioner's mind, whether it would not be as well to either offer to the Church the use of the property, as long as they used it for the purpose for which it was granted, the title being vested in the Superintendent General; or to make a grant of the land to them, if it could be done, and impose building, and other conditions on them.\n\nThe Commissioner desires me to state, that while the question of land is a great consideration in connection with these boarding schools situated immediately off a Reserve, yet it is desirable that as much encouragement as possible should be given them.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nfor Commissioner.\n41387\n\nA.M.

The band was divided in opinions in this matter, some wanting a day school similar to the regular public school, while others wanted a combined day and boarding school. After considerable discussion a vote was taken and it was decided by a small majority in favor of the combined day and boarding school. The Principal of the Crowstand Boarding School told me that they had decided to sell entire school property including buildings and land at the present site and build a new school on the reserve.\n\nThe Indians, however, express a strong wish that the school be built and run by the Department and not in any way controlled or managed by the Church. The Band desire as soon as possible, when all come definitely located on their lands, to change the school into a regular public school, towards which they are willing to contribute a sum equal in amount to that paid by neighboring white people in school taxes. If the Department agrees to their request the Indians are willing to do the labor on the New School building, the Department to furnish the material, at such time as a public school is started.\n\nThe Band has submitted through the chief Inspector conditions on which they are willing to surrender the southern portion of their reserve, which will if accepted bring them much closer together and make the School convenient for fact they will be near enough together to make a public school feasible. I beg to ask that I be informed as soon as reply to convey to the Indians,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Affairs.

The school to be non-denominational, as nearly like the Public School as possible, and directly under the Department's control.\n\n2. The building to be erected by the Department, using the Sands Capital Funds. Indians who wished to work and were sufficiently skilled, being given work by the contractors who might have the contract.\n\n3. The School building to be centrally located and a resident (preferably married) teacher employed.\n\nI promised to report the meeting to the Department but also stated that I did not think the School could be built this season and that in the meantime the children of school age must go to the Boarding schools. There are about thirty children of school age on the reserve. I talked this proposal over with Principal Mr. Whinney and he, at that time, said he would write you approving of this project. I saw him on Saturday last and he said he had not yet written but was doing so shortly. He stated that he was looking over the Birtle school and that no doubt Crowstund would close.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

D. MOLFAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. G. Blewett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nThe matter of a combination Day and Boarding School on Cote Reserve, is one that I should like to bring to your notice. As you are aware, the question of building a new school at Crowstand has been under consideration for the last three years, but during that time conditions on the Cote Reserve have greatly changed, owing to the greater part of it having been surrendered, and the Band living on the remainder of it now form a thickly settled community. I am of the opinion that a combination Day and Boarding school would work here to perfection, as fully 70% of the children on the reserve could attend as Day pupils and the balance as Boarders for five days each week.\n\nI may say that the Indians of this Band have been very anxious to have a day school and complain about the present school, which as you know is not popular with them.\n\nMy idea is that a suitable building could be erected to accommodate a staff of four and twenty pupils (Boarders), with all modern conveniences, at a very reasonable cost.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIn addition to this there should be a Principal's residence and a detached class-room, for which two buildings we have plans and specifications already made out that could be used, and all that would be necessary would be to get a plan for the Main Building. If you approve I should like to have one made out and submitted to you for consideration.\n\nI may say that I understand the Presbyterian Church has been considering such a proposition for some time and I know that the carrying out of this plan would meet the Indians' wishes also.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspr. of Indian Agencies.\n\n468645\nOctober 1st, 1914.\n\nDear Mr. Graham -\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to the educational work on Cote's Reserve.\n\nSome days ago I had almost concluded to discharge or transfer to other schools all the girls and conduct the institution for a time at least for boys only. I was afraid, however, that this might prove a hardship both to some of the children and also to the Church, and I am asking that a new Principal be appointed. We will keep the school running as it is until next year.\n\nI am disposed to agree with you that a combination day and boarding school would best meet the needs of the Cote Reserve. When a decision is finally arrived at the plans will be prepared in the Department. In the meantime I should be very glad to have a pencil sketch of a building that\n\nW. H.

What staff does the Department consider necessary for the running of the new School?\n2. If this is to be a Day School what is the purpose of the two small dormitories allowed for in the plan of the proposed building?\n3. Would it not be possible by a very slight addition to the cost of building and maintenance also, to make this a semi-Boarding School?\n4. What provision is to be made for conveying the more distant pupils to the day-school?\n\nI would not have the Department think that I am asking these questions out of any desire to find fault but from a sincere desire for the good of these people and to know exactly what the Department mean by the term \"Improved Day School\".

If you want us to secure these workers, you will have to give us an idea as to when they will be needed.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nAndrew S. Grant\n\nA.S.G.-A.V.\nD. C. Scott, Esq.,\nDy. Supt. Genl., Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI have just received a letter from Mr. McWhinney in which he states that he does not think it will be possible for them to keep the Boarding school open after the first of December and he is anxious to know what is to be done with the staff. His suggestion is that Miss Walker, who is an excellent teacher, should remain, and that Miss Dunbar should be matron, and that we get an Indian man or boy to do the outdoor work, so as not to put these trusted workers, that are now in our employ and are very efficient, out of business. If we are going to be responsible for this work, Mr. McWhinney will have to have general supervision of the School and the mission work on the Reserve, as we would not want to leave this school without proper supervision. Of course we would be responsible for his salary.\n\nI am writing to you personally in this matter because I want you to give it your attention. My opinion is that you had better let us make the necessary arrangements, subject to your approval, because we must notify the parties in our employ and we may have difficulty in getting new workers, and I think it better to use the ones we have, who have been tried and have proved satisfactory.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6281, file 604-1, part 1)\nNovember 16th, 1915.\n\nDear Dr. Grant,\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant with reference to the staff for the new Cote Bay school. I think the suggestion to retain the services of Miss Walker, that Miss Dunbar should be matron and that Mr. McWhinney should have a general supervision of the school and mission work on the reserve, is a good one, and I am prepared to give it my approval. In nearly all the improved day schools, of which we have several in operation in the western provinces, we have engaged a man and his wife, the man to take up the class work, and his wife to act as field matron, and in addition to these two we have provided a helper. The usual rate of salary has been $600.00 for the teacher, $300.00 for the matron and about $10.00 a month for the helper.\n\nI would ask you to be kind enough to let\n\nRev. A. S. Grant, B.D.,\nSuperintendent, Board of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\nConfederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\nme know what you consider would be fair salaries.\n\nIt should, of course, be remembered that in the new situation these young ladies will have to provide their own board, all the Government supplies they will have in their hands will be the material for the mid-day meal. I have no doubt we will be able to make some mutually satisfactory arrangement.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir,\n\nAs the time is near at hand when the combination school at Cote Reserve is to be opened, I should be glad to know what arrangements are being, or have been made regarding the management of this school. It is true you promised to advise me later on regarding the matter, but as the time is so near for the opening and reports are going around that Mr. McWhinney is to have charge as Principal, but that he will live in the town of Kamsack, thus leaving the building and pupils in the charge of two young women, I should be glad to know if there is any truth in these reports. It is true that you told me a short time ago that the Department and Mr. McWhinney were soon to sever connection, and this makes me think the reports must be groundless; however, I thought it wise to make enquiries before it is too late.\n\nYou know the trouble we have had in the past with boys and girls getting together. There was more of this at Crowstand than at all the other schools in the Inspectorate put together. Only last month there was another case of this kind, as you will see from Acting Agent Christianson's report. If the school is to be opened according to the reports above mentioned, it will make further trouble, which can be avoided by having the right kind of management.\n\nThere is another matter to which I would refer.\n\nDuncan G. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nHas Mr. Christianson the same power as other Agents in dealing with schools? There is a feeling prevailing that the Agent must not give directions to the teachers regarding the work generally. Now, if the Agent has not this power, when he sees matters he thinks require attention, he might as well keep away from the school altogether.\n\nI should like to make another suggestion before the school is opened\u2014which is, that all correspondence regarding the school should pass through the Agent's office, and instructions to the Principal should also go through him. There cannot be success if instructions come from three or four people, each of whom is unsure of what the others are doing.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nM.M. Graham\nInsp. of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, November 26th, 1915.\n\nDear Sir -\n\nIn the absence of the Deputy Superintendent General owing to illness, I have to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 18th instant, in reference to the proposed management of the Oete Indian Day School.\n\nMr. Scott has given some consideration to this matter, and has been in communication with the authorities of the Presbyterian Church, but nothing definite has as yet been decided upon. Your letter will be brought to Mr. Scott's attention on his return to the office, which, it is hoped, will be in the near future.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M.

I am very glad you see your way clear to fall in with my suggestion regarding the staff of the school, and I am taking up the matter of the salaries, and other arrangements necessary, with Mr. McWhinney in the light of your letter, and, as soon as I hear from him, I will write you again.\n\nThanking you for your prompt reply to this enquiry,\n\nI am,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nAndrew S.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have just received word from Mr. McWhinney that, now that winter has set in, they will be compelled to close the Boarding School on the 30th of November. The salaries of the matron and teacher will have to be paid by your department from December 1st on. As I understand it, you are responsible for the salaries of all the workers except the superintendent in this day school, and for all the expenses connected with the maintaining of it. Is it your intention that there should be any resident pupils at all? How are you going to arrange for the mid-day meal for the pupils?\n\nI was wondering if you would require any of the furnishings in the Boarding School, or any of the equipment there, either in the school or on the farm. If so, we would be glad to sell them to you at a reasonable price.\n\nIf the teacher and matron and other help are to live in the school, what about their board? Will you pay them a salary so that they can board themselves, or pay them so much salary and board in the institution? These are matters that ought to be\nsettled, so that we can make the necessary arrangements with the staff as to salary, etc.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA.S.G.-A.V.\nOttawa, December 5, 1925.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo in further reference to the improved day school on the Ote Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as you state the salaries of the matron and teacher will have to be paid by the Department from the first instant, on which date the Crowstand Boarding School was to be closed; it is thought that it would be advisable to continue classes in the boarding school building for day pupils until such time as the new day school building is ready for occupation and I should be glad if you would instruct Mr. McWhinney, who is to supervise this school, accordingly.\n\nWhile it is not the intention of the Department that there should be permanent resident pupils in this school, there may be exceptional cases where some of the children live at too great a distance to return home every night and provision will be made for keeping a few of them from Monday till Saturday, if necessary.\n\nAs to the arrangements for the mid-day meal, sufficient supplies for this purpose will be furnished on requisition through the Agent and a helper will be employed at the rate of $10.00 a month, as you were informed by the Deputy Superintendent General on the 16th ultimo.\n\nThe Department will also pay for any fuel used.\n\nRev.

I am taking up the matter referred to in your letter with Mr. McWhirter again, as to the employment of the teacher and matron in the meantime. I suppose if we sent on a statement prepared by him as to what salary the Government ought to pay, the amount will be forthcoming.\n\nOur contract with the Government is up on the 1st of April for all this work. I have not been able to get the other denominations to join with me, so that we might approach the Government regarding a new contract. It is certainly time that something was done, as we are not prepared any longer to work under the old one.

Original on 427000-17\n\nCote Day School.\n\nI am sorry to say that nothing has been done to Cote Day School since my last report and at present it looks as though the children of Cote Reserve were to lose a year's education and a number of the Indian parents are continually making enquiries about the delay in having this building completed.\n\nSgd. M. Christiansen,\nInd. Agent\nAs per your instructions in letter No. 431602-1 of Jan. 7th, I beg to state that I have examined and checked the goods at Crowstand School which the Church authorities desire the Department to purchase, a list of which I received in the above letter. In this connection I might say that the prices asked are reasonable with the exception of a few articles which are priced a little high.\n\nMy recommendation to the Department is that none or very little of this stuff should be bought as a great majority of it is old and badly worn, as the prices indicate. In my opinion the only articles worth accepting are, refrigerator @ $12.00, 4 children's beds and springs @ $.00 each and if any quantity of bread is to be made at the new School the bake oven could be procured and installed in the basement.\n\nThe reason for my recommendation is that it would be a pity to furnish a fine building, as the Cote School will be when completed, with this class of furniture, and I informed Mr. McWhinney of the above recommendation. If the Department takes these goods over I will check same when moved to Cote School.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nSir,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Your obedient servant,\n\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nActing Indian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6281, file 604-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st inst., which was found here on my arrival on the 28th inst.\n\nI note that the school is to be in charge of Miss Walker, Teacher, at a salary of $450.00, and Miss Sarah Dunbar at $500.00 per year. As the management of this school will have to be under one head and as your letter does not say which one of the two ladies is to be in charge I would be glad to be advised on this point.\n\nYour letter does not say anything about boarding arrangements for the pupils and I am therefore in the dark on this subject, although I understand from Mr. McWhinney, the missionary, that he understood from the Church Authorities that the Department were to furnish everything. If this is the case I would like to have full instructions on the matter.\n\nI have a few suggestions to make to the Department on the subject of this school. I think it is highly essential that the Indian Agent who is responsible for the Agency should be the one to give instructions to those in charge of the school.\n\nD.C. Scott Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThere should be no divided authority in this matter. If Mr. McWhinney or anyone else has suggestions to make regarding the school he should make them to the Agent and not to the school. I am merely pointing this out so as to avoid friction in the future which there is bound to be unless this matter is clearly understood at the outset.\n\nAll correspondence regarding this school should come through the Agent.\n\nThere is another matter that I think I should bring to your attention. The school is small and there is not sleeping accommodation for more than four children at the most. This being the case I think every effort should be made to have all children attend as day pupils, and those children who live at a great distance from the school should be sent to regular boarding schools where there is ample accommodation waiting for them. I refer to File Hills boarding school and Brandon Industrial school. Of course there will perhaps be cases where it would be a hardship to send children away to boarding schools but these will be few and on the advice and recommendation of the Agent they could be admitted to the improved Day school as boarders. Once we begin taking in boarders the expense of management will be increased and I feel it will be only a short time before you will be called upon to supply nearly everything that is supplied boarding schools and the training not nearly so good.\n\nIf the idea of supplying a mid-day meal only is followed, it will save a lot of complications and work for the Agent as we will only have to purchase meat, rice, biscuits, tea and sugar, whereas on the other hand if regular boarders are kept we will have to have all the facilities as are kept at a boarding school including additional staff, horses, cows, hens etc.,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6281, file 604-1, part 1)\nThe mid-day meal system worked out well at the Assiniboine Agency and if the people who are to take charge of this school will do as well there will be no grounds for complaint. My idea is to impress on the management of this school that it is to be run as a day school and let the boarding schools do what cannot be done here.\n\nAnother matter that I am not clear about, and that is regarding the board and maintenance of Miss Walker and Miss Dunbar. I understood from Mr. McWhinney that the Church Authorities proposed that the ladies provide their own board, I only hope this is true as it will be much easier for the Agent not to look after the purchase of the various requirements, of course there will be beef, flour and the other staples that will have to be purchased for the pupils' mid-day meal and these articles could be supplied to the staff as well as it would be impossible to keep them separate from the pupils' rations.\n\nWith regard to the furnishings required for the new school your instructions to me were to purchase what was absolutely necessary to equip the school. I did not find anything in the list of furnishings on hand at Crowstand that I thought would be suitable except a few blankets. I have therefore purchased a range, which I am having installed before I leave here, and the necessary cooking utensils. I could not get any beds or furniture in town, there being only one store here where furniture is sold and this shop carried practically nothing. I will order the beds, mattresses and two cheap bedroom sets in Winnipeg.\n\nThe\nThe class-room furnishings, desks etc., I am having transferred from Crowstand School at once, and will have the carpenter place them in the new school. A new desk and a small cupboard for school material will have to be supplied for this room.\n\nI have given instructions to put the soft water tank, of 50 barrel capacity, in at once. It is impossible to get the drainage system put in this fall on account of the scarcity of labour, this will have to be done in the spring.\n\nThe cold air shafts made of galvanized iron running down the wall in the basement near the furnace will have to be boxed in for protection against wood being piled and knocked against it. This is being done by the carpenter also.\n\nThere are no bins in the pantry for flour, tea, oatmeal etc., these are absolutely necessary and I am having them put in before the carpenter leaves the job.\n\nAccounts covering the purchases made by me will be forwarded to you in a few days.\n\nI hope the foregoing suggestions will be of service to the Department and that definite instructions will be issued as it will save complications in the future.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nOctober 13th, 1916.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nI have your letter of the 20th ultimo, with further reference to the management of the new Cote day school. I shall deal with the matters referred to by you seriatim.\n\nIt appears to me that Miss Sarah Dunbar, whose duties as matron will be general, including both the school and the reserve, should be the nominal head of the institution. A special letter of instructions as to her duties as field-matron will be sent to her.\n\nReferring to paragraphs 2 and 4, it is to be distinctly understood that this is a day school. It is not proposed to take in regular boarders, but should there be at any time 3 or 4 children, who on account of distance from the school, or for other reasons, could not be expected to attend regularly, they might be kept in the school from Monday morning to Friday night. In such cases, as in other schools, the parents would be\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nexpected to assist in providing their food. I agree with you that when it is found necessary to send children from this reserve to a residential school, they should go to Pile Hills, Brandon or Elkhorn, if Protestants.\n\nThe Indian agent as representing the Department will have direct supervision of this school, and all correspondence relating thereto should come through his office.\n\nWith reference to the mid-day meal, you may arrange for the purchase of the necessary food, such as meat, flour, rice, biscuits, tea and sugar. The supplies furnished should be of the same character as those given on the Assiniboine reserve. The arrangements made with the church authorities is that the teacher and matron should provide their own food, but in view of the fact that the salaries which they have been receiving, and are still being paid, are small compared with those paid in a number of other schools, I think that your suggestion, that they be furnished with beef, flour and other staples, is a good one, as these have to be supplied for the mid-day meal for the children, and you may carry\nout this arrangement.\n\nI approve of the action you have taken with reference to the furnishings, also the soft water supply, bins in the pantry, etc.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform the agent and the others interested as to the conditions on which the school is to be conducted as outlined above. I trust that the institution will be successful, and I know that the Department will receive the sympathetic cooperation of yourself and Mr. Christianson in attaining this end.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nToronto, Oct. 27th, 1916.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:-\n\nWe have just learned that the new school on the Cote Indian Reserve is completed, and that Miss A. E. Walker is to be the teacher, and Miss S. Dunbar the matron. We understand there are to be a number of boarding pupils - perhaps eight or ten. I presume we may regard this as a sort of semi-boarding school.\n\nHow is the school to be maintained? Who is to have oversight of it? Will Miss Walker have charge of the institution, and next to her will the Indian Agent exercise direct control over the school, or will our missionary, Rev. W. McWhinney, continue to have general oversight? If the supervision of Mr. McWhinney is withdrawn, it would seem that the only connection the Church will have with the school will be the privilege of submitting the name of a teacher and a matron for the approval of the Government.\n\nIn the estimates sent here, the salary of Miss Walker is placed at $450 and board, and that of Miss Dunbar, $500 and board. What will they receive to cover board? In a communication just received, it is suggested that, if they are to be provided with beef, flour, tea, etc., an allowance of $100 would be sufficient, but, if they have to provide everything themselves, $200 should be allowed.\n\nHow will the salaries be paid? Will the Department forward the money in a lump sum to Dr. Somerville, our Church Treasurer, in the same manner as the other salaries are advanced? As this school is not just like any of the others in which our Church is interested, we would be glad to know your plans.\nWe have not had an opportunity as yet to bring this matter either before the Presbytery of Yorkton or our Board, but feel sure that both would prefer that Mr. McWhinney should have general oversight. As he is a Minister of our Church, through him the Presbytery could keep in touch with the work. This is very essential, if we are to have any connection with the school. I fancy the women are not anxious for responsibility, but would prefer to be workers under our Board as heretofore.\n\nIn looking over past correspondence, I find that on November 16th, 1915, you wrote to Dr. Grant as follows:\n\n\"I think the suggestion to retain the services of Miss Walker, that Miss Dunbar should be matron and that Mr. McWhinney should have a general supervision of the school and mission work on the reserve, is a good one, and I am prepared to give it my approval\".\n\nThen, in a later letter dated December 4th, 1915, you said:\n\n\"It is thought that it would be advisable to continue classes in the boarding school building for day pupils until such time as the new day school building is ready for occupation, and I should be glad if you would instruct Mr. McWhinney, who is to supervise this school, accordingly\".\n\nThese statements seem to us very clear, and the arrangement you have outlined would be satisfactory, but, as we have had correspondence from Saskatchewan recently intimating that the Government is planning to work otherwise, we would be glad to hear from you again.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.H.E.-A.V.\n\nSecretary.\nNovember 14th, 1916.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo with reference to the management of the new Cote Bay school. It has been arranged that Miss Sarah Dunbar, whose duties as matron will be general, will be the nominal head of the institution; while Miss Walker will have charge of the class-room work. The former will be paid at the rate of $500.00 per annum, and the latter at the rate of $450.00 per annum. It has also been arranged that they shall be supplied for their own use with beef, flour and other staples, provided for the mid-day meal of the children. A special letter of instruction has been sent to Miss Dunbar as to her duties as field-matron. In our improved day school system in the west, it is usual to engage the services of a man and wife as teacher and matron respectively.\n\nRev. J. H. Edmison, B. A.,\nSecretary, Board of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\n424 Confederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\nand not two ladies as in this case. The engagement of a man and wife for these duties has been found generally satisfactory. The Department is, however, willing to try the experiment of conducting the school on the basis now arranged for, but should it not prove successful, it may be found necessary to institute a change at a later date.\n\nIt is to be distinctly understood that this is a day school, and it is not proposed to take in any regular boarders, but should there be at any time three or four children, who on account of distance from school or other reasons could not be expected to attend regularly, they may be kept in the school from Monday morning until Friday afternoon. In such cases, as in other schools, the parents will be expected to assist in providing their food.\n\nThe Indian Agent as representing the Department will have direct supervision of this school and all local correspondence regarding its management should come through his office. The Department has arranged with the Agent for the necessary supplies for a simple mid-day meal. These consist of meat, flour, rice, biscuits, tea, sugar, etc. They will be of the same\nnature as those given at other improved day schools.\n\nThe payment of the salaries of the matron and teachers will be made as usual to the Church. As with other day schools conducted under the auspices of the various religious denominations throughout Canada, your Church will have the privilege of nominating the teachers, but the direct control of the school will rest with the Department through its officers. I have no doubt that Miss Dunbar and Miss Walker will be able to achieve good results on the Cote Reserve, and I am sure that they will receive the sympathetic cooperation of our officers in that district.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of __________________________\n\nNo. ___________ I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 19th inst. with instructions re opening of the Cote school and I immediately informed Miss Dunbar that we were prepared to open the school. She wishes to know the Department's intention re furnishing the teacher's dining-room, also arrangements for hauling water, keeping fires and like chores. She states that she received the impression from the Church Authorities that the Department would furnish a chore man for the school. I suggested to her that, for the present, until arrangements were made, that they use the pupils' dining-room and if they were prepared to move in that I would send a team to Crowstand for their bedroom furniture next Monday, 30th inst., and purchase the supplies as stated by you. I informed her that, for the time being I would procure a barrel tank in which could be kept their supply of water for immediate needs and would arrange to have their water hauled for a few days.\n\nIf Miss Dunbar agrees to these arrangements school will be opened on the 1st November, in the meantime I presume she is getting advice from Mr. MacKinney.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nBalcarres\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6281, file 604-1, part 1)\nI thought it better to give them all the assistance in my power, for the present, until satisfactory arrangements re these details were made, in order that school be opened on the 1st of the month if possible.\n\nI received a letter from the Department a few days ago stating that Miss Dunbar had been under salary from the Department at the rate of $500.00 per annum as Field Matron for Cote Reserve since January last. Mr. McWhinney informed me that Miss Walker has also been under salary from the Department since last January at the rate of $450.00 per annum.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN. Christianson.\n\nIndian Agent.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI think I should like you to see the enclosed copy of a letter I received from Mr. Christianson this morning.\n\nThe furniture for the dining-room, which will consist of a table, four chairs and a small side-board, will be purchased by me. I am also buying two bed-room suites.\n\nYou will see from what Mr. Christianson says that Miss Dunbar expects to be supplied with a chore man, which, to my mind, would be absurd. The water is in a well 13 or 20' from the back door.\n\nI was not advised by the Department that Miss Dunbar has held the position of Field Matron for the past ten months, although I inspected the Agency once during this time and visited it five or six times, and I am positive the Agent knew nothing about it.\n\nTo be candid, I feel sure this work is not going to be a success under the present arrangements. To\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq., begin\n\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nbegin with, the management of the day school should be under a man and wife, who should be able to do all that is to be done. The salaries that are paid to the present two women would provide for this sort of help. Then again, I am not at all impressed with the teacher and I do not think Miss Dunbar will make a good field matron. My own experience with field matrons has been anything but satisfactory.\n\nThere is another matter, which is by no means the least important; both these ladies are completely under the influence of Mr. McWhinney, who as you know has not been a success as a school manager, and who has shown a decided inclination to interfere with the work of the reserve. Mr. Christianson is a busy man, but if we give him the proper start with this school he will do his best to keep it going. I would strongly recommend that if the parties now engaged are not satisfied with the Department's arrangements, that they be relieved and a man and wife engaged instead, even if we had to wait for a time.\n\nI am sorry I cannot speak more encouragingly about this school, but am hoping it may yet be able to get a proper start and show good results.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nInsp. of Indian Agencies\nNovember 14th, 1916.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo with enclosed copy of letter received by you from Mr. Christianson with reference to the management of the Cote day school. I do not know that there is anything I can add to my letter of the 13th October. We will have to give the proposed scheme a fair trial. The Church authorities understand that Miss Danbar and Miss Walker are on trial in their respective positions, they are also aware that the school is under the direct supervision of Mr. Christianson and yourself.\n\nWith regard to their help, I think it is reasonable that they should have someone who could cut wood, draw water and do other heavy work of this nature. In most of our improved day schools we provide help of some kind, and I think we should make\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nsuitable provision in this case. I know that both Mr. Christiansen and yourself will be much interested that this school, which has taken the place of the old boarding school, should prove successful.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 14th instant in reply to mine of the 31st ult.\n\nI do not wish you to think for one moment that I shall not do my utmost to make the improved Day School at Pelly a success. I thought it was only right that I should give you my impression of the two ladies who are to take charge of the school. Their general appearance did not impress me. Miss Dunbar has been paid for the past nine months, I understand, but she did not report to the Agent during all this time. I think if she had been in the least interested she would have at least reported herself, instead of living in absolute idleness all the time at Crowstand school, where there was just herself and Miss Walker. Of course it may not have been your intention to have her take up her duties until such time as the new school was opened.\n\nWith regard to my remarks about a choreman, I fear\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI did not make myself quite clear on this point. It was my intention that the wood should be cut, split and piled at the back door for the kitchen and in the basement for the furnace. The wood was to be cut by machinery and piled by the pupils. As to the water, the well is close to the door and the soft water is supplied by a pump in the kitchen. In view of these circumstances I do not see how a man could be employed. At our File Hills Colony Hospital the Nurse and her assistant, who is an Indian girl, not only look after the furnace, but they care for the pony as well. They also have a garden, hens etc., and I venture to say that these two people have more to do than the two at Pelly will ever have, as the latter can have the larger boys attend to the furnace during the day. However, if in the face of these explanations, you think additional help should be provided, kindly let me know and I shall carry out your instructions.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInsp. of Indian Agencies.\nNovember 23rd, 1916.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nI never had any doubt that you would try to make the improved day school at Pelly a success. The only reason why we retain the services of these two ladies is to placate the Presbyterian authorities who made a to-do about closing the school and throwing these people out of employment. I will leave the matters of detail in your hands and those of Mr. Christianson. If they do not make the thing go, we shall have to get rid of them and try to get a competent married man. I have told the Church authorities that our officers alone would be responsible, and I think they should understand from this that we do not require any guidance from Mr. McWhinney. I think his action in marrying that girl to the deformed\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nIndian conjurer was most reprehensible. It is inconceivable how he could have had the inhumanity to so act. Then he coolly makes the suggestion that we should endeavour to get the marriage annulled.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that, acting upon the advice of Mr. Wilson of Livingstone and Wilson, Barristers, Yorkton, I have opened Cote School and the teachers have moved in and school will commence on 11th inst.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 7, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant informing the Department that, acting on the advice of Mr. Wilson or Livingstone and Wilson, Barristers, Yorkton, you have opened the Cote School and that classes will commence on the 11th instant.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, when forwarding your monthly reports on this school, you will be good enough to give full information in regard to the work being done by both the teacher and the field matron.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

In that you stated that the salary of Miss Dunbar would be $500 and that of Miss Walker $450. You stated that \"the Indian Agent as representing the Department would have direct supervision of this school, and all local correspondence regarding its management should come through his office\". You also stated that \"the payment of the salaries of the matron and teacher will be made as usual to the Church\".\n\nI have asked the Women's Missionary Society to give me a statement of their payments to this school during the year. They have submitted the following:\n\n| Description                                      | Amount   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Salary of teacher for 6 months, Jan.-June        | $225.99  |\n| \" matron                                        | $250.00  |\n| Paid in full by Govt                            | $475.00  |\n| Salary of teacher for 6 months, July-Dec         | $225.00  |\n| \" matron # 4 # July-Oct                         | $166.64  |\n| Received from Govt                               | $41.65   |\n| Bal. due from Govt                               | $391.64  |\n\n$391.64\nThe $41.65 that they have received on account of salary for the matron did not come direct from Ottawa, but was sent direct from your Department to Miss Dunbar, and, as she had already received her salary cheque from the Church Offices, she forwarded it here, and the amount was entered as a refund. It seems to me that there is a little confusion in regard to the payment of these salaries. In your letter of the 14th, you state that the payment of the salaries will be made as usual through the Church. At least one cheque has gone direct, and whether others have been remitted in the same way I do not know.\n\nYou will see from the foregoing statement that, apart from the $41.65, our Treasurer has received nothing from the Government on account of this school for the six months beginning July 1st. As you have ruled that Mr. McWhinney no longer has any supervision, I cannot write him in regard to this, so am corresponding direct.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ.H.F.-A.V.\nDecember 28th, 1916.\n\nI have your letter of December 20th, with reference to the payment of salaries to the matron and teacher of the Cote Bay school. Confusion has certainly arisen with reference to the payment of these salaries which we can clear up without much trouble.\n\nMiss Dunbar was considered by our accountant as the field-matron, and is being paid upon requisition from the Agent. I learn that they have sent her November salary direct and she will probably refund it. The Schools Branch has requisitioned for the salary of Miss Walker, and I understand that they are sending you a cheque in payment for her in full to 31st December. A cheque for Miss Dunbar's December salary will also go to you in due course.\n\nI have issued instructions that these ladies\n\nRev. J. H. Edmison, B.

As previously intimated in my letter of the 19th. inst., wherein I acknowledge receipt of yours of 11th. inst., and expressing my surprise at receiving your telegram of the 8th. inst., I was even more surprised on receiving the one above quoted. I thought it unnecessary to reply to the above telegram but considered it my duty to obey instructions contained therein.\n\nI would ask the Department to acknowledge receipt of this letter as I feel that the censure in your letter of 11th. inst. is not due me.

Walker at Cote Indian School in regard to her salary, and also that of Miss Dunbar, matron.\n\nMiss Walker claims that her understanding was that she was to receive $450 with board, room and laundry in addition, and that Miss Dunbar was to receive $500 and board, etc. It now appears that, since moving into the new school, practically the full cost of board has come out of the salaries of these ladies.\n\nI understand that a mid-day lunch is served the pupils. As a result the matron and teacher secure a few staples such as tea, meat, sugar, etc. Miss Walker states that she and Miss Dunbar use comparatively little of these. She intimates that even the coal oil used to light the building has been paid\nfor out of their salaries.\n\nI have taken this matter up with our Women's Missionary Society this morning, and we have agreed to recommend that the salaries of both of these workers should be increased. Miss Walker intimates quite frankly that, unless the situation is improved, as far as she is concerned she will be forced to send in her resignation. We feel that you should make it possible for her to remain at her work. The cost of living is high, and she is not getting as much as some of those serving at the other schools. For example, the Hurricane Hills School was vacant for three months. Mr. Graham engaged a teacher at $900 a year, and the lady in question will have the same advantages in regard to the mid-day meal as Miss Walker.\n\nIt seems to us that Miss Walker should receive at least $60 per month and Miss Dunbar $50.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.H.E.-A.V.\n\nSecretary.\nJanuary 23rd, 1917.\n\nDear Mr. Edmison -\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, in reference to the salaries of Miss Walker and Miss Dunbar of the Otoe Indian School.\n\nIn the near future I expect a visit from Mr. W.

The attendance for January has been rather irregular owing to the severe cold weather and a number of the children have suffered from La Gippe, but I expect the attendance will be of a better average as soon as the weather moderates as the majority of the parents are anxious to send their children to school. Quite a number of the children attending this school previously attended Crowstand School and apparently, what they were then taught, does not seem to be of much benefit to them now. For example, one boy, a lad about 15, who had attended Crowstand School for four years cannot yet read satisfactorily from the 2nd primary reader. The teacher and matron are using their best endeavours but the school has not been in operation long enough to observe any progress.\n\nConsiderable inconvenience has been experienced during the recent severe cold weather by inability to heat the building as the furnace is far from satisfactory. Yesterday, Feb. 2nd., it became necessary to dismiss school about 1.30 o'clock as it was too cold for the children to stay in the building despite repeated efforts by the staff and others to produce heat. I have previously reported this matter to Mr. Inspector Graham and he gave me instructions to get Mr. Kelly, who installed the furnace in the new Agency house, to put this furnace in proper working order.

I have previously reported this matter to Mr. Inspector Graham and he gave me instructions to get Mr. Kelly, who installed the furnace in the new agency house, to put this furnace in proper working order. Mr. Kelly examined it and he informed me that all the pipe work to the furnace would have to be altered in order to get satisfactory results, but he does not wish to undertake the alteration until spring.\"\n\nWith reference to this I have to request that you will personally visit this school and have the furnace operated as a test under your instructions by the person in charge of it in the school, and at once report the results to the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nAs the furnace installed there is of standard make, of sufficient capacity, and heating conductors and registers of correct capacity, and as similar equipment is working satisfactorily in other buildings erected from the same plans and where the official tests show that a temperature of eighty degrees can easily be maintained in zero weather, this being the case, the Department will not permit any changes.\n\nM.

In the event, however, of your further report stating that the heating is not satisfactory, the Department will at once report to the makers of the furnace and have this examined and tested by them, and on the receipt if necessary, of their report here, further action will be taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

I had a reply from you Jan. 23rd in which you intimated that you expected to take this up with Mr. Graham on the occasion of his visit to Ottawa. Since then we have had no word. Our District Superintendent for Northern Saskatchewan called at the office a week ago. He feels that action should be taken at once in regard to this. He states that there can be no question about the ability of Miss Walker as a teacher, and intimates that she could very easily secure a much higher salary if she cares to leave the school. We hope that the Department will make it possible for us to retain her in the work.\n\nYours sincerely\n\nJHE/EB\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fox as teacher at Cote Indian School from Jan. 1st. She takes the place of Miss Lawrence. Miss Fox has a second class professional certificate and is an exceedingly competent woman. When Miss Lawrence gave up the work at the end of the year we had Miss Fox, who was acting as Secretary at our Canora Hospital, go over and take her place. She is willing to take the school permanently. I hope you will approve of her appointment.\n\nI do not know just what salary you will be willing to give her but I think you should give the maximum as she is without doubt one of the best qualified teachers on our staff and we are very fortunate in securing her. In looking up our files I find Miss Lawrence received $750 per year for ten teaching months, but I do not think this is sufficient, as teachers no better qualified are throughout Saskatchewan getting from $100 to $125 per month.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/EB\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fox has been appointed teacher of the Cote Indian Day School, to succeed Miss Gertrude Lawrence from January 1st, last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the appointment of Miss Fox and will allow her salary at the rate of $750.00 per annum. Miss Fox will also be entitled to receive the bonus at the rate of $150.00 per annum allowed to teachers of Indian Day Schools during the continuation of the period the bonus is allowed. The combined salary and bonus will give Miss Fox the sum of $900.00 per annum and this is the full amount that can be allowed her at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. B.

Marshall, teacher of the Cote Improved Day School, I beg to draw your attention to the fact that Mr. S. Marshall is a very competent and experienced teacher, has the children well in hand, and I have noticed a great improvement in the children in their work, cleanliness and deportment.\n\nThe number of children on the roll is 38 and the average attendance is 25.9 which does not include the daily attendance of four white children of the Farm Instructor's, so it can readily be seen keeps Mrs. Marshall fully employed.\n\nThis teacher is in receipt of a salary of $750.00 only per year, and I am of opinion that it should be raised by $200.00 per year. Her services are valuable to the Department, and am fully convinced that her services should be recognised.\n\nDuring September the Cote School was inspected by the Public School Inspector and he informed me that Mrs. Marshall was an excellent teacher and that his inspection fully confirmed all he had heard about her qualities before he came to carry out his inspection.\n\nI also learned from outside information that Mr. Merrill, the inspector offered Mrs. Marshall $1200.00 per year if she cared to consider working under him in the Provincial Public Schools, but understand that the proposal has not been considered by the teacher.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI may point out\nI may point out that Mrs Marshall holds a second class certificate, and it is the only qualified teacher of the three in the Pelly Agency.\n\nMrs. Marshall was also Principal at the Indian Boarding School, Birtle, Man for 6 years.\n\nIn conclusion I beg to recommend that this teacher's salary be increased from $750.00 per year to $900.00 per year.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, Nov. 15, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 14 of the 3rd instant, recommending an increase in salary for Mrs. S.

In continuing salary to Mrs. Marshall during her absence, and in the employing of a substitute, two salaries would be paid for the same service.

Graham Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Dr. Edmison:\n\nFor family reasons Mrs. Marshall finds it necessary to again resign her position as teacher in the Cote school, such resignation to take effect at the end of June. This I think will be final. Mrs. Fraser who has been so very acceptably filling the position of matron since last September has a Second Class Nova Scotia Teacher's Certificate, with several years experience in Public School work and wishes to take over the work of the class room. I would strongly recommend that she be given this position and that Miss Christina Templeton at present serving as assistant to the matron in the Moose Jaw Boys' College, be appointed matron of the Cote school in her stead. I am enclosing a letter from Mrs. Fraser of Moose Jaw College, which indicates Miss Templeton's fitness for this position.\n\nI should like to hear as soon as possible if this change for Mrs. D.R. Fraser and the appointment of Miss Templeton is to be made in order to let Miss Templeton know.\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSigned - W. McWhinney.\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq., D.Litt., F.R.S.C.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing a copy of a letter I have just received from Rev. W. McWhinney, our Home Mission Convener for Kamsack Presbytery.\n\nFrom this you will find that Mrs. Marshall has submitted her resignation as teacher of the Cote School, such resignation to take effect the end of June.\n\nPresbytery's Committee has recommended the appointment as teacher of Mrs. D.R. Fraser, and suggests the appointment as matron of Miss Templeton. She is at present Assistant Matron in the Moose Jaw College. She is reported as a most capable sewer and housekeeper. She was for some years in a large hospital in Glasgow. The Matron of Moose Jaw College describes her as a young woman of bright, lovable disposition and well suited to work such as she would have at Cote.\n\nI have conferred with our W.M.S. and that Society approves of both these appointments.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In reply I beg to say that the Department regrets that Mrs. Marshall has found it necessary to sever her connection with Indian school work, in which her services have been so satisfactory.\n\nThe Department will approve of the appointment of Mrs. D.

This is the first intimation that the Department has received regarding Mrs. Fraser's illness. Please advise if Mrs. Fraser has yet returned to her duties and, if not, state the probable duration of her illness. You should, also, report on the qualifications of the substitute teacher, Mrs. Johnson, and advise by whom she was secured. In this connection, I might point out that the Department should be promptly notified of the illness of any teacher.\n\nI would, also, refer you to official letter of May 6th, 1925, addressed to the former Agent, Mr. McConnell, with reference to the appointment of Mrs. Fraser as teacher and Miss Templeton as assistant teacher and matron. Apparently, we have not received any report recently with regard to the duties performed by Miss Templeton. I should be pleased to have a report from you regarding the duties she performs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE.A.W.R. MacKenzie, Esq., Jr.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter No.117-2-1 of the 4th inst. regarding the Cote Day School and the substituting of a teacher during the illness of Mrs. Fraser; I beg to advise that I notified Mr. Commissioner Graham of Mrs. Fraser's illness and secured permission to close the school until the critical stage was over and at the same time informed him that efforts were being made to secure the services of a substitute.\n\nMrs. Johnson who substituted until the Xmas holidays, holds a permanent second class certificate and was secured by the Rev. W. McWhinney, the United Church Missionary in the field. Prior to time Mrs. Johnson was secured Miss Templeton, the Matron did assume the duties as teacher, but found this in addition to her other duties, more than she could manage. Miss Templeton's duties as Matron at the Cote Day School consist of:\n\n1. Housekeeper for the residence.\n2. Prepare and serve the mid-day meal for the school children and instruct them in table setting and dish-washing.\n3. Give instruction in sewing and knitting.\n4. Perform duties of Field Matron along with the teacher as far as time and opportunity permit.\n\nMrs. Fraser has not and is not likely to return to her duties until the Easter holidays as her condition would not permit of her doing so.\n\nSchool was opened on the 3rd. of Jan. under the Tutorship of Miss S. Leadingham who holds a second class permanent certificate. The Rev. W. McWhinney having secured her services until the Easter recess.\nI note your instructions with regard to the illness of any teacher and in future will see that these are carried out.\n\nMrs. Fraser wishes to return to duty after the Easter recess.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 18, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, regarding the engaging of substitute teachers at the Cote Indian Bay School during the illness of Mrs. Fraser.\n\nYour explanation regarding the engaging of Mrs. Johnson until the Christmas holidays is noted. It is also noted that this school was reopened on the 3rd instant and that Miss S. Leadingham will act as substitute teacher until the Easter holidays, as it is not likely that Mrs. Fraser will be able to resume her duties until that time, but that she wishes to return to duty when able to do so.

She desires me to ask for leave of absence for her from May 24th, she leaving a substitute in her place to attend to her duties until the end of the term June 30th. The party she proposes to leave in her place is Mrs. F.

Owens to take over the matron's duties during her absence. Mrs. Owens will be allowed salary at the same rate as is paid the present matron, but we will be unable to continue the matron's salary, as it will not be possible to pay two salaries for the one service at this school.

These children are staying at the Cote School, rations clothes &c. to be provided by the church authorities. They are to return to their respective homes each Friday evening and be brought down on Mondays.\n\nThis situation has arisen over the fact that one or two other families have consented to and had their children baptized into the Roman Catholic faith since the opening of the St. Philips school on the Keesekonse Reserve.\n\nMay I have your instructions as to whether these children can be kept at the Cote School as above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) E.A.W.R.

The Department had in mind vans for the transportation of some of those enrolled at this school; but, after careful consideration, it has been decided that it would be more economical and satisfactory if six or eight of the children were taken into residence from Monday to Friday. I have written to Mr. Indian Agent McKenzie, with a view to learning just what equipment is necessary so that this scheme can be commenced on the first of September.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6281, file 604-1, part 1)\nKamsack, May 25th, 1928.\n\nMr. W. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nMr. McKenzie, Indian Agent has told me of a letter which he has just received from you saying that it is not possible for us to keep boarding children in the Cote Day School. I expect to be in Regina next week and would like to discuss this whole matter with you but in the meantime I would like you to consider the following matters in connection with this question:\n\n1. When the decision was arrived at to close the Crowstand Boarding School and substitute a day school I foresaw that there would be children who would not have suitable homes and others who would be too far away to come and go each day and therefore you will remember that I asked that a small boarding school be attached to the day school. This plan was approved by yourself and by the Department at Ottawa and the plans for the building were drawn and sent to me in 1915. But I suppose it was due to war time economy that the boarding idea was dropped and the Improved Day School was built instead. You will recollect that there was space enough to provide for five bed rooms. It has always been my idea that these should be used for those children who were too far away to come each day so that they could stay at the school from Monday till Friday. However the need for this did not become acute until this spring when the building and opening of the St. Phillips boarding school raised new problems.\n\n2. On the Keskoose Reserve, not far from the new school, there are several protestant families, some of whose children had been attending the St. Phillips day school. When the day school closed and was to be replaced by the new boarding school these protestant children could not attend as protestants. Efforts were at once put forth by the priest in charge to get them to have their children baptized in the Roman Catholic faith and so be admitted to the school. The only other alternative was for their children to be sent away to File Hills or elsewhere. To this they were strongly opposed and you can see the lesser this provided for the R.C. Church to get possession of these children.\n\n3. I should say here that I foresaw these difficulties two years ago when I first heard of the probable building of this boarding school. At that time I wrote the Deputy Minister Mr. Scott pointing out that the number of Catholic families on the Keskoose Reserve was so small that to build this school there would mean encroachment on our work and consequent friction and trouble for the officials of the Department. He promised that my representations would be considered but whether they were or not I do not know.\n\n4. When the question as to what should be done with these protestant children became acute in March and April I told the parents that until some satisfactory arrangement could be made we would take them into the Cote School from Monday till Friday. Father Bruet represented to the parents that this was merely a scheme to get them down to Cote School and then send them away to File Hills or elsewhere without the parents consent. Because of this supposed danger two families formerly protestant had their children baptized and in the case of one family two girls were admitted to the St. Phillips School. The mother of these girls is a member of our Church and the father is a nominal protestant. In the case of two other families we took their four children to Cote School and have been keeping them there from Monday till Friday. At the same time I\ntook the matter up with Rev. Arthur Barner and Dr. Manning in Toronto. I was going to write you in regard to the matter but understood you were not at home. I thought it best therefore to act through the officials of the Church.\n\n6. Not only on Kesekoose Reserve has the R.C. Church been trying to get protestant children into their school but their agents have been down on Cote Reserve trying to get those children who had a considerable distance to go to seek admission to St. Phillips.\n\n6. While there was Day Schools on both Cote and Kesekoose Reserves there was equality of opportunity. Since the building of the new boarding school on Kesekoose our work is placed at a decided disadvantage. What I have been asking for is that some action be taken by the Indian Department to place the educational work of both Churches on an equal footing. We do not ask for any favours but we do ask for equal facilities for doing our work.\n\n7. The Indians on Cote Reserve have been asking that the Day School be turned into a boarding school. I have discouraged this as much as possible in the past but now it seems as if some such action should be taken. I would not ask it to be made into a full fledged boarding school but that the buildings be sufficiently enlarged to enable us to keep from Monday till Friday those Cote children who have too far to come to and from each day and those protestant children from Kesekoose who are still farther away. Another solution that has been talked of is to provide vans to convey the children to and from school. This plan has had difficulties where it has been tried elsewhere. If the children are boarded from Monday till Friday some system would have to be evolved of providing food supplies for them.\n\n8. I know that the easiest solution of all would be to have these children go to Millarville or some other boarding school under our Church. I would be quite satisfied and pleased if the parents would agree to this but they are extremely unwilling to have their children sent away. To try to force this would be the means of driving them into the R.C. School.\n\nI shall be in Regina next week attending Conference and shall try to see you and discuss this whole matter. The information in this letter will give you my viewpoint pretty fully in the meantime.\n\nIn conclusion let me say that I do not want to raise any difficulties for the Indian Department, but I do want something done which will be fair to all concerned.\n\nWith very kind regards, I am,\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\n(Sgd) W. McWhinney.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., May 30th, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copy of a letter that I have received from the Rev. W. McWhinney, Missionary in charge of the Cote and Keesekoonse reserves for the United Church of Canada.\n\nThe matter in question was first brought to your attention in a letter from this office, dated the 7th instant, with which I enclosed copy of one received from our Indian Agent, Mr. E.A.W.R. McKenzie, who informed me that the Rev. Mr. McWhinney had brought four children of the Protestant faith from the Keesekoonse reserve, and was keeping them as boarders at the Improved Day School on the Cote reserve from Monday until Friday. Mr. McKenzie's letter was forwarded to you with a view of ascertaining whether it was right that Mr. McWhinney should do this or not. I received a reply from you on the 12th instant #117-2-1, stating that the Department could not approve of the children being brought to the school as boarders, and instructing me to inform the teachers accordingly. On receipt of this letter I took the matter up with Mr. McKenzie, and he, in due course, brought it to Mr. McWhinney's attention, and the letter now enclosed is the result of the Department's ruling. You will note what Mr. McWhinney says in the third paragraph of his letter.\n\nIt might be possible to make an addition to this school, and have a few of the children from the Keesekoonse reserve, who live at a distance from the school, taken in, provided the Church authorities are willing to do this, and the Department are willing to pay the grant. It might be a solution of the difficulty that has now arisen. I would also point out that there are vacancies in the File Hills school for eight or ten pupils all the time, and the Pelly reserves have always been a feeder for this institution.\n\nDuncan C.

I understand they have nearly all the facilities now on hand to enable them to carry on the work with these children in residence. We have equipped them with stoves and the necessary kitchen furnishings. There may, however, be some small items to be supplied. Rev. Mr. McWhinney is in the City at the present time attending a Conference of the United Church. He called to see me and I made known to him the contents of your letter and he is quite satisfied with the decision.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

Scott,\nDeputy Minister of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRegarding the denominational difficulty that has arisen between the Cote Day School and the St Phillips boarding school on the Pelly Agency I wish to make the following two requests:\n\nBefore doing so I wish to express my appreciation of your acceding to our first request that accommodation be given in the Cote school for the protestant children from Keskoose Reserve.\n\nWhen the emergency arose in April last and I felt we must provide for these children we took them into the school and in addition to the supplies provided by the Department for the mid day meal I had to purchase on my own responsibility certain other food supplies such as butter, rolled oats etc out of church funds which I had on hand and which properly belong to our Mission. I would respectfully ask that at the end of June when the school closes that I be allowed to submit a bill for what I have expended either to the Agent here or direct to you. The amount will be somewhere around ten dollars.\n\nIn the next place I would ask that the two daughters of Joe Keshane who were admitted to St Phillips school in April be not received but sent home and allowed to come to the Cote school or to any other protestant boarding school which they may choose. Joe Keshane is a nominal protestant and his wife is a member of our Church. The two girls in question were both baptized by me when they were infants. They, the parents, allowed their children to be baptized by the R.C. priest at St Phillips and taken into the school for fear that if they did not do this they would be sent away to some distant school. I had told them I would take them into Cote but this priest made them believe that this was merely a step to have them sent away elsewhere without their knowledge or consent.\n\nI am sorry these cases of friction have arisen with the St Phillips School but you may remember that in June two years ago I gave warning to the Department that these things would happen if the St Phillips boarding school were erected.\n\nHoping that these requests I have made may meet with your approval, I Am,\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6281, file 604-1, part 1)\nOttawa, June 13th, 1928.\n\nRev.

Please submit an itemised account, in duplicate, properly certified, to the local Indian Agent, with the request that he attach same to a proper voucher form and forward it to the Department, when payment will be made. It is noted that the amount of the account will be approximately $10.\n\nYou will be advised in a separate communication relative to the case of the two daughters of Joe Keshans, who are in attendance at the St. Phillip's Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

McWhinney,\nKamsack, Sask.\nAugust 17, 1926.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nWhen I was at the Cote Indian Day School this summer, I discussed a programme whereby 6 or 8 children would be taken into residence from Monday to Friday. All they can accommodate is really 6. If it is found advisable to take in more, we might have to provide a dining room in a separate building and use the present dining room for dormitory space. It would be advisable to give them a fairly liberal allowance for the noonday lunch. I am taking action on this file to increase the salary of Mrs. Fraser, who has met with considerable success here for the last 4 years.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

McKenzie,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to increased accommodation for pupils resident in the Cote Improved Day School from Monday until Friday of each week, I would like to call your attention to the immediate need for some provision for dormitory space for the five or six boys now in residence. When Mr. Russell Ferrier, Supt. of Indian Education was here in July he saw the need for increased accommodation and suggested that the present dining room be used for a dormitory and that a one story building could be erected in the rear which would serve as a dining room for day and resident pupils. This I think was a good suggestion.\n\nThere is sufficient dormitory space available for the girls, but I think it would be wise to provide a simple fire escape from one or more of the upstairs rooms for the safety both of the girls and the staff.\n\nIf this is approved, operations should be begun at once so that a surface foundation could be put down before the freeze up. The new building could be heated by a stove.\n\nI would therefore ask you to bring this matter to the attention of the Indian Department as soon as possible so that if possible the building may be erected before winter,\n\nI am,\n\nYours Respectfully,\nUnited Church Missionary,\n\n(Sgd) W. McWhinney.\nSir:-\n\nI have received a letter from the Indian Agent at Kamsack, enclosing one from Reverend W. McWhinney, the United Church Missionary in charge of the Cote Improved Day School, who calls attention to the immediate need for additional dormitory space for the five or six boys now in residence and to the visit recently of the Superintendent of Indian Education when this question apparently was discussed. May I please be advised if any promises were made to Mr. McWhinney and what was the nature of them, and if the Department wishes to take any steps to increase the accommodation asked for at this school. I enclose a copy of Mr. McWhinney's letter referred to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 19, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 310-11A Gen. of the 15th instant, enclosing a communication from the Rev. Mr. McWhinney, with reference to the Cote Indian Day School. When Mr. Ferrier visited the reserve this summer, he looked into the advisability of providing accommodation for a few boys from Monday to Friday. The present space is suitable for only six children, and I understand that girls are being kept in the school.\n\nIt is considered the most economical method of arranging for six boys would be to have them sleep in the present dining room and to erect a small building in which the meals could be served. If you consider this proposal favourably and believe it advisable to provide the building this fall, you might let me have a telegram with estimate of the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your No. 117-2-1, of the 19th instant, in reply to mine of the 15th October, with which I enclosed a copy of letter from the Rev. Mr. McWhinney with reference to the Dote Indian Day School and the providing of additional accommodation for children remaining at the school from Monday to Friday, and reply to say that, personally, I do not see the necessity for this. The Inspectors have been visiting this school regularly for the last 12 years, and this is the first time such a plan has been suggested by anybody. This school was built as an Improved Day School, with facilities to provide a midday meal for children coming from a distance, and it should be maintained as such. We have a similar school at Fisher River, even larger than this, and there is not a resident child in it, although the conditions are equally as difficult as at Pelly. We also have an Improved Day School at Fairford, where we have children living at considerable distances from the school and there are no children resident there. If we provide for the accommodation of 12 or 14 children in this school, as Mr. McWhinney suggests, there being six kept there now, we are getting into a Boarding School of a kind that is not advisable. You will recall that the Government, at considerable expense, built a splendid school at File Hills. This school was not built for the File Hills Indians only. We could not maintain a school with the children from this point alone. Pelly was to be one of the main recruiting points, and a large number of the pupils in the File Hills School today are from Pelly, but if we establish a sort of half industrial boarding school there we are going to cut off the feeding ground for this school and the children.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nchildren will not begin to get the training they would at File Hills. It is not such a great distance from Pelly to the File Hills School, and, in my opinion, it would be a mistake to do anything that would interfere with recruiting from this point.\n\nWe have ample schools to provide educational facilities for the children of this reserve\u2014Brandon, File Hills, Portage la Prairie and Birtle, and in view of all this I am utterly opposed to spending more money for something that is unnecessary. However, if it is your desire that I should proceed with the work of providing this additional accommodation kindly advise me.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham.\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, November 2, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 310-LIA Gen. of the 25th ultimo, with reference to the request for more accommodation for boarders at the Cote Indian Day School.

Mr. McWhinney advises that the duties of Matron from that date onward are to be assumed by one, Mrs. R.F. Roy recently of Kamsack, Sask.\n\nMrs. R.F.

Last autumn I wrote a letter to the Agent asking that he urge upon the Department the need for something being done in this matter before winter. I understand the letter with an accompanying one from the Agent went to the Commissioner's Office in Regina and I suppose was sent on to you. However nothing has yet been done and as a result the matron has had to make sleeping accommodation in the dining room for three or four boys all during the winter. This room has therefore to serve for dining room, dormitory and wash room. Surely the Department does not wish such conditions continued any longer than is necessary.\n\nYour suggestion of last summer that we erect a separate building to serve as a dining room and use the present dining room as a dormitory is I think the best solution of the difficulty. I would urge than a competent builder or architect be sent as soon as possible to decide where this additional building should be put up and how it should be connected to the main building.\n\nAs I pointed out to yourself personally and to the Deputy Minister by letter, the conditions which make this necessary are not of our making. Until the St Philips School was opened it was an easy matter to send children who could not attend as day pupils to File Hills or some other boarding school. But now inducements are offered to get them into St Philips and we have to meet that competition with suitable accommodation right here.\n\nWhenever the parents are willing we are quite satisfied to have them go to one of our boarding schools. We do not want to build up a boarding system here any more than we can help, but for years to come there will always be a dozen or more children who will need to be accommodated at the Cote School from Monday until Friday.\n\nSome provision in the way of fire escape should also be made for the upstairs rooms in the present building. There should also be six single cots provided when the proposed addition is erected.\n\nI sincerely hope these matters will receive prompt attention from the Department, since by this time you will also have received Mr Inspector Hamilton's report on the same matter.\n\nI Am,\n\nYours Very Respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6281, file 604-1, part 1)\nOttawa, May 18, 1929.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nIn the absence of Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Indian Education, I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, relative to the providing of increased accommodation for the pupils who are in residence from Monday until Friday of each week at the Cote Indian Day School. This matter will be brought to Mr. Ferrier's attention upon his return, which will be about the 1st of June, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. B. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

When Mr. Ferrier returned from the West last year, I wrote to Commissioner Graham for a report. Mr. Graham pointed out that there was plenty of room in our residential schools for these children and that it would be folly to operate a semi-boarding school on the Cote Reserve, while such schools as File Hills and Brandon were not filled to the limit of their accommodation. As the Department concurred in this opinion, our Estimates did not provide any funds for building an addition to the Cote Indian Day School.\n\nI am pleased to inform you, however, that there has been some correspondence concerning electric lighting of the Cote School and the Indian Agency, and I am hopeful that this improvement will be effected in the near future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. W. McWhinney,\nKamsack,\nSask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6281, file 604-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nKamsack, June 11th 1929\n\nMr. Russell Ferrier  \nSupt. of Indian Education,  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to the letter No. IIP-2-I dated June 5th from the Secretary, Mr. McLennan, I wish to express my surprise at the view taken by the Department in regard to the matter of increased accommodation at the Cote Improved Day School. It seemed to me when you were here last July that you were fully impressed with the need of the better accommodation for which we have been asking and in the letter referred to above no sufficient reason is given for the refusal of our request. We have no wish to establish a boarding school on the reserve but we feel that accommodation should be provided for those children who are too far away to attend as day pupils. I am quite pleased to have these children go to Brandon or File Hills but when the parents refuse to send them two alternatives remain, either to remain at home and be deprived of education or be coerced into going to St. Phillips boarding School. At the present time there are several children eight or nine years old who are not attending any school because they are too far away to attend as day pupils.\n\nAs I pointed out in my previous letter the present conditions here are not of our making. They are due to the Department refusing our request in 1918 for suitable buildings for our work and then allowing the St. Phillips School to be built a few miles away when there was only a very small number of children in the immediate neighborhood to be accommodated. We might well ask why it is fit and proper to have a full fledged boarding school on the Kusekoo Reserve but unwise to give boarding accommodation for even a few children on the Cote Reserve. To me this does not look like treating alike the two Churches involved.\n\nIn conclusion let me say that I have enough confidence in the desire of the Departmental officials to be just in the matter that I believe if they take time to look at this question fairly reasonably they would promptly grant our request.\n\nI shall hope to hear from you more favourably in regard to this matter in the near future.\n\nI Am,\nYours Respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6281, file 604-1, part 1)\nOttawa, June 15, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to the Cote Indian Day School. In reply, I have to state the Department does not feel justified in incurring expenditure to accommodate boarders at Cote, when space will be available in our regular Indian residential schools. I regret, therefore, that I cannot add to my letter of the 5th instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. F. McWhinney,\nKamsack,\nSask.\nTo Rev. Colin G.

W. McWhinney, has very recently erected a well equipped Roman Catholic boarding school at St. Phillips, five miles from our Cote School, and\n\nWHEREAS the officials of this St. Philips Boarding School have been endeavoring to get these aforesaid Indian children into their school, and\n\nWHEREAS these Indian parents are much opposed to their children going far away to school, these conditions are placing before the Indian parents the choice of having their children remain uneducated, sending them to a distant school, or placing them in a school not of their own faith, and\n\nWHEREAS by the Department of Indian Affairs spending a very moderate sum of money the Cote Day School can so increase its accommodation as to enable these pupils to be lodged and boarded from Monday till Friday, which system has been tried out during the past year and has been found to work out satisfactorily,\n\nTHEREFORE, we the undersigned members of Kamsack Presbytery would strongly urge the Officials of our Home Mission Board to bring such pressure to bear upon the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa as will have them take such action before another winter as will prevent this undue discrimination against our educational and missionary work on these reserves.\n\nWe remain,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n(Sgd.)

Scott, Esq., Litt.D., F.R.S.C.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nJuly 27, 1929.\n\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nThe enclosed petition from the Presbytery of Kam-\nsack, urging the Department of Indian Affairs to increase the\nboarding accommodation at the Cote Indian Day School, has just\nreached the office.\n\nYou will remember that some years ago, when it was\nfound that the buildings of the former Crowstand Boarding School\nwere unfit for carrying on the work, it was agreed to close this\ninstitution and to build instead a semi-boarding school on the Cote\nReserve. This was to consist of a large school room, with board-\ning accommodation attached, or in close proximity, which would care\nfor those children who were too far away to attend as day pupils.\nThe boarding accommodation was expected to house from twelve to\nfifteen children and three or four of a staff. The plans for this\nbuilding were drawn, but before the building operations began, the\nDepartment changed its plan and built only an improved day school.\n\nSince that time, those pupils who could not attend\nas day pupils have been sent to boarding schools of the Church else-\nwhere. This worked well until, as indicated in the petition, the\nDepartment under protest of the Church built a Boarding School for\nthe Roman Catholic Church only five miles away. A year ago sever-\nal children were housed in the day school and boarded from Monday\nuntil Friday of each week. This was agreed to by the Department,\nand supplies of food were furnished from the same source.\n\nAs you will see from the petition, the Presbytery is\nnow strongly urging that additional accommodation be provided for\nthese pupils too far removed from the school to go home each day.\nI will be very much pleased if you will give this your attention\nas soon as convenient.\n\nWith all kind regards,\n\nI am,\n\nYours most faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCGY:GWF.\nEnc.\nJuly 30th, 1929.\n\nDear Dr. Young,\n\nI have your letter of the 27th instant concerning additional accommodation for boarding children at the Cote Indian Day School. The Department doubts the advisability of establishing small residential schools and, of course, cannot consider the application favourably while such schools as File Hills and Brandon have not been filled to the limit of their accommodation. The Rev. Mr. McWhinney of Kamsack has corresponded with the Department in this connection and he has been informed that the Department cannot give favourable consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

I appreciate your attitude in regard to this\nmatter, and we will endeavour to accommodate ourselves\nto the situation.\n\nYours most faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCGY: BJ\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM REV. W. McWHINNEY,\nKAMSACK, Sask., dated January 9, 1930.\naddressed to Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nNow, the question I would like to ask you is what is the Department prepared to do to place the Cote School on an equality of opportunity with the St. Philips School. As I have pointed out in previous letters and as you will remember, the Crowstand Boarding School was closed in 1915 on the distinct understanding that the Department would build a semi-boarding school on the Cote Reserve. This was not done and although it put us to some inconvenience, we made no complaint because we were on equal footing with the St. Philips Day School. Now by the building of the residential school our Indians who are too far away to send their children to the day school and who do not want to send them so far away as File Hills are sorely tempted as in the case of the grandparents of this Charlotte Cote to put them into St. Philips.\n\nTherefore, I think, I am claiming only what is fair when I ask that some action be taken by the Department to remove this unfair advantage that has been given to the St. Philips people.\nJanuary 25, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. McWhinney:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant and I note your request for a semi-boarding school on the Cote reserve. When the Department is determining any extension in its programme, we are very glad to have the recommendation of whatever churches are interested. I believe your request should first receive the approval of the Missionary Society of the United Church. Perhaps you will write to them in the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev. W. McWhinney,\nKamsack,\nSask.\nCote School\nHamsack Sask.\nMay 11-30\n\nMr. Russell Ferrier\n\nYou will have\ndoubtless forgotten me, but\nI had the pleasure of meeting\nyou at this school two\nyears ago in July.\n\nI believe you have sent\nsome historical pictures to\nSt. Phillips School five\nmiles north of us. May we\nhave some, too, please?\n\nWe are very grateful for\nthe electric lighting. They\nare certainly a great boon.\n\nAnd now may I present\u2014a personal request?\n\nMay I, please, have some more salary? The school is heavy and I work hard. Since the children have been in residence I have supervision of lessons every night the resident children are here.\n\nWhen my predecessor left she was getting $100 a month. I have a heavier school and have $90 a month. In five years I have had a raise of $5.00 a month.\n\nIf you could do this, I certainly would be grateful.\n\nSincerely Yours\n\n(Mrs. D.T.C.) Etta S. Fraser\nOttawa, May 15, 1930.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to the work at the Cote Indian Day School. I am pleased to inform you that the Department will allow an increase in your salary of $6.00 per month as from September first, next. I regret that an earlier date cannot be fixed for the increase, as our funds are extremely low at the present time.

For instance, dressmaking, cooking and simple home nursing should be taught the girls while kindred subjects could be taught the boys. Make the lessons of practical value to the children.\"\n\nThe Department is under the impression that Mrs. R. F. Roy carried out some instruction along the lines suggested by the Inspector. If so, it was not brought to his attention but, if she does not do so, please let me have a report, stating if you consider that her other duties are so onerous as to prevent her devoting some time to teaching the subjects suggested by the Inspector to the pupils of the Cote School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Mrs. Roy is alone in the residential portion of the school and has to prepare meals for 8 to 10 people night and morning with an additional 20 to 24 for the noon day meal this in addition to bread baking and attending to the resident pupils does not give her very much spare time. If some permanent assistance could be given her either in cash so that she could hire someone to attend to the household duties or an assistant more time could be given to this phase of the work by her.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nRegina, Sask., February 25th, 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the various schools in the Pelly Agency, inspected by Mr. Hamilton.\n\nThe report on the Key Indian Day school is satisfactory, as is also the one on the Cote improved Day school. The attendance at the latter school is not as great as I think it should be - there are only 27 children on the roll, and 21 were present on the day of Mr. Hamilton's inspection.

The rope would have to extend from the inside of the building, just below or beside the window, across the porch roof and from thence to the ground, varying accordingly in length for each window, 15 to 18 ft. for each window.\n\nThe rope with five suitable hooks to fasten it to, would cost in the neighborhood of $7.50\n\nThis would have to be a special order as rope of this kind is not stocked in the stores but can be ordered when I have your instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 17, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, relative to a suitable and inexpensive means of exit in case of fire at the Cote Improved Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase and installation of a rope at each window that would be suitable to provide a means of escape. The ropes should be attached to strong hooks fastened below the sill of the windows, and, when not in use, could be coiled inside, below the window. It is noted that you estimate the cost of the rope, with suitable hooks, to be approximately $7.50. You will, no doubt, be able to obtain rope of a suitable type, and you should arrange to have same purchased and installed at an early date. Please forward a certified voucher, in duplicate, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE.A.W.R. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nOttawa, September 8, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, requesting authority to purchase food supplies for the noonday meal and for resident pupils at the Cote Improved Indian Day School.\n\nAs our funds are extremely limited this year, it is necessary to enquire carefully into the cost of supplies for noonday meals. I have, therefore, to request that you will state the number of children who are resident in the school from Monday morning to Friday night. You should also state the distance from their homes to the school and if it would not be possible for them to reside at home and attend the school each day as day pupils. If it is not possible for them to travel to and from the school each day, you might state if arrangements could not be made to have them sent to either the Brandon or File Hills Indian Residential Schools. It is found that during the last school year the sum of approximately $200 was expended in the purchase of supplies for meals. We will be unable to provide this amount for the present school year. Please state the minimum amount per month which you consider would be required in the purchase of supplies for the noonday meal for the day pupils; also for the resident pupils, if it is necessary that the present arrangements for these latter pupils be continued. I shall be pleased to have, at an early date, as complete a report from you as possible regarding the continuing of the present arrangements and also as to the above suggestion that the pupils who are too far away to attend school each day be placed in a residential school.\n\nIn the meantime, you may arrange for the purchase of the quantity of food supplies considered absolutely necessary for the present month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nE.A.W.R. McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nKamsack, Sask. May 18th 1935.\n\nDr H. W. McGill,\nDeputy Minister of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nBy this mail you will received the resignation of Mrs D. R. Fraser who has been teacher of the Cote Improved Day School for the past ten years. Along with her resignation Mrs Fraser has stated that she wishes to return to Nova Scotia where her husband is living and is considerable of an invalid. I understand she is requesting the Department to secure her a pass from the C. N. R. from Kamsack to her home in Truro. Now I do not know whether the Indian Department ever grants such passes to Indian workers but if it can be done I would very respectfully urge that Mrs Fraser be accorded this consideration as she has been a most faithful and efficient teacher and has put in eleven years of very strenuous work in the Cote School, in every way doing all she could for both Indian parents and children.\n\nI Am,\n\nVery Respectfully Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6281, file 604-1, part 1)\nOttawa, April 8, 1935.\n\nMadam:\n\nUnder authority of an Order of His Excellency in Council, dated July 31, 1933, with amendments, it is provided that all employees reaching 65 years of age should be retired.\n\nIn this connection I would draw your attention to the case of Mrs. D. R. Fraser, teacher of the Cote Improved Indian Day School, who is 66 years of age. It will therefore be necessary to either retire Mrs. Fraser as from the end of the present school year - June 30th, next - or, if it can be shown that her services are such that it would be difficult to replace her, an Order in Council could be obtained, retaining her in the position for a further period of one year.\n\nI am therefore submitting the matter of Mrs. Fraser's retirement for your consideration and would request that you advise the Department as soon as possible whether she should be asked to retire or if it is your opinion that she should be retained for one more year, when an Order in Council, authorizing her retention in the position, will be obtained. However, it will be necessary to state definitely in the application for the Order in Council that the services of Mrs. Fraser are of such a nature that, in the best interests of the work at the school, it would be difficult to fill the position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B. A.,\nAssociate Secretary, Board of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nOttawa, June 20th, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nIt has recently been found necessary to again reduce the Appropriation for Indian Education. Under these circumstances, it will not be possible to provide, during the academic year 1933-34, the funds required to supply food for those children who have been kept in residence at the Cote Indian Day School. Please inform those interested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActg. Secretary.\n\nR. A. W. R. McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nOttawa, May 23, 1935.\n\nRev.

Fraser from Kamsack to Truro, N.S.\n\nThis Department cannot issue passes on the C.N.R., nor can we obtain same. I, therefore, regret that it will not be possible for the Department to comply with your request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nRev. W. McWhinney,\nKamsack, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nI herewith tender my resignation to the Indian Department, to take effect June 30-1935.\n\nMy husband is an invalid in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia, and I feel that I cannot any longer stay away from that duty.\n\nI came to this school in September 1924 and have put in eleven years of the very best service I am capable of giving. The work among these Indian people has been intensely interesting, but very strenuous.\nIn view of these years of hard work, could the Indian Department give me a Railway Pass to my old home in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia? I had hoped to have the pleasure of your visiting the school here before I left the West, as I very much enjoyed Mr. Ferrier's visit some years ago. But I fear that pleasure will not be mine.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Mrs. B.R.) Etta S. Fraser\nOttawa, May 27, 1935.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter, tendering your resignation as teacher of the Cote Indian Day School, to take effect June 30th, next.\n\nIn reply I have to say that your resignation is accepted as from the date mentioned. The Department wishes to thank you for your long and faithful services at this school.\n\nI regret being unable to comply with your request to be furnished with a railway pass to your home in Nova Scotia, nor can we obtain same from the C. N. R. However, upon the termination of your service at the end of June, next, the Department will grant you a retiring gratuity, equal to two months' salary. I would request that you advise the Department at the end of June the address to which you desire your salary cheque and the retiring gratuity sent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nMrs. D. R. Fraser,\nTeacher,\nCote Indian Day School,\nKamsack, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn your letter of May 27, you asked that I advise the Indian Department of my address at the end of June 1934.\n\nI expect to leave Cote about July 8th or 10th and until that time my address will be as at present.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\n(Mrs. D.R.)

Crockett, teacher at the Cote Day School, went to Winnipeg last Saturday evening for the purpose of being examined by a doctor as she had not been in good health for some time. She left without my knowledge and the first information I had was the receipt of a telegram, addressed to Mrs. Roy, the Matron, and received Sunday evening, to the effect that she was confined in hospital and suggesting that another teacher be procured to relieve for a week or more while Miss Crockett was in hospital.\n\nAs I had very little information to furnish the Department as to the probable duration of her illness, and my recommendation as to the proposed steps to be taken with regard to continuing with the school work in her absence, I wrote Inspector Hamilton at Winnipeg, requesting him to make enquiries at the hospital and from her doctor in order that he could furnish me with sufficient information that I could make an intelligent report to the Department. I have not yet received a letter from Mr. Hamilton, but since my letter was mailed to him I have received another telegram from Miss Crockett, through Mrs. Roy, to the effect that she intends to give up the school as her doctor has advised her against teaching on account of her health.\n\nOf course the school is closed until another teacher is appointed and I would ask that steps be taken to have the position filled as soon as possible. I think that it would be possible to procure the services of a teacher locally if necessary, but I presume the appointment will be in the hands of the church authorities to some extent, at least they seem to think it should be.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.P.B.

Miss Crockett went to Winnipeg on the evening of the 2nd instant, for the purpose of being examined by a doctor, as she had not been in good health for some time. She left without the knowledge of the Agent, and the first intimation he had was the receipt of the telegram.

Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\n\nPP/O'M.\nKamsack, Sask.,\nMarch 18th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI find it necessary to report that the work of Miss R. M. Jamieson, teacher of the Cote Indian Day School, is not very satisfactory, and while I am not in favour of making the change immediately, the matter would be kept in mind and the change made at the beginning of the next school term.\n\nShe is sadly lacking in discipline. There has been considerable truancy and she does not seem to be able to control them in the classroom. I find that it is impossible to get any of the children, those who have been attending for several years and those who have recently started, to speak above a whisper in the classroom.\n\nIn addition to this, she has a great deal of spare time which could be spent in social service work and things of this nature. This she will not do. You will remember our conversation Tuesday night about the affairs at this school and the movement which I mentioned with regard to transferring Mrs. Roy and appointing a man as a missionary with his wife for teacher. As I informed you, I do not think this is what is required at all, but what is required is the right kind of a classroom teacher who will co-operate with Mrs. Roy, both in and about the school itself and on the reserve in social service work.\n\nThere is no need for any expense to the Department outside of the salary which is now being paid, but there is need for the teacher's salary being paid to the right kind of a person.\n\nI have previously hesitated about reporting adversely in connection with Miss Jamieson, chiefly because two or my own children are attending this school and it might be thought that this is my chief interest. My own children are making fair progress, but they receive no discipline whatever in school and it is necessary for us to attend to that part of it ourselves. The Indian children, however, receive no discipline whatever at home, and it is therefore very necessary that they receive some at the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThos. Robertson, D.S., Inspector of Indian Agencies, Regina, Sask.\n\nSgd. J.P.B. Ostrander.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nW. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., 23rd March, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI beg to submit the attached letter received from Mr. Ostrander, Agent at Pelly.\n\nMrs. Roy is Matron at the Cote Improved Day School and also Missionary on the Reserve. Owing to the fact that the Minister at Kamsack objects or refuses to conduct funeral services on the Reserve, Mrs. Roy has been doing this work. The Indians object to this. The Church is therefore considering transferring Mrs. Roy and replacing her with a male missionary-teacher.\n\nI understand Mrs. Roy objects to a transfer and is considering leaving the Service. She is an exceptionally good teacher and works among the Indians. We would be very sorry to lose Mrs. Roy and, if any influence can be used to retain her, we believe it should be done.\n\nI would recommend that Miss Jamieson's services be terminated at the end of this school year and that a teacher qualified for and willing to do social service work be engaged.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 1st, 1937.\n\nDear Dr. Dorsey:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Dr. Thomas Robertson, Inspector of Indian Agencies for Saskatchewan.\n\nDr. Robertson expresses the opinion that you have under consideration at the present time the desirability of changing the teachers at the Cote Improved Indian Day School. It would appear that there is a great deal of dissatisfaction with the work of Miss Jamieson, and I am of the opinion that her service should be terminated at the end of the present school year. Mrs. Roy is also employed at this school, as matron, at an annual salary of $750. In view of the fact that there is an enrolment of only 25 pupils and an average attendance of less than 20, the salaries paid - $950 to Miss Jamieson and $750 to Mrs. Roy - seem to be a little bit out of line with the salaries ordinarily paid for the operation of a small day school.\n\nDr. Robertson intimates that Mrs. Roy has been rendering good service and is very popular with the Indians. It is altogether likely that a petition will reach you, asking that her services be retained. I have been wondering if it would be possible for you to obtain the services of a married male teacher, whose wife could act as matron. If this suggestion does not appeal to you, I should like you to give some thought to the desirability of securing a capable girl to take Miss Jamieson's place. If you could obtain the services of a teacher interested in social service work, who could cooperate with Mrs. Roy, the results, I feel confident, would be very satisfactory.\n\nI am simply passing on these suggestions to you for your consideration.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Heey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Geo. Dorsey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West, TORONTO 2, Ont.\nOttawa, April 1st, 1937.\n\nDear Dr. Robertson:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of March 23rd and to state, by way of comment, that I have today written to the United Church authorities, expressing the view that Miss Jamieson's services at the Cote Day School should be dispensed with at the end of the present school year.\n\nI shall be glad to discuss this matter with you more fully when you visit Ottawa, in the immediate future.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hesey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. Thomas Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nPERSONAL\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare\nand Training,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of April 1st relative to the situation in the Cote Improved Day School. I have taken the matter up with Mrs. Loveys of the Woman's Missionary Society, and think that a more or less radical change will take place.\n\nI had in mind suggesting the appointment of Mr. George Harris, who is at present at Norway House as Farm Instructor, to be the Teacher, and Mrs. Harris to be the Matron. I had further in mind that, if Mr. Harris proved successful in this position, he might conceivably be the kind of man who would make a good principal of a larger school. I realize, of course, that it might be better to have a woman teacher, but if Mr. Harris were appointed he could conduct services on the Reserve. Whilst he is not an Ordained man, I think that, with the help of the Minister at Kamsack, the work would be better taken care of.\n\nI wonder whether you would care to give me your opinion about this. I would hesitate very much to make any recommendation which would not be of assistance to you in working out the policy which you have mapped out.\n\nWith best regards, I am\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD:BJ\nOttawa, April 17, 1937.\n\nDear Dr. Dorey:\n\nPlease pardon me for not replying to your letter of the 13th instant until now. I was anxious to discuss the subject matter of your communication with Dr. Robertson, Inspector of Indian Agencies for Saskatchewan, who is at present attending a conference at Ottawa - hence the delay.\n\nDr. Robertson and I feel that you would be particularly fortunate if you are able to secure the services of Mr. Harris for the Cote Improved Day School. I feel confident he would accept the position as a challenge and make a real contribution to the welfare of the Indian population. May I suggest that he be engaged on the understanding that he will remain at the school at least two or three years. I would not like to see him removed until the work in that district is thoroughly organized. You might let us have a specific recommendation at your convenience.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A.

Debbin as teacher and assistant teacher, respectively, of the Cote Indian Day School. Their appointment is approved.\n\nAs intimated in my letter of April 1st, it is felt that the salaries allowed at this school have not been in line with the salaries ordinarily paid for the operation of a small day school. It has, therefore, been decided that Mr. Debbin will be allowed salary at the rate of $950 a year and Mrs. Debbin at the rate of $500 a year. The salary of each of them will commence from September 1, 1937, and will be paid on the basis of ten teaching months in the academic year.\n\nDr. Theo. Robertson, Inspector of Indian Agencies, and Mr. J.P.B. Ostrander, Indian Agent, are being notified of their appointment and requested to give them every possible assistance.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. R.E. Cochrane, D.D.,\nSecretary, Board of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n259 Queen St. W.,\nToronto E., Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI would like to submit the following report on the Pelly Agency.\n\nCote School teacher\n\nThis school has a nice garden with individual plots for each child. The teacher and his wife are taking an active interest in not only the education and advancement of the children but also in the men and women on the reserve. Sewing, knitting, handicrafts and manual training is being carried out in the school. Women on the reserve have organized into a sewing circle. Several of the Indians expressed their appreciation at the work being carried on here.\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nSaskatchewan.\nKamsack, Sask.,\nSept. 8, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRe Cote Day School:\n\nYou will recall discussing with Mr. Dobbin and the writer the matter of Whitehawk and Friday children insisting on the Dobbin keeping them at night and for all meals as well as the noon day lunch.\n\nI discussed this matter with John Friday some time ago and pointed out that it was your wish that this practice be discontinued. John Friday objected very strongly and blamed Dobbin entirely.\n\nRoy Whitehawk applied to have his girl sent to Boarding School but I did not forward the application. School started today and Joyce Whitehawk is attending Cote School, but none of the Fridays turned up. John also mentioned that he would prefer sending his children to Boarding School rather than have them drive to and from school in the winter, but has made no move to have them sent to boarding school.\n\nDobbin are very anxious to have the Friday and Whitehawk children attend Cote Day School, but they are also very anxious to get away from making it more or less a free boarding school.\n\nIt appears that at this time last year Mr. Kerley said it was Mr. Robertson's wish that no children be kept by Mr. Dobbin at night and Dr. Robertson came along shortly after and said the matter had not been discussed with him. These people appear to be still convinced that Dobbin are the only people that object. Under the circumstances would you be kind enough to write a letter to me stating that the Department strongly objects to the Cote School being used as other than a day school, as I would very much like to clear Dobbin from blame.\n\nIt is certainly very unfair for the Indians to expect Dobbin to provide bed and board free of charge.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. L. Bryant\nIndian Agent.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nGeneral Supt. of Indian Agencies\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 6, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of September 2, addressed to Mr. Christianson, General Superintendent of Indian Agencies, has been brought to my attention.\n\nFor some years past the Department was aware that it was the practice to keep some children overnight at the Cote School and while we never approved of the practice no specific instructions were issued to discontinue it.\n\nThe Department feels that the time has now arrived when definite action should be taken and consequently you should notify the teacher that no children are to be kept at the school overnight.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J.

JACKSON:\n\nRe: Operation of Cote Improved Indian Day School.\n\nImmediately following our discussion of a few days ago, I made a careful review of the letters and reports on file in respect to the operation of the Cote Indian Day School.\n\nI should explain that the Cote School was established by Mr. Graham, as an experiment, a few years prior to his retirement. Mr. Graham was of the opinion at that time that it might be possible to operate a school in which provision would be made for the board and lodging of the pupils from Monday until Friday, asking the parents to become responsible for the clothing of the children and for their care during the week-ends.\n\nAt the time the present teacher and his wife were appointed, a number of children were boarded at the school from Monday until Friday of each week and the teacher's wife was allowed a salary of $50.00 a month for a 9 month period, on the understanding that she would be responsible for the preparation of the meals for these children and their general care. Two female teachers had been in charge of this school for several years prior to the appointment of the present teacher. The arrangement whereby pupils were provided with board and lodging at the school from Monday until Friday was never wholly satisfactory and was recently abandoned. The keeping of children at the school while others were permitted to go home at the close of the regular school period from day to day created a certain amount of dissatisfaction. It is\nsignificant that so far as I am aware no country has ever been able to organize what one might term an intermediate school, half-way between the residential school and the ordinary day school.\n\nYou will note that the reports on the teacher now in charge of the Cote Indian Day School are excellent in every respect. It is my understanding that this teacher taught for the full 10 months period last year, although under no obligation to do so. I have just learned that Mr. and Mrs. Dobbin may be offered the principalship of either the Round Lake or the File Hills Residential School. If such is the case it will only be necessary in the future to employ one teacher at the Cote School. The reports on file indicate that this teacher and his wife enjoy a very high reputation in the United Church. They have spent their lives in non-English speaking communities and Mrs. Dobbin particularly has been very successful in the organization and conduct of Sunday Schools amongst central European peoples.\n\nI got the impression from my conversation with Mr. Bryant that he is not very favourably impressed with the work of this teacher. Mr. Bryant finds it difficult to understand why his wife should be paid $50.00 a month as matron. This payment can be easily understood if we keep in mind the organization of the school and the purpose for which it was originally established. I personally attach a great deal of importance to Inspector Waind's report. Mr. Waind's reports are usually very critical and Mr. Dobbin appears to be one of the few teachers whose work appears satisfactory from year to year to the Inspector.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nMay 15, 1942.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 2nd instant and my reply of the 11th instant, in connection with transferring Mr. L.E. Dobbin from Cote to the File Hills Residential School.\n\nIs it the intention of the Women's Missionary Society to transfer Mr. Dobbin immediately? If so, do they intend to nominate anyone to carry on at the Cote School for the balance of the current academic year?\n\nWhile we have always allowed salaries for two teachers at Cote, the attendance at that school has decreased in recent years. The March quarter return shows an enrolment of 30 and an average attendance of only 17. The Indian Agent visited the Department last winter and at that time the opinion was expressed that the Department was not justified in paying salaries of two teachers at this school. Consequently, I feel that you should suggest to the Women's Missionary Society that only one teacher should be nominated for the Cote School for the academic year 1942-43.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Geo. Dorsey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 8, Ont.\nMay 19th - 1942.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt., of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA\u2014Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nDr. Cochrane requested that I should reply to your letter of May 15th\u2014\n\nWe, as a Woman's Missionary Society, are asking Mr. L.E. Dobbin to take up his duties at the File Hills School as soon as he can be released from Cote. We are looking for a teacher to undertake work in this School for the remainder of the year. We hope he may be able to arrive at File Hills by June first.\n\nIn the third paragraph of your letter you say that you have allowed salaries for two teachers at Cote. May I call your attention to the fact that $800.00 is the salary of one teacher at Cote and $500.00 the salary of the Matron for the Reserve, making a total Government Grant of $1,300.00.\n\nMrs. Dobbin, who has been acting as Matron, has been giving much time to the Homemakers' Club, which the Department requested should be organized. She has also been a very faithful visitor in the homes on the Reserve and we do feel that this work is sufficiently important that it should be continued. We are well aware, however, that there would not be sufficient work for two teachers and during the past five years there has been only one.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIsabel M. Lovett\nHome Mission Executive Secretary.\nOttawa,\nMay 20, 1942.\n\nDear Mrs. Loveys:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, with reference to the Cote Day School.\n\nI was aware that Mrs. Dobbin has been performing field matron duties, but she has always been classified as a teacher. The reason for this was due to the fact that other field matrons are only allowed a nominal salary and no provision is made for a field matron to draw the salary that we have been paying Mrs. Dobbin. Consequently, it was necessary to classify her as a teacher.\n\nAm I to understand from your letter that Mrs. Dobbin will not accompany Mr. Dobbin to the File Hills School? I was hoping that it was your intention to include her as a member of the staff of that school, especially in view of the apparent lack of discipline at File Hills for some months past.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMrs. C.M. Loveys,\nHome Mission Executive Secretary,\nWoman's Missionary Society,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n413-415 Wesley Buildings,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa,\nMay 20, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe United Church of Canada has recommended the transfer of Mr. L.L. Dobbin, teacher of the Cote Day School, to the Principalship of the Pile Hills Indian Residential School. The question then arose regarding a successor and I recall that when you visited the Department you were very pronounced in your opinion to the effect that two persons were not required at this school. On making this suggestion to the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada they appear to disagree and feel that both the teacher and field matron are required. As you know, we have always classified Mrs. Dobbin as a teacher, due to the fact that we have no provision made for a field matron, as such.\n\nUnder the circumstances, I should appreciate having a letter from you immediately setting forth definitely your views regarding the future of the Cote School. Your letter, of course, should include a definite recommendation regarding your views about continuing the employment of one or two persons.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J.L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nMay 25th - 1942.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA - Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nIt is not my intention to break up any happy home and I am sorry that I neglected to mention Mrs. Dobbin's name when I told you of Mr. Dobbin's appointment to File Hills. Already they are making plans and hope to take up their work on June first.\n\nI wonder if you would advise me what you consider a nominal salary for a field Matron, since our understanding was that Mrs. Dobbin was classed in this category, and your grant would be continued on this basis.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nHome Mission Executive Secretary.\nMay 23rd, 1942.\n\nAttention Mr. R. A. Hoey,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThe Woman's Missionary Society inform me that Mr. L. L. Dobbin will be prepared to leave the Cote Reserve and undertake his duties at File Hills on June 1, 1942. They ask me to nominate to finish the term at Cote Mrs. J. Bennett who is recommended by the Superintendent of Schools. She is an experienced Primary Teacher.\n\nI am also asked to nominate as Matron of the School Miss Maud Rogers. She is willing to undertake the work on June 1, 1942.\n\nIn your letter of May 15th you suggest that there had been two teachers formerly and that the idea of the Department was they were not justified in paying the salary for more than one teacher. As my information is that there have been only two women at Cote in recent years, one a Matron and the other a teacher, I have been wondering whether your reference to the second teacher was to the one whom the Woman's Missionary Society call the \"Matron\". I would be glad if you would put me right on this matter when you let me know whether you accept these nominations for the Woman's Missionary Society.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nRBC/HL\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6281, file 604-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa,\nMay 28, 1942.\n\nDear Doctor Cochrane:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, nominating Mrs. J. Bennett as teacher and Miss Maud Rogers as matron of the Cote School.\n\nThe appointment of Mrs. Bennett is approved and she will be allowed salary at the rate of $95.00 a teaching month plus bonus. I note that she will begin duties on June 1.\n\nI regret that at the present time I am unable to approve the appointment of Miss Maud Rogers as matron. As I stated in the last paragraph of my letter of the 15th instant, the Indian Agent visited the Department last winter and at that time the opinion was expressed that the services of a matron were not required. Recently I wrote to him again with a view to ascertaining if he has changed his opinion. There has not yet been time for him to reply and until he does so I cannot see my way clear to approve the appointment of a matron.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev.

Dobbin, teacher of the above school, and Mrs. L.L.

Bennett as teacher at Cote School, but regret that up to the present time the Department is unable to approve of the appointment of Miss Maud Rogers as matron. I shall pass on this information to the Woman's Missionary Society who are directly responsible for these appointments and the administration of the School and its work.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRBC: EWS\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of May 20th, File 117-2-1 in connection with the transfer of Mr. L. L. Dobbin to principalship of File Hills Residential School and appointment of a successor for Cote Improved Indian Day School.\n\nI recall discussing Cote Day School when visiting your Department during the winter and am of the opinion that as far as the actual school teaching at Cote Day School is concerned, one teacher is all that is required. I believe I pointed out that Mr. Buck at Aey Day School taught almost as many pupils as attended Cote Day School, and that Mrs. Buck also prepared a noon day lunch for all the children with an allowance for supplies amounting to half that supplied to Cote Day School, and she received no payment whatever for this work, while at Cote Mr. and Mrs. Dobbin both received salaries. In discussing the matter I maintained that Mrs. Buck should also be entitled to some monthly compensation.\n\nA field matron working with the teacher, really interested in the spiritual and bodily welfare of the Indians who would spend a good part of the time out on the reserve, visiting the homes and encouraging and helping the mothers to better living conditions, improving sanitation, giving simple first aid instruction in the care of the sick babies, etc., could, I think do a great deal of good on this Cote Reserve. There are a few homes that are farther than three miles from school, and an active matron should be able to visit every home frequently on foot, without any great hardship.\n\nIt has been said here that the Catholics are converting the United Church members to their faith, with possibly some truth, but more real active missionary work on the part of those in charge of the work here would overcome this to a great extent. I would suggest the organization of a good Sunday School Service every Sunday instead of the regular Sunday Service which is attended by the faithful few each Sunday. The Sunday School Service could in time include an adult Bible class, which I think would be attended by many adult Indians, with one or two that would be glad to teach a class. We possibly cannot do a great deal with many of the old Indians, but with the school children and younger people, there are great possibilities of helping them morally.........\nthem morally and spiritually.\n\nIn conclusion I would say that it would be possible to carry on here with one teacher for the duration of the war providing some provision is made for the preparation of the noon day meal. It would, I expect, be necessary for the teacher to keep a maid for help and company.\n\nRegarding the missionary work about on the reserve, I have already stated my views. By the way, I understand from Mr. Dobbin that the new missionary is on the way here from Toronto, and is expected to arrive to-morrow or the next day.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. L.

Mrs. Bennett was not engaged to assume the duties of the teacher for Cote beyond that date, but the Women's Missionary Society made the recommendation, I assume, to the Department to engage (Miss) Rev. M. E. Corner as she reported for duty during the first week of July.\n\nTrusting this is the information you require.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent.\n\nMr. R. A.

I enclose copy of letter of appointment and the necessary forms will be forwarded to you as soon as received.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant and note that Miss M.E. Corner has succeeded Mrs. Mary Bennett as teacher of the Cote School.\n\nI now desire to refer to the request contained in your letter of the 25th ultimo to the effect that the school be open during September and closed in January. This week we have a letter from Mr. M. Christianson, General Superintendent of Indian Agencies, in which he states that the white schools in Saskatchewan will be closed for September in order to allow the pupils to assist in harvesting operations. Mr. Christianson has suggested that similar action be taken with regard to the Indian schools. In view of Mr. Christianson's recommendation, it is difficult for us to approve the opening of the Cote School during September.\n\nI enclose the necessary forms which Miss Corner should complete and return.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Corner.\n\nMiss Corner advises me that she has been engaged for this position by the Women's Missionary Society of Toronto, and that she will be paid by them the same salary that was formerly paid to the school teachers by the Department, i.e., $90.00 per teaching month. She is under the impression, however, that the money she is paid by them will be reimbursed by the Department directly to the W.M.S. This, she understands, was a special arrangement between the Department and the Women's Missionary Society.\n\nBecause she is employed by a Charitable Institution, she feels that she is exempted from the Cost-of-living bonus and is therefore returning the Forms N.D.T.1 and CT 256 unattested to.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

The Women's Missionary Society of the United Church is allowed to nominate the teacher for the Cote School but when this is done the person appointed comes directly under our control. She is entitled to receive the cost-of-living bonus which at the present time is at the rate of 17%. I, therefore, return the forms which she should complete. Since writing to you previously new forms have been issued. You understand, of course, that the Department will only pay Miss Corner for a nine-month period; namely, from October 1 to June 30. It is quite possible that the Women's Missionary Society is paying her for the other months in the year. If they desire to do this, it is really none of our concern.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Her name is Miss Corner and she hasn't taught for years but I suppose this makes no difference. The other lady, a Miss Russell, is a housekeeper.\n\nThe attendance at this school so far has been very slow.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. Welfare & Training,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe Cote Day School, Cote Reserve:\n\nThe Rev. Miss Corner has been in charge of Cote Day School since July last, assisted by Miss M. Rogers as Matron. The latter has had many years in various mission fields and proved to be capable and understanding and she was very well liked by everybody. Unfortunately her health has not been good. She had a heart condition which made it necessary for her to take periods of rest and finally the doctors insisted that she give the work up. She went East last week.\n\nMiss Corner has made little if any headway with the mission work. She is of a more or less retiring nature and does not appear to get in common contact with the Indians, especially the men who are not generally in favour of a woman preacher. As a teacher she works hard, puts in hours after school on preparation of desk work etc., but does not appear to have the special ability to make a good teacher. She also has had difficulty in handling the larger boys. Miss Rogers had practically assumed all the responsibility of conducting the school and now that Miss Corner is left to her own resources, I am afraid she will find the situation difficult.\n\nMiss Corner is a woman of splendid character, trying to do her best, but in my opinion a man should be on the job, although many women teachers could handle the school very well.\n\nMiss Rogers was going to talk the situation over with Miss Lovies of the Women's Missionary Society at Toronto when she returned as Miss Rogers also realized that a man on the job would be much better for the mission work as well as the school teaching. A married couple with the man to teach and preach would, I think, be the best arrangement of this Cote Day School if this could be arranged with the W.M.S.\n\nJ. L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 14, 1943.\n\nRe: Cote Indian Day School,\nCote Reserve, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI am today in receipt of a letter from Indian Agent Bryant, which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"Miss Corner has made little if any headway with the mission work.

In view of this enrolment it would not be possible for us, under existing regulations, to allow an amount greater than the salary for one teacher. We would be prepared, however, to pay at the rate of $100.00 a month for the full 10 month period.\n\nIt would be deeply appreciated if you would review this matter with the object of letting me know in due course what the prospects are for securing a male teacher or missionary teacher for this school for the coming academic year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev.

Indeed, if anything else had happened, I would have been much surprised. I have sent a copy of your letter to Mrs. Loveys of The Woman's Missionary Society, who will give the matter consideration.\n\nI cannot think that it would be possible to get a man teacher, with the present scarcity of men. The only suggestion that I could make would be that your Minister might be persuaded to expedite the suggestion which I have made to him in writing, namely, to confer with the Hon. Humphrey Mitchell and get some of these conscientious objectors, who are trained teachers and who are married, and put such a man at Cote. It might be possible to get some man like Mr. Schellenberg. I will take this up with Mrs. Loveys.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD,MLT\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6281, file 604-1, part 2)\nRegina, Sask.

Miss Corner, who is the teacher there.\n\nThe school is in fair shape but there are a certain number of repairs that will have to be made - for instance; a new cistern in the basement. I was informed, and I saw the cistern, that it has gotten full of little holes. This was caused by the pipe gradually rusting. The furnace is also in bad shape. This was a misfit in the first place and 28 years ago I wrote reams of letters regarding this furnace and I finally got it changed so that it would heat the school. Mr. Bryant is going to get Mr. Barrie from Pelly, who is a tinsmith, to look at the furnace and the cistern, also some eave-troughing that has fallen off the school, and find out what it will cost to effect the repairs.\n\nThe fence around the school also needs repairing. Probably all new posts will have to be put in. Mr. Bryant will also attend to this in due course.\n\n..... The attendance\nThe attendance at the school is what caught my attention. There are 29 on the register and I suppose a lot more of school age that are not registered, but the attendance would I do not suppose average 15 during the year. However, the Department have that information. I talked very seriously on the matter of attendance with Miss Corner and she admitted frankly that she had done her best to get the Indians to attend but just simply could not awaken them to the fact that their children had to come to school to get an education. For instance; she informed me that the two that were her star pupils in attendance had lost 17\u00bd days during the year. Others stayed away for days and days at a time. In fact these are her exact words \"if the children want to stay at home the Mothers will let them do so\" and you know the result. I talked to Mr. Bryant, the Agent, on this matter and he made the statement that he did not try to encourage the older boys to attend school as Miss Corner could not handle them. The Rev. Miss Corner seemed to be quite a fine woman but she may not have the necessary qualifications for making a good teacher. No doubt she has the education, but whether she has the qualities to pass this on to the children is more than I know. However, to start with the management of the school is not what it should be. As you know this is what they call an Improved Day School. Five bedrooms upstairs and several rooms downstairs. It has a large furnace where cordwood sticks are used. In fact I think the furnace box is 48\" long. Miss Corner\n\n... told me herself\nshe herself that it was an awful job for her to put on the furnace. In her own words she stated\u2014\"I have to drag the sticks over to the furnace and then get some of the children to help me put them into the fire box. As a result the school was terribly cold last winter and never got warm until night.\n\nThe other lady that was at the school broke down about three months ago and had to go east.\n\nYou know probably better than I do, because I am not a teacher, that children do not get much of an education unless they go to school more or less regularly. Therefore you might say that the way the school is going at the present time, with only 50% attendance, it is more or less of a joke.\n\nI had an opportunity of speaking to one of the Councillors before I left there, John Felly, who has a fairly good education and speaks good English and I asked him to speak to the band and tell them that unless these Indians sent their children more regularly to school it would probably be necessary for our Department to close up the Institution, and John realized this. Whether my advice to him will be followed by the other Indians or not I do not know. He was the only one I had an opportunity of speaking to as I left in the afternoon.\n\nI realize that teachers are very hard to get, but whoever is there it takes a man to fire the furnace.\n\nThe repairs that are necessary will be taken up later.\n\nM.

BRYANT, Indian Agent, contacted the writer and complained that Miss Elizabeth ROBERTSON, Cote Day School teacher, was having difficulty maintaining regular attendance of her pupils at school. Mr. BRYANT advised that no Attendance officer had ever been appointed on the reserve in question and he requested that police action be taken under section 10 of the Indian Act.\n\nAt 9:00 AM this date, the writer patrolled via Pol/Car Code 6560 to the Cote Reserve, where I went over the subject with J.L. BRYANT. I suggested that it might be advisable to have a truant officer appointed, if the matter was likely to need much attention. The principle offenders appeared to be the children of Campbell SHINGOOS, John PELLY, George Bell COPE, Victor SHINGOOS, James SHINGOOS, Roy SHITSHAW and Allan FIDDLER, all twenty Indians.\n\nHeavy rains on this date made it impossible to travel the reserve trails by car, and it was decided that it would probably suffice at the moment, if I contacted the teacher in question, and warned what students that happened to be in attendance this date as to their future behaviour. I found only six students in attendance at the school, and Miss ROBERTSON the teacher, advised that the attendance of all had been very poor in the past. She considered however that the extremely wet day would no doubt account for the absence of many of the children.\n\nI warned the children, present, as to the consequences of truancy, and that police action would result if the truancy continued. The teacher intimated that she believed that the warning so given, would probably have the desired effect for a time at least, and that she would again take the matter up with the Indian Agent, if the truancy continued.\n\nI advised Mr. BRYANT of the action, taken and it was decided to take no further action this date. Should further complaints of this nature arise, warnings in writing will be given the various parents. The writer would respectfully request that this subject be taken up with the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, with a view to having a truant officer appointed for the Cote reserve district.

Miss Banfill arrived to act as missionary at Cote, but expected to do missionary work only, so did not stay. In the meantime Miss Robertson is doing her best to carry on with what help she can get. There is a large attendance at school and the noon day meal is somewhat of a problem.\n\nJ.L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent.\nSchools\n\nDue to the man power shortage it has been necessary to get along as best we could with available teachers in our day schools, staffed by one of the church missions as they are. The first concern of the church mission is to supply a missionary, generally some one is chosen who is not much success in a parish and little thought is given to his or her ability as a teacher, and in most cases they have had no teacher experience and are anything but a success at the job. Under the present set up I doubt if we can ever hope to get the results that we should normally expect, and it is unfortunate for the children that spend several years at these schools seeking an education.\n\nJ.L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent.\nI beg to submit herewith a report on the affairs of this Agency, for the quarter ending June 30th, 1946.\n\nEDUCATION:\n\nMiss Robertson of Cot Bay School has returned to her home and I understand will not return. She is a very fine woman and certainly did not spare herself trying to manage a very heavy school. However she has been in poor health and latterly the children became very difficult for her to handle, infact they were almost out of hand entirely. In the appointment of a successor I think we should insist on a male teacher, as I do not think there would be a bit of use sending another woman teacher for this difficult school. There is also to be a change at Key Bay school, and here again I hope we can have someone appointed that really knows something about teaching and the handling of Indian children. Nothing definite has been done about starting day school at Valley River. We may have to use some of the new catholic church for this purpose until we can build a school at a rental of $40.00 per month, but here again I would not recommend starting a day school there unless we can be assured that a male teacher that has some experience can be supplied for that point.\n\nSt Philips Residential school has built an addition to the present school and will be able to accommodate more pupils this coming term. This school is well managed, children are happy and on the whole parents are satisfied with the results.\n\nJ.L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 16, 1946.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI am advised by Indian Agent Bryant that Miss Robertson does not intend to return to duty at the Cote Indian Day School for the academic year 1946-47. The Agent states that she did good work but that recently she has not been enjoying good health.\n\nIf it is at all possible, we would like to have a male teacher at this school, as the Agent states that the children require more discipline.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

As soon as Mrs. Loveys get back, I shall see that you have the information for your files.\n\nIn the meantime, I shall be glad to know if you will confirm these nominations with this sketchy information.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) G.

She is a diabetic and has not enjoyed the best of health the latter part of the term. She is now in the Hospital at Moose Jaw with orders to reduce 30 pounds and remain on a diet. Miss Johnston is well qualified and can manage very well when enjoying good health.\n\nX X X X\n\nJ. L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent.\n\nCopied:\nCS\nExtract from letter from Inspector Ostrander, dated November 4, 1947. Original on 117-5-1\n\nThe attendance at the Key's and Cote Day Schools was very unsatisfactory. That of the Key's School was 70.23%, and that of the Cote School 58.95%. The Key's School, with 26 on the roll, had an average daily attendance of 18.26. The Cote School, with 44 on the roll, had an average daily attendance of 25.94. I pointed this out to Indian Agent Mr. J.L. Bryant, and the teachers concerned, and drew the attention of Mr. Bryant to the fact that Family Allowances payments should be stopped in many instances. Mr. Bryant is to immediately warn the parents that failure to greatly improve the attendance will result in loss of Family Allowances payments, and possibly prosecution. Aside from the matter of attendance I feel that very little is being accomplished at either the Cote Day School or the Key's Day School, and I do not consider the teachers concerned are giving the service which we are entitled to expect.\nKamsack, Saskatchewan,\nDecember 1st, 1947.\n\nBernard F. Neary Esq.,\nSuperintendent,\nWelfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Cote Day School.\n\nWhen making up the 1948-49 estimates I neglected to include an extra class room and another teacher for Cote Day School. There are 45 pupils on the roll this term and this will probable increase by at least another 10 next year.\n\nThere were 36 at school today, I am sure you will agree that even this number is more than enough for one teacher to properly handle and that two teachers are required to do justice to the children and teachers. As an emergency measure the large dining room could be used as a class room for the little tots but eventually another class room should be added to the present structure. I trust that these items may still be included in the 1948-1949 estimates.\n\nJ. L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 5, 1947.\n\nMr. J.L. Bryant, Indian Agent,\nKamsack, Saskatchewan.\n\nWe have your letter of the 1st instant in which you point out that it will be necessary to operate a second class room at the Cote Day School next year.\n\nOur estimates for the fiscal year 1948-49 have already been submitted to the Minister's office and it is not possible to increase them at the present time.\n\nYou might communicate with us again about April 1st, 1948 and you should state at that time what provision you consider can be made for another class room at the Cote School.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nOttawa, December 12, 1947.\n\nMr. J. L. Bryant, Indian Agent,\nKamsack, Saskatchewan.\n\nCote Indian Day School\n\nIn his report dated December 1, 1947, Mr. J. P. Gorczy\u0144ski, School Inspector, makes the following comments concerning the above school:\n\n\"The minimum essentials of the curriculum are being adequately covered. The lessons are well prepared and effectively administered. The work in arithmetic is being presented in a simplified and meaningful form. The same psychologically sound method is employed in the presentation of other subjects in the course of study. The writing, reading, spelling, health and social studies receive additional emphasis.\n\n\"The library in this school is inadequate. A greater variety of simple and well illustrated reading material should be provided. Since the interests of the Indian children are somewhat different from their so-called white neighbors, the development of reading habits presents a problem and a challenge to the teacher.\n\n\"Hot noon lunches are being served in the school free of charge to the pupils. The allowance for noon meal made by the Department is absolutely insufficient. I would strongly suggest the increase in this allowance.\n\n\"The classroom is too overcrowded. It is strongly suggested that an additional classroom be provided for grades I and II class. It is absolutely impossible to do justice in this overcrowded classroom.\n\n\"Miss Johnson is continuing to give you good service.\"\nYou will recall that in the June issue of the Bulletin we published a long list of books selected from the supplementary reading lists of the various provincial departments of Education and which we had purchased for use in our Indian schools.\n\nA search of our files indicates that we have no record of Miss Johnson ever having requisitioned for these books. Would you please bring this matter to her attention.\n\nThe provision of an extra classroom at this school has already been the subject of a letter dated December 5. It is to be hoped that the average attendance at this school remains high so that we can present a convincing argument for the addition of an extra classroom.\n\nBernard F.

This arises from the fact that beginning September 1st, last, a new teacher and a new matron were placed in charge of the Cote School. In computing salaries for the September quarter for new teachers the Department has been accustomed to pay on the basis which the number of days taught during that quarter bears to number of days in the school year. In the cases of Miss Sinclair and Mrs. McMillan the return showed that they were in charge for 17 days in the September quarter and, accordingly, the former was allowed 17/200 of $700.00, or, $63.75, and the latter 17/200 of $600.00, or, $51.00.\n\nAs the school year ends on June 30th, the Department has always made the necessary adjustments at that time and paid any arrears in salary that might be due. In the present case the balance of $222.75 would have been paid in June next.\n\nFor your information I enclose copy of the Indian Day School Regulations showing the procedure adopted. However, as possibly the Woman's Missionary Society desire this amount in order to close their books for the year 1921, a cheque for the balance due is being sent now instead of in June next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

Lawrence for assistance during the absence of a teacher.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mrs. Roy was anxious to try to keep the class-room open until a teacher could be appointed in the place of Miss Crockett, who was confined to hospital. She therefore decided that she would teach in the class-room, and to do so, it was necessary to have assistance in the preparation of meals, and the care of the sleeping quarters. I informed her of the contents of your letter of the 12th November, number 117-2-1, and particularly the last sentence thereof, but she still wished to continue with her intention to keep the class-room open and engaged Miss Lawrence to assist her. I did not give authority for this, but informed Mrs. Roy, after she had paid Miss Lawrence, that I would forward the receipt to the Department for consideration.\n\nI was aware that Miss Lawrence was at the school for the week ending 23rd November, but made no arrangement for her payment. However, Mrs. Roy paid her for 5 days @ $1.50 per day and it seems only fair that she should be reimbursed as her intentions were for the best interest of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.F.B.

O., Sask., Nov. 30th, 1914\n\nDear Mr. Scott,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of October 1st, and other official correspondence with regard to the subject of a combination Day and Boarding school for Cote Reserve.\n\nI am sending herewith a sketch of a proposed school, which has been prepared with great attention to details, and I think if this plan is followed it will suit our requirements. A school of this kind has been in my mind for a long time. Rev. Dr. Grant who was here yesterday looked over the plans and was well pleased with them.\n\nYou will notice that the building is to be heated with hot air, as this system is far more easily managed. Experience at File Hills school and elsewhere has led me to decide that for a building of this kind hot air is the most suitable.\n\nThe plumbing is worked out to meet all requirements allowing ample closets and bath-rooms.\n\nI would draw your attention to the fact that the building is only 48' X 54' and still it provides room for 16 or 18 regular\n\nDuncan G. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nregular boarders, for a married Principal (who should be teacher as well) and two of a staff. The dining-room and kitchen are large enough to provide for the additional pupils at the mid-day meal.\n\nI am strongly of the opinion that the Principals of our Boarding schools should live in the building in order to look after the morals of the pupils and I have therefore provided quarters for the Principal in the building and am not sending a plan for an additional residence. Another reason for having the Principal living in the school proper is that as a Boarding school the grant earning power is extremely small and will not warrant keeping up a separate establishment.\n\nThe class-room should be a separate building similar to the one at File Hills. As you have plans of this in Ottawa, it will not be necessary to send a sketch.\n\nI have tried to get away from the costly boarding school and at the same time provide a school that will meet all requirements on Cote reserve. All that will be necessary in the way of a staff will be a Principal (teacher also), a cook and a matron.\n\nThe cost of this building will be between twelve and fifteen thousand dollars.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nAspr. of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, December 10, 1914.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo in reference to Cote combined Boarding and Day school, also the sketches showing what you consider necessary for a school of this class. You have undoubtedly given the preparation of this plan considerable thought, and this should be of assistance in the preparation of the completed plan when we are in a position to undertake the erection of the building.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nF. H. Graham, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nOttawa, March 10, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that blue prints of the preliminary plans prepared for the combined Boarding and Day school, Cote Reserve, Sask., are being sent you by concurrent mail.\n\nPlans have been prepared from the sketch sent in by you, but include other arrangements which are necessary to fully comply with Departmental regulations for boarding schools. The building will be heated with steam as it is impossible to do satisfactorily with hot air furnaces, owing to the number of pipes which would have to be carried to the several parts of the building.\n\nThe accommodation provided in dormitories is for 12 boys and 12 girls, and class-room for 56 pupils, which can be increased if necessary. The other accommodations provided will fully meet requirements.\n\nShould it be necessary to provide for more dormitory accommodation by a slight re-arrangement in the plans, accommodation can be provided for 40 pupils.\n\nYou are requested to give the plans consideration and return to the department with your criticism thereon as soon as possible when the plans will be completed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAss't Deputy and Secretary,\nBalgonie, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6281, file 604-5, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter above quoted, which remained unanswered until I had made a visit to Pelly, where I wished to get further information regarding the number of children that would likely attend the school it is proposed to build on Cote Reserve.\n\nAs you are aware, the Indians on Cote Reserve want a day school, and as I understand it, we are meeting their wishes half way by giving them a combination day and boarding school, that is to be managed by the Presbyterian church, on the per capita grant system. A school, such as we propose, will, at best, have only half the earning power a boarding school would have. It is therefore necessary to make the buildings as compact as possible, so as to run it with the least possible number of staff. So far as I can see at present we cannot hope to get more than 16 boarders and if I am right, it seems to me we might be able to curtail the building in some respects. Take the matter of infirmaries, do you not think that one room would answer the purpose?\n\nFrom past experience at File Hills and other points, the space set aside for this purpose almost seems lost, as it is very rarely used. With the few children who will be living in\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nthis school the necessity for such space will be correspondingly less and the chances are that boys and girls will not be sick at the same time. If only one room can be set aside it will mean something.\n\nAs the Principal will have to live in the building and will be a married man with possibly two children, I think a re-arrangement of the front rooms would be a great advantage. I think that on the right of the main entrance there should be two bed-rooms with closets and entrance between them, rooms, and the present sewing-room, which need not be very large, moved over to the left hand side to take the place of the corner bed-room.\n\nGround Floor:- I think it would be wise in view of the limited number of the staff to make the matter of supervision as easy as possible, and would suggest that the main passage be divided by a partition with a door; this would insure the complete separation of the boys and girls and would not necessitate a member of the staff being in constant attendance. In this matter we cannot be too particular, as we have had a great deal of trouble with boys and girls getting into each other's quarters, and now that we are putting up a government building, we should, if possible, make it so that this trouble can be avoided.\n\nAs the earning capacity of this school will be less than half what it is at the present Crowstand school, the staff must be just half what it is at present and if you can re-arrange the plan, doing away with one infirmary and making the dormitories much smaller, it\nit would fill our requirements. Of course, if it were a boarding school we are going to build, we could add a few feet to the present plan and have a perfect building. But the Indians are pressing for a day school and all the accommodation we need is for sixteen children.\n\nThe staff accommodation as it now stands appears to be ample.\n\nWhen it is decided to build great care should be taken as to the location of the building.\n\nI would judge from the plans that there is to be no underground basement. Everything apparently is above ground. I presume the Department has its own reasons for having it done this way, but I have never seen a building of this kind without a basement.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, April 15, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant and answer to Department's enquiry concerning the proposed combined boarding and day school plans for the Cote Reserve, and in reply to say that in the opinion of the Department a school cannot be carried on successfully with 16 pupils, and with 24 pupils for which dormitory accommodation has been provided only by the strictest economy. With respect to the Isolation Infirmary to which you refer particularly, these are necessary even if never used, as it is of the utmost importance that cases of infection, if such occur, should at once be isolated to prevent the danger of contagion to the balance of the school.\n\nThe size of the building is determined to a great extent by the dormitory accommodation and that required in the basement, and even if one of the Infiraries was omitted, the size of the building could not be diminished to any appreciable extent, providing for actual requirements.\n\nIf 16 pupils only are available on the Cote reserve and none from other sources for this school, it is for the Department to consider if an improved day school only, with provision for residence and children's dining-room would not be more advisable than the combined boarding and day school. I have, therefore, to request that you will favour me with your opinion on this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6281, file 604-5, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter above quoted concerning the plans of the proposed Boarding and Day school at Cote Reserve.\n\nThe Indians of this reserve have been pressing for a Day school for a long time and have been led to believe that they would get one some day. The idea of a combination Day and Boarding school was suggested by the Presbyterian Church officers, and I am sure they had no idea of having such an elaborate building as the one for which you submitted plans. I must confess I was surprised when I saw them and the first idea that struck me was that we would be building a Boarding school and not a small combination school.\n\nThe plan I submitted was, in my opinion, too elaborate, if anything, but when I saw your plans, with additional rooms, extensive water system and extra bath-room I at once felt that the school could not be run on the grant from 12 or 16 pupils even with the additional Church grant.\n\nI feel sure that on Cote's reserve there will not be sixteen Boarders, as the members of the Band are determined to have their children at home, but if we should have, say 14 Boarders, it seems to me that there ought to be some kind of a building that could be made to meet the requirements at very little cost.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\ncost. There are lots of private dwellings in this country with ten or twelve children in them and I am satisfied these children are as well looked after as we would expect our Indian pupils to be.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your letter it would appear that your idea is that we might be able to get pupils from other reserves as boarders. If we did this we would be going back to the Boarding school system, but I doubt if you could get them. If the Department cannot figure out a smaller and simpler building for housing 16 children, I would suggest that an improved Day school be built. If will meet with the Indians' approval, but I doubt if the Church would like it.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInsp. of Indian Agencies.\nDear Sir,\n\nSome time ago I was informed that the Department had not yet fully decided to go on with the building of the Semi-boarding and Day School on Cote's Reserve this year. Would you kindly let me know now if a final decision has yet been arrived at in this matter. There are several things which are waiting for this final decision and it would accommodate us very much to know exactly what we may expect this year.\n\nHoping to receive from you a favourable reply as to the building being proceeded with at an early date, I Am,\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nRev. W. McWhinney\n\nTo The Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Can.\nOttawa, May 29, 1915.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant in reference to the building of a combined Day and Boarding School at Cote reserve, and in reply to inform you that the Department has decided to erect an Improved Day School, as it is apparent that a Boarding School cannot be financed with number of pupils obtainable there. The Rev. A.S. Grant, D.D., the Superintendent of Board of Home Missions for the Presbyterian Church in Canada, will no doubt communicate with you direct as to the Church's decision in the matter.\n\nIt is proposed to undertake the erection of the Day School as soon as the plans and specifications have been completed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

After the purchase of the above supplies has been made, you should forward an itemized account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nWith reference to the request for table oilcloth and kitchen linoleum, please report whether you consider this equipment to be absolutely necessary. I might say that our funds are extremely limited, and it is necessary that all expenditure be kept as low as possible and only the most necessary supplies furnished. If you consider that the oilcloth and linoleum are absolutely necessary, you should give an estimate of the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE.A.W.R.

Linoleum will be much more permanent. With regard to the oilcloth for the tables this will cost in the neighborhood of 45\u00a2 per yard and would suggest that another time this needs renewing to cover these tables with veneer and paint them which would be permanent except possibly a coat of paint once per year. While the expenditure would be out of the question this year I have however inquired into the cost which for veneer, placing and paint would cost in the neighborhood of $3.50 per table, the oilcloth of course is only around $1.50 but requires renewing each year.\n\nIn view of the necessity of both these may I have your authority to purchase the table oilcloth and linoleum, also your advice as to whether an item covering the cost of veneer and paint for this purpose should be placed in the estimates this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is noted the cost will be approximately $19. You may also purchase the quantity of table oilcloth required for the tables. This material, while serviceable, should be purchased as cheaply as possible.

I have, therefore, to request that you will state the number of children who are resident in the school from Monday morning to Friday night. You should also state the distance from their homes to the school and if it would not be possible for them to reside at home and attend the school each day as day pupils. If it is not possible for them to travel to and from the school each day, you might state if arrangements could not be made to have them sent to either the Brandon or File Hills Indian Residential Schools. It is found that during the last school year the sum of approximately $200 was expended in the purchase of supplies for meals. We will be unable to provide this amount for the present school year. Please state the minimum amount per month which you consider would be required in the purchase of supplies for the noonday meal for the day pupils; also for the resident pupils, if it is necessary that the present arrangements for these latter pupils be continued. I shall be pleased to have, at an early date, as complete a report from you as possible regarding the continuing of the present arrangements and also as to the above suggestion that the pupils who are too far away to attend school each day be placed in a residential school.\n\nIn the meantime, you may arrange for the purchase of the quantity of food supplies considered absolutely necessary for the present month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

The expenditure of $200 during the past year for food supplies was too great and must be reduced.\n2. It was asked if the pupils who have been boarding in the school from Monday until Friday could not go home each night and return in the morning.\n3. It was also asked if these pupils could not be transferred to the boarding schools at File Hills or Brandon.\n\nNow as supervisor of this school for The United Church of Canada I would urge that there be no reduction in the necessary supplies for the Cote School in order to provide fittingly for the few pupils who lodge and board there from Monday until Friday. Also while we do not object to pupils being transferred to these boarding schools if the parents so desire, we do not think any undue pressure should be brought to bear to bring this about.\n\nThere has been, I think considerable change of late years in the officials of the Department and perhaps you are not aware of the conditions and the understanding under which the Cote school was built in 1915. At that time the Presbyterian Church agreed to the closing of the Crowstand Boarding School which had previously supplied educational facilities to these reserves, with the understanding that a semi-boarding and day school would be erected on the reserve. The plans for such a school were drawn but suddenly the Department decided instead to build an improved day school. From 1916 until 1928 this was conducted as a simple day school where the pupils received a warm mid-day meal. At that time the Department erected the St Philips Boarding School five miles away and at once the Roman Catholic Church began to encroach and try to entice the pupils from our day school. To secure a small degree of equality of school opportunity we secured the consent of the Department to board several pupils, from a distance, from Monday till Friday. I urged that we be given additional lodging accommodation but was refused. The injustice of the situation lay in the fact that a large and costly boarding school was erected for one Church and the other was refused the expenditure of a few hundred dollars to provide for the needs of a few pupils who were too far away to attend as day pupils. Since then we have been utilizing some extra space to accommodate not more than five or six pupils. Last year and now there are only three or four. It costs the Department $150 to $160 to maintain a pupil in a boarding school. I ask you is it reasonable to object to an expenditure of something like $200 to maintain three or four pupils for the year. I am heartily in accord with any effort to save money where it can be saved without inflicting hardship but the Cote school is not the place to cut down expenses. The matron makes good use of all the supplies received and there should be no curtailment. Further, these pupils live too far away to allow them to attend merely as day pupils.\n\nCommending these matter to your consideration, I Am,\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6281, file 604-5, part 4)\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter No.117-2-5 of the 8th inst., regarding supplies for the Cote Day School, I beg to advise that at present there are only two resident pupils there, both from the Keeskonse reserve, nine miles distant. The Protestant families on that reserve raise an objection to sending their children to File Hills when there is a boarding school, (St. Philips, R.C.) on their reserve. If we had any way of forcing them to send their children away, there would be no need of boarding any pupils at the Cote School during the week, except for the noon day meal. This was the very reason for keeping resident pupils at Cote as the Indians there who were protestants turned R.C. rather than send their children away and these people are still of the same opinion. I would much prefer to see resident pupils not kept at the Cote School as they haven't proper facilities there to do so, but run into this same objection by the parents as soon as they are approached regarding sending them to File Hills.\n\nIn working out on a per capita basis the amount of the supplies for meals $200, for last year, it cost less than 5\u00a2 per capita for these supplies per day, so it could not be lowered unless we were to dispense with the noon day meal entirely, and also the resident pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6281, file 604-5, part 4)\nOttawa, September 24, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, regarding the food supplies required for the midday meal and for the resident pupils at the Cote Improved Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, in view of your report and also that of Mr. Agent McKenzie, the Department will approve of continuing the supplying of food of the same type as furnished last year. Mr. McKenzie is being informed accordingly, and requested to arrange for the purchase of the supplies considered absolutely necessary and to keep all costs as low as possible. At the present time he states there are only two resident pupils, and, if this number does not increase, the cost of the supplies should be considerably lower than last year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

McWhinney,\nKamsack, Sask.\nOttawa, September 24, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, with reference to the food supplies for the noonday meal and for the resident pupils at the Cote Improved Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department has received a communication from Rev. W. McWhinney, Supervisor of this school for the United Church of Canada, urging that there be no reduction in the supplies for the few pupils who board at the school from Monday until Friday and for the regular midday meal to the pupils. As the Indian parents refuse to allow their children to be sent to the File Hills Residential School, it is considered that the providing of supplies should be continued, and you may arrange for the purchase, from time to time, of the various food supplies as formerly purchased. It is noted that at the present time there are only two resident pupils. It should, therefore, not be necessary to incur as large an expenditure as last year. The Department will rely on you to see that only the supplies considered absolutely necessary should be furnished and that all costs be kept as low as possible. The above authorization is for the present academic year ending June 30th, next, only.\n\nItemized accounts, in triplicate, properly certified by you, should be forwarded for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.A.W.R.

Please advise to what schools this flour is being supplied. You should, also, state if this flour has already been sent to any school or schools or is it kept in the agency warehouse and supplied as required.\n\nIn replying, you might also let me know the number of children who are now being kept in residence at the Cote's Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

McKenzie Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe heating plant Cote Indian School\n\nIn accordance with your request, I beg to report that on April 25th last I made a thorough examination of the above heating plant and find as follows:\n\n1. The cast iron fire box of furnace is cracked in several places, these cracks have opened to the extent of half an inch and in rear end there are several pieces of casting on the point of falling out, in fact if the wood used for firing is not carefully placed in fire box, the end would be completely knocked out in a short time. The openings in fire box also create a continuous fire hazard as the suction of the air circulating through the warm air passages will tend to draw the sparks from the fire box and deliver them through the hot air registers into the rooms above.\n\n2. The grates in the fire box are also burned out.\n\n3. The brick work around the top and at the front of furnace is cracked and in several places has fallen out, the joints in the radiator drums also require to be cemented with furnace cement and one direct draft damper installed.\n\nI might add that this furnace was overhauled and reinstalled in 1923 and the ten years service since has completely burned out the fire box and other parts which cannot be replaced as this furnace is obsolete and it is impossible to procure any repairs except grates, consequently it will be impossible to begin another winters firing with the furnace in this condition, in fact it is nothing short of a miracle that there has not already been a fire.\n\nIt has also been reported to me that the distribution of hot air in the building is very unsatisfactory as notwithstanding a strong fire it is impossible to heat that part of the building exposed to the wind and it would not be advisable to replace the present furnace with one of the same type and installed under similar con-\nE.A.W.R. McKenzie, Indian Agent.\n\nditions as this will not improve the distribution of hot air and would recommend that a steam heating plant be installed as it will then be possible to place the heat where it will be most effective and not be affected by winds.\n\nI would be pleased to submit estimate of cost for installing same\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6281, file 604-5, part 4)\nKamsack, Sask.\n\n17th May, 1933\n\nNo. 14.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise that following up a report of the Matron at the Cote School that when she lights a fire in the furnace it filled the whole of the building with smoke, I examined the furnace and also had Mr. Soeder of Kamsack examine the furnace and pipes and enclose herewith his report on the present condition of the heating plant at the school.\n\nThere is no need of the furnace at present but with the previous repairs asked for it is found that it would be more or less a useless expenditure as even then the fire hazard could not be overcome owing to the condition of the present fire box.\n\nThe question of steam heat was gone into about two years ago but at that time the fire box had not broken down or the brick covering given way as at present.\n\nCan some change of this heating plant be carried out during the summer holidays as otherwise the question of heating the building will be impossible?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6281, file 604-5, part 4)\nOttawa, May 23, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, regarding the condition of the furnace at the Cote Indian Day School and enclosing the report of the plumbing contractor who examined the heating plant.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to your letter of the third ultimo, with reference to repairs which would be required to place this furnace in a serviceable condition for the coming winter. I may say that our funds are extremely limited, and, as no special provision was made in the Estimates for the supplying of a new furnace, it will be possible to authorize only the repairs that are absolutely necessary at the present time.\n\nThe installing of a steam heating plant, to replace the present hot air system, would entail too large an expenditure to be considered at present. It is hoped that, with no large expense, the present furnace can be repaired and made satisfactory for another winter's use. I would request that you furnish an estimate of the cost of renewing the grates, taking down the brick work around the furnace and replacing with new mortar, supplying three lengths of hot air pipes and having the furnace door welded.\n\nYour early attention and report, giving details as to cost, is requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE.A.W.R. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter No.117-2-5 of the 13th inst., regarding 24 sacks Flour for schools, I beg to advise that Flour in that quantity is supplied to the Cote and Key Day Schools, in the undermentioned quantities:\n\nCote Day School 20\nKey Day School 4\n\nThe stock of Flour is carried in the warehouse at the Agency and Keys and issued to the schools as required. Up to date 4 sacks have been issued to the Cote Day School 1 sack to the Keys Day School.\n\nAt the Cote Day School there are at present four pupils in residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\n*Polly Agency*\n\nTo: John Olahowski\n\n*Kamask, Sask.*\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| April | To 80 lbs beef @15\u00a2 | 12.00 |\n\n*Beef for noon day meal and resident pupils, Gota Bay School, April 1933.*\n\n*Auth: Department's letter No.117-2-5 dated September 24th, 1932.*\n\n---\n\n**AUDITED FOR PAYMENT**\n\n*May 26 1933*\n\n*ACCOUNTS BRANCH*\n\n*DEPT.

As soon as the fires were let out it was found that the repairs previously asked for would not place the furnace in a fit condition to use as the fire box is now completely done.\n\nAlthough Mr. Soeder recommends steam heat to get a more even distribution of heat in the building would the Department consider another hot air furnace, our present pipes for hot air and registers could then be used. A furnace suitable would cost in the neighborhood of $300.\n\nAn estimate of the cost of the former repairs asked for would be about $45, but then there is no fire box to build from, or rather the present one is completely done, the details of repairs asked for is as follows:\n\nRenewing grates Est. cost $20.\nLabour brick work 15.\nNew brick and lime 7.\nWelding door 5.\n\nThese however are of no use unless there is a fire box.\n\nIf it is impossible to furnish a new type hot air furnace could the matter of the heating plant be referred to Mr. Murison on his next visit as the furnace will not be required until the Fall?\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 19, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has had recent correspondence with Mr. Agent McKenzie, Kamsack, Sask., regarding the heating equipment at the Cote Indian Day School. He states that the present hot air furnace is practically beyond repair and that it is necessary to install a new one. He reports that the cost of a new hot air furnace, using the present pipes for hot air and registers, would be approximately $300.\n\nOwing to recent orders for a reduction in the Appropriation, it is doubtful if the Department can provide funds to the above amount. No doubt, you will be in the Pelly agency in the near future, and I would request that you visit this school, inspect the present heating equipment and report what you would advise be done at the lowest possible expense in order to provide for the heating of the building during the coming winter. You should give consideration to repairing the present furnace, if possible to do so without large expense.\n\nI may say, for your information, that it will not be possible to provide food, etc., for the number of pupils who are kept in residence at this school from Monday to Friday in each school week. The keeping in residence of these children will have to be discontinued if it is intended that any part of the cost be provided by this Department.\n\nAny recommendation you make for the heating of this school for next winter will be considered. As stated, it is doubtful if we could provide funds to the amount of $300 for a new furnace.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nW. Munison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, June 19, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, regarding the installing of a new heating plant at the Cote Indian Day School and giving an estimate of the cost of a new hot air furnace, using the present pipes for hot air and registers.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department is referring this matter to Mr. Inspector Murison, asking him to report concerning the best means to provide heating for this school for the coming winter and at the lowest possible cost. Owing to recent orders for a further cut in the Appropriation, the Department is at present in doubt as to whether funds for the purpose of installing a new hot air furnace can be provided or not, and it may be that other arrangements for the heating of this school will have to be made for next winter. After Inspector Murison's report is received, consideration will be given as to what can be done to provide heating facilities for next winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nE.A.W.R. McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nOttawa, June 20th, 1933.\n\nSir,-\n\nIt has recently been found necessary to again reduce the Appropriation for Indian Education. Under these circumstances, it will not be possible to provide, during the academic year 1933-34, the funds required to supply food for those children who have been kept in residence at the Cote Indian Day School. Please inform those interested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActg. Secretary.\n\nE.A.W.R. McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nSir,\n\nFurther with reference to food supplies for Cote School and your letter No.117-2-5 of the 20th, ult., does this apply also to supplies which have been furnished in the past for the noon day meal at that school, as during the summer months there are only two to three resident pupils? All of the day pupils however have been given a noon day meal for several years. Does this also apply to the issue of flour rice and biscuits which we have on hand in the Agency warehouse for the Cote School?\n\nIf the meals are to be discontinued altogether there will be then no issue of these to the school, this would also apply to the meat issue from the butcher shop during the summer months.\n\nI have been asked these questions by the missionary in the field and as the letter is not clear as to whether all the meals are to be discontinued or only those pupils that are resident.\n\nMay I have your instructions so that I can pass the information on to the Rev.W.McWhinney?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs, Indian Agent,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 13th, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to food supplied to the Cote's Indian Day School.\n\nI note from your letter that, during the summer months, there are only two or three resident pupils. Please advise the Department why these pupils have to be kept at the school during the holiday period. Would it not be possible to return them to their parents?\n\nYou might, also, let me know the quantities of flour, rice and biscuits which you have in the agency warehouse for the Cote School.\n\nThe Department does not consider it necessary to issue meat during the summer months.\n\nOn receipt of your reply, the whole matter will receive further consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

We were not just clear as to whether this meant the cutting off of all food supplies or only those for the few boarding pupils who remain in the school from Monday till Friday.\n\nSince this same matter was under consideration about a year ago I would ask you to look up on your files my letter of September 14th 1932 and your reply of September 24th. This letter of mine, I think shows very clearly that the conditions under which the Cote School was established and the excellent work it has done since entitles it to special considerations. Further, it should be remembered that the action of the Department in erecting the St Philips School five miles away makes it imperative that no action be taken which would interfere with the Cote School meeting the needs of its proper constituency.\n\nIf these food supplies are cut off it means that a considerable number of these pupils would be transferred to residential schools. It should not be necessary for me to point out that these children are being educated in the Cote School in a much more economical way than they could be in a residential school where each would cost in the neighborhood of $150.00 per year. But if economy is the aim of the Department such action would mean increased rather than lessened expenditure.\n\nFor many years I have held that the policy of the Department should move towards the day school system replacing the residential schools and thus leading the Indian parents to assume a greater responsibility for the support and upbringing of their children. In a recent conversation with Honourable Mr. Murphy he quite agreed with me in this policy and asked me to write the Department in regard to the Cote School matter.\n\nI would therefore urge most strongly that there be no lessening of the providing of food supplies for the Cote School. At present the parents are bearing a goodly share of the support of their children and at the present time to attempt to lay any heavier burden upon them would lead to injury and not benefit. You can depend upon it that as supervisor of this School and Missionary on the Reserve I am each year exacting as much self-support as possible from the Indian parents. Such a gradual advance we hope some day will lead the Indian to assume the same responsibility as our own people.\n\nCommending this whole matter to your sympathetic consideration,\n\nI Am,\n\nYours Very Respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In connection with this matter, the Department is in receipt of a letter from Rev. W. McShinney.\n\nIt is found that during the academic year 1932-33 there was an expenditure of approximately $150 for food supplied the children at this school. Our funds this year have been reduced and, after considering the matter fully, it has been decided to allow a sum not exceeding $125 for the purchase of food at the Cote Day School during the academic year 1933-34. This amount is expected to cover not only the cost of food for those children who are kept in residence but also the cost of the midday meal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

In addition to this we have on hand:\n\n- 13 sacks of Flour\n- 50 lbs.

I however managed to gain access to the furnace room. I found that the condition of this furnace is very bad. As a matter of fact I consider it unsafe to have a fire placed in it. The cast iron fire box is burned out. It is cracked in several places at the sides and some of these cracks have opened nearly one half inch. There are openings at the rear of the furnace and several pieces of casing are on the point of falling out. A jar such as might easily happen by throwing a stick of wood in too far would knock the whole end of the furnace out. As it is, I could see plainly into the hot air chamber. These openings in the fire box create a continuous fire hazard, as the air circulating through the surrounding air passage will tend to draw the sparks from the fire box and deliver them through the hot air registers into the room above. In my opinion the fire box is beyond repair and unsafe for further use. A new furnace is, in my opinion, absolutely necessary if the school is to be continued. I would not take the responsibility of operating that school during the winter months until the heating equipment is put in order. The estimate of $300.00 is very reasonable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector,\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 24, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to your letter of June 14th, last, regarding the installation of a new heating plant at the Cote Indian Day School and giving an estimate of the cost of a new hot air furnace, using the present pipes for hot air and registers. In this connection I have to say that Mr. Inspector Murison, who recently visited this school, is of opinion that a new furnace is absolutely necessary. He states, further, that the estimate as submitted by you for the purchase and installation of a hot air furnace at a cost of $300 is very reasonable.\n\nI have to request, therefore, that you will arrange for the purchase and installation of a hot air furnace, of the capacity and type that would be satisfactory to heat the building and to be connected to the present pipes and registers. The business should be given to a firm on the approved list. If necessary, you may consult Mr. Inspector Murison regarding the purchase and the work in connection with the installation. You should see that a satisfactory job is completed and that the total cost is kept within your estimate, viz.: $300. I enclose an encumbrance certificate authorizing an expenditure to that amount. After the work has been completed, please forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost. You should state on each copy of the voucher that the expenditure was incurred under authority of R. R. No. 882.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nE.A.W.R.

This leaves a balance of $11.00 for the school's requirements in the food line to last until the end of the academic year, June 30th next. The school is going to experience difficulty in getting through until the holidays as they will be unable to purchase meat as well as other supplies on the balance.\n\nAt present the children are being fed on bread, potatoes and rice pudding.\n\nCould this be supplemented by meat being supplied until the school closes in June next?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs.\nKamsack, April 13th 1934.\n\nMr A. F. McKenzie,\nSecretary of Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nUnder date of August 4th last year I wrote you pointing out several important reasons why the appropriation for supplies to the Cote School should not be reduced. You replied saying that you were allowing $125.00 for supplies for the year 1933 and 34. But during the year certain other supplies than food such as soap etc. that were formerly supplied from the Agency have been cut off and these also had to be charged up against the $125. Then too the attendance at the Cote School has been larger during this year than the previous one when the allowance was $150. Hence at the present time with two months and a half yet to run before the end of the year there is only something like $11.00 left to provide for three or four boys in residence for five days of the week and provide for the mid day meal of about twenty-five other children. You will readily see what an impossible task you are placing upon the matron of the school and what a menace such curtailment of food means to these children. In a letter to Mr Agent McKenzie you suggest that meat should not be required for the children during the summer. Now if you consider that Indian children more than many others require a certain amount of meat in their diet in order that they be maintained in health, you will realize how unjust it would be to treat these children in this way. By the treaties made with the Indians the Government of Canada has placed itself under certain moral obligations, aside from the legal obligations, to educate the Indian children. In the residential schools provision is made not only for boarding them in a fitting manner but also for clothing them. Surely an Improved Day School should demand sufficient suitable food stuffs to give these children one satisfying meal during the day. I was Principal of a residential school for fourteen years and I have been supervisor under our Church of this Cote School for seventeen years, and I cannot see why children in a day school where the Indian parent bears the large part of their maintenance should not receive fair and reasonable treatment for one meal in the day.\n\nMrs Roy, the matron is careful in all her management. There is no waste but she has a mother heart and she should not be asked to set Indian children down to a meal of which she is ashamed. Furthermore these children cannot properly do their work in the class room if they are hungry. Such a condition is not creditable to the Government of this Dominion.\n\nInstead of crowding the day schools to the wall, it seems to me the policy of the Department should be to increase their efficiency to such an extent that in time they would to a great extent take the place of the much more costly residential schools.\n\nI am in thorough sympathy with every proper move towards economy but I am quite sure there are many other places where economy can be practised with much better results than in cutting down the already meagre allowance to this school. I would ask that Mr Agent McKenzie be notified at once to procure meat and such other supplies as are necessary to maintain the school properly to the end of the term.\n\nTrusting that this matter will meet with a favourable and sympathetic reception from you, I Am,\n\nYours Very Respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In addition to the expenditure mentioned, I am informed by departmental officials that biscuits, flour and rice have been supplied from agency stores.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nRev. W. McWhinney,\nKamsack,\nSask.\nMay 9th, 1934.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General:-\n\nI am returning Rev. Mr. McWhinney's letter of the 23rd ultimo.\n\nAt the Cote Indian Day School, there is an average attendance of approximately 25 children, and the Department has for many years found it difficult to satisfy the demands made by Mr. McWhinney. When it was necessary to reduce expenditures, department officials considered that $125 would be an adequate amount for midday meal purposes at this school for the academic year 1933-34. I find that, since last September, accounts have been submitted amounting to approximately $85. This means that some $30 can still be expended without exceeding the amount which the Department promised. I may add that, in addition to this expenditure, the school has been supplied with 800 pounds of biscuits, 13 sacks of flour, and 50 pounds of rice. Under these circumstances, I feel you will agree that the expenditure that has been authorized is fairly adequate.\n\nI am of the opinion that Mr. McWhinney's reason for urging increased expenditure for food supplies is partly due to the fact that, without the Department's approval, three or four children, whose parents live at a considerable distance from the school, are kept in residence at the Day School and, consequently, have to be supplied with all their meals.\n\nI trust that the attached letter will meet with your approval.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, May 11th, 1934.\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 13th ultimo, regarding the purchase of food for the Cote Indian Day School, I beg to say our records show that approximately $95.00 has been expended in the purchase of food since last September. You forwarded accounts for a larger amount than this, but these accounts included the cost of cleaning articles, such as soap, Ban Ami, etc. As you were authorized in official letter of August 8th, last, to expend an amount not exceeding $125.00 for food during the academic year 1933-34, you are therefore in a position to authorize a further expenditure of approximately $30.00.\n\nIn your letter of August 4th, last, you stated that you had on hand for the Cote School 900 lbs. of biscuits, 13 sacks of flour and 50 lbs. of rice. Please let me know if you have supplied these articles to the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE.A.W.R. McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise that the posts of the Cote school fence are completely done and require to be renewed, most of them are rotted at the ground and are being held in place by the wire, as there is almost sufficient wire posts only and top rails require to be renewed.\n\nThe following is approximately what would be required to put the fence in shape:\n\n- 155 posts 6 in. for 3 ft. pape wire estimated costs 12\u00bd\u00a2 ea. $19.38\n- 25 lbs.

The fire box has been repaired and now the oven is found to be giving way at the bottom which if repair would necessitate rebuilding the whole thing. The stove is of a type which has been discontinued and very hard to get even the necessary repairs at times for the fire box. If the high oven type and the whole oven would need to be replaced, the cost of which I would judge to be about half what a new range of the regular type would cost. This stove has been in bad shape for several years and has been placed in the estimates for that length of time but it has now reached such a condition that any repairs made can only be temporary as something else burns out shortly after. The range has been in use since 1915, 19 years of service which is about the length of time that any stove of that description will last.\n\nWhat they need is a regular six round range with the oven in the usual place which gives them that much more room on the top of the stove for cooking.

T. G. Murphy in regard to the amount of money allowed the Cote Day School for food supplies for the noon day meal and also for the maintenance of the five or six pupils who lodge and board at the school from Monday until Friday. I urged that for this academic year that at least $150.00 be allowed. Some time ago I was informed by the Indian Agent Mr McKenzie that only $125.00 had been allowed. Then more recently I was told that the supply of beef formerly supplied from the Agency stores was to be supplied no longer. Now I have understood that it was the policy of the Department to encourage the Day School form of Indian education to such an extent that some time in the future it would largely supplant the work done in the residential schools. If this is so I cannot understand why such treatment as referred to above is meted out to the Cote School which means trying to crowd it out of existence.\n\nI would therefore ask your attention to the following features in this matter:\n\n1. There are about thirty pupils to be given a mid-day meal and five pupils to be fed from Monday until Friday.\n2. Meat is an important item of diet for an Indian child and pupils in residential schools are supposed to have meat at least once a day.\n3. Owing to weather conditions the school potato crop was almost a failure and forty or fifty bushels of potatoes will have to be purchased out of the amount allowed for food.\n4. If these five pupils in residence from Monday until Friday were sent to a residential school it would cost the Department in per capita grant $750.\n5. Is this economy to force these children to a residential school?\n\nThe matron in the Cote School is exceedingly careful in the use of all supplies but surely it is not fair to ask her to do the impossible or to see these children underfed and their health suffer in consequence.\n\nFor about fifteen years I was principal of a residential school and for thirty-one years I have been missionary on this Reserve. For the past eighteen years I have been supervisor of the Cote School for the Women's Missionary Society and feel that I can speak with some authority in regard to the matter of the treatment of Indian children.\n\nI am in hearty sympathy with every effort of the Department along the lines of economy but it is a pity to see economy misplaced and I feel that this is decidedly the case in this matter of supplies for the Cote School.\n\nI would urge therefore that the school receive its supply of beef from the Agency stores as formerly and that the amount allowed for other supplies be increased from $125.00 to at least $150.00. Surely this is an insignificant amount in comparison with what is spent on the residential schools.\n\nTrusting that this matter will receive your sympathetic attention, I Am,\n\nYours Very Respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6281, file 604-5, part 4)\nOttawa, December 4, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to supplying food for those children who are kept in residence and also for midday meal purposes at the Cote Indian Day School, I beg to say that the Department is today in receipt of a letter from Rev. W. McWhinney stating that the amount provided is too small.\n\nIn official letter of September 7th, last, you were authorized to expend the same amount as last year, viz., $125. In view of the representations made by Mr. McWhinney, it has been decided to increase this amount by $25. This means that the sum of $150 will be expended during the academic year 1934-35 in the purchase of food for those children who are kept in residence and for the midday meal.\n\nAs your letter of September 10th, last, stated that you have a sufficient supply of biscuits on hand for the Cote School, the Department considers that the biscuits and the amount allowed, viz., $150, should be sufficient.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

For this I wish to thank you very sincerely. That $25 will mean very much to relieve anxiety about the proper feeding of these children, but I would respectfully ask you to reconsider the other request I made that the Agent be instructed to supply the necessary beef from the Agency stores as has been done for the past eighteen years. Perhaps you may think that this $25 should be used to meet that need, but you will perhaps know that in the past two or three years beans and rice and tea have been cut off from the supplies allowed this school. The tea, of course was for the staff and this is not important but the other two items are important. It will therefore take this $25 to supply these and other necessary supplies as well as the meat required from the spring until the end of June.\n\nI assure you I do not wish to appear importunate in my requests for I am asking only for that which I feel to be necessary for the proper maintenance of the best run day schools under the jurisdiction of the Department.\n\nMr. McKenzie tells me he can secure an animal for beef for about $15 and I would ask you to instruct him to do this and supply the beef to the Cote School, the same to be charged to the Department.\n\nTrusting that this request will meet with your approval, I Am,\n\nYours Very Respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In spite of that fact, the Department is allowing, this year, an increase of 20% over the amount allowed last year.

Dec. 28th 1934.\n\nMr A. F. McKenzie,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter of the 17th came to hand some days ago and I note that you say that since the estimates for the Department for the current year had been reduced and that you had made the increase from $125.00 to $150 for the maintenance of the Cote School you were of the opinion that you had dealt reasonably well with this School.\n\nNow with all due respect for the degree of familiarity which yourself and others in the Department have with the different Indian Schools permit me to say that since none of you have ever visited this School I do not think you fully understand the conditions and the very creditable work that is being done or you would not hesitate to grant very much more than I have been asking.\n\nSometimes I wonder if there is someone locally who is influencing your judgment in this matter or if there is an underlying desire and purpose to crowd out this school in order to give wider scope and opportunity to some boarding school. It does seem very strange that per capita grants of $150 are paid to boarding schools and here we are maintaining a school for $150 of a grant which cares for thirty children. Is it then asking too much when we ask for sufficient extra to buy a beef animal to supply beef to the children? Is it creditable to the Department that the matron has to send the boys out to snare rabbits to furnish the children of wards of the Government of Canada with a little meat?\n\nAs I said in my former letter I am in hearty sympathy with everything that makes for economy but there are right and wrong places for its exercise. I venture to say there is not an Agency in the West where many times fifteen dollars is spent in far less needful ways than in providing proper food for these children. When I say this I am speaking of that which I know to be fact.\n\nNow I hope you will not think I am over persistent in this matter but when I know positively that I am asking only for what is right and reasonable I shall not drop this matter until I have made every effort to have the Department see this business somewhat as I do. I hope however that the good sense of Hon. T. G. Murphy as well as the Deputy Minister and yourself will see that justice is done without continuing this correspondence any further.\n\nI Am,\n\nYours Very Respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The current had been supplied the school from the time that the Delco plant was first installed at the Agency, and I assumed that, as the Kamsack power was taking the place of the old Delco plant for the remainder of the lighting, and there was no further expense in connection with the installation, no additional authority was required in connection with the lighting of the school.\n\nIf it is not the intention of the Department to furnish light to this school it is only necessary to disconnect the wires.\n\nThe Department originally paid for the wiring of this school. In the Auditor General's Report for this Agency for the fiscal year 1929-30 there is a charge of $1850 for installing a Delco plant and $1000 of this was charged to the Education Vote, apparently referring to the Cote Day School as that is the year the plant was installed at the Agency and the day school wired.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.F.B.

The account should show the consumption and the rate, in order that the Department can compute the amount due.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit the following report of a visit which I made to the Cote Indian Day School in the Pelly Agency on the 14th instant.\n\nMiss Ruby M. Jamieson has been in charge of the classroom as teacher since November last. She has a First Class certificate for Saskatchewan. I was very favorably impressed with her. She appears capable, has good control over her pupils, and her class organization appears to be good and I consider her work is very satisfactory.\n\nThere were 23 Indian pupils present out of an enrollment of 27. In addition to these, two of the Indian Agents and three of the Farming Instructors children attend regularly. The attendance has been good during the present quarter, with the exception of the last week in January and the first week in February when an epidemic of influenza reduced it. Apart from these two weeks the daily attendance has been from 18 to 23, which is very good considering the unusually severe weather we have had since the New Year.\n\nI found the classroom clean and tidy. The children presented a healthy and clean appearance and they appeared to be warmly clothed.\n\nThis is what is called an Improved Day School. There is a matron in charge, Mrs. Roy, who prepares a mid-day meal for the Indian children. Mrs. Roy is a good housekeeper and takes an interest in the welfare of the children.\n\nI made an examination of the building and wish to draw the Department's attention to the condition of the basement foundation. It is very badly cracked and daylight can be seen through the cracks. The result is that, notwithstanding there is a hot air furnace in this basement, the temperature of the basement is below freezing point on the day of my visit. With conditions such as this you will understand that it is difficult to heat the building. An item has been placed in the Estimates for 1926-27 to cover the cost of repairing this basement wall and I would strongly recommend that the work be done during the coming summer. I consider this important, as at present it endangers the condition of the building as well as making it uncomfortable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 28, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your 310-11 of the 22nd instant, reporting on your recent visit to the Cote Indian Day School. The Department is pleased to note that the teacher, Miss Ruby M. Jamieson, is performing satisfactory services and that there is a good attendance of Indian children; also that they were healthy and warmly clothed. It is further noted that the matron, who prepares the midday meal for the pupils, takes an active interest in their welfare.\n\nRegarding the condition of the basement foundation, I have to say, for your information, that the following items are provided in our Estimates for the coming fiscal year for this school:\n\n(1) Rebuilding foundation and basement walls .. $200.00\n(2) Painting .. 250.00.\n\nAs recommended by you, this work could be done during the coming summer holidays, and I would request that either yourself or the local Indian Agent draw the matter to the attention of the Department, stating definitely the work that should be carried out, how you would propose that the labour be performed and the approximate cost of materials and labour.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

I have examined this cistern and I do not think it is worth repairing. It was made of galvanized iron about twenty years ago and the metal is about at the end of its usefulness. It is located close to the fuel chute and the outside entrance door, and as a consequence is in the coldest part of the basement. It should be on the other side of the furnace, where the basement is warmer and, to move it there, it would have to be taken down.\n\nI would recommend that a new cistern be made and placed in the proper location in the basement. The cost of material and labour would be about $50.00. This would include labour to make minor changes in the eaves-troughing, which would be necessary in changing the location of the cistern.\n\nAs you are aware, the water situation at this school is not good and, when there is no water stored in the cistern, it is necessary for all the washing water to be hauled from the river to the school, a distance of about half a mile. I would be glad if authority could be given me for this expenditure as soon as possible after the first of April, in order that the cistern can be completed in time to catch any early rain-fall.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 31, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 24th instant, the Department has provided in the Appropriation for the fiscal year 1936-37 an amount of $200 for rebuilding the foundation and basement walls of the Cote Bay School. On the recommendation of Inspector Murison, who visited this school on February 14th, it was decided not to proceed with this work until the summer holidays.\n\nIn addition to the amount stated above, we will have available another amount for painting, but it is not the Department's intention to do any exterior painting this year owing to lack of funds. Consequently, if the repairs to the foundation will cost more than $200, part of the money provided for painting could be used.\n\nIf you consider that any repairs that may be made to the foundation and basement walls during the summer holidays will not damage the new cistern, which you recommend be installed at once, you may proceed with the latter work. It is noted from your letter that the cost of the material and labour for the new cistern will be approximately $50.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nJ. P. B.
