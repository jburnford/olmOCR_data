BILLINGS, F.G.S.\n\nMONTREAL: DAWSON BROTHERS.\nLONDON, NEW YORK, AND PARIS: BAILLI\u00c8RE.\n\n1865.\nPREFACE.\n\nThe following work consists of descriptions of new species of organic remains from the Lower and Middle Silurian rocks, with re-descriptions, and, in some instances, additional details and illustrations of a few that were previously published either in the annual reports of the Survey or in the scientific journals of the Province. It has been prepared from time to time, according as the new forms were discovered, or as more perfect specimens of those already known were procured. The only systematic arrangement, therefore, that could be followed, was to group the descriptions together in a series of articles. The first portion, consisting of twenty-four pages, was issued in November, 1861,\u2014the second, pages 25 to 56, in January, 1862,\u2014the third, pages 57 to 168, in June, 1862,\u2014the fourth, pages 169 to 344, in February, 1865, while the remainder, completing the volume, will bear date herewith. The first twenty-four pages, and also 57 to 72, have been reprinted with some alterations, the substance of which is specified by Mr. Billings in the appendix on page 419. The figures were all drawn from nature by Mr. H. S. Smith, the artist of the Survey, and engraved on wood by Mr. J. H. Walker of this city.\n\nW. E. LOGAN.\n\nGeological Survey Office,\nMontreal, October, 1865.\nI. On some new or little-known species of Lower Silurian Fossils from the Potsdam Group (Primordial Zone). By E. Billings, F.G.S.\n\nThe fossiliferous rocks on the north shore of the Straits of Belle Isle, from which a portion of the species hereinafter described were procured, consist of the following in descending order:\n\n1. Limestones.\u2014Reddish and greenish-coloured limestone, varying in some places to grey, with some red and green shale. The fossils are Paleophycus incipiens, Archeocyathus Atlanticus, A. profundus, Obolus Labradoricus, Obolella chromatica, O.? cingulata, Olenellus Vermontana, O. Thompsoni, Conocephalites miser, Bathyurus parvulus, B. senectus, Salterella rugosa, S. pulchella, and S. obtusa. There are, besides these, two species of Orthis and one of Orthivina, and numerous fragments of trilobites, apparently of several undescribed forms. The thickness of these limestones is 141 feet.\n\n2. Sandstones.\u2014Grey, red and reddish-grey sandstones, the lower beds holding pebbles of white quartz from the size of a pea to one or two pounds in weight. The only fossil observed is Scolithus linearis. Thickness 231 feet.\n\nThese rocks rest upon the Laurentian, and their fossils show them to be of the age of the Potsdam group. They were examined by Mr. J. Richardson during the past summer.\n\nAnother exposure of rocks of the same age occurs about three miles east of Phillipsburgh in the County of Missisquoi, and extends south into the State of Vermont, where it is largely developed, and constitutes the Red sandrock of the geologists of that state. During several visits made to this exposure last summer, I could find no fossils on the Canadian side of the boundary-line, but several important localities occur in the immediate neighbourhood in Vermont. At one of these, 1\u00bd mile east of Swanton, a number of species have been found by the Rev. J. B. Perry and Dr. G. M. Hall of that town. These gentlemen are engaged in making a careful geological examination of the rocks and fossils of\n\n* The following twenty-four pages were reprinted in 1864. See Preface.\ntheir neighbourhood, and have requested me to describe the new species collected by them. At this locality *Palaeophycus incipiens*, *Obotella cingulata*, *Olenellus Vermontana* and *O. Thompsoni* occur in the black slates conformably interstratified with the sandstones and magnesian limestones which constitute the principal mass of the formation. It will be observed that several other species are also found here; but the prevailing forms are the four above mentioned, and, as they are most abundant in the limestones of the Straits of Belle Isle, there can be little doubt that the two deposits, although 860 miles distant from each other, are of the same age. The occurrence of *Scolithus linearis* and the general aspect of the fossils, also show that these rocks must be very nearly, if not exactly, in the same geological horizon with the Upper Primal sandstones and slates of Pennsylvania.\n\n**PLANT\u00c6.**\n\n*Scolithus linearis.* (Hall.)\n\n*Scolithus linearis.\u2014(Hall.) Pal., N. Y. Vol. I, Pl. I. Figs. 1, a, b, c.*\n\nThis species occurs at Anse au Loup in the sandstone, but I have not detected it in the limestone of that locality. The form differs from the one which is so common in the Potsdam sandstone of Canada in being larger and straighter. It is perfectly identical with that of the Upper Primal sandstone of Pennsylvania, and also with that of the Potsdam sandstone of Tennessee. (Formation III of Prof. Safford.)\n\n*Palaeophycus incipiens.* (N. sp.)\n\n**Description.**\u2014This species consists of elongated straight or slightly curved stems from half an inch to three-fourths of an inch in width. The transverse section is irregularly oval, with two acute edges, but it is probable that this flattened form is due to compression. Although numerous specimens lying in the rock were examined, no indication of branching was observed. The specimens are usually from four to six inches in length, but some are more than one foot. They occur abundantly on the surface of certain strata, and the specimens from Anse au Loup are perfectly identical with those which abound in the slates near Swanton in Vermont, holding *Conoccephalites*, *Olenellus Thompsoni*, *O. Vermontana*, &c.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Anse au Loup, on the north shore of the Straits of Belle Isle; sandstone of the Potsdam group.

(N. sp.)\n\nDescription.\u2014Stems cylindrical, from one to four lines in diameter, often crowded together in such abundance as to completely cover the surface of the rock. They lie across each other in every direction, and appear to be so interlaced that where very thick the same stem can seldom be traced for more than one inch in length. They are either straight or crooked, and sometimes present sudden slight enlargements of the diameter, giving them a somewhat nodulose aspect.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014One mile south of the boundary line, on the road leading from Moor\u2019s Corners in St. Armand to Saxe\u2019s Mills in Highgate, Vermont. In the thin beds of the Potsdam group. Red sandrock formation of Vermont.\n\nCollector.\u2014E. Billings.\n\nPROTOZOA.\n\nIn the limestone at Anse au Loup there are numerous fossils which from their radiated structure have the aspect of true corals, and yet in polished sections seem to possess the poriferous organization of sponges. I shall therefore leave it an open question as to which of the two divisions they should be referred. There appear to be two closely allied genera, but for the present I shall place all the species in one.\n\n[Since the above was written I have, in 1864, ascertained by treating a silicified specimen of A. Minganensis with acid that it contains numerous silicious spicula, and these fossils must, therefore, be classified among the extinct tribes of sponges.]\n\nGenus ARCHEOCYATHUS. (N. gen.)\n\nGeneric characters.\u2014Turbinate simple or aggregate; cup deep. The internal structure, so far as can be made out, consists of an inner wall constituting the inner surface of the cup, and an external wall or epitheca enveloping the whole. Between the two walls there are numerous radiating septa, the interseptal spaces being filled with poriferous or cellular tissue. It is highly probable that the inner wall is permeated by pores communicating with the interseptal tissue.\n\n[The radiating septa are, in A. profundus, perforated with small pores. The spicula found in A. Minganensis are slender, fusiform, slightly curved, acute at both extremities.]\n\nIn A. Atlanticus the radiated structure is not so well defined as it is in the others, but still it can be observed in the polished sections. In\n*A. profundus* the septa are well developed, and give to the fossil the aspect of a *Petraia* or *Zaphrentis*. It may be that these two species should be placed in different genera; but as there are numerous fragments of what appear to be intermediate forms, it would seem to be the better course to group them together in the first instance.\n\n**Archeocyathus profundus. (N. sp.)**\n\n*A. Minganensis*, pars, as published in 1861.\n\nFig. 1.\u2014The slender base of attachment. Fig. 2.\u2014A longitudinal section through the base of the cup of a worn specimen; \\(a\\), a transverse section of a fragment where the diameter of the cup is 3\u00bd inches, showing the radiating septa between the outer and inner walls. Fig. 3.\u2014A transverse section across the base below the bottom of the cup.\n\nFig. 4.\u2014Fragment of an individual which is 3\u00bd inches in diameter, showing the annulations and the septal striae.\nDescription.\u2014Elongate, turbinate, more or less curved, the basal one or two inches slender, then rapidly expanding to a diameter of from one to four inches, then becoming cylindrical. The form is that of a large *Cyathophyllum* or *Zaphrentis*. The cavity of the cup extends in depth nearly to the base. The radiating septa are thin and closely crowded together, there being eight or ten in the width of three lines. The surface is annulated by strong rough ridges from three to six lines distant from each other, the intervening furrows being two or three lines deep. The inner wall of the cup is exceedingly thin, apparently less than half a line.\n\nIn none of the specimens is the outer wall preserved except in spots, and there only partially. The large individuals appear to have attained a length of more than one foot with a diameter of from two to four inches.\n\nIn 1861 I referred this species to *A. Minganensis*, but further examination induces me to regard it as distinct. The latter is more deeply and distantly annulated, and, besides, it occurs in a higher geological position than does the former, having been found only in the Calciferous formation.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014Anse au Loup, on the north shore of the Straits of Belle Isle; limestone of the Potsdam group.\n\nCollector.\u2014J. Richardson.\n\n**Archeocyathus Atlanticus. (N. sp.)**\n\nFig. 5.\u2014*a*, a fragment of this species; *b*, a transverse section; *c*, a longitudinal section of the same.\nDescription.\u2014The only specimen of this species in the collection is a fragment four inches and a-half in length, fourteen lines in diameter at the larger and nine lines at the smaller extremity. Where the diameter is eleven lines the cavity of the cup is four and a-half lines across, and the space between the walls three lines. Of the radiating poriferous septa there are about sixty; they are so irregular that it is only in certain places in finely polished sections that the radiated structure can be detected. On one side where the specimen is weathered the structure presents the appearance of a rather compact cellular tissue. The form appears to be elongate conical, gradually tapering, the surface marked by wide shallow encircling oblique annulations, from three to six lines distant from each other. The outer wall does not seem to be poriferous, but this appearance may be due to the crystalline condition of the rock into which it is converted.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014Anse au Loup, on the north shore of the Straits of Belle Isle; limestone of the Potsdam group.\n\nCollector.\u2014J. Richardson.\n\nBRACHIOPODA.\n\nOBOLUS LABRADORICUS. (N. sp.)\n\nFig. 6.\n\nFig. 6.\u2014Dorsal valve of O. Labradoricus.\n\nDescription.\u2014Dorsal valve sub-circular, the hinge-line straight and equal to about three-fourths the width of the shell; rather strongly and uniformly convex, most prominent at one-fourth the length from the beak, the latter small, neatly pointed, scarcely distinct from the cardinal edge. Surface with fine concentric stri\u00e6, which converge slightly on approaching the cardinal edge 15 to 20 in one line, and also with a few coarser concentric undulations of growth, the whole crossed by minute radiating stri\u00e6 just visible to the naked eye. The shell is black and friable like that of a Lingula. Length, 5\u00bd lines; width, about 6 lines.\n\nVentral valve unknown.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014Anse au Loup, on the north shore of the Straits of Belle Isle. Limestone of the Potsdam group.\n\nCollector.\u2014J. Richardson.\nGenus Obolella. (N. gen.)\n\nGeneric characters.\u2014Shell ovate circular or sub-quadrate, convex or plano-convex. Ventral valve with a false area which is sometimes minute and usually grooved for the passage of the peduncle. Dorsal valve either with or without an area. Muscular impressions in the ventral valve four; one pair in front of the beak near the middle or in the upper half of the shell, and the others situated one on each side near the cardinal edge. Shell calcareous. Surface concentrically striated, sometimes with thin extended lamellose ridges.\n\nIn general form these shells somewhat resemble Obolus, but the arrangement of the muscular impressions is different. In Obolus the two central scars have their smaller extremities directed downwards, and converging towards each other; but in this genus the arrangement is exactly the reverse.\n\nThe three species in which I have seen the muscular impressions are the following:\n\n1.\u2014O. chromatica,\u2014hereinafter described. In this species the central muscular impressions are divergent below.\n\n2.\u2014A species which occurs in the well-known deposit of limestone near Troy in the State of New York. This is probably Avicula? desquamata. (Hall) (Pal. N. Y., vol. I, p. 292, plate lxxx, fig. 3.) In two specimens of this species which I have before me the scars are in the upper part of the valve and diverge below. The small scar on each side close to the margin is visible.\n\n3.\u2014A small species from the Potsdam sandstone of the St. Croix River in the Western States, where it occurs associated with the Primordial trilobites described by the late eminent geologist, Dale Owen. In this the central scars are close together, one on each side of the median line and parallel.\n\nThe genus appears to be closely allied to Obolus, but sufficiently different, on account of the disposition of the muscular impressions, to be classified as distinct therefrom.\n\nObolella chromatica. (N. sp.)\n\nFig. 7. Obolella chromatica.\u2014a. Ventral valve; b. dorsal; d. interior of one of the valves, supposed to be the ventral, showing the muscular impressions; c. outline restored from detached valves.\nDescription.\u2014Broad-oval, the rostral extremity obtusely pointed, front broadly rounded, greatest width a little below the middle; both valves rather strongly and uniformly convex, most tumid at about one third the length from the beak. Ventral valve more acute above than the dorsal, beak depressed below the greatest elevation of the shell, slightly elevated above the margin, with a small area beneath it which is inclined backward at an angle which varies from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. Dorsal valve with an obtusely rounded umbo, the beak scarcely distinct from the cardinal edge and not elevated above the margin. Surface with fine concentric striae or small minutely rugose ridges of growth of variable size, from 4 to 8 in one line, often smooth from exfoliation, or wearing. Colour of the shell in the reddish limestone a honey yellow, in grey limestone greyish; when exposed to the weather becomes white and minutely fibrous.\n\nLength and breadth about three lines.\n\nIn some specimens the ventral valve is depressed convex, the beak being on a level with the greatest elevation of the shell. The shell is thick and strong, and when well preserved, breaks with a granular fracture. When weathered, a tendency to fibrous exfoliation is manifested.\n\nThis species is closely allied to the form that is found so abundantly in the Troy limestone, but the muscular impressions in that one are rather closer together and nearer the beak. (At least they are so in the specimens in my possession.)\n\nMany of the specimens are a little more obtuse in the upper half than those figured. The individuals are exceedingly numerous and differ little in size.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014Anse au Loup, on the north shore of the Straits of Belle Isle. In limestone of the Potsdam group.\n\nCollector.\u2014J. Richardson.\n\n**Obolella (Kutorgina) cingulata. (N. sp.)**\n\nFig. 8.\u2014Ventral (?) valve of *O. cingulata*. Fig. 9.\u2014Cast of interior of ventral valve. Fig. 10.\u2014Dorsal (?) valve.\nDescription.\u2014Hinge-line straight, a little less than the greatest width of the shell; sides straight or slightly convex for about one half the length; anterior angles obtusely rounded; front margin either uniformly convex or with a small portion in the middle somewhat straight. Greatest width a little in front of the middle. Ventral valve strongly and uniformly convex, most tumid about the middle; beak depressed below the greatest convexity of the shell; cardinal edges straight or gently concave, diverging from the beak at an obtuse angle. Area unknown. Dorsal valve somewhat flat, most elevated at the beak, in front of which, along the middle of the shell, there is a wide shallow concavity extending to the front margin; on each side of the beak, descending with a somewhat flat slope to the cardinal angles; area unknown, apparently half the height of the ventral area and nearly at right angles to the plane of the margin. Beak erect, obtusely pointed, forming the most elevated part of the shell. Surface with strong concentric sub-lamellose ridges which do not converge to the beak but terminate on the cardinal edges, their course conforming to the margin of the shell. Four or five ridges in the width of one line.\n\nLength of largest dorsal valve seen \\(6\\frac{1}{2}\\) lines, greatest width 8 lines. Length of largest ventral valve in a straight line from back to front 7 lines, width 10 lines. The proportional length and width appear to vary. The apical angle of the ventral valve also varies, being in some specimens much more pointed at the beak than in the one above figured. Specimens of all sizes occur from 3 lines in width upwards.*\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014Anse au Loup, on the north shore of the Straits of Belle Isle. In limestone of the Potsdam group.\n\nAlso abundantly in the condition of casts 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) mile east of Swanton in Vermont.\n\nCollectors.\u2014J. Richardson, Dr. G. M. Hall, and Rev. J. B. Perry.\n\n* Since the above was written, I have examined many casts of the interior of this species, and am inclined to the opinion that it is generically distinct from *Oboeella chromatica*. From the very considerable elevation of the beak the dorsal valve must have an area and probably a foramen. In one specimen there are two large oval impressions faintly impressed, but still distinctly visible. There is no trace of the lateral scars; and the form, notwithstanding the characters of the surface, conveys the idea of an *Orthisina*. Should, upon further examination, my suspicions turn out to be well founded, I shall call the genus *Kutorgina*, after the celebrated European naturalist, Kutorga. It is not quite certain which is the ventral or which the dorsal valve.\nOrthisina festinata. (N. sp.)\n\nFig. 11.\u2014Ventral valve and side view of O. festinata. Fig. 12.\u2014Area of ventral valve. Fig. 13.\u2014Camerella antiquata.\n\nDescription.\u2014Subquadrate or semi-oval, hinge-line equal to the greatest width of the shell. Ventral valve sub-pyramidal, beak elevated, surface with a straight or slightly convex slope in all directions to the margin, area triangular, a little inclined backwards, foramen about as wide as high, closed by a convex deltidium which is perforated at the beak. Dorsal valve nearly flat. Surface with angular bifurcating ribs, five or six in the width of two lines at the margin, crossed by fine concentric striae, of which there are from seven to ten in one line.\n\nWidth on hinge-linge from 10 to 15 lines; length about a third less than the width. Height of beak of ventral valve from two to three lines.\n\nBoth valves show longitudinal undulations radiating from the beak to the margin.\n\nThis species closely resembles some of the ordinary forms of the genus, but differs internally from any known to me in the Second Fauna in the absence of the dental plates, no traces of which can be perceived in the casts.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u20141\u00bd mile east of Swanton in Vermont.

(N. sp.)\n\nFig. 13.\n\nDescription.\u2014Ovate or subcircular, beaks obtusely pointed (as seen in the cast), both valves moderately or rather strongly convex. Surface with from 8 to 10 small rounded ribs which do not reach quite to the beaks.\nSome of the specimens are proportionally more elongated than others. The front margin appears to be always broadly rounded, and the greatest width at about one-fourth the length from the front margin.\n\nLength from 4 to 6 lines; width either equal to or a little less than the length.\n\nThis species resembles *C. varians* of the Chazy, but is more numerously ribbed.\n\n**Locality and Formation.\u2014**1\u00bd mile east of Swanton, Vermont, in the Potsdam group.\n\n**Collectors.\u2014**Rev.

The neck furrow well defined all across; the glabellar furrows indistinct, the dorsal furrow is well defined all round the glabella. The cheeks are moderately tumid: a line drawn across the glabella about the mid-length would pass through the eyes. The distance of the eye from the dorsal furrow is equal to the greatest width of the glabella; the eye appears to be very small. The margin in front of the glabella is equal in width to about one-third the whole length of the head; it is bordered by an obtuse narrow elevated rim, just within which is a groove, which is more deeply impressed on each\nside than directly in front of the glabella, there being at this place a gently convex elevation resembling that which occurs in Barrande's species, *C. Sulzeri* and *C. coronatus*. The ocular ridge is well defined where the surface is preserved, but is rarely visible in the sandstone casts. Most of the specimens are distinctly carinate along the median line of the glabella.\n\nIt is possible that there may be a median tubercle on the neck segment, but none of our specimens have this part sufficiently well preserved to shew it.\n\nThe following are the dimensions of a specimen of the average size:\u2014\n\nLength of head 5 lines; length of glabella 3\u00bd lines; greatest width of glabella 2 lines; width of glabella at front 1\u00bc line; distance of eye from side of glabella 2 lines.\n\nDedicated to Prof. C.

The only specimen in which it has been observed attached to the\nthorax is not sufficiently well preserved to enable me to describe it in detail.\n\nThe following are the measurements of two of the specimens:\u2014Length of head $4\\frac{1}{2}$ lines; length of glabella 3 lines, width, just in advance of neck furrow, $2\\frac{1}{3}$ lines, and at one-third the length from front margin 2 lines.\n\nIn a specimen consisting of the thorax and pygidium the whole length is six lines, of which the pygidium occupies apparently a little less than one line. Width at first segment $5\\frac{1}{2}$ lines; width of axis at same place $1\\frac{1}{2}$ line; width at anterior margin of pygidium about 3 lines.\n\nThe position of the eye is not shewn in any specimen that I have seen, but from the width of the portions of the fixed cheeks which remain, it must be distant from the dorsal furrows nearly the width of the glabella.\n\nThis species appears to be closely allied to the one above cited from Shumard\u2019s paper, so far as the characters of the glabella are concerned. As however the proportions are a little different, I shall dispose of it as above until I can have an opportunity of submitting a specimen to Dr. Shumard.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014$1\\frac{1}{2}$ mile east of Swanton in Vermont, in the slates of the Potsdam group.\n\nCollectors.\u2014Rev.

The front of the head is surrounded by a narrow border which appears to be flat; there appears to be some evidence of a spine on the neck segment.\nThe pygidium found in the same fragment of stone with one of the specimens of the glabella of this species is in all general characters that of a *Bathyurus*. It is semicircular, convex, axis cylindrical, strongly convex, terminating behind with an abruptly rounded descent, six annulations, the first three or four most strongly defined.

(N. gen.)\n\nGeneric Characters.\u2014Small, slender, elongate-conical tubes, consisting of several hollow cones placed one within another, the last one forming the chamber of habitation of the animal. The cross section of these tubes is circular or subtriangular, and they are either straight or gently curved; the surface is concentrically or longitudinally striated.\n\nI think these fossils, although no doubt allied to Serpulites, sufficiently different therefrom to constitute a distinct genus. Their structure is so compact that they are seldom found compressed, while all species of Serpulites are almost invariably in that condition, shewing that they consist in general of something more like a membraneous sack than a hard shelled tube.\n\nThis genus is dedicated to J. W. Salter, Esq., Palaeontologist of the Geological Survey of Great Britain.\n\nSalterella rugosa. (N. sp.)\n\nFig. 22. A piece of Limestone with S. rugosa.\n\nDescription.\u2014This little species is straight, conical, tapering uniformly to an acute point. Length from two to four lines, the greater number of the specimens being under three lines; diameter at large extremity one line in a specimen four lines in length; the smaller ones are often a little more obtuse. Aperture circular, equal to about three-fourths the whole diameter. It is not certain that in any of the specimens observed the surface is preserved; they all appear to be divested of the outer covering, and exhibit four to six imbricating sharp annulations in the length of one line, the edges towards the larger end. These are doubtless the exposed edges of the several sheaths of which the tube is composed. They are usually straight, but some are slightly curved.\n\nThis species must be closely allied to Serpulites Macullochi (Salter), but upon an average they are smaller than those figured by Salter in the Jour.

(N. sp.)\n\nDescription.\u2014Six to eight lines in length; diameter at aperture about three lines. The transverse section is always sub-triangular, and in some of the specimens one side appears to be flat like a Theca, and I would refer it to that genus only that the tube is composed of successive layers. None of the specimens are perfect, but the form is sufficiently different from that of the other two to indicate a distinct species.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014Same as the preceding, but not associated with S. rugosa, although it occurs in the same fragments of rock with S. pulchella.\n\n2.\u2014On some new species of Fossils from the Calciferous Chazy, Black River, and Trenton Formations.\n\nGenus Eospongia.

Die Silurische Fauna des Westlichen Tennessee, p. 7, 1860.\n\nGeneric characters.\u2014Sub-globular, pyriform or sub-hemispherical sponges, not free, with an internal arrangement of pores (sometimes reticulated), radiating irregularly from the central axis; cup of variable depth.\n\nDr. Ferdinand Roemer, in his beautiful work on the Silurian Fauna of Western Tennessee, has described three genera of Silurian sponges,\u2014Astylospongia, Palaeomanon, and Astr\u00e6ospongia. The first of these, he says, consists of free sponges; hence the generic name. We have several\nspecies in the Lower Silurian rocks of Canada, which were evidently attached and not free. Most of the specimens have a well developed pedicle. Some of the others, which exhibit no pedicle, evidently attached themselves while young to some cylindrical body and grew around it. We have several with the stalk of a crinoid passing quite through either in the centre or a little on one side. Others are perforated through the centre as if they had grown around some upright slender body, which has disappeared during the natural process of fossilization. Those with the stalks of crinoids passing through them could not have been free, and the others with the central perforation appear to be of the same species. The structure and general form does not differ from those which exhibit perfect evidence of a pedicle. I propose therefore to separate the species here mentioned from Astylospongia, and arrange them under the name of Eospongia.\n\nI shall place a new species from the Trenton limestone, corresponding in form to Roemer's A. inciso-lobata in Astylospongia.\n\n**Eospongia Roemeri. (N. sp.)**\n\n*Description.*\u2014Elongate, pyriform or club-shaped; the internal structure in polished sections shows numerous circular tubes, those in the central part of the mass the largest.\n\nThe best preserved specimen that I have observed is $5\\frac{1}{2}$ inches in length and 3 inches in diameter at two inches from the top. The larger extremity is rounded, with a small depression 1 inch wide and half an inch in depth in the centre. It tapers gradually from 3 inches to a diameter of $1\\frac{1}{2}$ inch at the small end where it is broken off. The pores, as shewn in a polished transverse section, are from $\\frac{1}{2}$ a line to 2 lines in diameter.\n\nDedicated to Dr. Ferdinand Roemer.\n\n*Locality and Formation*\u2014Mingan Islands, Chazy limestone.\n\n*Collectors.*\u2014J.

The upper margin is obtusely rounded. The width of the cup is about one-third of the whole diameter, and about a-half or three-fourths of an inch deep, rounded at the bottom, and with a thick rounded margin. The greatest width of the species is in general near the top, but in those which have grown around the stalk of a\ncrinoid there is a depression below as well as above, so that it is often difficult to say which is the cup or which the base. The transverse polished section shows numerous radiating tortuous channels, often branching, from half to one line in diameter, and usually distant once or twice their width. The vertical section shows other channels ascending and sloping outwards. The weathered surfaces are irregularly striated with obscure rounded often interrupted radiating ridges of from \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) to 1 line wide.\n\nSome of the specimens are nearly flat, but in general they are obscurely turbinate or very depressed pyriform.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Mingan Islands, Chazy limestone.\n\n**Collectors.**\u2014Sir W.

The beak is rounded, prominent and situated about \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of a line from the margin of the apex. The most convex part of the shell is at about one fifth the length from the beak; from this point the surface descends with a uniform gentle and very slightly convex slope in all direc-\ntions to the front margin and anterior angles and half of the sides; in the posterior or upper half with an abrupt slope, becoming concave on each side of the beak.

The whorls then commence to separate, and become more and more distant until at the completion of the third the distance is from $1\\frac{1}{2}$ to $2\\frac{1}{2}$ inches. Where the whole spire is $4\\frac{1}{2}$ inches across, the diameter of the aperture is one inch; at $3\\frac{1}{2}$ inches it is 9 lines. There are usually from 8 to 12 septa in half an inch, but the distance is variable in the same specimen. In the one figured there are 5 -r 6 in half an inch in the latter part of the second and commencement of the third whorl, but farther on towards the outer chamber there are 12 or 15 in the same distance. The siphuncle is about $\\frac{3}{4}$ of a line in diameter, and about the same distance from the shell. The chamber of habitation appears to be three or four inches deep.

(N. sp.)\n\nDescription.\u2014Very large, the coiled portion alone being $10\\frac{1}{2}$ inches across. The first two whorls are $2\\frac{1}{2}$ inches and the first three $4\\frac{1}{2}$ inches across. The first three are coiled in contact; after which the whorls begin to separate, and at the completion of the fourth are distant about $\\frac{1}{4}$ of an inch. The last whorl is then produced nearly in a straight line for about 2 inches, after which (in the only specimen collected) it is not preserved. The dorso-ventral diameter of the tube where broken off is almost $4\\frac{1}{2}$ inches. The distances of the septa vary greatly. In the commencement of the third whorl there are three in one inch, but they gradually become more distant until at the end of this whorl there are only two in one inch. The distance then diminishes, and at the middle of the fourth whorl there are four in one inch. (These measurements relate to the outer side.) Beyond this they are not seen, but the siphuncle is preserved to the end of the fourth whorl, and shows the traces of nine septa in the last inch. The siphuncle is exposed in the specimen in two places, both in the fourth whorl. In the first quarter of the length of this whorl it is concealed. In the second quarter it is laid bare for a length of $5\\frac{1}{2}$ inches. It is here 4 lines in diameter, and its position is, as nearly as can be, central. In the last quarter of the whorl there is another exposure of about 4 inches, its diameter being five lines, and its position, where last seen, $2\\frac{1}{2}$ inches from the ventral or outer margin, and $1\\frac{1}{4}$ inch from the dorsal or inner margin. The position therefore of the siphuncle in this species varies in different parts of the same individual. This agrees with Barrande's observations on Orthoceras mundum, in which the siphuncle passes from one side to the other in such a manner that ten or twelve species might be made out of different fragments of the same individual.\n\nThe only specimen collected is firmly imbedded in the limestone matrix, and is worn away so as to exhibit a complete section along the plane of the coil, showing all the whorls and the siphuncle as above mentioned. The character of the surface cannot thus be observed. But judging from the appearance of the shell as seen in the section the last whorl is crossed by wide shallow undulations, but no traces of these can be seen on the inner whorls, where the shell is also visible.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014Phillipsburg in the County of Missisquoi, Canada East.

Glabella elongate oval, terminating in front with an acute elevated rostrum, the length of which is not known, and truncated behind by the neck furrow, narrowly convex and rather sharply carinated along the median line. Glabellar furrows represented by two obscure indentations on each side, the posterior at a little less than one line from the neck segment, and the anterior about two lines; the latter are deep pits situated in the dorsal furrow or just in the angle formed by the junction of the base of the glabella with the fixed cheeks. The neck segment is a flat plate inclining upwards and backwards at an angle of about $45^\\circ$. The neck furrow is well defined all across the whole width of the head, being least distinct in passing over the posterior part of the glabella.\n\nPygidium semioval with a flat border all round abruptly bent down at nearly a right angle. Axis conical, moderately convex, extending the whole length and causing a slight projection in the posterior margin. Side lobes nearly flat, with five or six flat ribs each with a fine pleural groove extending the whole length. On the axis there appear to be ten or twelve closely crowded annulations occupying five sixths the length, the apex being apparently smooth. On approaching the margin the side ribs seem to curve a little forwards. Length of head, excluding the rostrum, $3\\frac{1}{2}$ lines, measured along the base of the glabella. Width of glabella at neck segment $1\\frac{1}{2}$ line, and just in front of the anterior pits 2 lines; elevation at neck segment less than one line, and at front of head, so far as seen, about 2 lines.

There is a broad spiral band situated with its upper edge about the middle of the whorl; above this and only separated from it by a sharply elevated thread-like carina there is a second very narrow but well defined concave band, above which the whorl is gently concave for about two thirds the distance to the suture; and in the remaining third to the suture there is a spiral row of small elevated imperfect varices which give to this part of the shell a peculiar nodulose appearance. The suture is deeply canalulate. Under side of body whorl moderately ventricose. There is a small umbilicus. Aperture oval somewhat effuse below.\n\nSurface with elevated sharp-edged lines of growth, distinctly visible to the naked eye, from eight to ten in the width of one line.

(N., sp.)\n\nDescription.\u2014Shell very large, trochoid, conical, with a flat base. The specimen consists of the body whorl and a portion of the one next above it. Although imperfect there is sufficient to show that this is a smoothly conical flat-based species belonging to that group of which *P. Ramsayi* of the Calciferous formation is an example. The basal margin is narrowly rounded, the lower side of the body whorl flat and at a right angle (or very nearly so, to the vertical axis of the shell. The upper side of the whorl is gently convex, or nearly flat for a short distance from the aperture and then gradually becomes gently concave. Judging from this form, the spire is most probably an uniformly tapering cone. As the lower side of the body whorl forms an angle of about 60\u00b0 with the upper side the apical angle would also be about 60\u00b0. There is evidence of a wide umbilicus.\n\nSurface with fine crowded sublamellose striae curving backwards so as to form an acute angle in passing over the margin. Width of the base 4 inches.\n\nThis fine shell is allied to *P. Ramsayi*, but is nearly four times as wide at the base.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014South point of Large Island, Mingan Islands.

The body whorl is large and uniformly ventricose, most prominent about the middle. The upper whorls are small and uniformly ventricose in the cast. Surface with fine stri\u00e6 and a few obscure undulations. These curve backwards at an angle of about $45^\\circ$ to the axis of the shell until they reach the spiral band, below which they at first curve forward and then become more vertical.\n\nLength of a specimen of four whorls about $1\\frac{1}{2}$ inches; width at base nearly the same; width of spiral band on the last whorl nearly 2 lines.\n\nThe only specimen seen is about the size and somewhat of the shape of *Eunema Erigone*. In that species, however, the small whorls are slightly concave above the spiral band but in this they are convex. The band in this species is not so broad, the last whorl is also not so prominent at the base.

External surface either smooth or horizontally or vertically striated or ribbed. Internal surface either smooth or with a crescentiform row of small circular or oval muscular impressions open towards the anterior extremity.\n\nProf. Phillips confines this genus to such as have \u201cthe face under the apex\u201d truncate. There is, however, as is well shewn by our specimens a gradation between those with the aperture oval or circular and those which have it straight in front and curved at the sides and posterior margin. These shells are referred by some to *Capulus* and by others to *Patella* both of which names have been used by me also. But we have now two species from the Quebec group which shew that the muscular impressions\ndo not form one continuous scar as in these two genera but consist of a number of small isolated cavities.\n\nIt may be that when the internal characters of Phillips' species become well known, these Lower Silurian forms will be referred to a different genus, but until we have some evidence of a generic difference it would not be safe to give them a separate designation.

The body of the shell is subtriangular, ventricose, the ventral margin rounded, the posterior angle about one fifth more remote from the umbones than the anterior, the umbonal angle acute, apparently 20\u00b0 or 30\u00b0. The anterior wing is triangular compressed, its dorsal margin convex, forming with the anterior margin an angle of about 45\u00b0. At the junction of the lower margin of the wing with the ventral margin of the body of the shell there is an obtuse notch, in consequence of the curvature of the two margins mentioned. The posterior wing is small slender and cylindrical at its extremity but towards the body of the shell it rapidly expands into a broad base occupying about \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) the length of the posterior side of the body of the shell. The umbones are small but distinctly elevated above the hinge line. The beaks are closely incurved.\n\nSurface covered with fine radiating ribs, just visible to the naked eye. Of these, 10 can be counted on the anterior wing and about double the same number on the body.\n\nThe following are the dimensions of the most perfect specimen observed. Width on hinge line including both wings 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) lines; from the umbones to extremity of anterior wing 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) lines; from the umbones to extremity of posterior wing 1 line; from umbones to ventral margin 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) lines; width\nof ventral margin $1\\frac{1}{2}$ lines; the anterior ventral angle is about $\\frac{1}{2}$ of a line more remote from the umbones than the posterior angle.\n\nNone of the specimens examined are quite perfect, and it seems probable that in some the posterior wing may be proportionally a little larger. In the one figured, a piece appears to have been broken off.\n\nD. D. Owen has figured a small species, under the name of *Pleurorhynchus antiqua*, in his Report on the Geology of Wisconsin and Iowa, Pl. 2 B. Fig. 19. His figure shows the body of the shell and the anterior wing, but not the posterior siphonal wing. Judging from so much as is exhibited, the ventral margin of the body of the shell does not project so far below the lower margin of the anterior wing as it does in this species. Owen found his specimen in the Lower Silurian rocks at Lower Fort Garry, on the Red River, in the Hudson Bay Company's territory.\n\nIt may be that this species belongs to an undescribed genus, but until the interior can be seen, we are compelled to place it in *Conocardium* on account of its external characters.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Paquette Rapids, on the Ottawa River.

The foramen is probably situated at the outer extremity of the groove, but it cannot be seen in the specimen examined. The upper valve (supposed to be that of this species,) has the apex situated about one-third the semi-diameter from the margin. In both valves the apex is smooth.\n\nSurface with rather strong, sub-lamellose concentric stri\u00e6, which become more distant and coarser from the apex outwards. At the margin there are four or five ridges in 1 line, but next to the apex double that number in the same space. The ridges are somewhat irregular, being in some places slightly undulated, and occasionally branched, two or more running into one. The grooves are rather wider than the ridges, and the lamellose aspect of the latter appears to be due to their being more abruptly elevated on the inner side, or the side towards the apex than on the outside.\n\nWidth of the specimen of the lower valve examined, 9 lines; length of peduncular sulcus, $3\\frac{1}{2}$ lines; width of same, $\\frac{1}{2}$ a line. Another specimen (an upper valve) is 7 lines wide.\n\nThe lower valve is depressed, conical, and appears to have been about 2 lines in height, but as it is somewhat distorted by pressure, the true elevation cannot be determined. The upper valve seems to be less convex than the lower.\n\nThe species described by Prof. Hall, under the name of *Orbicula lamellosa*, (Pal. N. Y., Vol. 1, p. 99, pl. 30, figs. 10 a b,) appears to be a smaller and more finely striated species. It may be that the figures represent a young individual of this species; but, at all events, the name proposed by Prof. Hall cannot be retained, as it was pre-occupied by another and very distinct species, *D. lamellosa*. (Brod. Zool. Proc. 1833, p. 124.)\n\nThis species also resembles *D.

Surface with fine, radiating striae, which increase by interstitial addition, sometimes closely crowded together, in which case there are ten or twelve in the width of one line; occasionally more distant, or from four to eight in one line. The intermediate grooves are divided into square compartments by cross ridges, which connect the radiating ridges, but are not continuous, those in one groove not corresponding in position with those in the adjacent grooves, so as to form uninterrupted concentric lines. In specimens with the striae closely crowded together, only the radiating lines are distinctly visible, but the others can always be detected in good specimens, on close examination.\n\nLength, from 12 to 15 lines; width a little less than the length.

Surface with fine very\nobscure radiating striae, ten or twelve in the width of one line, crossed by fine concentric striae about the same distance apart. This arrangement of the striae gives to the surface a finely punctuated aspect.\n\nLength, 6 or 7 lines; width, 5 or 6 lines.\n\nThe shell is thin and of a light brown or dun colour. When a little worn, it has a smooth, glistening appearance, and the punctures and striae are then scarcely visible.\n\n*Trematis cancellata* (G. B. Sowerby,) must be closely allied to this species. It is thus described: \"Shell orbicular, very flat, being more gibbous near the posterior extremity; surface covered with close-set, elevated lines radiating from the apex, which are crossed by the elevated lines of growth, so that the entire surface has a finely reticulated appearance; the fissure in the ventral valve is small and close to the hinge; shell very thin; length and breadth, \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of an inch.\" (Sharpe, Jour. Geo. Soc., Vol. 4, p. 69.) I have not seen Sowerby's original description and figure, but from the above it would appear that *T. cancellata* has a small foramen, while *T.

(N. sp.)\n\nDescription.\u2014The specimen upon which this species is founded consists of the glabella and the greater part of the fixed cheeks of a minute trilobite, discovered by Mr. J. F. Smith, of Toronto, two or three years ago, in the neighborhood of Peterborough, C.W. The glabella is obtusely conical, strongly convex, most elevated in the middle, separated from the cheeks by a deep dorsal furrow, which runs all round; front margin obtusely rounded; sides gently convex; neck furrow extending all across. Cheeks moderately tumid. Eyes at about the mid-length of the head, and distant about half the width of the glabella from the dorsal furrow.\n\nLength of glabella, 1 line; width of the same, a little more than half a line; length of eye, apparently about \u00bc of a line.\n\nOn account of the rather great convexity of the glabella, this species resembles a Menocephalus.

The two species of *Lingula* were found in New York. (Pal. N.Y., vol. i.)\n\n1851.\u2014Dr. H. A. Prout described *Graptolithus Hallianus*, from the Potsdam sandstone of Wisconsin. (Am. Jour. Sci. (2) xi, p. 187.) This species has been since referred, by Prof. J. Hall, to the genus *Dendrograptus*.\n\n1851.\u2014Sir W. E. Logan read a paper before the Geological Society of London \"On the Occurrence of a Track and Foot-prints of an Animal in the Potsdam sandstone of Lower Canada.\" He stated that his \"attention was first drawn to the track by Mr. Abraham, then editor of the Montreal Gazette, who duly appreciated its possible geological importance, and inserted a notice of it in his daily journal.\" (Jour. Geo. Soc., vol. vii, p. 247.)\n\n1852.\u2014Prof. R. Owen described and figured the tracks above mentioned under the names of *Protichnites septem-notatus*, *P. octo-notatus*, *P. latus*, *P. multinotatus*, *P. lineatus* and *P. alternans*. As to the affinities of the creature which made the tracks, he says the *Limulus* \"comes nearest to his idea of the kind of animal which has left the impressions on the Potsdam sandstone.\" (Jour. Geo. Soc., vol. viii, p. 214.)\n\n1852.\u2014Dr. D. D. Owen described *Orbicula prima*, *Lingula ampla*, *L. pinnaformis*, *Dikelocephalus Minnesotensis*, *D. Pepinensis*, *D. Miniscaensis*, *D. Iowensis*, *D. granulosus*, *Lonchocephalus Chippewaensis*, *L. hamulus*, *Crepicephalus Wisconsensis*, *C. Miniscaensis*, and *Menocephalus Minnesotensis*, from the Potsdam sandstone of Wisconsin. He also cites with doubt *Obolus Apollinis*, *L. antiqua* and *L. prima* with *Orthis* and Crinoidal stems from the same beds. (Geol. Rep. on Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota.)\n1859.\u2014J. W. Salter described *Conocephalites antiquatus* from \"a cast in a brown sandstone, said to be a bouldered fragment from Georgia.\" (Jour. Geo. Soc., vol. xv, p. 554.)\n\n1860.\u2014Dr. B. F. Shumard announced the discovery of the Potsdam sandstone and Calciferous sandrock or their equivalents in Burnet county, in the State of Texas, and described one species, (*Orthis Coloradensis,*), from the former. (Trans. Acad. Nat. Sci., St. Louis, vol. i, pp. 627, 672.)\n\n1860.\u2014Sir W. E. Logan described and figured a track in the Potsdam sandstone under the name of *Climactichnites Wilsoni.* This track was discovered by Dr. James Wilson of Perth. (Can. Nat. Geol., vol. v, p. 279.) Dr. J. W. Dawson has described and figured the various tracks of *Limulus* on the sand of the existing sea-beaches, showing very clearly that both *Protichnites* and *Climactichnites* may be the tracks of crustaceans. (Can. Nat. Geol. vol. vii, p. 273.)\n\n1860.\u2014F. H. Bradley described *Conocephalites minutus* from the Potsdam sandstone at Keeseville, N. Y. He also reported the occurrence of the cast of a *Pleuronectaria* and a crinoidal joint in the same beds. (Am. Jour. Sci. (2) xxx, p. 211.)\n\n1861.\u2014Dr. B. F. Shumard described from the Potsdam of the locality in Burnet county in Texas, above mentioned, *Discina microscopica, Camerella* (sp.?), *Capulus* (sp.?) *Agnostus Coloradoensis, Arionellus (Bathyurus) Texanus, A. (Bathyurus) Planus, Conocephalites depressus, C. Billingsii* and *Dikeloccephalus, Roemer.* (Am. Jour. Sci. (2) xxxii, p. 213.) In this paper Dr. Shumard mentions the previous discovery, by Dr. Ferd. Roemer, of trilobites in Texas which had been referred by Barrande to the fauna of the Primordial zone. I have not access to Roemer's work at present, or I would notice his species here.\n\n1862.\u2014Dr. F. V. Hayden and F. B. Meek gave an account of their discovery of the Potsdam sandstone around the Black Hills and other localities along the eastern side of the Rocky Mountain range. They described *Obulella nana, Theca (Pugiunculus) gregaria* and *Arionellus Oweni* from the Black Hills and Big Horn Mountains. They also cite species either identical with or closely allied to *Lingula prima* and *L. acuminata,* from the same localities. (Am. Jour. Sci. (2) xxxiii, p. 73, Jan. 1862; also Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., Dec. 1861, p. 435).\n\n1862.\u2014Dr. B. F. Shumard revised several of D. D. Owen's species, and also described *Dikeloccephalus latifrons,* *Arionellus bifurcatus,* and *Conocephalites minor* from the Potsdam of Wisconsin. He also made the first announcement of the occurrence of the genus *Agnostus* in this formation. The species noticed by him \"appears to be identical with or at least\nvery nearly allied to\u201d *A. Orion* which occurs at Point L\u00e9vis. (Trans. Acad. Sci., St. Louis, vol. ii, May, 1862).\n\n1863.\u2014Prof. J. Hall revised a number of the above named species from the Potsdam sandstone of Wisconsin, and described the following new ones: *Lingula Winona*, *L. Moisa*, *L. Aurora*, *Discina inutilis*, *Obolella polita*, *Orthis Pepina*, *Platycteras primordialis*, *Euomphalus vaticinus*, *Theca primordialis*, *Serpulites Murchisoni*, *Dikelocephalus limbatus*, *D. spiniger*, *D. Misa*, *D. Osceola*, *Conocephalites Eos*, *C. Perseus*; *C. Shumardi*, *C. nasutus*, *C. Oweni*, *C. Eryon*, *C. anatinus*, *C. Pattersoni*, *C. binodosus*, *C. Winona*, *C. diadematus*, *C. optatus*, *C. nactus*, *Chariocephalus Whitfieldi*, *Illenurus quadratus*, *Triarthrella Auroralis*, *Agnostus Josepha*, *A. parilis*, *A. disparilis*, *Aglaaspis Barrandei*, *Pemphigaspis bullata*, and *Amphion matutina*. The new genera of trilobites described in this paper are *Pemphigaspis Aglaaspis*, *Triarthrella*, *Illenurus*, *Chariocephalus* and *Ptychaspis*. In the last of these is placed Owen\u2019s two species, *Dikelocephalus Minnesotensis* and *D. granulosus*. All the species are illustrated by excellent figures. (16th Reg. Rep.)\n\n1864.\u2014Prof. A. Winchell, of Michigan, described *Orthis Barabuen-sis*, *Straparollus (Ophileta) primordialis*, *Pleurotomaria Advena*, *Ptychas-pis Barabensis*, *Paleophycus articulatus*, and *P. informis*, from the Potsdam sandstone of Sauk County, Wisconsin. He also reports from the same locality, *Scolithus linearis*, *D. Minnesotensis* and *D. Pepinensis*.\n\nIn addition to the above, Prof. Hall has described from the Potsdam group in Vermont *Olenellus Vermontana*, *O. Thompsoni* and *Bathynotus Holopyga*. There will also be found in this work the following twenty-two species,\u2014*Scolithus Canadensis*, *Paleophycus incipiens*, *P. congregatus*, *Archeocyathus Atlanticus*, *A profundus*, *Obolus Labradoricus*, *Obolella chromatica*, *O. (Kutorgina) cingulata*, *Orthisina festinata*, *Camerella antiquata*, *Conocephalites miser*, *C. Adamsi*, *C. Vulcanus*, *C. Teucer*, *C. arenosus*, *Bathyurus senectus*, *B. parvulus*, *B. vetulus*, *B. perplexus*, *Salterella rugosa*, *S. pulchella*, and *S. obtusa*.\n\nThere are also in Canada certain beds, at present considered to form the upper layers of the Potsdam, which hold *Lingula acuminata*, *Ophileta compacta*, *Pleurotomaria Canadensis*, and a small orthoceratite. It may be that these beds should be placed in the base of the Calciferous, and, therefore, in the following comparisons the fossils they hold will not be taken into account.\nAssuming that the above are all the described species of this series of rocks, the fauna of the Potsdam as at present known would appear to consist of\u2014\n\n| Classification       | Number of Species |\n|----------------------|-------------------|\n| Plantae              | 6                 |\n| Protozoa             | 2                 |\n| Graptolitidae        | 1                 |\n| Brachiopoda          | 21                |\n| Gasteropoda          | 5                 |\n| Annelida             | 5                 |\n| Crustacea            | 67                |\n\nTotal: 107\n\nThe six species of Plant\u00e6 are supposed to be fossil sea-weeds, and there can be no doubt that at least four of them are; but as to the two species of Scolithus there is much difference of opinion. By some they are thought to be casts of annelide-burrows, and by others fucoids. Much further observation is required to determine the affinities of these obscure but very remarkable fossils. The two species of Archeocyathus may possibly belong to an extinct order of corals, but for the present they are placed among the Protozoa. The Graptolitidae, Brachiopoda, Gasteropoda, and Annelida are mostly of genera or sub-genera, which have a great vertical range, and can scarcely be made available to determine, by their generic relations, the age of any geological horizon, although certain species of each genus may be confined to, and characteristic of, particular groups of strata. In the following comparisons, therefore, they will not be taken into account further than to notice that none of the species are as yet known to ascend into the Calciferous formation. The trilobites belong to the following genera:\n\n| Genus               | Number of Species |\n|---------------------|-------------------|\n| Aglaspis            | 1                 |\n| Arionellus          | 4                 |\n| Bathyurus           | 4                 |\n| Bathynotus          | 1                 |\n| Chariocephalus      | 1                 |\n| Conocephalites      | 23                |\n| Crepicephalus       | 2                 |\n| Dikelocephalus      | 10                |\n| Menocephalus        | 1                 |\n| Lonchocephalus      | 2                 |\n| Olenellus           | 2                 |\n| Ptychaspis          | 1                 |\n| Triarthrella        | 1                 |\n\nThe above constitute the dominant family of the trilobitic fauna of the Potsdam.\n\n| Genus               | Number of Species |\n|---------------------|-------------------|\n| Agnostus            | 4                 |\n| Amphion             | 1                 |\n| Ill\u00e6nurus           | 1                 |\n| Pemphigaspis        | 1                 |\n| Protichnites        | 6                 |\n| Climactichnites     | 1                 |\n\nTotal: 67\nIn the above list, I have left all the species in the genera to which they were originally referred by their authors respectively. Some alterations have been proposed by Prof. Hall and Dr. Shumard, which will no doubt be adopted either wholly or in part. Without objecting to any of these changes, it seems the better course, for the present, to admit D. D. Owen's four genera, until more perfect specimens can be procured.\n\nOn a comparative examination of all the genera in the above list it will be seen, that *Agnostus*, *Ill\u00e6nurus* and *Pemphigaspis* are peculiar types, and, in their organization, stand apart, as it were, from all the others. *Amphion* is a well defined genus, now, for the first time, found in rocks so ancient as the Potsdam, although it occurs in the Calciferous, and is known in Bohemia, by a single species (*A. Lindauri*, Barr.) in the lowest beds characterized by the second fauna. These four genera are represented, so far as at present known, in the Potsdam by only seven species, and constitute but a small portion of the whole fauna of the period. We may also set aside *Protichmites* and *Climactichnites*, because they consist only of tracks, and we know too little about them to form any idea of the affinities of the family to which they belong.\n\nAfter making the deductions, above mentioned, there remain thirteen genera, and these all belong to one great family, which appears to have attained its greatest development in the Potsdam period, and to have gradually declined afterwards, until the era of the Trenton limestone, when it became extinct. The different generic groups, of which this family is composed, are most closely allied, and run into each other in such a manner as to render subdivision almost impossible, showing that they all had one common origin. There appear to be, furthermore, innumerable varietal passages between the species, while, in certain localities, the individuals occur in such vast multitudes, although always in fragments, as to constitute of themselves the principal mass of the rock. The aspect of the family is that of a portion of the first fauna of Barrande, and it seems probable that it existed in a period somewhat later than that of the large species of *Paradoxides*, which form so striking a feature in the Primordial zone of Europe. In Bohemia, Sweden, Wales and Spain, some of the genera do indeed occur in the rocks of that ancient horizon, but they do not constitute the principal and dominant section of the fauna. In the Potsdam, on the other hand, thirteen out of seventeen genera (excluding the genera founded on tracks), and fifty-three out of sixty species, belong to this family, while the individuals are so exceedingly numerous that they perhaps furnish ninety per cent. of the whole.\n\nWithout noticing the Calciferous formation, for the present, we may proceed next to the examination of the fauna of the Quebec group. In the table shewing the succession of Canadian rocks, on page 20 of the\nGeology of Canada, this group is divided into the Sillery and L\u00e9vis formations. The Sillery, consisting of a vast deposit of sandstones and slates, has, as yet, furnished only two species of fossils,\u2014a small Lingula, too imperfectly preserved to be determined, and Obolella pretiosa. The L\u00e9vis formation holds a large, interesting and well marked fauna, which persistently maintains the same combination of types, and consequently exhibits the same aspect along a chain of exposures extending from Newfoundland to Vermont, a distance of nearly 1000 miles. The same rocks have been traced through Vermont into New York, and will, perhaps, yet be found to continue on to the Gulf of Mexico. The formation, however, in its extension into the United States has, as yet, furnished only a few fragmentary fossils. The localities in Canada, where organic remains abound, are of limited extent, and widely separated from each other, although they all occur in the same line of outcrops. The perfect identity of the species which are common to exposures so far apart as are Cow Head in Newfoundland, and Point L\u00e9vis and Phillipsburgh in Canada, is truly wonderful; while the rock specimens, whether of slate or limestone, are often absolutely indistinguishable from each other by any lithological characters. From this formation we have 219 described species, distributed as follows:\n\n| Zoophyta | ................................................................. | 1 species |\n| Graptolitidae | .............................................................. | 53 \" |\n| Brachiopoda | ............................................................... | 28 \" |\n| Lamellibranchiata | ............................................................ | 2 \" |\n| Gasteropoda | ............................................................... | 42 \" |\n| Cephalopoda | ............................................................... | 20 \" |\n| Crustacea | ............................................................... | 73 \" |\n\nIn the above, I have not included any of the Newfoundland fossils except those which occur in the slates and limestones at Cow Head. The rocks of this locality are precisely of the same age as those of Point L\u00e9vis; but the other fossiliferous exposures, such as those at Portland Creek, Table Head, Point Rich, and Pistolet Bay, hold a somewhat different, although closely related, fauna. They may well be placed in the Quebec group, but not in the L\u00e9vis formation. The Quebec group, in fact, consists of several formations differing from each other lithologically and paleontologically, and yet forming a connected series. In the L\u00e9vis formation, the following genera of trilobites occur:\n\n| Arionellus | ............................................................... | 2 species |\n| Bathyrus | ............................................................... | 12 \" |\n| Bathurellus | ............................................................. | 6 \" |\n| Conocephalites | ........................................................... | 1 \" |\n| Dikelocephalus | .......................................................... | 14 \" |\n| Menocephalus | ............................................................. | 3 \" |\n| Loganellus | .............................................................. | 1 \" |\nThe above belong to the dominant family of the trilobitic fauna of the Potsdam.\n\n| Genus          | Number |\n|----------------|--------|\n| Agnostus       | 3      |\n| Amphion        | 5      |\n| Ampyx          | 1      |\n| Asaphus        | 4      |\n| Cheirurus      | 8      |\n| Endymonia      | 1      |\n| Holometopus    | 1      |\n| Harpes         | 1      |\n| Harpides       | 1      |\n| Ill\u00e6nus        | 5      |\n| Nileus         | 1      |\n| Lichas         | 1      |\n| Remopleurides  | 1      |\n| Shumardia      | 1      |\n\nIn this list I have placed all the species in the genera to which they were originally referred, except the species of Loganellus, which was described as an Olenus. The two species of Arionellus may possibly belong to Prof. Hall's newly proposed genus Ptychaspis. In the genus Bathyurus there are two species, (B. conicus and B. Cordai,) which evidently have the characters of Owen's genus Crepicephalus. In Dikelocephalus Sesostris, we have also a form which I consider to be perfectly congeneric with D. Miniscaensis, one of the types of Ptychaspis. Menocephalus is not recognized by Hall and Shumard among the fossils of the Potsdam sandstone of Wisconsin, where the specimen on which Owen proposed the genus was procured. Crepicephalus is also placed by them in Conocephalites, where, indeed, it is perfectly admissible, provided the great extension given to this latter genus be sustained. I think, however, the number of species is becoming so great that, sooner or later, Conocephalites will be broken up into a number of genera. Be this as it may, we have, in the L\u00e9vis formation, the leading generic types of the dominant family of the Potsdam trilobites, although (in accordance with the views of different authors) not all under the same names. All the species (39 in number) that I have referred to Arionellus, Bathyurus, Bathyurellus, Conocephalites, Dikelocephalus, Menocephalus and Loganellus, belong to that family. Comparing the trilobitic fauna of the Potsdam with that of the L\u00e9vis formation, we thus find that in the former, thirteen out of seventeen genera, and fifty-three out of sixty species; and in the latter, seven out of twenty-one genera with thirty-nine out of seventy-three species belong to the same zoological group. This shows that, while this peculiar type of trilobites strongly connects the two faun\u00e6, during the period of the L\u00e9vis formation it was on the decline.\nPassing now to the upper part of the Lower Silurian we may, for our present purpose, regard the Chazy formation as being characterized by a distinct fauna; but the Black River, Birdseye, Trenton, Utica Slate, and Hudson River, should all be grouped together. The fauna of this latter series may be called the Trenton fauna, as it attains its greatest development in that formation.\n\nIn the Chazy fauna the dominant family of the Potsdam trilobites is reduced to a single genus and species\u2014*Bathyurus Angelini*. The genus *Amphion* also passes from the Potsdam to the Chazy, but is not known above that formation in this country.\n\nIn the Trenton fauna the dominant family of the Potsdam is represented by only two genera (*Bathyurus* and *Triarthrus*). The latter has not been found below the Trenton; but it, nevertheless, is a genus of the primordial type. Barrande has placed it in his third family, which includes *Paradoxides*, *Arionellus*, *Conocephalites*, *Olenus*, &c. (Syst\u00e8me Silurien, p. 340.) In Canada we have four species of this genus, all in the Utica slate, *T. Bechii*, *T. spinosus*, *T. glaber* and *T. Canadensis*. The first of these is found, in New York, in the Trenton as well as in the Utica slate. Of the three species of *Bathyurus*, two (*B. Smithi* and *B. extans*) occur in the Black River limestone; while the third (*B. spiniger*) is common to the Black River and Trenton.\n\nIn order to save space the generic relations of the several trilobitic faunae above noticed may be abbreviated as in the following lists.\n\n**Trenton Fauna.**\n\nAsaphus, 10; Acidaspis, 2; **Bathyurus**, 3; Bronteus, 1; Calymene, 3; Cheirurus, 3; Dalmanites, 3; Encrinurus, 1; Harpes, 3; Illeenus, 7; Lichas, 1; Proctus, 1; **Triarthrus**, 4; Trinucleus, 1.

Total, 14.\n\nPOTSDAM FAUNA.\n\nAgnostus, 4; Aglaspis, 1; Amphion, 1; Arionellus, 4; Bathyurus, 4; Bathynotus, 1; Chariocephalus, 1; Climacichnites, 1; Conocephalites, 23; Crepicephalus, 2; Dikelocephalus, 10; Ill\u00e6nurus, 1; Menocephalus, 1; Lonochocephalus, 2; Olenelius, 2; Pemphigaspis, 1; Protichnites, 6; Ptychaspis, 1; Triarthrella, 1. Total, 67.\n\nIn the above lists the genera printed in black-letter are those that occur in the Potsdam; those in italics belong to the primordial type, but have not yet been found in the Potsdam. All the others are members of the second fauna of Barrande, except, indeed, Endymionia and Shumardia, which are new genera, whose geological range is as yet undetermined. Crepicephalus, Ptychaspis and Bathynotus are placed in the L\u00e9vis faun\u00e6, but with their number not indicated, because the species are included in Dikelocephalus and Bathyurus. The lists show, so far as the proposition can be demonstrated by genera alone, that the true place of the L\u00e9vis formation is between the Potsdam and the Trenton groups, not below the Potsdam, as is still maintained by some observers.\n\nIf we examine how far these several faun\u00e6 are connected together by species, we find:\n\n1. Not a single species of the large fauna of the Potsdam is known to pass upwards.\n\n2. Of the Calciferous fauna, four species (Asaphus canalis, Amphion Salteri, Bathyurus Cordai and B. conicus) pass upwards into the L\u00e9vis formation. And one of these (A. canalis) ascends into the Chazy.\n\n3. Of the L\u00e9vis fauna, two species (A. canalis and Cheirurus prolificus) pass upwards into the Chazy.\n\n4. One trilobite only (Asaphus platycephalus), and that doubtfully identified, is common to the Chazy and Trenton. It is also worthy of notice that the peculiar group of the genus Cheirurus, with a spine on the head, has only been found, in America, in the L\u00e9vis formation, and in the Chazy, (see C. perforator, p. 275; C. Glaucus and C. Satyrus, p. 323.) And further that the genus Remopleurides has, as yet, been found in America only, in the same two formations.\n\nProceeding, next, to the other orders and classes, such as the Brachiopoda, Gasteropoda, Cephalopoda, &c., it is quite clear that the L\u00e9vis fauna is, upon the whole, distinct from all the others, although a few species are common to it and the Calciferous, or to it and the Chazy.\nThe Calciferous species, which are certainly found in the L\u00e9vis formation, are *Lingula Mantelli*, *Camerella calcifera*, and *Phurotomaria calcifera*. There are, besides these, a few which I do not consider to be positively identified with Calciferous species, but which, nevertheless, in such specimens as have been collected, agree so well with the figures in the Pal. N. Y., that it would be unsafe to give them new names. They have been referred by me heretofore to *Ophileta uniangulata*, *Macurea matutina*, *M. sordida* and *Holpea dilucula*.\n\nOf Chazy species we find, at Phillipsburgh, the plates of a Cystidean, which I cannot distinguish from those of *Palaeocystites tenuiradiatus*, a peculiar and remarkable fossil, and highly characteristic of the Chazy limestone. It is, probably, a distinct species, but in detached plates it is impossible to point out any difference. *Camerella curians* is also common to the Chazy and L\u00e9vis fauna. The remarkable genus *Caluthium* is represented in the L\u00e9vis formation by *C. pannosum*, and in the Chazy by *C. Canadensis*. This genus commences in the Calciferous, and runs up to the Chazy. *Stenopora fibrosa* can scarcely be mentioned as a characteristic fossil, but it is found in beds below the L\u00e9vis, and passes upwards to the upper Silurian. There are no species common to the L\u00e9vis and Trenton faun\u00e6, except the one last mentioned.\n\nIt will be seen by referring to Art. 6, p. 207 and its continuation, p. 361, that in Newfoundland the L\u00e9vis formation does not there immediately overlie the true Calciferous, but is separated therefrom by two other series of strata of considerable importance. The first of these, consisting of Divisions I, K, L, M, is 1084 feet in thickness, and holds a fauna which is, upon the whole, distinct from that of the L\u00e9vis formation. The trilobites are:\n\n| Trilobite       | Number of Species |\n|-----------------|------------------|\n| Bathyurus      | 2                 |\n| Bathyrellus    | 1                 |\n| Asaphus         | 1                 |\n| Ill\u00e6nus         | 2                 |\n| Amphion        | 1                 |\n\nOf these, *Asaphus canalis* and *Amphion Barrandei* occur in the L\u00e9vis formation. *Orthis Electra* is also found in these beds; but all the other fossils are either new species, or species that occur in the Chazy and Calciferous. Overlying this series of strata is another 277 feet in thickness, with a different fauna, the details of which will be found at the place cited. Then follows 700 feet of sandstone, overlying which is the L\u00e9vis formation, at Cow Head. It would thus appear that the rocks at Point L\u00e9vis not only overlie, but, also, when the series is complete, are at least 2000 feet above the true Calciferous. That so many trilobites belonging to the\ndominant type of the Potsdam should occur in such a horizon appears to me to be a most extraordinary fact. Judging from the fossils alone, I should say that the L\u00e9vis formation immediately succeeds the Calciferous, but the physical evidence seems to show that such is not the case.\n\n2.\u2014Descriptions of New Species of Fossils.\n\nIn a paper published in the Canadian Naturalist and Geologist, vol. v, p. 201, August, 1860, I made a provisional division of the specimens in which the fossils were first found at Point L\u00e9vis, and designated them simply as limestones Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4. I think it advisable to retain these divisions here, but it is quite clear that they all belong to the same series of beds. No. 1 is a peculiar greyish-white limestone and holds a number of species that have not been discovered in any locality except at Point L\u00e9vis. Sir W. E. Logan has shown that there are nine bands of the limestone and that my Nos. 1 and 3, belong to his band No. 3, and also that his No. 4 includes my No. 2. There are several species common to these two bands, but a great deal more must be done in the way of collecting fossils at Point L\u00e9vis before all the questions that have arisen with regard to the fauna of that locality can be satisfactorily disposed of.\n\nThe following is Meek and Hayden\u2019s description of *Obolella nana*.\n\n\u201c**Obolella nana.**\u201d (Meek and Hayden.)\n\n\u201cShell very small, subcircular, or transversely suboval, moderately convex, rather thick; front broadly rounded; sides more narrowly rounded. Beak of dorsal valve short and obtuse. Ventral valve proportionally a little longer than the other, about as long as wide, and having a slightly more prominent beak; without a distinct mesial ridge within; scars of adductor muscles located behind the middle and diverging towards the front. Surface marked by a few concentric furrows; exfoliated specimens showing small obscure regularly disposed radiating striae on the inner laminae.\n\n\u201cLength of dorsal valve, 0\u00b715 inch; breadth of do., 0\u00b717 inch; convexity, 0\u00b715 inch. Length and breadth of ventral valve of a smaller specimen, each 0\u00b714 inch.\n\n\u201cIn first sending on to the Academy a description of this little shell, we had referred it with doubt to the genus *Obolus*, stating, at the same time, that its muscular scars, so far as they could be made out from the only specimen we had seen showing the interior, seemed to present differences from the type of Eichwald\u2019s genus. Since seeing Mr. Billings\u2019s figures of his\ngenus *Obolella*, recently published, we are fully satisfied that he is right in separating these shells from the genus *Obolus*.\n\n\"Our species is so closely allied to *Obolella chromatica* of Billings, the type of the genus, (see \"New species of Lower Silurian Fossils, page 7,) that we were inclined to regard it as specifically identical until we had an opportunity to compare it with specimens of Mr. Billings's species, kindly sent us by him. On comparing it with these, we find it is more convex, and proportionally broader, while its concentric markings are stronger. The substance of its shell is also thicker, and differs in showing radiating stri\u00e6 on the inner laminae of exfoliated specimens.\n\n\"Locality and Position.\u2014Central portions of the Black Hills, from the Primordial or Potsdam sandstone.\"\n\n**OBOLELLA PRETIOSA.** (N. sp.)\n\n![Figures](image)\n\nFig. 61.\u2014*Obolella pretiosa.*\u2014a.

Dorsal, and b. ventral valve.\n\n**Description.**\u2014Transversely broad oval; width greater than the length; front margin broadly rounded; lateral margins more narrowly rounded than the front; greatest width about the middle, or a little below; beak of ventral? valve minute, pointed, apparently not depressed below the greatest elevation of the shell; apical angle very obtuse, about 150\u00b0; cardinal slope straight, or sometimes gently concave on each side of the beak, for a length equal to one-fourth or one-third the whole width of the shell, and then imperceptibly becoming curved round to the lateral margins. The other valve only differs in outline by having the apex more obtuse. Both valves are moderately and uniformly convex; the greatest elevation being about the middle, or a little above it. Surface with very fine squamose concentric stri\u00e6. In some of the specimens a few radiating stri\u00e6 are visible. These, however, may be in some instances due to distortion, as the shell is very thin.\n\nSome of the specimens are inequilateral, or have the umbo and beak a little on one side of the median line, and thus present the aspect of a small lamellibranchiate shell.\nLength from 2 to 3 lines; width usually about one-fourth or one-fifth greater than the length. The specimens are often much distorted, and sometimes nearly circular; but all the well-preserved individuals that have come under my observation are transversely sub-elliptical, the width being greater than the length.\n\nThis species differs from *O. chromatica*, *O. Ida*, and *O. desiderata*, in its proportions, and from the first of these particularly in having a thin instead of a thick shell. In this latter character also it differs from *O. nana* (Meek and Hayden). On comparison of specimens, I cannot see any difference between this species and one figured by Dr. Emmons in his American Geology, Pl. I, fig. 10, the size, proportions, and surface characters being precisely the same, so far as I can judge. The Virginian species, as may be seen by Emmons' figure and also by specimens in my possession, is (like ours) sometimes inequilateral. It occurs in Augusta County, Virginia, in soft-whitish grey slates associated with graptolites.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Our species occurs in the greenish and olive-colored slates near the bridge of the Grand Trunk across the Chaudi\u00e8re, and also in similar slates, but of a darker color, at Cape Rouge, above Quebec. These slates are interstratified with the Sillery sandstones, which are at present classified as the upper part of the Quebec group, but the question as to whether such is their true position or not, is considered an open one. The only fossils found in the Sillery, up to the present time, are this species and a small *Lingula* which will be described as soon as good specimens can be procured.\n\n**Collector.**\u2014J. Richardson.\n\n**Obolella desiderata.** (N. sp.)\n\n*Fig. 62, a, b.*\n\n**Description.**\u2014Shell small, moderately convex. Ventral valve ovate; greatest width a little in front of the middle; front angles and margin uniformly rounded, the front margin sometimes with a portion in the middle straightish; the upper half slightly narrowed towards the beak. Dorsal valve nearly circular.\n\nLength and breadth from 3 to 4 lines.\n\nThe specimens that have been collected are all, with the exception of three or four, pressed quite flat. Those not distorted by pressure show a moderate amount of convexity, the greatest elevation being at about one-\nthird the length from the beak. The beaks appear to be depressed down to a level with the hinge line, but upon this point there yet remains some uncertainty.\n\nFrom some nearly perfect casts of the interior, the following characters can be made out. In one of the valves (supposed to be the ventral), a strong rounded groove commences just beneath the beak, and runs along the median line to about the centre of the shell. On each side of the principal groove is a large ovate muscular impression, extending from near the mid-length of the shell a little more than half way to the beak. These impressions are bounded and distinctly defined at their lower extremities by the two small diverging grooves above mentioned. Their outer and upper margins are distinctly defined. In the rostral part of the shell there are two small grooves which take their origin close to the beak, one on each side, and run towards the front, diverging to the outside of the upper part of the two large muscular impressions. The characters of the interior of the dorsal valve are somewhat similar to those of the ventral valve, but the median groove is shorter, and there is a thickening of the shell just below the beak, which presents the appearance of a false area inside of the cavity of the umbo. It is probable that the two small grooves above mentioned are connected with the small muscular impressions, which, in *O. chromatica*, are distinctly seen outside of the two larger. The condition of our specimens, however, is such, that this point must remain open for further investigation.\n\nThis species differs from *O. chromatica* in the form of the muscular impressions, which are larger and nearer the median line. *O. pretiosa* is of a different form, the width being greater than the length. *O. Ida* is much smaller, more convex, and not so nearly circular. *O. nana* (Meek and Hayden), Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci., Philadelphia, vol. 13, p. 435, Dec. 1861, is also wider than it is long.\n\nThe two large muscular impressions in this species appear to converge towards the front in some of the specimens, as in the genus *Obolus*, while in *O. chromatica* they diverge. But, notwithstanding this difference, the large size of these scars, and the general aspect of the shell, appear to be sufficient to authorise us to place it in *Obolella*.\n\n**Locality and Formation.** \u2014 Point L\u00e9vis; in the graptolitic slates, Quebec group.\n\n**Collectors.** \u2014 Sir W.

(N. sp.)\n\nFig. 63, a, b.\n\nDescription.\u2014Shell small, obtusely ovate, greatest width at or a little in front of the middle, abruptly narrowed to the beaks, sides and front margin uniformly rounded, the front slightly less convex than the sides. Both valves equally and rather strongly convex, most elevated at about one-third the length from the apex, thence sloping with a gentle curve to the sides and front margin, abruptly descending on each side of the beak and umbones. Ventral valve slightly more pointed above than the dorsal; umbo narrowly convex; beak apparently depressed to the level of the lateral margin. Dorsal valve obtusely angular or narrowly rounded at the beak, the latter not visibly distinct from the cardinal edge; umbo obtusely convex. Surface with a somewhat shining aspect, with a very fine concentric striae; a few radiating striae are visible on two of the specimens. Shell apparently very thin.\n\nLength of a perfect ventral valve, 2 lines; width, 1\u00bd lines. The length and width of the dorsal valve are about equal.\n\nThis species somewhat resembles a Lingula, but in general its aspect is so much like that of an Obolella, that although the internal characters have not been observed, I think it best to refer it to the latter genus. It is one-third smaller and not so thick-shelled as O. chromatica, and differs from that species in having the beaks depressed down to the level of the lateral margin instead of a little elevated.\n\nIt differs from O. pretiosa in having the umbones more tumid, the beaks not so sharply pointed, in its greater convexity, smaller size, and less proportional width. O. desiderata is larger, and more obtuse in the rostral half. O. nana (Meek and Hayden) is proportionally broader.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014Point L\u00e9vis.

Sides for about one-fourth the length next the beak straight or very nearly so, sometimes slightly concave and occasionally with a barely perceptible convex curve. In the anterior two-thirds, the sides and front margin are uniformly curved so as to give to the front part of the shell a circular contour. Surface with fine but\ndistinct subsquamose concentric stri\u00e6, of which there are from six to ten in the width of one line. Length of largest specimen seen, 7 lines; width, $6\\frac{1}{2}$ lines.

A single valve from the Calciferous sandrock at the eastern end of the Island of Montreal is rather strongly convex, especially on the umbo. It is 7 lines in length, and $6\\frac{1}{2}$ in width, its proportions, contour, and surface characters being precisely like those of the largest specimen from Point L\u00e9vis.\n\nThis resembles *L. curta* of the Trenton limestone and Utica slate, but is proportionally broader.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Point L\u00e9vis; in the graptolitic slates of the Quebec group.

Surface with fine concentric striae, from eight to ten in the width of one line.\n\nLength from 15 to 18 lines; width from 10 to 12 lines.\n\nThe above description relates to the specimens collected in the black graptolitic slates at the water's edge, a short distance below the ferry at Point L\u00e9vis; but in the thin-bedded limestones interstratified in the slates on the road-side near the ferry-landing, others were collected of a smaller size, but with precisely the same form and proportions. The largest found at this locality is 12 lines in length and 8 lines in width. Numerous smaller ones, from 3 to 10 lines in length, occur along with the larger, in the same beds. At present I believe all of these belong to the same species; but should a separation hereafter be deemed advisable, it is proposed to retain the name *L. Quebecensis* for the larger form, which is associated with the graptolites.\n\nThis species resembles *L. quadrata*, but is more nearly oval, and proportionally not so broad.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Point L\u00e9vis.

Area very large, forming an obtuse angle with the plane of the lateral margin.\nDorsal valve gently concave; area slightly inclining forwards, forming with the area of the other valve an angle of about 100\u00b0.\n\nForamen of ventral valve about as wide as it is high, the apical third closed by a thin deltidium. Area of the dorsal valve crossed by a groove as in *L. decipiens*.\n\nThe surface of this species appears to be smooth, but as all the specimens are silicified it is possible that this may be the result of some circumstance in the process of fossilization.\n\nWidth about 3 lines, length 2\u00bd lines.

Ventral valve convex, somewhat flattened in the upper half; umbo narrow and slightly elevated, the convexity extending therefrom gradually widening towards the front; the cardinal angles compressed and sometimes slightly reflected; front half curved towards the dorsal valve with a rounded slope. The area is rather large, somewhat concave, forming an obtuse angle with the plane of the lateral margin. Foramen triangular, usually open, but sometimes with a rudimentary deltidium over a small part at the beak.\n\nDorsal valve concave, with a distinct mesial sinus commencing at the beak and gradually widening forward, becoming obsolete before reaching the front margin. Area well developed, flat, rather more than one-third the width of that of the ventral valve, forming a right angle with the plane of the lateral margin.\n\nInterior of ventral valve with a well-defined ridge running all round, parallel with and at about one-third the length of the shell from the margin. The dental plates are rudimentary, and seem to converge towards each other, thus exhibiting a tendency to form a small chamber in front of the beak.\n\nInterior of dorsal valve with a semicircular ridge similar to that of the ventral valve, but apparently a little nearer the margin. In some specimens a mesial ridge extends from near the foramen towards the front, termi-\nnating at the semicircular ridge with a strongly elevated projection. At the hinge-line there is a sort of foramen passing between the dental sockets and forming a concave groove across the area nearly to the beak. On each side of this foramen there is a small projection similar to those that are seen in the dorsal valve of *Orthis*. It is barely possible that these may represent the divaricator processes, but at present I am inclined to the opinion that they do not. I think the muscles were attached to the surface at the bottom of the groove which passes between them.\n\nSurface with fine stri\u00e6 alternating in size exactly as in *Strophomena alternata*.\n\nWidth from 4 to 6 lines.

Ventral valve very convex, most elevated in the upper half and along the middle, where it is often obtusely carinated, descending with a gently concave or somewhat flat slope to the sides; cardinal angles compressed; beak small, pointed, depressed to about half the height of the valve; area about half the height of the valve, forming with the plane of the lateral margin an angle of about 110\u00b0; foramen scarcely so wide as high; dorsal valve convex with a deep angular sinus which divides the valve into two tumid lobes. Surface when\nvery perfect with fine concentric striae crossed by stronger radiating striae which give to the shell a beautifully cancellated appearance; when not perfect, either smooth or with only the radiating striae.\n\nWidth from 1 to $1\\frac{1}{2}$ lines; length from $\\frac{1}{4}$ to $\\frac{1}{3}$ less than the width.\n\nThis is the smallest species of *Orthis* known in the Lower Silurian rocks of Canada. Numerous perfect single valves and a few with both valves connected were procured by treating fragments of limestone holding the silicified fossils with acid. The form varies somewhat after the manner of *O. Lynx*, being sometimes transversely oblong with the sides subparallel and often narrowed towards the front, and with or without short ears at the cardinal angles. The front is often rounded, but in general it is either somewhat straight or with a wide angular notch in the middle crossed by the deep mesial sinus of the dorsal valve. In the foramen there is seen in several of the specimens a projection which seems to be a large divaricator process, but in others this is not seen.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Point L\u00e9vis.

The shell is moderately convex, most elevated at about one third the length from the beak, compressed near the cardinal angles; beak small, incurved down nearly to the plane of the margin; umbo broadly rounded, projecting a little over the hinge-line. Surface with angular bifurcating ribs, several times divided between the umbo and the front margin, becoming very fine on approaching the cardinal angles, from four to six in the width of two lines at the front margin. There is a very obscure mesial depression, which scarcely affects the contour of the surface but is still perceptible, running all the way to the beak, on approaching which it becomes attenuated to a single impressed line. The area is small, consisting simply of the thickness of the shell; the foramen wide but very low.\n\nIn the interior of the valve the anterior pair of occlusor muscular impressions consist of two small but deep pits of an oval shape, one line in length and half a line in width, situated close to the median line and about their own length from the beak. Above each of those are two very small\npits which may represent the posterior pair. There is no divaricator process, the umbo being simply hollowed out into a triangular cavity, to the bottom of which the muscles for opening the valve were attached.\n\nLength 5 lines; width 7 lines.\n\nVentral valve unknown.\n\nOf this species we have only a single but very perfect dorsal valve. It resembles the dorsal valve of *O. plicatella*, but is not so convex. It differs from *O. pectenella* and *O. subquadrata* in external aspect, while in the interior it exhibits no divaricator process.

Ventral valve strongly convex, most elevated in the upper half; beak incurved down nearly to the level of the plane of the lateral margin; umbo prominent neatly rounded, overhanging the hinge-line; cardinal angles somewhat compressed; area small, concave, not extending the whole width of the shell; foramen small, about as wide as it is high. Dorsal valve nearly flat, gently convex in the upper half, sloping to the cardinal angles and front margin, with a wide barely perceptible mesial sinus; area small, nearly at a right angle to the plane of the margin; foramen small, extending to the beak; the latter scarcely distinct from the hinge-line. In the interior of this valve the margin all round the front and lower half of the sides is deeply crenulated by the coarse ribs. In the upper half there is a low obtuse mesial ridge which on approaching the foramen divides, a branch going to each of the crural processes.

Shell semi-oval or suborbicular; greatest width about the mid-length; cardinal angles a little more than 90\u00b0, rarely rectangular, sometimes appearing to be slightly rounded; hinge-line usually a little less than the greatest width of the shell; sides gently convex, sometimes straight for a short distance below the cardinal angles; anterior angles rounded; front margin usually convex, but sometimes with a portion in the middle straight. Ventral valves strongly and narrowly convex along the middle in the upper half, descending with a somewhat flat or gently convex slope to the sides and cardinal angles, the latter not much compressed. The front half of the valve becomes more broadly convex, but in general the carination, which commences at the beak, can still be perceived, although nearly obsolete. Beak small, only a little projecting over the hinge-line, depressed to about one third the height of the shell; area small, at its base forming an angle of a little over 100\u00b0 with the plane of the lateral margin, strongly concave in the upper part; foramen small, about as wide as it is high.\n\nDorsal valve very gently convex, with an indistinct wide shallow mesial sinus, which in some specimens is scarcely perceptible. Area small, forming an obtuse angle with the plane of the lateral margin; foramen small but well defined to the very point of the beak; the latter scarcely distinct from the cardinal edge.\n\nIn the interior of the ventral valve the muscular impressions are not distinguishable in any specimen that I have seen, but just in front of the\numbonial cavity there is a strong oval or subcircular callosity about 1 line in width in shells which are 3 or 4 lines in length. Above this the umbonial cavity is deeply excavated and the dental plates scarcely at all developed. In the interior of the dorsal valve a lower obtuse ridge runs along the median line from the foramen for half the length of the shell forward, when it becomes obsolete. No divaricator process can be seen in the foramen of any specimen observed, although this part appears to be perfectly preserved in many of the detached valves examined.\n\nSurface covered with fine bifurcating striae from six to eight in the width of one line.\n\nWidth from 3 to 6 lines; length about $\\frac{1}{5}$ or $\\frac{1}{6}$ less than the width.\n\nAs before mentioned, this species is very closely allied to *O. perveta*, the geological position of which appears to be about the Chazy, Black River, and the base of the Trenton limestones. The only differences that can be made out from a comparison with specimens from Tennessee and the figures given by Hall in the Pal\u00e6ontology of New York, are, that in *O. perveta* the dorsal valve is more convex than it is in *O. electra*, and the beak of the ventral valve not so depressed, while at the same time it is more extended. At present I have no means of comparing the interiors of the two species. When such a comparison can be made, should no greater differences be disclosed than are afforded by the external characters, I would be disposed to unite the two under one name. The specimens of *O. perveta* from Tennessee vary greatly in form and convexity, and yet, in all, the dorsal valve is more convex that it is in *O. Electra*. The European species *O. parva* is also most closely allied to *O. Electra*, only differing therefrom, so far as can be determined by comparison with figures, in having the beaks more strongly incurved. Its geological position must be very nearly the same.\n\nThese species belong to a group of finely striated *Orthides*, which made its appearance in the beginning of the Silurian period, and flourished in all the after geological ages up to the Carboniferous.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Point L\u00e9vis. The specimens from which the description was drawn up are silicified shells, procured in the upper part of limestone No. 2. But in the white, grey, and yellowish masses which hold the greater number of the species of trilobites, a species resembling this occurs rarely, but not sufficiently well preserved to enable us to say whether or not it is the same.\n\n**Collectors.**\u2014Sir W.

The ventral valve is remarkably like that of a *Leptaena* or *Strophomena*, but the dorsal valve is that of an *Orthis* externally, while the place of the foramen is occupied by a divaricator process which has so far as it can be seen the structure of the same organ in *L. sericea*.

Twelfth Annual Report of the Regents of the State of New York, p. 39, October, 1859.\n\nThis genus was proposed by me, in the work above cited, to include such shells as those known in England under the names of *Pentamerus lens*, *P. liratus*, and *P. laevis*. They differ from *Pentamerus* in having the valves usually sub-equal, and no longitudinal septa or triangular chamber in the interior of the dorsal valve. Both valves have an area, but in the dorsal it is usually linear, or only slightly exceeding the thickness of the substance of the shell in height. The ventral valve has usually a concave mesial sinus more or less developed, and the dorsal valve a mesial fold corresponding thereto. The hinge line in some of the species, such as in *S. laevis* and *S. microcamerus*, have the hinge line straight and much extended.\n\nAmong the brachiopoda found in the limestone nodules of Point L\u00e9vis there are two species which have all the internal characters of this genus. The form is also the same, except that in one of them, *S. Arachne*, the area of the ventral valve is so much developed as to give the whole shell the external appearance of an *Orthis*. It has, however, the mesial fold and sinus, and the shell exhibits a tendency to vary, by the extension of the middle of the front margin, which is also a peculiarity of the typical species. De Verneuil has described in the Geology of Russia, vol. 2, p. 129, Pl. 2, fig. 1 a\u2013g, a species under the name of *Spirifer Tcheffkini*, which appears to me to be a *Stricklandia*, and to stand between *S. Arachne* and *S. brevis*. The surface is reticulated in nearly the same way, and the form (in a general sense,) is similar, with the exception that the ventral area is very slightly developed, or almost linear. Judging from the external characters alone, for the interior is not described, I should say that *S. Tcheffkini* belongs to *Stricklandia*. Should this surmise turn out to be well-founded, then these three: *S. Arachne*, *S. Tcheffkini*, and *S. brevis* will form a very complete series, leading to *S. lens*, *S. Gaspensis* and others, which constitute the bulk of the genus. I strongly suspect that *Camerella Calcifera* should be referred to *Stricklandia*.\nStricklandia? Arachne.

Dorsal valve depressed, convex, with an obscure mesial elevation; area about one-fourth the size of that of the ventral valve; foramen open to the beak.\n\nSurface with obscurely rounded ribs, five or six in the width of one line, these are separated by fine, sharp furrows, and crossed by distinct concentric striae, from six to eight in the width of one line, giving to the surface a reticulated appearance.\n\nThe largest specimen seen is 3 lines wide and 2 lines in length.\n\nIn the interior of the ventral valve there is a small triangular chamber beneath the beak, supported by a short mesial septum.

(N. sp.)\n\nFig. 78. \\(a, b\\).\n\nDescription.\u2014Of this species we have only discovered some fragments, but these are quite sufficient to show that it is distinct from any that has been heretofore described. The form appears to be semi-elliptical, both\nvalves moderately convex; the hinge line straight and sometimes two inches wide; surface smooth. The area of the ventral valve is about one line in height at the beak; The foramen triangular, and about as wide as it is high. In the interior there is a small triangular chamber just in front of the foramen, with an obtuse tooth on each side. The area of the dorsal valve is somewhat smaller than that of the ventral, and the foramen is nearly of the same size. In front of the foramen there are two indistinct ovate muscular impressions, one on each side of the median line, with a slightly developed mesial septum between them. These scars are longitudinally striated, and there are some faint indications of subdivision of each. They, no doubt, represent the two pairs of occlusor scars of the generality of the brachiopoda.\n\nThe specimens are silicified, and were procured by dissolving nodules of limestone in hydrochloric acid. Several of the fragments obtained in this way show that all the front half of both valves is very thin and fragile, and that in one, most probably the ventral valve, there is a shallow rounded mesial sinus, with a corresponding elevation in the dorsal. This species appears to be allied to *Stricklandia* (Pentamerus) *microcamerus* (M'Coy), and appears to be preserved in the same way, i.e., only the parts around the beak and hinge line remaining. I have specimens of what appear to be portions of the two valves of M'Coy's species, and although the two seem to be closely allied, yet ours has the muscular impressions in the dorsal valve much larger.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Point L\u00e9vis; in the upper part of limestone No. 2, Quebec group.\n\n**Collectors.**\u2014Sir W.

Head nearly semicircular, length a little more than half the width, strongly convex. Glabella irregularly sub-cylindrical, broadly rounded in front, three-fourths the whole length of the head, with a large tubercle on each side at the anterior extremity, and a very minute one on each side next to the neck furrow, the latter extending all across. Dorsal furrows on each side of the glabella very deep, and angular at the bottom as far as the large anterior tubercles; around these and the front of the glabella, not so deep, yet still distinctly defined. From the middle of the front of the glabella, a well defined angular furrow runs straight forward to the middle of the anterior margin of the head. In the bottom of this furrow there appears to be a small triangular tubercle, which gives to the glabella, in some specimens, but not in all, the appearance of having a projecting angular point in the middle of its front margin. The two large tubercles mentioned seem to be simply a lateral expansion of the anterior one-fourth of the glabella, making its width at this place one-third greater than it is at the mid-length.\nThe neck segment is well defined and prominent. Cheeks exceedingly convex, most elevated along the middle or along a line half way between the glabella and the margin. The neck furrow extends all across the cheeks at the posterior margin.\n\nPygidium semi-oval, narrowly rounded behind, very convex, about as wide as the head, but one-third longer; axis acutely conical, strongly convex about three-fourths the whole length and a little less than one-third of the whole width, well defined all round by the dorsal furrows. The axis is divided into six segments, the anterior of which is subdivided by a small furrow which runs across it and extends into the anterior segment of the side-lobes. In the side-lobes there are five segments, the last one sometimes obscurely defined: these do not extend quite to the margin.\n\nSurface of both head and pygidium covered with small granular tubercles, more distinctly developed in some individuals than in others.

(N. gen.)\n\nGeneric Characters.\u2014In the only species of this genus at present known, the head is semi-oval and convex; glabella ovate, convex, with a large elongate, oval tubercle on each side. The facial suture appears to terminate at the posterior angle or just outside of it, and running forward to cut the anterior margin on a line passing through the middle of the cheek, parallel with the longitudinal axis of the body. On this point, however, there is yet some doubt, as the moveable cheek has not been seen, and what appears to be the facial suture may be a fracture. Thorax distinctly trilobed; axis convex; side-lobes flat; six or seven segments; the pleur\u00e6 with a well-defined groove crossing them diagonally outwards and downwards. Pygidium semi-oval, distinctly trilobed, with the axis and side-lobes divided into segments by well defined furrows.\nThis genus is allied to both *Trinucleas* and *Ampyx*. From the former it differs in the absence of the punctured border of the head; from the latter, in the form of the glabella, which has a large tubercle on each side, and is destitute of a rostrum.\n\n**Endymion Meeki. (N. sp.)**\n\n![Fig. 84.](image)\n\n*Fig. 84.\u2014Endymion Meeki, enlarged two diameters.*\n\n**Description.**\u2014Broad oval; length to width about as 5 is to 4. Head transversely semi-oval; glabella convex, depressed semi-cylindrical in the posterior half of the length, then expanding to twice the width of the neck-segment, front obtusely rounded; glabellar furrows represented by two obscure indentations on each side, of which one is situated at about the mid-length, and the other half-way between this and the neck-segment. Neck furrow extending all across. Neck segment convex, and well defined. On each side of the glabella there is an elongated fusiform lateral lobe or large tubercle, separated from the main body of the glabella by the dorsal furrows, which are moderately deep. These lateral lobes are also separated from the cheeks by a furrow distinctly defined, but broader than the dorsal furrows. The anterior extremities of the lobes are acute, and situated on a line drawn across the glabella at about one-fourth of the length from the front margin thereof. The posterior extremities are a little truncated by the neck furrow. The glabella is about four-fifths the whole length of the head. The cheeks are moderately tumid, and crossed at the base by the neck furrow, which runs nearly out to the posterior angle, and then seems to turn forward as if it were continued all round the head.\n\nThorax distinctly trilobed, with six segments visible in the specimen, it remaining doubtful whether or not there is a seventh situated where a fracture crosses the body, just behind the first segment next the head. Axis of thorax semi-cylindrical, very convex, a little wider in the middle than at the extremities; less than one-third the whole width of the body. Side lobes, as far as seen, flat. Pleural groove crossing the pleur\u00e6 outwards and downwards in the outer third of the length, gradually becoming parallel with the posterior side, and then curving slightly forwards.\nPygidium semi-oval, apparently about one-third the length of the head; the axis convex, acutely conical, and of five segments. Side-lobes flat, with three obscure furrows, which do not reach the margin. The pygidium seems to have a smooth border abruptly turned down all round, but this remains doubtful. Surface smooth. About the middle of the glabella there is a small rounded tubercle.\n\nLength of specimen, 5 lines. Width at posterior margin of head, about 4 lines. Length of head, 2\u00bd lines. Length of thorax, 1\u00be lines. Length of pygidium, about 1 line.\n\nIn the specimen, the glabella and the whole of the left cheek are very perfect. A fracture crosses the thorax, just behind the first segment, and it is barely possible that in this place there was a segment which is not preserved. My own impression is, that there are only six segments. The axis is perfect, except at the fracture. The left side lobe is also perfect, with the exception of the ends of the pleur\u00e6, where some obscurity exists. The right cheek, the greater part of the right side of the thorax and pygidium, are not preserved.\n\nThis species is dedicated to the excellent American palaeontologist, Mr. F. B. Meek.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014Point L\u00e9vis; in the upper part of limestone No. 2, Quebec group.\n\nCollectors.\u2014Sir W. E. Logan, J. Richardson.\n\nHolometopus Angelini.

Glabella five-sixths of the length of the head, narrow, and depressed cylindrical, with the sides parallel to the posterior half, then gradually enlarging to twice the width at the front, which is broadly rounded; anterior angles of glabella rather obscure, but apparently acutely rounded. The sides of the glabella are separated from the cheeks by the deep dorsal furrows, which are obscurely angular at the bottom and wide above; they extend as far as the anterior angles, but do not run round the front. Cheeks tumid; eyes small, apparently crescentiform, situated about their own diameter from the posterior margin, and about the\nsame distance from the side of the glabella. Neck furrow extending all across the base of the glabella. The facial suture in its course in front of the eye at first curves a little outwards and then forwards, cutting the anterior margin of the head on a line drawn parallel with the longitudinal axis of the body, a little outside of the eye. Surface smooth.\n\nLength of head of largest specimen seen, about $2\\frac{1}{4}$ lines. Length of glabella, $2\\frac{3}{8}$ lines. Width of head, $5\\frac{1}{2}$ lines. Diameter of the eye, $\\frac{3}{4}$ of a line.\n\nThe posterior angles and margin of the head are not preserved.\n\nThis species closely resembles *H. limbatus* (Angelin), but that species has the anterior angles of the glabella broadly, instead of acutely rounded.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Point L\u00e9vis; in the upper part of limestone No. 2, Quebec group.\n\n**Collector.**\u2014J.

In some specimens several of the stems are in contact with each other, and when this is the case and the stems have an angular shape they very much resemble the coral *Tetradium*. The larger stems are more often straight than the smaller. The true *Scolithas linearis* is generally larger, and the stems straight and parallel with each other. I have seen no specimens of that species in our Canadian rocks, although it does occur in the lowest red sandstone in Labrador, on the north shore of the straits of Belle Isle; to which place our survey has extended. In the Canadian species the individuals are usually irregularly scattered through the rock, lying in all directions.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Townships of Landsdowne and Bastard, Ste. Genevi\u00e8ve Island, near Ste. Anne, Beauharnois, and at various other localities in the upper part of the Potsdam formation. I have also collected this species on the east side of Snake Mountain, in Vermont.\n\n**Collectors.**\u2014Sir W. E. Logan, A. Murray, J. Richardson, R. Bell, E. Billings.\nDescription.\u2014In this species the stems are in general from two to $2\\frac{1}{2}$ lines in thickness, cylindrical or sub-angular, and either straight or more or less curved, crowded together in great profusion on the surface of the strata, and crossing each other in all directions. The stems appear to be simple, or not branched, throughout their whole length, but upon this point there is some doubt, as occasionally two or more may be seen joining in such a manner that they suggest the idea of branching, although it cannot be distinctly ascertained. It is at all events certain that where a stem is well preserved and stands out in full relief, no appearance of division can be seen. It is only where they are closely crowded together that they seem to be subdivided. Some of the stems can be traced a length of 6 or 8 inches, and they retain the same thickness throughout. They appear to have been long, slender, soft marine plants, which by some cause were thrown down upon the surface of the strata in tangled masses, and there petrified.\n\nOn comparing this species with *P. congregatus* (see p. 3) the difference can be seen at the first glance. In that species the stems vary greatly in thickness, and are generally crooked, instead of gracefully curved.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014Near Beverley in the township of Bastard.

Murray, R. Bell.\n**Palaeophycus Funiculus. (N. sp.)**\n\n*Description.*\u2014This species consists of long, slender, cylindrical wire-like stems, about 1\u00bd lines in thickness, gently curved and sparsely scattered about the surface of the strata. Sometimes they are found in considerable numbers lying across each other, but never in such dense reticulating layers as those formed by *P. Beverleyensis* and *P. Beauharnoisensis*. Single stems one foot or more are often seen without any others near them, and being, when not distorted by pressure, very nearly cylindrical, they somewhat resemble a round, smooth crinoidal column.\n\n*Locality and Formation.*\u2014Edwardstown, near Norton\u2019s Creek Mill, in the County of Napierville.

(N. sp.)**\n\n*Description.*\u2014This species consists of cylindrical, rod-like stems, usually from \u00bd to \u00be of an inch in thickness. They are usually straight, and found in broken pieces from 3 to 12 inches in length, being most common in the thin beds of shale between the strata of limestone. They are sometimes more or less crooked, but never, so far as I have observed, gracefully curved. They very much resemble in size and form *P. tubularis* (Hall), Pal. N.Y., vol. i., pl. 2, fig. 1, and may possibly be the same species. At present I think them different, and propose to name them as above, provisionally.\n\n*Locality and Formation.*\u2014City of Ottawa. In the Trenton limestone.\n\n*Collectors.*\u2014J. Richardson, E. Billings.\n\n**Palaeophycus Beauharnoisensis. (N. sp.)**\n\n*Description.*\u2014This species is evidently allied to *P. Beverleyensis*, differing therefrom principally in the greater size and more rigid aspect of the stems. These vary in thickness from 1 to 4 lines, but the most common size is from 2 to 3 lines. They are either straight or slightly curved, nearly cylindrical, somewhat angular, often with one or more deep longitudinal grooves. They cover large surfaces of the rock, crossing each other at all angles. Some of the stems can be traced to a length of two feet. They often appear to be somewhat flattened, and show some indications of branching at an acute angle.\n\n*Locality and Formation.*\u2014Beauharnois. Calciferous sandrock.\n\n*Collectors.*\u2014Sir W. E. Logan, J. Richardson.\nGenus *Licrophycus.* (N. gen.)\n\n*Generic Characters.*\u2014Composed of numerous elongated sub-cylindrical stems springing from a common root, the stems either remaining single or sending off branches at an acute angle.\n\nThe genus *Buthotrephis* (Hall) should, I think, be confined to those fucoids which consist of a central principal stem, more or less branched above, as in *B. antiquata*, *B. subnodosa*, &c. The species which form tufts consisting of a number of stems rising from a single root, appear to be sufficiently different to constitute a distinct genus.\n\n*Licrophycus Ottawaensis.* (N. sp.)\n\n![Image]\n\nFig. 87.\n\nFig. 87.\u2014*Licrophycus Ottawaensis.*\n\n*Description.*\u2014This species consists of elongated slender flexible stems, springing from a common root, and dividing into numerous branches, which are given off at a very acute angle. The stems are from $1\\frac{1}{2}$ to 2 lines in\nthickness, and gently curved from the centre outwards, forming a tuft from 4 to 8 inches in height and about the same in the greatest width. In the best preserved specimen observed, the original stem is cylindrical, and about 4 lines in thickness at the base, where it is broken off. At 1\u00bd inches in height, it is 9 lines in diameter, and here consists of a bundle of from 20 to 30 stems closely aggregated into one solid cylindrical mass. The stems then separate and curve gracefully outwards, forming a tuft 7 inches wide at the height of 4 inches. The length of the whole is about 7 inches. The stems have a smooth sub-cylindric aspect, and appear to have been of a succulent or soft structure, so that, when thrown down and buried in the sediment, they were pressed and partly blended into each other.\n\nThis is a very striking, easily recognized, and persistent species.

Length, 3 or 4 inches; width, across the whole tuft, from 1\u00bd to 2 inches. It is closely allied to *L.

(N. sp.)**\n\n*Description.*\u2014This species forms large fan-shaped tufts one foot wide, consisting of long, branched, cylindrical, usually much curved stems from 2 to 3 lines in thickness. It resembles *L. Ottwaensis*, but differs in the greater flexibility of the stems, the effect of which is to produce wide straggling expansions instead of compact tufts.\n\n*Locality and Formation.*\u2014Manitouwaning Bay, Lake Huron; in the upper part of the Hudson River group.\n\n*Collector.*\u2014R. Bell.\n\n**Lycophycus Hiltonensis. (N. sp.)**\n\n*Description.*\u2014This species consists of numerous sub-cylindrical straight or curved stems, which spring from a common root, and are many times branched above. The original stem divides close to the root into several branches, each of which as it increases in length gives off new branches at an acute angle, the new ones suddenly becoming of the thickness of the old; the latter usually more or less curved. The stems are in general about half an inch in thickness. At five inches from the base fourteen stems can be counted in one specimen on the surface of the rock, occupying a width of seven inches. The length of this group is nine inches.\n\nThis species closely resembles *B. succulens* (Hall), Pal. N. Y. vol. 1, Pl. 22, fig. 2a, but the stems are twice the size. The species figured on Pl. 21 of the same work as an undetermined Palaeophycus appears to be a fragment of this species.\n\n*Locality and Formation.*\u2014Near Hilton Village, Island of St. Joseph, Lake Huron.

(N. sp.)**\n\n*Description.*\u2014This species is found in the form of irregular oblong-ovate or depressed hemispherical masses, one end usually divided into two parts by a furrow of more or less depth. The whole mass is generally crossed by numerous undulating wrinkles, which have a direction transverse to that of the furrow. The more common dimensions are from 3 to 4 inches in length, and from $2\\frac{1}{2}$ to $3\\frac{1}{2}$ in width, but occasionally specimens occur much larger and also smaller. One of these is $9\\frac{1}{2}$ inches by $5\\frac{1}{2}$, and in\naddition to the principal groove exhibits two or three other obscure furrows on each side. This may constitute a distinct species.\n\nThis curious fossil is evidently generically identical with that figured by Prof. Hall in the 2nd vol. Pal. N. Y., Pl. 9, under the name of *Rusophy-cus bilobatus*, but differs therefrom specifically in being proportionally shorter, while the furrow does not run the whole length, as it does in the Clinton species.\n\n*Locality and Formation.*\u2014Head of the Grenville Canal; in the Chazy sandstone.\n\n*Collector.*\u2014Sir W.

The point of attachment is very nearly central.\n\nIn the 1st vol. of the Palaeontology of New York, Pl. 12, Prof. Hall has figured two species under the name of *Streptelasma profunda*. It is possible that the specimen represented by his fig. 4, on the plate quoted, may be an individual of this species, but the figure does not exhibit any indications of a cup, or any external characters to prove that it belongs to this genus, or indeed that it is a coral at all. The other five figures are sections of a species of *Petraia*. He describes *P. profunda* as having the cup extending nearly to the base of the coral, and having from 36 to 60 radiating septa. In the Black River limestone in Canada, there is a\nspecies which agrees very well with Prof. Hall's description, but it is decidedly distinct from the one for which I now propose the name *P. aperta*.

Cup from $\\frac{3}{4}$ to 1 inch in depth, the bottom flat or irregularly convex, and its width (at the bottom) equal to three-quarters of the whole diameter. Radiating septa at the margin of the cup in a specimen $3\\frac{1}{2}$ inches in length and $\\frac{1}{2}$ inch in diameter, about 150, alternating in size. In the same specimen, the radiating septa close to the bottom of the cup extend inwards 2 lines from the outer wall, the latter being 1 line in thickness. In a longitudinal polished section, all the central portion is seen to be filled by transverse diaphragms, three or four in two lines. Surface with a few obscure undulations of growth, and, when worn, with distinct septal striae.\n\nThe specimens are numerous, and vary in their length, diameter, and amount of curvature; some are strongly curved in the lower, and straight in the upper half. The septal fossette has not been observed, and it is\ntherefore doubtful whether or not it belongs to the genus. Young specimens \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of an inch in length, and also the smaller extremities of the adult, are destitute of transverse diaphragms.\n\nThis species in its external characters very much resembles *Petraia rustica* (Billings), Report for 1857, and is found associated with it in the same beds. The internal structure at once shows it to be distinct. I referred it to the genus *Petraia*, and it is figured under that name in the work cited at the head of this description, judging it to be distinct from *P. rustica* on account of the form of the cup; but since that part of the work was printed I have had specimens split by a lapidary, and find that it more probably belongs to *Zaphrentis*.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Drummond Island, Lake Huron.

Radiating septa from 50 to 80, according to the size of the corallite, extending inwards about one-sixth of the diameter. The inner area occupies full five-sixths of the whole diameter; the transverse septa or tabulae thin, slightly undulating, from \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) to \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of a line apart. Surface with about two longitudinal septal striae in one line, the ridges between which are often divided by a smaller stria.\n\nThe annulations are distant from each other from 2 to 14 lines, the most common distance being about half an inch. They are usually sharp-edged, but often in the younger corallites they are either obtusely rounded or represented by mere enlargements of the diameter of various forms and distances.\n\nThis species appears to be gregarious, as great numbers are found on the same slabs of limestone, lying across each other in all directions and broken into fragments from 1 to 4 inches in length.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Ance \u00e0 la Barbe, Bay of Chaleurs.

Radiating septa from eighty to one hundred. These are closely crowded together at the centre of the fossil, but become more widely separated as they recede towards the margin. At $2\\frac{1}{2}$ inches from the centre in one specimen they are $2\\frac{1}{2}$ lines apart; at four inches in another larger individual they are $3\\frac{1}{2}$ lines distant from each other. Judging from the cast of a cup of this species, the septa must be elevated a little above the surface of the disc; the intervening spaces being slightly concave. In several specimens the base, instead of showing an acute point of attachment, is excavated into a cup-like cavity, $\\frac{3}{4}$ of an inch in depth. The central portion of the upper side seems to be only slightly elevated above the general surface of the widely expanded disc. The under side of a large specimen which is somewhat worn is covered with numerous concentric flexuous raised lines, three or four in the width of one line. In another it is smooth as if protected by a dense epitheca.\n\n*Locality and Formation.*\u2014South-west point, Anticosti; in division 4, Middle Silurian.

The young appear to bud from the side of the adult, and also in some instances from the cup. The surface of the corallites is in general somewhat smooth, but in colonies which have had a disturbed growth it is more irregular, being annulated with obscure accretion ridges, and presenting occasional swellings or enlargements of the diameter. In some there are a few lateral projections which connect the contiguous corallites, as in the genus *Eridophyllum*. In the transverse section there are seen about 60 radiating septa, one half of which seem to reach very nearly to the centre. In the longitudinal section, the transverse diaphragms in the central half form, with the radiating septa, a tissue of square or oblong cells. In some places where the transverse diaphragms alone are visible, the cells are greatly elongated horizontally. The outer vesicular area is filled with oval or irregularly reniform cells, with curved sides, and some acute angles, from 4 to 8 cells in the width of one line.\nThis species must be closely allied to the well known *C. articulatum* of the Upper Silurian rocks of Europe, but differs therefrom in not being so strongly annulated, and in exhibiting a tendency to form connections between the corallites by the development of small radiciform projections, as in the genus *Eridophyllum*.\n\nThe colonies are large, and when split open, the long, slender, cylindrical, and parallel corallites (which are always in contact with each other or very nearly so,) present an aspect very like that of some species of Devonian corals from Canada West, such as *Diphyphyllum arundinaceum*.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014L\u2019Anse a Gascon, Bay of Chaleurs : Middle Silurian.\n\n**Collector.**\u2014Sir W.

(N. sp.)\n\nDescription.\u2014Corallum apparently simple, turbinate, curved, gradually expanding to a width of $1\\frac{1}{2}$ inches in a length of 5 inches; irregularly annulated by sudden constrictions and expansions of growth, from $\\frac{3}{4}$ to $1\\frac{1}{4}$ inches apart. The transverse section, where the diameter is $1\\frac{1}{2}$ inches, shows about 120 radiating septa, which seem to reach half-way to the centre. On the outside, where the surface is a little worn, the septal striae are well indicated, and the interseptal spaces divided into square compartments by the transverse diaphragms. There are about 3 septal striae in 1 line. The cup appears to be about $\\frac{3}{4}$ of an inch deep, and at the bottom about $\\frac{1}{3}$ the whole diameter of the fossil. The internal structure in the longitudinal section cannot be made out in the specimens observed, being obscured by crystallization.\n\nThis species somewhat resembles C. truncatum (Linn\u00e6us), but is more deeply annulated. The rings on the upper side project at about a right angle from the side, sometimes $\\frac{1}{2}$ an inch, and gradually slope on the lower side to the narrowest part of the next constriction below, so that the individual is constructed as if several corallites had been set into each other.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014L'anse \u00e0 le Barbe, Bay of Chaleurs, Middle Silurian.\n\nCollector.\u2014Sir W.

Cup irregularly conical, its depth about half the diameter of the corallite; the walls thick; the margin effuse or obtusely rounded, the inner surface of the cup descending with a convex slope from the outer edge inwards. In the longitudinal section the inner area is about one-third\nthe whole diameter; the tabulae thin, much undulated, three or four in the width of one line; the outer area filled with small cells, which curve upwards and outwards, the rows leaving the inner area at an angle of 45\u00b0 or somewhat less, and cutting the outer surface at an angle of from 60\u00b0 to 90\u00b0, or thereabout. There are from 120 to 150 radiating septa, most of which reach the inner area. In worn specimens the surface is strongly sulcated longitudinally by the septal stri\u00e6, and the transverse walls of the cells which fill the intermediate spaces are seen closely crowded together, there being four or five in one line. They present the peculiar zigzag arrangement seen in most species of *Heliophyllum*.\n\nIn size this species resembles *C. angustum* (Lonsdale), but in that species the vesicular tissue forms on the surface, where seen in the interseptal spaces, \"regular square cells,\" whereas, in this, they form zigzag transverse lines.\n\nLength, from 4 to 8 inches.

Inner area about one-third the whole diameter, with the transverse septa well defined but undulating, in some places nearly in contact, and in others separated from half a line to one line or a little more. Outer area with large acutely-lentiform cells sloping upwards and outwards, from three to six lines in length. Surface with a thin epitheca, the edges of the septa shewing, as it were, through it, about one line distant from each other, and often with what appear to be one or two smaller septa between each two of the larger. There are also numerous annulations of growth, of various sizes, the larger distant from four to nine lines from each other, and each being slightly more prominent on its upper than on its lower edge. Fine transverse annulating stri\u00e6, from six to eight in one line, are also visible where the surface is well preserved. The radiating septa are not distinctly visible in the specimens, but they appear to be about a line apart at the margin.\n\nLength from 4 to 10 inches.

Cup shallow, concave, with a small projection in the middle, indicating the inner area. Radiating septa, as indicated by the sulci on the exterior, about one hundred. Inner area well defined in the longitudinal polished section, about one-sixth the whole diameter; the tabulae very thin and numerous, apparently five or six in one line. The outer area consists of an exceedingly compact vesicular structure, the largest cells being scarcely half a line in length. Outer surface with strong convex longitudinal ribs about one line in width, the sulci separating them, sharply rounded or angular at the bottom.\n\nThe only specimen of this species that I have seen is of a remarkable shape. On one side of the cup the margin curves downwards, and on the other, upwards. It is barely possible that the concave extremity which I\nhave called the cup may be the base, the small projection in the middle being the point of attachment. In that case, this species would be a *Ptychophyllum*. The supposed base is worn away in the specimen, so that this point cannot be determined at present. The extraordinary compactness of the internal structure separates this from any described species from the Silurian rocks of America.\n\n*Locality and Formation.*\u2014Anse \u00e0 la Vieille, Bay of Chaleurs.

(N. sp.)**\n\n*Description.*\u2014The specimen upon which this species is founded is cylindrical, 21 lines in length and 10 lines in diameter. In the longitudinal section, the inner area is 3\u00bd lines in diameter, filled with large cells, the tabulae being very thin and not extending across but irregularly coalescing, thus forming acutely lenticular vesicles, from 1 to 3 lines in length, arranged in curving lines, the convex side towards the base of the corallite. In the outer area the vesicular tissue is very fine, but distinct, and indicated in the polished section by two sets of lines, one curving upwards and the other downwards, crossing each other nearly at a right angle. There are six or seven lines in the width of one line, and the cells are on an average about one-sixth of a line across. In the transverse section there are seen about 70 radiating septa, which extend about two-thirds of the way to the centre. The surface is longitudinally marked with distinct ridges, about three in one line, separated by fine deep sulci. It is also transversely annulated by strongly projecting rings of growth, most prominent and angular on their upper sides. Of these there are six in the length of 21 lines.\n\nThis species differs so widely from all the others described in this paper, that a comparison is scarcely necessary. Owing to the peculiar construction of the cells in the outer area, that is to say, curving downwards as well as upwards, I suspect that it will turn out to be a *Heliophyllum*.\n\n*Locality and Formation.*\u2014Anse \u00e0 la Vieille, Bay of Chaleurs.

Surface annulated with several deep undulations of growth, and longitudinally striated with very distinct septal sulci, about four in the width of one line in the upper half, and five or six towards the smaller extremity. The cup is about \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of an inch in depth, obtusely conical, and distinctly sulcated on the inside by the septal striae. In a longitudinal polished section, the structure appears to be very compact, or composed of very small cells, two or three in the width of one line, but owing to the peculiar state of preservation of the specimen these cannot be well observed.\n\nI have some doubts whether this species should not be referred to the genus *Cyathophyllum*, since the strongly striated surface of the cavity of the cup would indicate that the radiating septa are more fully developed than they are in *Cystiphyllum*. The species to which it bears the nearest resemblance is *C. Greyi* (Edwards and Haime) from the Wenlock limestone at Dudley. It appears to be a larger and more strongly striated species than that, and therefore I shall give it a distinct name for the present, provisionally.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Anse \u00e0 la Vieille, Bay of Chaleurs.

Richardson.\n\nGenus STROPHOMENA.\n\nThe following descriptions are copied from a paper published in the Canadian Naturalist and Geologist, Vol. V., February 1860:\n\nIn the Silurian rocks of Canada and the neighboring countries, there are many species or varieties of that group of the genus Strophomena of which S. alternata may be regarded as the typical form. These are all closely related, and yet exhibit such differences that only those naturalists who entertain wide views upon the subject of the value and significance of specific distinctions, would feel inclined to unite them under one common name. The forms of this group most common in the Lower and Middle Silurian rocks are, S. alternata, S. incrassata, S. deltoidea, S. camerata, S. tenuistriata and some others to be described hereafter in this paper. The first of these ranges from the Chazy limestone upwards perhaps to the Niagara rocks, but is most abundant in the Trenton limestone and Hudson River group. It is also very widely distributed, as it occurs in all parts of the Continent, where the last two formations have been recognized, and is also found in the Lower Silurian in England and Ireland. S. incrassata has exactly the same form as some of the varieties of S. alternata but is never, as far as I have been able to ascertain, more than half the average size of this latter species. It seems to be confined to the Chazy and the Black River limestone or the lower part of the Trenton, and has therefore, a geological distribution different from that of S. alternata, a fact which would appear to constitute an additional ground for classifying it as a distinct species. S deltoidea is a Trenton limestone form abundant in certain localities, but not generally distributed. Thus in the\nState of New York, according to Professor Hall, \"it abounds at Trenton Falls and at Sugar River in Lewis County,\" but \"is scarcely known as occurring in the Champlain valley.\"* In Canada it is found at Lachine and at several other places, but there are hundreds of good exposures of the rock in the Province that have been carefully examined, where not a single specimen has been seen, although in all the localities *S. alternata* is more or less common. *S. camerata* occurs at one spot in the vicinity of Ottawa, but I have never met with it elsewhere. *S. tenuistriata* may be collected in the hard black limestone around the base of the mountain of Montreal, particularly in the neighborhood of the McTavish monument, and also at Ottawa and two or three other places, but does not occur at all in the majority of the localities of the Trenton limestone. These three species, therefore must have been capable of existing in certain places only, on the bottom of the ocean during the period of the accumulation of this rock, while *S. alternata* flourished everywhere. Whether or not, therefore, they are to be regarded as distinct species, this much at least seems probable, that they were by some peculiarity in their habits or in their organization, unfitted for so wide a range through the seas as that enjoyed by *S. alternata*.\n\nThe question, whether or not these supposed species are really distinct, cannot be answered until naturalists shall have discovered some general law of life by an appeal to which they may in all cases determine what is a species as distinguished from a mere variety. It is scarcely necessary to state that such a law if it do exist at all may remain unknown to man for ages, and in the meantime nearly all determinations of species from varieties where the forms are very closely related may be regarded as not positively established. The physical geologist is more interested in the results of investigations which show that certain forms are confined to particular geological horizons than in those, whose sole object is to determine the exact zoological relations of such forms. If it be true, for instance, that that particular form of the genus called *Strophomena incrassata* is confined to the limestones lying next under the Trenton in the fossiliferous series, it makes no difference to the geologist, whether it be in reality a distinct species of itself or only a variety of some other species. Its value to him as a guide, while tracing out the geographical distribution of these Rocks, is not at all affected by the zoological question. In demonstrating the physical structure of the country, he can reason upon varieties with as much safety as upon true species, provided that such varieties are confined to and consequently characteristic of particular portions of the geological edifice. It is therefore, of great importance, not only to ascertain to what\n\n---\n\n* Palaeontology of New York, vol. I, p. 107.\nparticular level each variety is confined, but also to determine whether or not such species as range through several formations exhibit any and what change in form on passing from one group of rocks to another. Should it be hereafter proved that the supposed species above quoted, constitute on purely zoological grounds, but one extensive and variable species, still it would be convenient for geological purposes to have a separate name for each variety that can be shewn to be characteristic of a particular geological horizon.\n\nBefore entering upon the description of the new species, I shall give a general account of such characters as are common to all the forms of the group typified by *S. alternata*.\n\n**STROPHOMENA ALTERNATA. (Conrad.)**\n\nIn all the forms of this important type, the convexity of the ventral valve has a peculiar contour which may be seen not only in the Lower Silurian but also in the Upper Silurian and even in such Devonian species as *S. Pattersoni*, *S. inequiradiata*, *S. demissa*, *S. concava*. That part of the valve which is usually called the visceral disc occupies all the central region of the shell and terminates in a point at the beak. Just in front of the beak it forms a more or less well defined low rounded umbo on each side of which there is a flattened or sub-concave depression extending obliquely outwards to the margin just in front of the cardinal angles. These latter are usually reflected or a little curved upwards from the plane of the lateral margins. The visceral disc is somewhat flattened, gently convex or only slightly elevated throughout the greater part of its extent. In the upper half of the shell it is bounded by the depressions that have been mentioned as existing between the umbo and cardinal angles, but in front and at the sides it terminates where the shell begins to be bent down to form the deflected margin which runs all round the edge and becomes obsolete on approaching the cardinal angles. This margin varies in width from one-twelfth to two-thirds the whole length of the shell and therefore the disc in some of the varieties occupies nearly the whole superficies of the valve, but in others, less than half. In the very young shells in most of the specimens that I have seen, there is no deflected margin and occasionally adult individuals may be found, which on a side view give the outline of an uniform flattened arch from beak to front. In by far the greater number of specimens however the deflected margin is well defined. The contour of the front of the visceral disc varies according to the form of the deflected margin and is thus either broadly rounded or more or less pointed. In *S. rhomboidalis*, which also belongs to this group, the front of the disc, and its sides also, are often nearly straight.\nThe dorsal valve is flat or only gently concave beneath the visceral disc of the ventral valve, but all round, its curvature conforms to that of the deflected margin.\n\nIn the true *S. alternata* the areas of the ventral and dorsal valves are inclined towards each other at an angle varying from 75\u00b0 to 80\u00b0, but this angle never amounts to 90\u00b0. It will be observed that in some of the new species hereinafter described it is greater than 90\u00b0.\n\nThe surface in most of the species exhibits two sets of radiating striae, the larger of which are about one-twelfth of a line wide in large specimens, and the smaller half that size, from one to ten of the smaller between each two of the larger, the more common numbers being from three to five. Sometimes also the shell is marked with a series of concentric wrinkles.\n\nOf the above characters, those which are confined to the upper half of the shell such as the form of the beak, the umbo, the concave depressions or hollows on each side of the umbo, and the reflected cardinal extremities, are common to all the species, and in order to avoid repetition will not be particularly dwelt upon in the following descriptions. The radiating striae are also very constant in the aspect they present. The only parts which appear to afford permanent variations of much value are the front of the visceral disc, the deflected margin and the hinge line. The proportional length and breadth of the shell seems also to be of much importance especially if accompanied by a variation in two or three of the other characters.\n\n**Strophomena nitens.

Width on hinge-line from nine to twelve lines. Length from six to eight lines.\nThe beak, umbo depressions on each side of the umbo and cardinal angles of the ventral valve the same as in *S. alternata*. The deflected margin forms an angle of between 100\u00b0 and 110\u00b0 with the general plane of the visceral disc, and occupies on the median line (in all the specimens I have seen) from one third to nearly one half the whole length of the shell.\n\nThe dorsal valve is quite flat, or even a little concave, just in front of the beak, but elsewhere curved to correspond with the ventral valve.\n\nThe area of the ventral valve lies nearly in the plane of the lateral margins, and the area of the dorsal valve forms with it an angle of about 95\u00b0. The height of the area of the ventral valve at the foramen is three fourths of a line in a specimen nine lines wide, and of the dorsal valve about one third of a line. Foramen of ventral valve partly closed by a V-shaped deltidium, the lower open part of which is closed by the strongly projecting deltidium of the dorsal valve.\n\nThe width of the foramen, is about equal to its height.\n\nThe surface is the same as in *S. alternata*, and, when a little worn presents a smooth shining silken lustre.\n\nWhen compared with *S. incrassata*, *S. alternata*, *S. deltoidea*, *S. cam-erata*, or *S. tenuistriata*, it will be seen that this species is shorter in proportion to the width than any of them, and also that the inclination of the areas towards each other differs in forming an obtuse instead of an acute angle.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014This species occurs at Charleton Point, Anticosti, in the upper part of the Hudson River group.\n\n**Collector.**\u2014J.

Width on hinge line twelve to fifteen lines; length ten to twelve lines.\n\nThe ventral valve varies greatly in the amount of its convexity. In some specimens it is depressed convex, and these have almost precisely the aspect of the more flattened forms of *S. alternata*. Others are slightly convex, nearly hemispherical, uniformly arched from beak to front, no devected margin distinct from the visceral disc, the latter occupying the whole of the shell, except a small triangular space at the hinge-angles. Between these two extremes there are individuals which present all the\nintermediate degrees of convexity, and some in which the deflected margin can be detected with a width equal to half the whole length of the shell.\n\nThe surface is the same as that of *S. alternata*.\n\nThe area of the ventral valve is one line high in a specimen fourteen lines wide, and lies very nearly in the plane of the lateral margin. The foramen is as wide as high, and closed by a strongly convex deltidium, the lower margin of which is concave to admit the equally convex deltidium of the dorsal valve, whose area is almost half a line wide and forms an obtuse angle of between 90\u00b0 and 100\u00b0 with that of the ventral valve. The beak of the ventral valve exhibits in some specimens a small round perforation.\n\nThis species differs from *S. nitens* in being in general a little longer proportionally, larger, and more uniformly convex, with scarcely a distinct deflected margin. In *S. nitens* the length is in general only two thirds of the width, but in this species it is always over five sixths.\n\nThe angle formed by the inclination of the areas being obtuse instead of acute furnishes the only character as far as I can ascertain by which it can be separated from *S. alternata*.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Charleton Point, Hudson River group, and also at East Point in the Middle Silurian, Anticosti.\n\n**Collector.**\u2014J.

Width excluding the ears, five to nine lines; length five-sixths of the width; ears one line and a half in length each, in a well preserved specimen five lines wide.\nThe ventral valve is in the small specimens, depressed convex and nearly uniformly arched from beak to front; the umbo well defined, but the concave depressions on each side rather obscure; no deflected margin.

Foramen not distinctly observed but apparently wider than high.\n\nThe detached and empty ventral valves exhibit two rather large triangular hinge teeth, one on each side of the foramen, covered with striae on the outside in a manner similar to that of the area of those species to which Professor Hall has given the generic name of *Strophodonta*.\n\nThe spiniform ears are often either broken or worn away.\n\n**Varieties.**\u2014Several specimens nine lines wide without ears, and others of the same size strongly convex, and with an indistinct deflected margin, occupying from one-third to one-half the length of the shell, appear to belong to this species.\n\nThe species when the ears are broken away has exactly the appearance of *S. alternata*, only that it is never more than half the size.

Length from two-thirds to four-fifths the width.\n\nIn the ventral valve the umbo and depressions on each side are well defined and exactly like those of the convex form of St. alternata. The visceral disc is moderately and broadly convex; the deflected margin from one-fourth to one-third the whole length of the shell, passing into the disc with a short rounded curve. Dorsal valve with the curvature corresponding to that of the ventral valve.\n\nThe area of the ventral valve is a little more than half a line in height at the foramen in a specimen two inches wide, and it inclines a little outwards apparently forming an angle of from 160\u00b0 to 170\u00b0, with the plane of the lateral margins. The foramen appears to be almost completely closed, but this character has not been ascertained with certainty owing to the imperfection of the specimens examined. The hinge teeth are striated as in S. Leda. The area of the dorsal valve is almost linear, or at the most not half the width of that of the ventral valve.\n\nThe surface does not differ from that of S. alternata, so far as I have been able to ascertain.\n\nVarieties.\u2014One specimen has been found associated with the others of this species in which the length and breadth are almost equal. It has no ears, although it is longer in proportion to the width, and yet it does not appear to differ sufficiently to constitute a distinct species. Another\nspecimen has a rounded fold in the front margin which becomes obsolete at one third the length of the shell.\n\nThis species by its projecting ears, narrow areas, and striated hinge teeth is most closely related to *S. Leda*, from which it differs in being four times the size. It has so much of the aspect of *S. alternata*, that at present we have no means of distinguishing it from that species without an examination of the hinge area and teeth.\n\n*Locality and Formation.*\u2014Middle Silurian, Anticosti, associated with *Pentamerus oblongus*.\n\n*Collector.*\u2014J. Richardson.\n\nThe above four species, *S. nitens*, *S. Ceres*, *S. Leda*, and *S. Philomela* are closely allied to *S. alternata*. The three following have the ventral valve concave, and belong to a very different group, of which *S. filitexta* (Hall) may be regarded as a typical form.\n\n**Strophomena fluctuosa.

The cardinal angles more or less compressed and often a little reflected, usually forming angular or\nnarrowly rounded ears. Ventral valve concave, the curvature corresponding to that of the dorsal valve.\n\nArea of dorsal valve lying in the plane of the lateral margin, about one third of a line high. Area of ventral valve forming a right angle with the marginal plane, in large specimens one line or a little more in height at the beak, and gradually decreasing towards the extremities of the hinge-line.\n\nForamen of ventral valve triangular; the width at the base somewhat exceeding the height, completely closed by a convex deltidium, the basal margin of which is rendered a little concave by the convex margin of the similar deltidium which closes the foramen of the dorsal valve.\n\nSurface with a set of fine rounded elevated radiating striae distant from each other usually about half a line, sometimes a little less and occasionally one line. Between each two of these there are from two to ten much finer striae; the whole crossed by fine crowded concentric lines. In most of the specimens the whole of the upper half of the shell is covered with short undulating wrinkles, which sometimes have a concentric arrangement and often form concentric rows converging from the hinge-line towards the centre of the shell, crossing each other. The specimens from the Trenton limestone are usually without these undulations, but in those from the Hudson River group this character is prominently exhibited.\n\nThis shell is somewhat variable in its characters. The visceral disc of the dorsal valve is sometimes confined to a small area around and in front of the beak and along the hinge-line, and in such cases the deflection takes place at one fifth or one fourth the length from the beak. Occasionally a broad rounded elevated mesial fold extended into a linguiform projection of the middle of the front margin gives to the dorsal valve a trilobate character. The area of the ventral valve is in general at right angles to the plane of the lateral margins, but sometimes it slopes a little forward. In some the hinge-line is greatly extended, the cardinal extremities forming projecting triangular ears.\n\nWidth on hinge-line from one inch to one inch and a half Length variable, from two thirds of the width to four fifths or a little more.\n\n*Strophomena deltoides* (Conrad) has the ventral valve convex and may be always distinguished from this even when the hinge-line cannot be seen by the small rounded umbo close to the beak. *S. camerata* and *S. tenuistrigata* (Conrad) have also the ventral valve convex.

Width at hinge-line from one to two inches, length about five eighths the width.\n\nDorsal valve moderately convex, depressed towards the cardinal angles, which are a little recurved; umbo flat. On a side view the outline forms a gentle and nearly uniform curve from the front for about four fifths the length, when it descends with a flat slope to the beak, which it reaches at an angle of from $45^\\circ$ to $60^\\circ$.\n\nVentral valve concave, the greatest depth about the middle or a little nearer the beak.\n\nArea of ventral valve moderate, forming an angle of about $100^\\circ$ with the plane of the margin, its height in a specimen two inches wide, one line; foramen triangular, closed by a convex deltidium, its width at the base about one fifth greater than the height. The beak is not perforated in any specimen that I have seen. Area of dorsal valve nearly in the plane of the margin, its width about one third of that of the ventral valve.\n\nSurface with moderately coarse radiating striae, which increase both by bifurcation and interstitial addition, usually unequal but sometimes uniform in size, from ten to fifteen in the width of two lines, crossed by excessively fine crowded concentric lines.\n\nThis species is allied to S. fluctuosa, but differs in having the areas of the ventral and dorsal valves inclined at an angle which is rather less than a right angle. In its outline it forms nearly an uniform arch instead of being abruptly bent like S. fluctuosa.\nThe dorsal valve of *S. recta* (Conrad) is said to have a slight mesial depression, while the ventral valve is flat. *S. plano-convexa* (Hall) has also a slight mesial depression in the dorsal valve, and is flat or even a little convex in front of the beak of the ventral valve, where this species is concave. It has also a perforated beak, and an area more approximated to the plane of the lateral margins than it is in *S. Thalia*. The three species are, however, notwithstanding these differences, closely related.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014City of Ottawa, Trenton limestone.\n\n**Collector.**\u2014E.

Width on hinge-line about two inches; length varying from a little less to a little more than the width.\n\nDorsal valve very convex, nearly regularly arched from beak to front, only a small space at the hinge extremities compressed, the whole of the remainder of the shell exceedingly ventricose, usually a rounded fold in front which becomes obsolete at one fourth the length, area sublinear, scarcely half a line in width in the largest specimens.\n\nVentral valve depressed convex near the beak, and concave all round near the margin, area about one line wide and forming an angle of about $115^\\circ$ with the plane of the lateral margins. Foramen not observed.\n\nSurface marked with fine radiating striae ten or twelve in the width of one line, every third, fourth or fifth one of which is twice the size of the intermediate fine ones. The whole surface is besides (in most specimens)\nornamented with indistinct concentric wrinkles from one fourth of a line to two lines in width. There are probably fine concentric stri\u00e6, although I have not, (owing to the partially exfoliated state of the specimens examined) been able to detect them.\n\nThis species varies considerably in the amount of the convexity of the dorsal valve and in the size of the mesial fold in front. Some have a wide flat space in the umbonal region, and in such, on a side-view, the outline of the shell rises from the beak at an angle of about $45^\\circ$ only, while in others, which are more ventricose, this angle is full $60^\\circ$ with the plane of the margin.\n\nSometimes the sides are strongly compressed, so that the shell becomes subcylindrical and greatly produced in front, the length exceeding the width. In some specimens the stri\u00e6 are nearly all of the same size, but in general they alternate as in the finest marked specimen of *S. alternata*.\n\nResembles *S.

Ventral valve convex; the front margin and the anterior half of the sides abruptly curved down to form a deflected border, the length of which is equal to one-third of the whole length of the shell. The visceral disc, or all that part of the shell which is not included in the deflected border, is gently convex, most elevated in\nthe middle, somewhat flattened at the cardinal angles. Beak scarcely distinct from the cardinal edges, a little depressed below the greatest height of the shell, perforated by a well-defined circular aperture. Area proportionally rather large, flat, nearly at right angles to the plane of the lateral margins, slightly overhanging the hinge-line. Foramen apparently as wide as it is high, closed by a convex deltidium. Dorsal valve flat, all except the margin, which is curved to correspond with the ventral valve. Surface with about 30 fine, but distinct, radiating striae, about one-half of which reach the umbo; the intervening flat spaces with much finer striae, just visible to the naked eye. A small space on the umbo is smooth, and much of the remainder of the shell covered with small irregular undulations.\n\nWidth of a ventral valve, on the hinge-line, 7 lines; length about 4 lines. Width of a dorsal valve of another specimen, 6 lines; length 3\u00bd lines.\n\nOf this species only two detached valves have been collected. It is evidently closely allied to *Lepticena Loveni* (De Verneuil, *Bul. Geol. Soc. France*, 2d series, vol. v., p. 339, pl. 4, fig. 5), but is proportionally broader, and differs greatly in the curvature of the valves, as may be seen by the figures above given. *L. Loveni* has also a deep sinus in the middle of the front half of the ventral valve, and a corresponding fold in the dorsal.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014The Jumpers, Anticosti.

The visceral disc\nis gently convex and shaped like that of *S. alternata*, but the shell is usually suddenly bent, and the deflected margin greatly, produced often at a right angle to the upper part. The length of the margin and the angle of curvature vary extremely. The surface is covered with fine rounded or sub-angular striae, which are always more or less flexuous. In some, they are of a uniform size all over; in others, they alternate in size, and have from two to six smaller between each two larger. These are crossed by fine concentric striae, and often the visceral disc exhibits a number of obscure concentric undulations, as in *S. deltoidea*. The shell has a silken lustre, in certain conditions of preservation. Our specimens agree so nearly with the descriptions of *S. imbrex*, that for the present it would not be advisable to give it a new name. *S. camerata* (Conrad) appears to be the same species, only smaller and found at a lower horizon, i.e., in the Trenton.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014This species occurs in great abundance at Cape Robert, Anticosti; in the Hudson River group.

The ventral valve is gently concave, and the dorsal as gently convex. The surface exhibits several concentric squamose ridges of growth, and is covered with strong rounded and rugged, often flexuous radiating ridges, which increase both by subdivision and intercalation. Between these larger ridges there are from two to six smaller radiating striae, the whole crossed by very fine concentric lines and irregular undulations of the shell.\n\nIt is with much doubt that I refer our specimens to this species. I have not access to any detailed description except that given by McCoy\nin the British Pal. Foss., and he makes no mention of either the concentric stri\u00e6 or the fine radiating lines between the large ridges.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Prinsta Bay, Anticosti.

Ventral valve slightly convex in the umbonal region, and elsewhere flat or gently concave; beak scarcely distinct from the cardinal area, slightly depressed below the umbo; area of medium size, flat, extending the whole length of the shell, forming an obtuse angle of from $110^\\circ$ to $135^\\circ$ with the plane of the lateral margin; foramen triangular, width at the base greater than the height, closed by a convex deltidium which does not quite reach the hinge-line, but has its lower margin concave. Dorsal valve uniformly very depressed convex or nearly flat, slightly concave at the cardinal angles and with a barely perceptible mesial depression along the middle, which commences very near the beak and extends one third or one half the length of the shell; beak very small and minutely elevated.\nabove the cardinal edge; area varying in size, from less than one half nearly equal that of the ventral valve.\n\nSurface with fine rounded slightly crenulated radiating striae of different sizes, the smaller coming in by implantation at various distances from the beak. In some specimens the striae are more nearly of one uniform size than in others; at the front margin there are usually four of the larger and four or five of the smaller striae in the width of one line. When the surface is perfectly preserved, it is seen to be beautifully cancellated by fine apparently squamose striae, which are undulated slightly upward in passing over the ridges. There appear to be from ten to twelve concentric striae in the width of one line.\n\nWidth of largest specimen collected 1 inch; length 9 lines; height of ventral area 1 line.\n\nBoth Conrad and Hall describe the two areas as being nearly equal. In only one of our specimens is the dorsal area preserved, and in that it is about one fourth the width of the ventral area. The specimen figured in the 1st vol. of the Palaeontology of New York has a width on the hinge-line about equal to twice the length of the shell. In none of ours is the length more than two thirds the width. Notwithstanding these differences, I venture to refer ours to Conrad\u2019s species, as in all other respects they agree with the figures and descriptions.\n\nThis shell is closely allied to S. pecten, and may yet be found to be connected therewith by intermediate forms. On examining a large number of good specimens of S. pecten, I find that that species varies a good deal. In some of the individuals the radiating striae are straight in all parts of the shell. In others, those in the middle are straight, but those near the cardinal angles more or less convex. The concentric striae also vary in fineness from ten to twenty in the width of one line. The curvature of the ventral valve also varies, it being in some individuals gently convex all over except near the cardinal angles, and in others convex at the umbo and concave all round. The proportions vary, the hinge-line being often much extended and the shell narrowest towards the front, or it is equal to or even a little less than the greatest width. The area of the dorsal valve is sometimes nearly equal to that of the ventral, but often less than half the size. The ventral valve is always depressed convex or nearly flat, but never concave except near the cardinal angles. It almost always exhibits a mesial depression exactly like that of S. recta.\n\nNot only does S. pecten agree with S. recta in the form of the valves and characters of the surface, but it varies in the same way, and the two species must be regarded as not only congeneric, but even as most closely allied, if not absolutely identical. The only difference exhibited by our\nspecimens is that in *S. rectus* the deltidium of the ventral valve extends down nearly to the hinge-line, and thus almost entirely closes the foramen, while in *S. pecten* it only closes a small portion at the apex.\n\nSome of the specimens of *S. pecten* have a minute perforation in the beak of the ventral valve, and there are indications of a similar aperture in *S. recta*.\n\nThe Russian species *O. asmusi* (De Verneuil), figured and described in the Geology of Russia, seems to be closely allied to *S. recta*.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014This species has only been found at one locality in Canada, as far as I am aware,\u2014the top of the Barrack Hill in the city of Ottawa, in the upper beds of the Trenton limestone.\n\n**Collector.**\u2014E.

It is a resupinate form, with a gently convex dorsal valve, and the surface marked by fine rounded radiating striae increasing in number by implantation several times between the beak and the front margin, and crenulated by fine concentric striae. The hinge-line and cardinal angles are strongly corrugated by six or seven short oblique wrinkles. The form and surface markings correspond very nearly with the figures and description given in the work cited. Conrad's specimens were from Cincinnati, most probably from the Hudson River group, and ours is found in the same formation, associated with an abundance of *Rhynchonella caper*, so numerous in rocks of this age in the Western States.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014English Head, Anticosti.

The form is semi-\nelliptical; hinge-line equal to the greatest width of the shell; cardinal angles rectangular or nearly so; sides straight or gently convex, and parallel in the upper half; all the front half of the shell broadly rounded. Width 10 lines; length 8 lines.\n\nThe shell is very thin and fragile. The surface is covered with minute closely-crowded radiating striae, barely visible to the naked eye. Under the glass there appear to be about 20 of these in the width of one line. They are slightly undulated; the new ones come in by implantation, and the whole are crossed by extremely minute concentric striae. The striae are of a uniform size, and so small that to the eye the shell appears at first sight to be smooth. On account of the distorted condition of the specimens, I cannot determine which valve is the convex one, but it appears to be the ventral.\n\nLocality and Formation\u2014Observation Cape, Anticosti.

Ventral valve depressed convex, greatest elevation on the umbo just in front of the beak, descending with a flat or gently concave slope to the cardinal angles; the central region either gently convex, flat, or gently concave; a wide concave shallow mesial sinus, which usually terminates abruptly at from $1\\frac{1}{2}$ to 3 lines from the front margin; area small, about half the width of the shell, slightly concave, and a little overhanging the hinge-line; umbo with its most elevated point distant from the beak a little less than the height of the area; beak small, depressed about one-third below the most elevated point of the shell, scarcely distinct from the\ncardinal edge; foramen triangular, its width at the base about equal to the height. Dorsal valve moderately and uniformly convex; a small portion at the cardinal angles compressed and often slightly reflected; area a little less than that of the ventral valve, overhanging the hinge-line; umbo small, obtusely rounded; beak forming a small elevation upon, but scarcely distinct from the cardinal edge.\n\nSurface with sub-angular radiating striae, 5 or 6 in the width of 2 lines in the middle of the shell, and about 4 at the front margin. These striae are subdivided at about one-third the length from the beak, and again at about two-thirds.\n\nWidth of a large specimen 1 inch; length \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of an inch; width of the area 6 lines; height of the same 1 line.\n\nIt will be seen from the details given in the above description, that this species is most closely allied to *O. subquadrata*, and perhaps should be regarded in the light of a variety thereof. There are, however, certain differences which are very persistent, although not great. In *O. subquadrata* the dorsal valve has always a mesial sinus, and the ventral, a mesial fold; the area is always more than one half the width of the shell; the most elevated point of the ventral valve is distant from the beak a little more than the height of the area, and the shell is somewhat larger. In this species there is a sinus in the ventral valve, instead of a fold, and the dorsal valve is uniformly convex or exhibits no sinus; the area is about one-third the whole width, and the greatest elevation of the ventral valve is nearer the beak than it is in *O. subquadrata*. This latter species ranges from the Trenton to the Hudson River group, but *O. Iphigenia* occurs only in the Trenton.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014City of Ottawa; Trenton limestone.\n\n**Collectors.**\u2014E. Billings; A. T. Drummond, Esq., of Kingston.\nOrthis Porcata.

Ventral valve somewhat flat; the beak strongly elevated, usually a wide shallow concavity extending from the umbo to the front margin, where it is often nearly as wide as the whole shell; a flat, gently convex or gently concave slope from the umbo to the cardinal angles. In some specimens, the middle portion of the shell, instead of being gently concave, is either flat or gently convex. The most elevated point is usually from half a line to one line from the beak; the latter small, scarcely distinct from the cardinal edge and depressed a little below the umbo. The area is large, and very nearly equal to the width of the shell in those specimens which have the cardinal angles rectangular, and somewhat shorter when they are rounded; it is also either flat or gently concave, and the upper part slightly overhangs the hinge-line. The foramen is triangular, open to the beak, its width at the base about equal to the height. Dorsal valve uniformly convex, varying greatly in the amount of its gibbosity, the cardinal angles flattened and usually a little reflected; greatest elevation a little above the middle; umbo obtusely rounded; beak small, scarcely distinct from the cardinal edge; area one half the size of that of the ventral valve, with a wide triangular foramen open to the beak, and having in the middle a strong divaricator process: it is either flat or gently concave, and slightly overhangs the hinge-line.\nThe surface in most of the specimens is covered with strong radiating striae, which are twice and sometimes thrice divided before reaching the margin. In the middle of the shell there are about six striae in the width of two lines, and at the margin about four. Those at the cardinal angles are sometimes a little smaller, and often a little larger than the others.\n\nThe usual width is from 12 to 18 lines; length about one fourth less than the width. Height of the ventral area from 1\u00bd to 2 lines.\n\nThe principal difference between this species and *O. subquadrata* consists in the more uniform and greater convexity of the dorsal valve, and in the absence of a mesial fold and sinus.\n\nSome of the specimens are much more coarsely ribbed than others, having only three ribs to two lines at the front margin, and four or five in the middle of the shell. In very perfect specimens fine concentric lines of growth are obscurely visible crossing the radiating ridges.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Trenton limestone at Ottawa and near L'Orignal; also at Anticosti in the base of the Anticosti group, Middle Silurian.

Ventral valve irregularly depressed pyramidal, with a deep rounded mesial sinus which becomes obsolete before reaching the beak; the latter small, pointed, not incurved, scarcely distinct from the cardinal edge, and forming the most elevated point of the valve. From the beak to the cardinal angles the shell descends with a flat or sometimes gently concave slope. Area rather large, its height at the beak equal to one eighth of its length, slightly concave, nearly at a right angle to the plane of the margin, but slightly overhanging the hinge-line. Dorsal valve rather strongly convex, with its front much elevated in the middle by a large rounded mesial fold which becomes obsolete at the umbo; cardinal angles compressed and slightly reflected; umbo large, obtusely rounded, overhanging the hinge-line; beak very small but distinct, situated on the cardinal edge and not elevated; area about one third the size of that of the ventral valve, lying nearly in the plane of the margin, slightly concave and sometimes a little overhanging the hinge-line. Foramen of ventral valve triangular, its width at base about two thirds the height, apparently open to the beak, but this point not clearly ascertained. Surface with rather fine radiating striae, 3 or 4 in the width of a line at the middle of the front\nmargin; gradually becoming finer towards the cardinal angles, one half running all the way to the beak, and the other half dying out at from a half to two thirds the distance.

Ventral valve convex, most elevated at one third the length from the beak, which is small, pointed and depressed about one third below the greatest height of the valve; cardinal area rather large, triangular, somewhat concave, extending to the beak, but closed by a convex deltidium all but a small triangular space at the base. Surface with from twenty to twenty-five prominent, subangular radiating ridges, which gradually enlarge from the beak to the base, separated by the same number of sulci equal to the ridges in breadth and depth, two ridges in one line at the front margin.

Its internal characters are very similar to those of Rhynchonella, but externally it differs in having an open foramen in each valve and the beaks nearly equal. In these two latter characters it agrees with Porambonites, from which again it differs in having the shell ribbed and the surface not pitted.\n\nA small generic group might be made to include P. Ottawaensis and the two species figured in the Geology of Russia under the names of Spirifer rectus and S. Panderi.\nPorambonites Ottawaensis.

Ventral valve convex, most elevated at one-fourth the length from the beak; a concave mesial sinus commences at the front margin and extends in some specimens nearly to the umbo, in others dying out at two-thirds the length of the shell; area small, scarcely one-third the width of the shell, strongly concave, overhanging the hinge-line; beak small, incurved down to one-third the greatest elevation of the valve; foramen triangular, its width about equal to its height. The form of the dorsal valve is similar to that of the ventral, but it is a little larger, and has a mesial fold which in general is only slightly elevated; area not quite so high as that of the ventral valve, and lying nearly in the plane of the margin, but a little curved over the plane; foramen triangular, open to the beak. On each side of the umbo both valves are abruptly deflected, so that they descend to the margin at a right angle. Surface on the umbo and flat space on each side, smooth; three obscurely angular ribs on the mesial fold and two on the sinus; from three to five ribs on each side; none of the ribs reach the beaks. A few squamose zigzag concentric striae are visible.\n\nIn the interior of the ventral valve, the dental plates form two thin vertical septa, extending about one-fourth or one-third the length of the shell. The teeth are well developed. The umbo between the dental plates is hollow quite to the beak, as in *Rhynchonella*. There is no trace of a deltidium.\n\nIn the interior of the dorsal valve, the bases of the oral arms consist of two short plates, concave on their upper, and convex on their lower sides.\nThey are separated from each other by a narrow fissure which extends quite to the beak. Beneath, they are supported by two very slightly developed vertical and parallel plates. From their anterior extremities two slender calcified oral processes extend about one-fifth the length of the shell, curving upwards nearly to the inner surface of the ventral valve. In the cavity of the umbo there is no divaricator process, as there is in Orthis.\n\nThis species is closely allied to *P. rectus* (Pander) = *Spirifer rectus* (De Verneuil) in the geology of Russia, but is not so numerously ribbed.\n\nThe specimens are about 6 lines in length, and the same in width.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Pauquette Rapids, on the River Ottawa.

Dorsal valve a little larger than the ventral, with an obtusely rounded umbo, and the beak deeply buried beneath that of the ventral valve; a large depressed convex mesial ridge extending from the umbo to the front, where it elevates the margin; 4 or 5 ribs on the mesial elevation, those on the outside sometimes subdivided at about half their length into 2 or 3; on each side of the mesial ridge there are from 8 to 10 ribs.\nLength 15 lines, width 17 lines, depth of both valves 13 lines.\n\nVery numerous small specimens from 6 lines in length and upwards, occur with the larger.\n\nThis species is closely allied to *R. capax* (Conrad), Hudson River group, being of nearly the same form and size.

Dorsal valve about equal to the ventral in the amount of its convexity; beak hidden beneath that of the ventral valve; umbo divided by a narrow sinus, which commences under the beak of the ventral valve, and, extending about one line therefrom, gradually divides, the branches being obscurely indicated all the way to the front, on either side of the mesial ridge; the latter convex and moderately elevated at the front margin, becoming obsolete near the umbo, on which its place is occupied by the sinus above mentioned. Surface of both valves with somewhat obscure bifurcating ribs. On the dorsal valve there are two or three ribs in the sinus at the umbo which are extended on to the mesial ridge, and subdivide into from 6 to 8 before reaching the front.

Richardson.\nGenus Athyris. (McCoy.)\n\nThis genus, as originally described by McCoy and D\u2019Orbigny, consists of a large and important assemblage of species ranging from the Middle Silurian up to the Permian inclusive. It appears to be capable of subdivision, and accordingly several generic names have been proposed for the various sub-groups. The arrangement that I follow is that published by Davidson in his Introduction to the classification of the Brachiopoda. According to this, Athyris stands for that group of imperforate species which has A. tumida for the type, and is precisely equal to Meristella (Hall), proposed in 1861. Spirigera includes the perforated group with S. concentrica for the typical form.\n\nIf Professor Hall\u2019s suggestions be followed, then Spirigera must be suppressed altogether and Athyris take its place, and thus stand as the generic name of a group of shells for which it is decidedly inappropriate. I cannot see the least reason whatever for this change, except that it would make a vacancy for Prof. Hall\u2019s genus Meristella. If we follow Davidson, there can be no misnomer, for both Athyris and Spirigera will stand for groups for which they are in no way inappropriate, and no injustice will be done to either McCoy or D\u2019Orbigny.\n\nAthyris umbonata.

Ventral valve strongly convex, forming a continuous curve from beak to base, spiral in the upper half, gently curved in the lower. Umbo large, rounded, very prominent. Beak abruptly incurved down to the umbo of the dorsal\nvalve. There is usually a faint indication of a mesial sinus in this valve, which however only amounts to a flattening of the shell along the middle of the lower two thirds. Dorsal valve moderately convex, most elevated at one third the length from the beak; umbo obtusely rounded, beak concealed; hinge-line curved but distinct for two thirds the whole width. Surface smooth or with many obscure accretion ridges; in a few individuals these latter are strongly developed, but in general the aspect is that of a smooth shell. Length from 6 to 9 lines, width varying from two thirds to eight ninths of the length.\n\nThis species is more elongated than *A. Prinstana*, and has the umbo of the ventral valve more strongly developed. The two species appear to be connected by intermediate links; but in a large number of specimens two groups can be selected having upon the whole a distinct specific aspect.\n\nBoth are allied to the several species of this group found in the Clinton and Niagara rocks of New York, and especially to *A. naviformis* (Hall), which differs in being radiately striated and in having a deep mesial sinus.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Junction Cliff, Anticosti.

The most projecting part of each whorl is just about the middle; above this mesial angulation the surface of the shell descends with a gently concave or nearly flat slope directly to the suture; below the angulation the slope is similar to that above, but appears to be more nearly flat. On the body whorl the angular edge is bevelled on its upper surface by a narrow flat spiral band about one third of a line in width, so situated that it slopes upwards and inwards. This whorl is more concave on the upper side than the others. Below the margin there is a wide shallow concave band about two lines in width, but so slightly depressed as to be scarcely distinguishable. The body of the whorl below the margin is large and obtusely conical, and the aperture appears to have been caniculated or effuse at the lower angle. Surface unknown, but probably finely striated. The aperture is not preserved in the specimen, but it is evidently large, straight or gently concave on the upper side, and with the outer lip moderately convex.\n\nLength about 18 lines; width of body whorl about 10 lines.\n\nThis group belongs to the Lower Silurian group of *Murchisonia*, of which *M. perangulata* of the Black River limestone is the type.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Galt.

Below the angulation the slope is flat all the way to the suture. The angular edge is apparently sharp, and if there be a band it must be a very narrow one.\n\nA fragment consisting of 15 whorls is 18 lines in length; 5\u00bd lines wide at the larger and 1 line at the smaller extremity. Another specimen consisting also of 15 whorls is 17 lines in length, 5\u00bd lines at the larger and 1 line at the smaller extremity. The dimensions of these two (the only ones collected) are therefore the same. The angulation is situated a little above the lower third of the length of the whorls.\n\nThis species is allied to *M. longispira* (Hall), Pal. N.

Above the band the\nsurface descends with a flat slope to the suture; below the band the whorls are uniformly ventricose. The last whorl appears to be about two-thirds of the whole length of the shell. The band has a distinct but narrow carination on its upper side. Surface nearly smooth, but, on a small portion of the shell which remains, very fine stri\u00e6 are visible. The band, as indicated in the cast, is narrow and slightly concave.\n\nLength about 1 inch; width about 8 lines; width of the band on the last whorl about \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of a line.\n\nThe surface resembles a short *M. bellicineta*, from which it differs in the form of the whorls, by being flat above the band.

The second whorl is elevated about half its own height above the body whorl. The two apical whorls are just visible above the second on a side view. As the whorls are nearly cylindrical but a little flattened vertically, the aperture must be transversely oval.

The dorso-ventral diameter at the smaller extremity is 9 lines, but at the larger, in consequence of the imperfection of the specimen, it cannot be ascertained. In 2\u00bd inches of the length there are 19 septa. These appear to be nearly flat or only gently concave. The siphuncle appears to be moniliform, 2 lines in thickness, and with its centre 6 lines from the dorsal and 3 lines from the ventral margin. The surface of the cast is longitudinally sulcated by obscure furrows about 1 line apart, showing that the shell itself must be marked in a similar manner. The specimen is slightly curved.\n\nIt is not certain to what extent the transversely ovate form of the section of this species may be due to compression.

(N. sp.)\n\n**Description.**\u2014Shell small, ovate, apex narrowly rounded; contracted towards the aperture; greatest diameter a little above the middle of the septate portion, at which point the lateral diameter is greater than the dorso-ventral in the proportion of 10 to 8. There are, apparently, three septa. The first of these crosses the back of the shell about two lines above the apex; then traverses the side, proceeding obliquely upwards at an angle of about 45\u00b0 to the longitudinal axis, and crosses the ventral\nat four lines above the apex. The other two are first seen on the side, where they seem to be combined and originate from the first in a single suture; thus united, they ascend the side about four lines, curving slightly backwards: they then separate gradually, and at eleven lines above the apex turn abruptly forwards and cross the ventral side, the greatest distance between them being just at the turn, where they are separated one line. The aperture is not preserved in any of the specimens collected.\n\nThis description is founded on the most perfect specimen seen, of which the above Fig. 148, \\(a\\), is a view of the right side, a little restored. The other three specimens are more or less worn and distorted. From these it seems that all three of the septa are united, or in some way so concealed, in the suture described as the first septum, that they cannot be seen in perfect specimens. The sipuncle is seen in the base or apex of two of the specimens, not quite half way between the centre and the dorsal margin. It is about 1 line in diameter.\n\nLength of the best preserved specimen 12 lines; dorso-ventral diameter at the point where the septum crosses the ventral side 7 lines, and at the most ventricose part below 8 lines. Greatest lateral diameter 10 lines. This specimen is from English Head, Anticosti.\n\nAnother specimen from Gemache Bay (fig. 000, \\(b\\)) is a little longer, and as it is a little worn both on the dorsal and ventral sides, the proportions appear to be somewhat different; but when perfect they must be very nearly the same. It will be seen by the figure (\\(b\\)) that the upright sutures at first separate, and then seem to unite again. This might constitute a specific difference; but on account of the worn condition of the specimen, the markings are very obscure, and this appearance may be deceptive.\n\nIn form, this little species resembles \\(A.\\) Canadense, from which it differs greatly in the course taken by the first septum across the ventral side.\nThis species is dedicated to the eminent American geologist and palaeontologist, Dr. J.

(N. sp.)\n\nDescription.\u2014A cast of the interior consisting of five whorls is twenty-three lines wide at the base and eighteen lines in height; umbilicus nine lines wide, and on inside exhibiting all the whorls quite to the apex. The whorls are sub-cylindrical, gradually increasing in size; transverse section showing the form of the aperture elliptical, the width about one fourth greater than the height. Width of the aperture about eight lines; height six lines.\n\nIt is difficult to say whether this fossil should be called a Pleurotomaria or a Murchisonia. The cast resembles a short Murchisonia with slender cylindrical whorls and a very wide umbilicus. On the outer side there is some appearance of an angulation, as if there were a band on the margin of the shell.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014Galt; in the Guelph formation.\n\nCollector.\u2014E. Billings.\n\nPleurotomaria Valeria. (N. sp.)\n\nDescription.\u2014Large, conical; whorls five or six, very gradually increasing in size, with a sharp-edged margin all round. On the upper side, as nearly as can be ascertained from the cast, the whorls have an obtusely rounded angulation at about one third their width from the outer edge; above this angulation they are flat or gently concave to the suture; below it, also flat, and descending with an abrupt slope to the outer edge. The latter presents a sharp angle of about 90\u00b0. Just below it a gently concave band about one and a-half lines wide. The remainder of the under side of the whorls is gently convex, uniformly rounded into the umbilicus. The aperture, as shown in the cast, is transversely ovate, depressed convex above and below, narrowly rounded on the inside and angular on the outside. Umbilicus about one half the whole width.\n\nWidth 28 lines; height 15 lines; width of umbilicus 14 lines; width of aperture 9 lines; height of the same 6 lines.\n\nThis shell somewhat resembles P. Elora, but differs in being angulated on the upper side of the whorls.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014Galt; in the Guelph formation.\n\nCollector.\u2014E. Billings.\nPleurotomaria Agave.

On the upper side the last whorl is gently concave in the outer half, or two-thirds of the width, and slightly convex or flat above; in some specimens the concavity occupies the whole width; upper whorls gently convex or flat; apex generally rounded. The margin in the last whorl is thin, sharp, and a little turned upwards. On the underside the whorls are convex, most prominent a little within the mid-width where they are obtusely rounded angular. Umbilicus a little more than one-third the whole width, exposing the rounded inner edges of all the whorls to the apex. Aperture rhomboidal. Surface with fine striae curving backwards to the margin.\n\nWidth of an average specimen 22 lines; height 10 lines; width of last whorl, on the upper side at the aperture, 7 lines. The width appears to be from 15 to 24 lines; the most common 20 lines.\n\nP. lapicida (Salter) is smaller and has the aperture more nearly elliptical, and a much narrower umbilicus.\n\nP.

On the upper side the whorls are concave for three-fourths their width; the inner one-fourth next the suture convex.\nThe margin is truncated by a flat band, about half a line in width and nearly vertical, sloping a little inwards and upwards. On the under side the whorls are strongly convex, obscurely angulated at the edge of the umbilicus; there are indications of a faint concave band just below the margin. Umbilicus small; when measured across from the angulated line of the last whorl, it is one-third the whole width, but it contracts to one-tenth the whole width in passing through this whorl, and seems to diminish only slightly thence to the apex. The whorls in the umbilicus are rounded. The aperture is sub-circular; rounded on the inner and lower side, and angular at the edge, its height about equal to its width. The second whorl is slightly turretted above the last. Surface with fine and coarse striae, the latter being minute undulations of growth, about four in one line, all curving backwards to the margin both above and below.\n\nWidth, from 10 to 12 lines; height, from 7 to 9 lines.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014Pauquette's Rapids, on the Ottawa River; Black River limestone.\n\nCollector.\u2014E.

On the upper side the whorls make a nearly smooth flat slope from the apex to the margin, which is narrowly rounded, and shows some indications of a band. Below the margin convex, gradually increasing in prominence to the edge of the umbilicus which is rather sharply angulated. In the umbilicus the whorls are nearly flat, and sometimes forming an indistinct staircase to the apex. The umbilicus is about one-third the whole width, abruptly ascending from the angulated edge to the apex. Surface nearly smooth.\n\nThe whole of the aperture has not been observed, but several silicified fragments show that the inner lip is nearly straight and approaching the vertical, slightly convex in its upper, and concave in the lower half, giving an obscure sigmoid curve. It is much extended downwards, making the depth of the body whorl at the angle of the umbilicus at the aperture more than one-third the whole height of the shell.\n\nWidth from 12 to 18 lines; height from 9 to 12 lines.\n\nThis species is allied to both P. Americana and P. Progne, but differs from the former in having the whorls flat in the umbilicus instead of rounded, while the latter has the umbilicus closed.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014Pauquette's Rapids, on the Ottawa River; Black River limestone.\n\nCollector.\u2014E.

Dec. 1, p. 23, pl. 5, fig. 2.\n\nDescription.\u2014Shell rather large, turbinate, acutely conical; apical angle from 45\u00b0 to 50\u00b0; whorls about six, strongly ventricose, with a flat band in the upper third. The aperture appears to be large and ovate; the inner lip is thin and folded over so as to conceal the minute umbilicus. Surface finely striated. Length about 30 lines; width of body whorl 15 lines.\n\nThis species is about the size and somewhat of the shape of *M. bellicincta*. The principal difference is in the form of the upper part of the whorl. The lower two-thirds or three-fourths of the whorl is nearly uniformly convex, but the upper third descends abruptly to the deep suture. The band is quite flat, and being situated on the upper sloping part, gives to the whorl a truncated appearance. The lower edge of the band is defined by a small acute carina, seldom visible in specimens which are worn.\n\nIn *M. ventricosa* (Hall) the whorls are strongly angulated in the middle, as in *M. perangulata*.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014Pauquette's Rapids, on the Ottawa River; Black River limestone.\n\nCollector.\u2014Sir W.

The surface of the shell is marked with coarse, unequal, engirdling striae, distinctly impressed, from\ntwelve to twenty in an inch. These stri\u00e6 cross the shell obliquely, curving towards the apex on the ventral side. Chamber of habitation unknown.\n\nJudging from the fragments that have been collected, this orthoceratite must attain a length of four or five feet. The following are the dimensions of several specimens:\n\n1. Length 13 inches; diameter of shell at the longer extremity 32 lines, and of the siphuncle 10 lines; diameter of shell at smaller extremity 15 lines, and of the siphuncle 5 lines.\n\n2.

(N. sp.)**\n\n**Description.**\u2014Apparently about one foot in length; section circular; tapering at the rate of from one and a half to two lines to the inch; septa from four to five to the inch, rather strongly concave. The siphuncle is moniliform, the segments between the septa subglobular or ovate, the diameter of each being equal to about one-fifth the whole diameter of the shell. The position of the siphuncle, as shown in three different individuals, is, with its centre, about half way between the centre of the shell and the margin; it is a little more distant from the margin than it is from the centre of the fossil.\n\nThis species, both internally and externally, closely resembles *O.

Septa one line distant on the side. Siphuncle, small, in contact with the shell on the ventral side. Chamber of habitation of moderate depth.\n\nThe specimen is 2 inches in length measured along the curve of the ventral side. Dorso-ventral diameter at the aperture 10 lines, lateral 6 (?) lines; dorso-ventral diameter at last chamber 10 lines, lateral 7 lines; dorso-ventral diameter at the eleventh septum 6 lines, lateral 5 lines.

The outline figure b, is the side view.\n\nDescription.\u2014This species is founded on a simple specimen, consisting of a portion of the septate part of the shell. Section oval, narrowly\nrounded on the ventral side; dorso-ventral diameter (as measured on the plane of the last septum preserved in the specimen) twelve lines, lateral diameter nine lines; diameter of siphuncle three lines, tapering to a point at the apex; length following the ventral curve eighteen lines. Septa moderately concave and crossing the shell obliquely, so that the dorsal margin is much nearer the apex than the ventral, the distances in the specimen, for the septum observed being seven and eighteen inches respectively. The distance of the septa from each other has not been positively ascertained, none of them, except the last, being preserved. The inside of the siphuncle is transversely grooved, and it is possible that these grooves may represent the edges of the septa. If they do, then the septa must be very thin, and closely crowded together, as there are on an average about five grooves in a length of one line.\n\nThe species, so far as its characters can be made out, is a short thick strongly curved form, with a large siphuncle in contact with the shell on the dorsal side.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014Paquette's Rapids; Black River limestone.\n\nCollector.\u2014E.

Glabella regularly conical, its length about five-ninths that of the head; posterior furrows distinct, entering at about one-half the distance from the ocular ridge to the posterior margin of the neck segment, thence running obliquely inward and backwards at an angle of about 45\u00b0, apparently not quite one-third the width; two anterior furrows on each side, represented by obscure pits; neck furrow narrow; neck segment convex, strongly elevated on the fixed cheeks. The eyes are small, and situated on a line drawn across the glabella at the anterior fourth; ocular ridge well defined, smooth, prolonged, with a backward curve outside of the eye. Thorax a little more than half the width of the head; the axis strongly convex and gradually aperting backwards; side lobes flat; pleurae with a wide groove along the middle, a small portion of their outer extremities turned backward. Surface of thorax, glabella, and a sub-reniform space on each side of the base of the glabella, smooth; the border with circular punctures about one-tenth of a line in width, and separated by smooth rounded interspaces half their own width; the punctures larger and more distant at the inner edge of the border; on the elevated part of the cheeks they have a sub-reticulated arrangement.\n\nLength of the head, including the border, 8\u00bd lines; width at neck-segment, 16 lines; length of glabella 5 lines; width of the same at the base 4 lines; length of the posterior prolongations of the border behind a line drawn across at the neck-segment 9 lines; distance of the eye from the side of the glabella 1 line.\n\nThe crust on all the middle part of the glabella is broken away, but the part of it which remains on the side is smooth even when viewed through a pocket lens.\n\n*Harpes Dentoni* has the surface differently marked, the eye more distant from the glabella, and the lateral spines proportionally longer.\n\n*Locality and Formation.\u2014City of Ottawa; Trenton limestone.*\n\n*Collector.\u2014Dr. J. M. Grant, Ottawa.*\n\n**Harpes Dentoni. (Billings.)**\n\n*Fig. 166.*\n\n*(Canadian Nat. and Geo.; vol. 8, p. 36: 1863.)*\n\n*Description.\u2014The head of this species, exclusive of the posterior prolongation of the border, is nearly semi-circular. The border itself is not wholly preserved in the specimen, so that its width cannot be ascertained. The length of the head without the border is six lines, and its width on a*\nline running across the neck segment one inch. The margin is prolonged backwards thirteen lines from the neck furrow. The head is rather strongly convex, its elevation at about mid-length of the glabella being about four lines in the specimen, although a little depressed by distortion. The glabella is strongly convex, being elevated nearly one line above the level of the cheeks; it is obtusely rounded in front, and appears to be nearly as broad where a line drawn through the eyes crosses it as it is at the neck furrow, but on this point there is some doubt as the posterior portion is crushed. The neck furrow is well defined across the glabella, and curves a little forward on the median line. The neck segment is well developed. On each side of the base of the glabella, there is an irregularly semi-oval space, the outer margin of which, is abruptly sunk about half a line below the general surface of the cheeks. This space is bordered on its posterior margin by the neck furrow;\u2014on the outer and anterior side, by a nearly vertical elevation of the crust of the cheek, the outline of the space making an obtusely rounded curve on the outside and then turning inward and forwards to the glabella, which it reaches at an acute angle on a line crossing the eyes. There appears to be a slightly impressed glabellar furrow on each side, which commences at about one line from the neck furrow, at about one-third the width of the glabella from the side of the same, and runs obliquely forwards and outwards, reaching the side at about one line behind the eye. In front of this, there appear to be two small depressions in the side of the glabella, close to the surface of the cheek and opposite the eye. A line drawn across the head through the eyes would cross the glabella at about one third its length from the front. The eyes are small tubercles, scarcely half a line in diameter, and situated about two lines from the side of the glabella. A small thread-like ocular ridge runs from the eye forward, nearly to the front of the glabella, but does not appear to cross the small dorsal furrow which runs round the sides and front. The neck-segment forms a vertical elevation along the posterior margin of the head, half a line in height, and curving backwards gradually passes into the posterior prolongations of the head. These, as far as they can be seen, are nearly vertical, but sloping a little inwards and upwards.\n\nThe surface of the whole head is covered with small irregularly polygonal pits, separated from each other by sharp-edged walls. On the cheeks these pits are, on an average, about one-fourth of a line across, but they vary in size, some of them being much smaller than the others. They seem to be in general a little smaller on the glabella than on the cheeks. Where a portion of the crust is broken away from the front of the head, a cast of the inner surface can be observed. It is covered with small round tubercles, about three in one line.\n\nThis species differs from *Harpes antiquatus*, the only species hitherto\ndescribed from the Lower Silurian Rocks of Canada, in having the glabella more obtusely rounded in front, and in the remarkable characters of the surface, which is reticulated, all over the head, by the sharp lines separating the angular punctures; while in *H. antiquatus* the glabella is smooth or only minutely punctured.\n\nDedicated to Mr. Wm.

The tubes are small, there being about four or five in the width of one line, larger on the summits of the elevations, where, also, they exhibit a tendency to an arrangement in lines radiating from the apex of the elevations. In some of the weathered sections an obscure lamellar concentric structure is exhibited, similar to that of *Stromatopora concentrica*.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Cape Smyth, Lake Huron; Hudson River formation.\n\n**Collector.**\u2014R.

Dorsal valve moderately convex, with a short mesial fold corresponding to the sinus in the other valve. Surface with fine striae apparently four or five in one line with indications of concentric striae.\nWidth on the hinge line 6 or 7 lines. The area of the ventral valve seems to be less than a line in height. All the specimens are imbedded in stone so that the area and foramen cannot be seen.\n\nThis species resembles *O.

The cavity occupied by the animal appears to be, at least in the lower part, not spirally coiled, as in the ordinary gasteropods, but straight and central, with the lip spread out all round, trumpet-like. There is some evidence that towards the apex of the spire, it is spirally coiled, but neither of the two specimens collected has this part preserved. The suture is distinct in the spire, but seems to become obsolete on approaching the lip.\n\nThe specimens are so imperfect, that the affinities of this curious fossil are not very apparent. Even the shell has a different aspect from that of any gasteropod I have seen in the Lower Silurian rocks, being nearly black with a horny texture.\n\n**CLISOSPIRA CURIOSA.** (N. sp.)\n\n![Fig. 167.](image)\n\n*Fig. 167.\u2014Clisospira curiosa. a, side view; b, view of the specimen, looking down upon it from above.*\n\n**Description.**\u2014Aperture trumpet-like, expanded to a width of about one inch; spire central, or nearly so, sinistrally coiled, about five lines in diameter at the height of six lines, about seven lines at the base, or where it passes into the wide lip. The whorls are depressed convex, and the\nsuture, where the shell is preserved, only slightly impressed. The spire is nearly vertical on one side and sloping on the side opposite. The shell is nearly black, and of a lamellar structure.\n\nThe least of the two specimens collected has only two whorls, and part of the third preserved, so that the characters of the apical portion are unknown. The shell is somewhat exfoliated, and does not shew the surface markings. When placed with the aperture downwards, and viewed from above, the lip is seen as a nearly circular disc-like expansion, the spire forming a central elevation.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014Near St. Antoine, above Quebec, in a boulder with Subulites Psyche; Quebec group.\n\nCollector.\u2014J.

Whorls five or six, depressed convex, with the suture slightly impressed, resembling, in these respects, all the other species of the genus. The largest specimen examined, consists of the last three whorls, the apical two or three broken off. Its length is 21 lines, and diameter of last two whorls, 12 lines. When perfect it must have been about 2\u00bd inches in length.\n\nIt is larger than S. puella, but not so slender in its proportions, and it is much smaller than S. subfusiformis of the Trenton limestone.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014Near St. Antoine, above Quebec, in a boulder, with trilobites of the Quebec group.\n\nCollector.\u2014J.

Upper side of whorls uniformly convex; suture distinct; outer side gently convex, most tumid a little above the mid-height; umbilicus about three-fourths the whole width with an acutely rounded edge; inner side of whorls in the umbilicus gently convex. Surface unknown.\n\nThe spire is depressed below the outer whorl, so that the specimen is doubly concave. The width of the specimen is 12 lines, and as the last\nwhorl is broken off, it was, when perfect, probably several lines wider; width of last whorl, where broken off, $4\\frac{1}{2}$ lines; height $6\\frac{1}{2}$ lines.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Point L\u00e9vis; in limestone No. 2, Quebec group.\n\n**Collectors.**\u2014J.

The body whorl is large, forming more than half the length of the shell. The suture is deep and the whorls strongly projecting. Surface unknown, the specimen being a cast of the interior, on which, however, are impressed numerous obscure grooves which cross the whorl from the suture backwards to the angle, and then gently forwards.\n\nThis shell is closely allied to *M. ventricosa* (Hall), but differs in not being so oblique, and in having the shell undulated.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Point L\u00e9vis; in limestone No. 2, Quebec group.\n\n**Collector.**\u2014J.

The whorls are usually nearly flat on the upper side, the surface forming a straight slope from the acute apex to the angular margin of the body-whorl; sometimes gently convex with a tendency to become slightly concave in the lower half. On the under side the most convex part of the whorl is close to the umbilicus, the edge of which is obtusely rounded angular. From the margin to the umbilicus the whorls are depressed convex. The margin of the body-whorl is somewhat acutely angular, narrowly rounded. The umbilicus is wide, being at\nleast half the whole width. Surface with fine stri\u00e6, which curve backwards from the suture to the margin, and then forwards to the umbilicus. The specimens usually show numerous shallow undulations following the course of the fine stri\u00e6.\n\nWidth of a large specimen 18 lines.\n\nBesides the form above described there are several others, which are either varieties, or closely allied species.

It is possible that the specimen may be a little distorted by lateral compression. The diameter of the siphuncle is about half a line, and its section is not quite circular, being flattened on the ventral side, where it is in contact with the shell. The curvature of the ventral side, so far as it can be ascertained, for the portion preserved, is that of a circle with a radius of 15 lines. It is probably more sharply curved near the apex.\n\nThis species differs from all the ordinary forms of this genus found in the Lower Silurian rocks of Canada in its slender proportions and comparatively distant septa.

The septa, measured on the surface on the ventral side near the chamber of habitation, are about half a line distant, but on the dorsal side near the apex they must be much closer together.\n\nAssociated with the two specimens represented by fig. 179, in the same rock, were found two other fragments. One of these fragments shows a section of the siphuncle, and that its position is in contact with the shell on the dorsal side, while its dorso-ventral diameter is about three-fourths the lateral diameter of the shell. In a polished longitudinal section through this fragment, there are ten septa in the length of two lines. This would be double the number shown by the other in the same space, but in this latter the measurement gives the distance on the surface where they (the septa) come out obliquely, and are consequently not so approximated.\n\nThis species must be very closely allied to C. typica. The septa, as shown by one of the fragments of the former, are the same in number, in the same length as the grooves on the inside of the siphuncle of the latter.\nThe siphuncle of this species is larger than that of the other. The transverse sections differ in being more narrowly rounded on the ventral than on the dorsal aspect in *C. typica*, while in *C. Mercurius* both the ventral and dorsal sides have the same form of convexity.\n\nThe specimens are, however, very imperfect, and further, discoveries may render some modifications of the descriptions of these two remarkable cephalopods necessary.\n\nThe dorso-ventral diameter of one of these specimens next to the chamber of habitation is 9 lines; lateral diameter 6 lines; dorso-ventral diameter of the siphuncle in the same specimen 4 lines; lateral diameter 3 lines.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Point L\u00e9vis; limestone of the Quebec group.\n\n**Collectors.**\u2014R.

The eyes appear to be small, and situated on a line drawn across the glabella, a little behind the anterior third. They are distant from the dorsal furrow about one-fourth the width of the glabella, and have a well defined ocular ridge.\n\nLength of the best preserved glabella 7 lines; width at neck segment 5\u00bd lines; width at the front margin 4 lines; width of the margin of the head in front of the glabella 1 line; distance of the eye from the side of the glabella 1\u00bd lines.\n\nThe form of the glabella in this species is almost exactly the same as that of *D. Devinei*, and yet I think the two are distinct, for the following reasons:\n\nOne of the specimens of *D. Devinei* shows that the margin of the head in front of the glabella has a width equal to one-half the whole length of the glabella, whereas in this species it is only one-seventh.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Point L\u00e9vis, in limestone No. 1; Quebec group.\n\n**Collector.**\u2014T.

The front margin of the head is gently convex, and has a width equal to nearly one-third the length of the glabella. It has a row of small punctures, at one-third its width from the glabella, as there is in *D. Owensi*. There do not appear to be any glabellar furrows. The glabella is very gently convex, and there does not seem to be any marginal rim to the front of the head.\n\nThe pygidium, found with it, is convex and has a broad obtusely conical axis, one-third the whole width and two-thirds the whole length. Front margin gently convex, and all behind the angles uniformly rounded. Length two-thirds the width. Both axis and side lobes are nearly smooth, but exhibit faint indications of segmentation. It is not at all certain that this pygidium belongs to the species.\nThis may be only a variety of *D. Oweni*; but owing to the greater proportional width and smoothness of the glabella, and the absence of a marginal rim to the head, it has a different aspect.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Point L\u00e9vis; in limestone No. 2, Quebec group.\n\n**Collector.**\u2014T.

Neck furrow extending all across and turned forwards at the extremities, not quite reaching the dorsal furrows; posterior furrows, with their anterior extremities, a little behind the middle, extending across with a strong backward curve; anterior furrows, with their anterior extremities, just behind a line drawn across at the anterior third, then curving backwards, sometimes absent or only impressed near the sides. In general all the furrows terminate without reaching the sides of the glabella. The dorsal furrow is distinctly impressed, but very narrow. The eyes are small, their centres situated just in front of the mid-length, and almost in contact with the side of the glabella. The anterior margin of the head is narrow, thin, and turned upwards, as it is in *D. Hisingeri*.\n\nLength of glabella 5 lines; width 4 lines; width of the front margin of the head \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) a line.\n\nThis species, together with the two that I have placed in the genus *Arionellus*, under the names *A. cylindricus* and *A. subclavatus*, will certainly fall into the newly proposed genus *Ptychaspis*,\u2020 if that generic name be sustained. *Ptychaspis* seems to me to differ scarcely at all from *Bathynotus*.\u2021 A species, almost identical with *D.

The width of the front margin of the head before the glabella, is one-fourth the length of the glabella, and has a depressed convex rim, one line wide, in a specimen in which the glabella is five and a half lines in length. The eye is somewhat larger than that of *D. Sesostris*, and with its centre situated just behind a line drawn across the head at the mid-length.\n\nThese differences give to the glabella a distinct aspect, but further discoveries may show that this, with the one mentioned as occurring at Whitehall, in New York, are all varieties of *D.

The posterior margin of the pygidium is not preserved in the specimen. Axis short, conical, convex, with apparently three rounded segments, besides a terminal one, which is triangular and gradually merges into the general surface behind. Side lobes gently convex in the central region, gradually becoming flat behind. There are four depressed convex ribs on each side, all spreading a little outwards.\n\nLength 6 lines, and as the posterior margin is not preserved, when perfect it was a little longer; greatest width, on a line drawn across at 4 lines from the front margin 9 lines; length of axis about 3 lines; width of the same at the front margin 2 lines.\n\nAs before stated, this pygidium resembles that of *D. magnificus*. It differs in having the ribs at the side nearly flat and considerably divergent, giving a much greater proportional width.\n\n*Locality and Formation.*\u2014Phillipsburgh; (limestone) B 2, section Geo. of Can., p. 844, Quebec group.\n\n*Collector.*\u2014Dr. J.

(N. sp.)\n\nDescription.\u2014Glabella small, truncato-conical, narrowed towards the front, moderately convex, the outline on a side view nearly straight, or gently convex for two-thirds the length, then abruptly curved down to the front; sides nearly straight, converging forwards; front gently convex, or nearly straight in the middle; anterior angles narrowly rounded; neck furrow extending all across, the extremities turned forwards, but scarcely touching the dorsal furrow; anterior furrows represented by two small oblique pits on each side; neck segment wide, a little turned forwards at the ends. The margin of the head in front of the glabella, is in width about one-sixth of the length of the glabella, and has a thickened rim or border.\n\nLength of largest glabella seen $3\\frac{1}{2}$ lines; width at the neck segment 3 lines; width at the front $2\\frac{1}{2}$ lines; width of the margin, in front of the glabella $\\frac{3}{4}$ of a line.\n\nThis species is of the same type with D. Sesostris, but differs from it in being always smaller, in having the glabella narrowed towards the front, or truncato-conical instead of oblong, and in the form of the glabellar furrows which do not extend across, but are small but distinct pits. It is more common than D. Sesostris.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014Point L\u00e9vis; limestone, No. 1; Quebec group.\n\nCollectors.\u2014Sir W. E. Logan, T. Devine, Esq., J. Richardson, R. Bell.\n\nGenus Loganellus. (Devine.)\n\nGeneric Characters.\u2014The trilobites, for which this genus was proposed, are ovate, with a conical or sub-cylindrical glabella, having two or three more or less distinctly marked, usually oblique furrows on each side; facial suture behind the eye curving outwards, and cutting the posterior margin inside of the angle; in front of the eye, also curving more or less outward to the front margin. Thorax broad; side lobes flat; pleur\u00e6 about twelve; pleural groove running along the middle, nearly to the extremities. Pygidium with a well-defined axis; side lobes depressed, and with from four to six ribs.\n\nThe genus is allied to both Olenus and Dikelocephalus. It differs from the former in being composed of larger species, and in having the facial suture curving outwards in front of the eye. Angelin has described the Swedish species of Olenus under eight sub-genera, and this might\nform a ninth, differing as much from any of them as they do from each other. Several of those which I have placed in *Dikeloccephalus* will probably fall into this genus, if it shall be sustained, but at present I do not wish to change their generic references until more is known about them. The typical species of *Dikeloccephalus* have the last glabellar furrow, and sometimes the second one, extending all across. This genus was proposed by Mr. Devine, in April, 1863, but the species was placed provisionally in the genus *Olenus*. I think it best to leave it there until we shall have obtained more information concerning the affinities of the numerous species of this group, now only known to us by fragments. It seems probable that some of the species from the Potsdam sandstone, referred by Dr. Shumard and Prof. Hall, to *Conocephalites*, may belong to *Loganellus*.

These rocks form a belt of low country lying along the coast and extending inland to the foot of a range of mountains which, at least in the southern part, are composed of Laurentian gneiss. The width of this belt, of Silurian rock, for about 100 miles north of Bonne Bay appears to be from 5 to 10 miles, but further north it becomes broader, and may spread across to the eastern shore of the island.\n\nThe fossils, as well as the stratigraphical position, shew that these rocks belong to the Potsdam and Quebec groups. The Potsdam group has here a thickness of about 2000 feet, and is composed, for the greater part, of sandstones, quartzites and slates, the remainder being dolomites and limestones. The Quebec group is 6600 feet in thickness, the lower 3200 feet, consisting almost altogether of limestones above which there is a deposit of 1400 feet of sandstones, slates and conglomerate limestones, and this in its turn, is overlaid by 2000 feet of greenish sandstones and red shales. The following table of the different members of this series of rocks is abridged from the measured sections published in the Geology of Canada, on pages 865\u2013868, 869\u2013871, and 879:\n\n**QUEBEC GROUP.**\n\n| Division | Description                                                                 | Thickness |\n|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Q.       | Greenish sandstones and red shales...Sillery                                | 2000      |\n| P.       | Grey and white limestone conglomerates with much black shale.

The volume of the same strata in the region further north is not so great. The Potsdam group at the Straits of Belle Isle, for instance, is only 11-47 feet in thickness, whereas at Bonne Bay it is 2020, the difference being made up by a greater development of shale at the latter locality. Divisions O and P were measured at Cow Head, and the greenish sandstones and red shales of Q at the south arm of Bonne Bay. For further details relating to the structure of the whole region, from Bonne Bay to the Straits of Belle Isle, reference must be made to the Geology of Canada.\n\nFor a catalogue of the fossils and remarks on their distribution, see the end of this article.\n\nProtozoa.\n\nAmong the fossils collected in the limestones of the Quebec group, in the northern part of Newfoundland, are fragments of several species resembling, in their external characters, many of those of the Mesozoic rocks, which are usually considered to be sponges. The specimens are so imperfect that their internal structure cannot be determined with anything like the precision required to decide upon their true position. They appear to me, however, to differ from all the known genera, and I shall therefore dispose of them provisionally, for the present, as follows:\n\nGenus Calathium. (N. gen.)\n\nGeneric characters.\u2014The species for the reception of which this genus is proposed, have a cylindro-turbinate form, and are perforated by small tubular canals, which are arranged in longitudinal and transverse rows,\nso as to give to the mass a more or less regularly reticulated appearance. The apertures of the canals are round, oval, or quadrangular. The cup seems to be deep. Structure of the partitions between the canals, unknown.\n\n**Calathium formosum.** (N. sp.)\n\n![Fig. 192.](image1)\n\n![Fig. 193.](image2)\n\n*Fig. 192.\u2014Calathium formosum.*\n*Fig. 193.\u2014C\u2014affine.*\n\n**Description.**\u2014The only specimen of this species, that has been collected, is cylindro-turbinate, length 21 lines, diameter at the larger extremity 14 lines, and at the smaller 4 lines. The apertures are nearly 1 line wide in the upper part, and half their own width distant from each other. In the lower part they are somewhat smaller and closer together. The longitudinal rows ascend obliquely, inclining a little to the left. The transverse rows cross the others at right angles.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014G, Cape Norman, Newfoundland: Quebec group.\n\n**Collector.**\u2014J. Richardson.\n\n**Calathium affine.** (N. sp.)\n\n*Fig. 193.*\n\n**Description.**\u2014The specimen is about 9 lines in length, and tapers from 9 lines in diameter at the larger end, to 3 lines at the smaller. There are six transverse rows of tubes in three lines. The longitudinal rows appear to be somewhat more numerous, but owing to the condition of preservation they are not clearly seen. The fossil seems to be composed of a series of rough transverse plates, but this is owing to the circumstance of the partitions between the longitudinal rows having been destroyed.\n\nThis species seems to be quite distinct from *C. formosum*, in having the tubes smaller and closer together, and in tapering more abruptly.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014G, Cape Norman, Newfoundland: Quebec group.\n\n**Collector.**\u2014J. Richardson.\nCalathium Anstedi. (N. sp.)\n\nFig. 194.\u2014Calathium Anstedi. A fragment consisting of two individuals growing from the same base.\n\nDescription.\u2014Turbinate, conical, expanding to the width of sixteen lines in a length of two inches, several individuals sometimes growing from the same base. Cup deep and narrow. Surface (and probably the whole mass) reticulated with nearly square canals, of which there are from four to six in the width of two lines, the apertures separated by thin walls, about one-fourth of a line in thickness. The rows of pores ascend the sides in straight lines, or nearly straight. The transverse rows are at right angles to the vertical rows.\n\nOf this species only three specimens were collected, the best preserved of which is represented by fig. 194. This consists of the lower portions of two individuals which grew together. Length of the largest 2 inches; width at the upper extremity (broken off) 16 lines. The cup at this place seems to be 6 lines in diameter, and the walls 4 lines in thickness.\n\nAnother specimen is 2\u00bd inches across the larger extremity, and must have been from 5 to 6 inches in length.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014II, Pistolet Bay on Schooner Island, Newfoundland: Quebec group.\n\nCollector.\u2014J. Richardson.\nCALATHIUM FITTONI. (N. sp.)\n\nFig. 195.\n\nFig. 195.\u2014Calathium Fittoni. A fragment of the inside of the cup.\n\nDescription.\u2014Elongate, apparently sub-cylindrical, gradually expanding. There are five or six vertical rows of canals in a width of six lines, and about the same number of transverse rows. The apertures are sub-ovate or sub-quadrangular. The walls between the vertical rows are about half a line in thickness, but those between the transverse rows are not so thick.\n\nThis species, judging from several fragments, is more than 4 inches in length, and probably 2 inches in greatest width. It may belong to a different genus.\n\nThe best specimen is a fragment of the inside of the cup. It is represented in fig. 195.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014K, Point Rich, Newfoundland: Quebec group.\n\nCollector.\u2014J. Richardson.\n\nGENUS TRACHYUM. (N. gen.)\n\nGeneric characters.\u2014The species on which this genus is proposed have a close texture without large canals. One of the species has a deep cup, but the other is a rudely cylindrical mass without any internal cavity. As it is evidently a fragment, it is most probably the basal portion broken off below the cup. In case it should turn out to belong to a different genus, I beg that the name may be retained for species congeneric with the best preserved of our specimens, T. Cyathiforme.\n\nTRACHYUM CYATHIFORME. (N. sp.)\n\nFig. 196.\n\nFig. 196.\u2014Trachyum Cyathiforme. Two views of the same specimen.\nDescription.\u2014Obtusely turbinate, expanding to the width of twelve lines at a height of nine lines; base obtusely rounded; cup wide and deep; walls thin. The substance appears to be composed of thin parallel fibres running from the base upwards, about twelve in the width of one line. The thickness of the walls in a specimen nine lines in height and twelve in width is about one line at the margin, and two lines at the bottom. The cup therefore occupies nearly the whole bulk.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014G, Cape Norman, Newfoundland: Quebec group.\n\nCollector.\u2014J. Richardson.\n\nTrachyum rugosum. (N. sp.)\n\nDescription.\u2014The only specimen collected is a rudely cylindrical mass three inches in length and eighteen lines in diameter. It has three or four deep engirdling constrictions, and is composed of the same fibrous structure as T. Cyathiforme, with which it was found in the same bed.\n\nThe above name is proposed for it provisionally.\n\nZoophyta.\n\nIt is remarkable that throughout so vast a series of fossiliferous limestones as that of the Quebec group, there should be an almost total absence of corals. Four species only have been detected, and these are represented by only eleven fragments, in a collection of fossils which numbers more than a thousand specimens. Of these, the only one that can be certainly determined is Stenopora fibrosa (Goldfuss); one good specimen was found in Division H, at Table Head, and another in P, Cow Head: the latter at least 2000 feet above the former. At Cow Head there were collected some fragments of what seems to be a species of Petraia allied to P. corniculum, but the specimens are very obscurely preserved, and it is quite possible that they may belong to one of the genera of sponges, Archeocyathus or Culatham.\n\nThe other two species appear to belong to the genus Stromatopora. They are the following:\n\nStromatopora compacta. (Billings.)\n\nA single specimen, not distinguishable from this species (see ante, p. 55,) was found in Division L, at Point Rich.\nSTROMATOPORA RUGOSA. (Hall.)\n\nSpecimens of a species, which appears to be only a variety of *S. rugosa*, were collected in Division G, Cape Norman.\n\nI have placed the genus *Stromatopora* here instead of among the Sponges, as it appears to me, from some recent examinations that I have made, to be a coral allied to *Fistulipora*.\n\nCRINOIDE\u00c6.\n\nA few fragments of crinoidal columns were collected at different levels, from Division G, upwards. No remains of *Cystidea* were collected, and only one star-fish,\u2014described below.\n\nASTERIAD\u00c6.\n\nSTENASTER HUXLEYI. (N. sp.)\n\n![Fig. 197. \u2014 Stenaster Huxleyi. View of the upper side of the only specimen collected.]\n\n*Description.*\u2014Deeply stellate, four or five inches across; body small, less than half an inch in diameter; rays long, flexuous, sub-cylindrical, apparently angulated along the medium line on the upper side, uniformly tapering to an acute point. On the dorsal side the rays are covered by a multitude of small sub-angular plates, each from one-fourth to one-third of a line wide. The central part of the body is not well preserved in the\nonly specimen collected; but it is evident from a view of the plates which remain, that they are here larger and more convex than those of the rays.\n\nDiameter of the body 5 lines. Length of each ray $1\\frac{1}{2}$ inches. Width of the rays at their junction with the body 3 lines. Depth of the rays from the dorsal to the ventral side of the body apparently somewhat less than the width. The total breadth of the specimen, if the rays were straightened out, would thus be about $4\\frac{1}{2}$ inches.\n\nFrom the manner in which the rays are curved, it is evident that they possessed a considerable amount of flexibility. The specimen is somewhat distorted by pressure, but a small portion of one of the rays near the body seems to retain its natural shape, and it is here obtusely angulated along the median line. The transverse section of the ray should be, therefore, sub-pentagonal. There is still, however, some doubt on this point. The under side is unknown.\n\nDedicated to the distinguished Naturalist Prof. T. H. Huxley.\n\nFormation and Locality.\u2014Point Rich, Newfoundland: Quebec group.\n\nCollector.\u2014J.

Views of two specimens.\nDescription.\u2014Very elongate, ovate; width to the length about as 9 to 24; front broadly rounded, with a portion in the middle straight; sides straight and parallel; apex of dorsal valve about 90\u00b0; cardinal slopes on each side of the beak nearly straight, or gently convex, forming an obtuse rounded angle with the sides at about one-fourth the length. The shell is strongly convex in the upper half, and wedge-shaped in the lower half. Surface concentrically marked, with fine striae, and a few obscure radiating lines, as in most species of this genus.\n\nLength of large specimen 2 inches; width 9 lines. This species is closely allied to *L. Philomela* (aute, p. 49), but has the sides straighter, is proportionately more convex in the upper half, and is destitute of the groove along the median line.\n\nIt is not so nearly pentagonal as *L. Lyelli*.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014N, Table Head, Newfoundland: Quebec group.\n\nCollector.\u2014J. Richardson.\n\n**LINGULA IOLE.

Cyane.* a, b, c, d, views of four different specimens.\n\nDescription.\u2014Shell small, ovate, ventral valve longer and more acute in the rostral half than the dorsal; apical angle from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0; greatest width usually at about one-fourth the length from the front, thence tapering to the beaks with gently convex sides; front angles evenly rounded; front margin obtusely rounded. Dorsal valve with the beak obtuse, and a rather convex umbo. Both valves rather strongly and uniformly convex; the ventral valve sometimes obscurely carinated on approaching the beak. Surface obscurely striated, presenting a somewhat smooth shining aspect.\n\nLength of ventral valve $3\\frac{1}{2}$ lines; width $2\\frac{1}{2}$ lines. Length of dorsal valve $2\\frac{3}{4}$ lines; width $2\\frac{1}{2}$ lines.\n\nThis species is closely allied to *L. Cyane*, and occurs along with it in the same beds, but differs in being more uniformly convex, in not being so wide, and in not presenting the sub-pentagonal aspect of that species.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014P, four miles north-east from Portland Creek, Newfoundland: Quebec group.\n\nCollector.\u2014J. Richardson.\nLINGULA CYANE. (N. sp.)\n\nFig. 200, a\u2013d.\n\nDescription.\u2014Shell small, sub-ovate or obscurely pentagonal. Ventral valve longer than the dorsal; beak acute; apical angle about 60\u00b0; greatest width below the mid-length; the upper half uniformly tapering, with nearly straight margins to the beak; sides in the lower half gently convex and sub-parallel; anterior angles rounded; a portion in the middle of the front margin nearly straight. The dorsal valve is a little shorter than the ventral, and more obtuse in the upper half. Both valves are rather strongly convex, but slightly flattened along the median line from the mid-length to the front margin. Surface with fine concentric striae scarcely visible to the naked eye, and with a few larger undulations of growth. One specimen, under the magnifier, shews fine radiating striae.\n\nLength of ventral valve 3\u00bd lines; width, 3 lines; length of dorsal valve 3 lines; width the same.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014P, four miles north-east from Portland Creek, Newfoundland: Quebec group.\n\nCollector.\u2014J.

The small outline figures indicate the natural size; a and c, dorsal valves; b, ventral valve, as seen from above; d, area of a ventral valve which shews a central groove; f, area of another specimen which exhibits no groove; e, side view.\n\nFig. 201.\n\nDescription.\u2014Shell very small, about 1 line in diameter; one valve nearly flat, and the other, acutely conical. Dorsal valve very gently con-\nvex, nearly circular; sides and front margin uniformly rounded; posterior margin very obtusely angulated at the beak, on each side of which, a portion of the cardinal edge equal to one-fourth of the whole width of the shell, is nearly straight; umbo very small; beak apparently depressed to the hinge line and not projecting beyond it; cardinal angles compressed, broadly rounded; a wide shallow mesial sinus extends from the front margin about half way to the beak; elsewhere the valve is gently convex, or nearly flat.\n\nVentral valve acutely conical, with a flat triangular area which is perpendicular to the plane of the lateral margin, its base half the width of the whole shell. In the apex of this valve there is a minute circular aperture, and in one specimen a dark line extends from it down the middle of the area, which appears to represent the foraminal groove of this genus; but in two other specimens of the ventral valve, with the area well preserved, there is no indication of a groove. Surface with very fine concentric striae.\n\nWidth of dorsal valve, about 1 line; length, about $\\frac{3}{5}$ of a line. The height of the ventral valve is about 1 line.\n\nThe form of this species is very like that of *A. subconica* (Kutorga), but that species is twice the size of this, and has the area distinctly grooved.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014P, four miles north-east from Portland Creek, Newfoundland; Quebec group.\n\n**Collector.**\u2014J. Richardson.\n\n**Orthis delicatula.** (N. sp.)\n\n**Description.**\u2014Shell thin and flat, semi-elliptical, hinge line straight, equal to about twice the length of the shell; sides and front uniformly rounded. Ventral valve with a narrow mesial elevation in the upper half, elsewhere flat; beak and umbo slightly elevated above the hinge line; area narrow or linear. The dorsal valve is almost flat with a shallow mesial groove. Surface with very fine radiating striae, about ten in the width of one line. Width of an average specimen, 4 lines; length 2 lines.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014N, Table Head and Pistolet Bay; P, four miles north-east of Portland Creek, Newfoundland; Quebec group.\n\n**Collector.**\u2014J. Richardson.\n\n**Other Species of Orthis.**\n\n1. **Orthis Electra**, ante, p. 79, occurs at Table Head, Port aux Choix, and Point Rich in Divisions H and I. At Table Head some of\nthe specimens are silicified, and I have been able thus to compare both\nthe interior and exterior with the originals, on which the species was\nfounded.\n\n2. O. Hippolyte, ante, p. 81, occurs at Cow Head in Division P.\n\nBesides the above there are several small convex finely striated species\nof the type of O. perveta and O. elegantula. The specimens are so badly\npreserved that it would be useless to name them. They occur at Port\naux Choix, Table-Head, Point Rich, and Bonne Bay.\n\nStrophomena aurora. (N. sp.)\n\nFig. 202.\n\nFig. 202.\u2014Strophomena aurora; a, ventral valve; b, section; c, portion of the\nsurface enlarged.\n\nDescription.\u2014Semi-elliptical, length varying from a little more than\none-half the width, to four-fifths of the width, widest at the hinge line;\ncontour usually an uniformly elliptical curve from the cardinal angles all\nround. Ventral valve convex, narrowly and often acutely carinated on\nthe umbo, depressed and sub-concave towards the cardinal angles. Area\nmoderate, forming an obtuse angle of about $125^\\circ$ with the plane of the\nlateral margin. Dorsal valve concave, with a mesial sinus commencing at\nthe beak and growing wider and shallower towards the front margin; area\napparently about half the size of that of the ventral valve, and forming a\nright angle therewith. Surface with rather strong angular striae of differ-\nent sizes, the smaller coming in between the larger, both by intercalation\nand sub-division, the whole crossed by fine concentric striae, more distinct\nin specimens which have the radiating striae well separated than in those\nwhich have them close together. The striae are about the size of those of\nS. alternata, but more angular. The concentric striae are just visible to\nthe naked eye when the surface is well preserved. On most specimens they\ncannot be seen at all, as a very small amount of weathering or exfoliation\nremoves them. In some there are several strong angular folds radiating\nfrom the beak to the front margin, with usually one of the larger striae run-\nning along the crest of the fold, and a number of the smaller in the\nintervening concave space.\n\nThe convexity of this species, as indeed it is in all others of the genus,\nis variable. Usually the ventral valve is depressed convex, the outline forming an even, flattened arch, from beak to front, but often it is strongly arched and angulated about the middle. The carination of the umbo sometimes extends quite to the front margin, and in such instances it has a strong angular elevated stria along its crest in the median line of the shell. Width from 7 lines to 1 inch. Length from $\\frac{5}{6}$ to $\\frac{4}{5}$ the width.\n\nA separated dorsal valve, apparently belonging to this species, has the divaricator process undivided, as in the genus Orthis.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014K, L, M, N, Point Rich and Table Head, N, Burnt Cape, Pistolet Bay; P, four miles north-east from Portland Creek, Newfoundland; Quebec group.\n\nCollector.\u2014J.

Ante,* p. 73, a single valve not distinguishable from this species, was found in P, four miles north-east from Portland Creek.\n\nCamarella parva. (N. sp.)\n\nDescription.\u2014Shell small, ovate, length about one-third greater than the width; apical angle about $60^\\circ$; sides gently convex; front broadly rounded. Ventral valve rather strongly convex, uniformly arched from beak to front; mesial groove narrow, concave in the bottom, dying out at two-thirds the length from the front. Dorsal valve broad, ovate, not so long as the ventral, and more uniformly but not so strongly convex; mesial fold narrow, rounded, dying out at about half the length. Surface apparently smooth. Length of ventral valve about 2 lines.\n\nThe specimens are imperfect. The beak of the ventral valve is not well exposed, but seems to be strongly incurved.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014N, Table Head; P, four miles north-east from Portland Creek, Newfoundland.\n\nCollector.\u2014J.

Can., p. 127.)\n\nRemarks.\u2014This species, or one almost identical with it, occurs along with C. parva both at Table Head and four miles north-east from Portland Creek; also in the nodules of white limestone on the south side of Cow Head. It was first discovered in the Chazy limestone at the Mingan Islands, and was afterwards collected near the village of Chazy in New York, in the same formation, by J. Richardson.\n\nCamerella calcifera. (Billings.)\n\n(Canadian Nat. and Geol., vol. vi. p. 31 : Aug. 1861. Geol. Can., vi. p. 231.)\n\nRemarks.\u2014This species occurs in the nodules of white limestone on the south side of Cow Head in Division P. It is very characteristic of the limestone at Point L\u00e9vis and Phillipsburgh. At all these localities it is associated with Bathyrurus Saffordi. It occurs also at St. Timothy, near the head of the Beauharnois Canal, and at Norton\u2019s Creek, in the upper part of the Calciferous formation.\n\nRhynchonella corinthia. (N. sp.)\n\nDescription.\u2014Transversely elliptical; width one-fourth, or one-third greater than the length. Ventral valve strongly convex, with a wide rounded mesial sinus which dies out at the umbo. Dorsal valve strongly and uniformly convex, with a wide rounded but not greatly elevated mesial fold. Surface with numerous small angular ribs, which bifurcate two or three times before reaching the margin; from three to five in one line, usually seven in two lines. Width about 8 lines; length 6 lines.\n\nOf this species only a few fragments have been collected, but they are sufficient to show that it is different from any yet described. The form of the valves is that of a Rhynchonella, somewhat resembling the globose individuals of R. plena. But the bifurcation of the ribs is suggestive of Orthis.

(N. gen.)\n\nGeneric Characters.\u2014The general form of the species for which this genus is proposed is precisely like that of Pterinea, except that both valves are equally convex, and the hinge appears to have an external ligament like that of Unio. On this latter point, however, there remains some doubt, as the hinge is only partially seen in one specimen.\n\nEopteria typica. (N. sp.)\n\nDescription.\u2014Hinge line straight; anterior wing small, posterior large; umbones near the anterior extremity. Body of the shell strongly and obliquely convex, sub-cordiform; ventral margin rounded; posterior margin descending from the extremity of the hinge line at an angle of about 100\u00b0, nearly straight or slightly concave, until approaching the posterior ventral angle, where it forms a narrowly-rounded curve to the ventral margin. The posterior wing is not much compressed. The greatest gibbosity is about the middle of the shell, and extends obliquely from the umbones backwards and downwards to the posterior ventral angle. Surface with coarse radiating striae, about four in a width of three lines at the ventral margin.\n\nLength of hinge line about 12 lines; length from the umbones to the posterior ventral angle about 13 lines.\n\nResembles an ordinary form of Pterinea, but is more convex than the generality of the species of that genus.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014G, Port aux Choix, Newfoundland; Quebec group.\n\nCollector.\u2014J.

If a line be drawn between the most projecting points of the anterior and posterior extremities, it will divide the shell into two nearly equal parts: of these, the upper or dorsal half is triangular, the umbones forming the apex with an angle of about $120^\\circ$, the posterior slope a little longer than the anterior: the ventral half of the shell is semi-ovate, the anterior end the largest. The shell is very thick, and rather strongly convex. Surface with obscure concentric striae.

Along the middle of the last whorl there is a concave spiral band, and, separated from this by a narrow thread-like ridge, a deep groove; above which, flat or very slightly concave to the suture. In the upper whorls the band gradually becomes concealed in the suture, the groove remaining distinct. The base below the band is moderately convex, except on approaching the aperture, where it is strongly so. Aperture rhomboidal, obtusely angular at the band; the upper half of the inner side formed by the penultimate whorl; the lower half by a thickened slightly effuse lip. Umbilicus minute, but visible.

The body whorl has a double band along the middle, consisting of two concave grooves and three sharp narrow carinae, the one separating the two grooves being the most prominent and constituting the margin. Above the double band is another, rather strongly concave, and from one-third to half the width of the upper side of the whorl. The upper side of this latter band is limited by a fourth carina, above which the edge of the whorl is bevelled into the suture. On the upper whorls only three of the carinae and two of the grooves are visible, and the latter are there also usually of equal width. The apex is acutely terminated. The base is rather strongly convex. Aperture sub-rhomboidal, rounded on the inner side and angular at the band. Inner lip greatly thickened.

Spire depressed conical with a rounded apex. Whorls in the upper two-thirds of their width gently convex, becoming more flattened on approaching the concave band; the apical whorl convex its whole width. On the under side the whorls grow gradually more convex from without inwards, most tumid at two-thirds their width, thence rather abruptly rounded into the umbilicus, which is scarcely one-third the whole width.\n\nThe specimen consists of two whorls, and is probably the apical portion of a larger individual.

Width 28 lines; height about 7 lines. There are three whorls, allowing for a small one 2 lines across in the centre. The other two increase from a width of 1\u00bd lines to 9 lines in making two turns. A vertical polished\nsection shows that the outer margin is thin and sharp, and that the aperture is most probably not rhomboidal but transversely elliptical, the outer angle acute and the inner probably narrowly rounded. The form is thus like that of *P. lapicida* (Salter), differing therefrom in being larger and in having a wider umbilicus; the whorls also are not so flat above, and not so convex below.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014G, Cape Norman, Newfoundland; Quebec group.\n\n**Collector.**\u2014J.

Umbilicus either very narrow or completely closed. Surface unknown.\n\nWidth about 9 lines; height 4 to 6 lines.\n\nThe character of the margin has not been clearly ascertained, but it appears to be acute, and probably has a very narrow band on the edge. The shape may be described as ventricose-lenticular, both spire and base moderately convex, and the peripheral edge being at about the mid-height, or a little above. It resembles *P. Progne*, *Geol.

The original specimens\nwere evidently very imperfect, and it appears to have been not possible to give the details of the specific characters. The figures barely show enough to indicate the genus. I have heretofore referred to *M. matutina*, with doubt, a species found in the Calciferous at the Mingan Islands, and have also thought that I could recognize it in the limestone of the Quebec group at Phillipsburgh. It has now, however, become apparent, from the collections made in Newfoundland, that there are several distinct species, all having nearly the form and proportions indicated by the figures in the work above cited; but it is, at present, impossible to decide that any one of them is truly *M. sordida* or *M. matutina*. I propose, therefore, to describe them all as new, and to leave it for future discoveries to determine whether or not those which occur at the typical locality, in New York, are represented among them.\n\nIn the following descriptions the shell is regarded as being sinistral; the flat side is thus the spire and the umbilicated side the base.\n\nAlthough I think that the genus *Ophiletu* is founded on species of *Maclurea*, with very slender whorls, I retain it for the present provisionally.\n\n**Maclurea crenulata.

The base forms an irregular hemisphere, highest at the aperture.\n\nSurface finely striated, and usually with some rugose lines of growth.\n\nThese latter are sometimes absent, and the shell has then a smooth aspect.\nA single specimen of an operculum was found in the same piece of limestone, with several shells of this species. It is a flat thin plate, with a muscular process, as in *M. Logani*.\n\nThe edge of the umbilicus is exhibited in more than fifty specimens, and in all it bears a sort of a rounded band, which is beautifully crenulated transversely, as in most of the species of *Solarium*.\n\nThe inner whorls of the spire are sometimes a little elevated above the others.

Richardson.\n\n---\n\n**Maclurea ponderosa.** (N. sp.)\n\n**Description.**\u2014Shell large; from four to six inches across; of four or five whorls. Spire flat, the central whorls often a little elevated above the outer ones; the margin obtusely rounded. Base truncated hemispherical; umbilicus about half the whole width, with an acute edge; sides of the whorls in the umbilicus moderately convex. Surface with strong squamose stri\u00e6 parallel to the edge of the aperture. Shell remarkably thick, usually exhibiting a tendency to exfoliation.\n\nNo very perfect specimens of this species have been collected, although it occurs in vast numbers in several localities. The edge of the umbilicus in ordinary specimens is acutely rounded, but in good vertical polished sections it is very acute. Such sections also show that, in some, the edge of the whorls is exposed, in the umbilicus, in staircase form, to the apex, but in others it is quite certain that it (the edge) is concealed by the preceding whorl.\n\nIn most specimens the whorls on the upper side are uniformly depressed convex, with a moderately deep suture, but sometimes they are nearly flat.\n\nA specimen of four whorls is about 5 inches across.\n\nThis species, in size and proportions, much resembles *M. Magna*, but differs from it in having the whorls a little more slender in the horizontal direction, and deeper in the vertical, in having the edge of the umbilicus more acute and always a thicker shell. The vertical section is almost exactly like that of *M. affinis*, as represented above in fig. 224, which,\non comparison, will be found constantly a little different from similar sections of *M. Magma*.\n\nThe only differences I can perceive between *M. affinis* and this species, are in the much greater size and thickness of shell of the latter.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014P, Cow Head, Newfoundland; and also near Phillipsburgh, Canada East. It occurs most abundantly at Correy's farm, about five miles north of Phillipsburgh, on the road to Bedford, in band C 1, of the Phillipsburgh series.\n\n**Collectors.**\u2014J.

The base is depressed hemispherical; umbilicus very small, and in some specimens apparently closed altogether. Surface with fine striae, those on the base seem to be rather coarse.\n\nThis species is easily recognized, even when in the condition of casts, by its margin, which is often much more acute than is represented in the above figure.\n\nThe largest specimen collected is 3\u00bd inches across, and consists of about 3\u00bd whorls, the last one being 12 lines wide at the aperture.

Spire flat or very slightly convex in the middle, upper side of the whorls with a concave band, occupying the outer half, the inner half elevated, and either convex or with the most prominent part slightly flattened. The margin is nearly acutely angular. The outer side of the whorl, below the margin, is either flat or gently concave, and sloping inwards at an angle of about $70^\\circ$, with the plane of the spire in the body-whorl, but from $60^\\circ$ to $70^\\circ$ in the smaller whorls. The umbilicus is about five-sixths of the whole width, the edge rounded angular in the last whorl; acutely angular in the inner whorls. The slope of each whorl into the umbilicus is gradual, and sometimes a little concave near the edge, then convex, and lastly, nearly vertical. All the whorls are exposed to the apex. The aperture is obscurely rectangular in the last whorl, but more nearly oval in the inner whorl; the width a little greater than the height.\n\nSurface with strong rugose transverse stri\u00e6, and often with shallow concave grooves, from two to three in two lines.\n\nThe casts of the interior somewhat resemble those of *M. transitionis*, but are distinguishable by the form of the upper side of the whorl, the margin of which, instead of being uniformly rounded, as in the species cited, is obliquely truncated by an obscure flat band, which slopes outwards and downwards at an angle of $15^\\circ$ to $30^\\circ$ with the plane of the spire. The acute edges of the margin of the shell and umbilicus are more obtuse or obsolete in the cast.\n\nThe last whorl is sometimes a little vagrant.\n\nA specimen 13 lines in width is 4 lines in height.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014G, H, I, K, L, M, Point Rich, Table Head, Cape Norman, Schooner Island in Pistolet Bay, entrance to the north arm of Bonne Bay, Newfoundland; Quebec group.\n\nCollector.\u2014J. Richardson.\n\n*Maclurea transitionis.* (N. sp.)\n\nDescription.\u2014Shell small, about two inches across, of about four slender whorls. Spire flat; the suture in casts of the interior deeply impressed; the outer margin rounded; the outer side of the last whorl depressed convex and nearly vertical. The umbilicus is nearly the whole width of the shell, with an acute edge. The inner side of the whorls in the umbilicus has two slopes. The first, commencing at the edge of the umbilicus, extends about one-third the width of the whorl, inclined at an angle of $45^\\circ$ or somewhat less, to the plane of the spire; it is usually\ngently concave. The second, inside of the first, is gently convex, and inclined at an angle of from $70^\\circ$ to $80^\\circ$. Surface unknown.\n\nWidth of an average specimen 20 lines; width of last whorl 6 lines; height of last whorl about 6 lines.\n\nWhen the upper side alone of this species is seen, it cannot be distinguished from *M. affinis*; the size of the shell and proportions being about the same. The umbilicus, however, is altogether different. Some of the specimens have thicker whorls, and approach *M.

On the upper side the smaller whorls are, in some specimens, quite flat, and in others convex; the outer margin of the last whorl, in all the specimens seen, is obtusely rounded. The edge of the umbilicus, in the perfect shell, is thin and quite sharp, with a concave band just below it; in the casts it is acutely rounded. With the exception of the concave band, the inner side of the whorls in the umbilicus is gently convex. The whorls are all seen in the umbilicus, but the edge projects only slightly. The height of the shell is nearly two-thirds its width. Surface unknown, but probably finely striated.\nWidth of an average specimen 24 lines; height 15 lines; width of umbilicus 11 lines; width of last whorl 9 lines.\n\nThis species differs from *M. crenulata* in being of a more rotund form, the outer edge of the body whorl obtusely rounded, the umbilicus wider, and the edge not crenulated.\n\n*M. transitionis* may be only a variety.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014I, K, L, M, N, Point Rich and Table Head, Newfoundland; Quebec group.\n\n**Collector.**\u2014J.

The one represented by fig. 229, occurs abundantly and in a fine state of preservation. The outer surface is divided into two sub-triangular areas by a suture running from the nuclear angle *a*, to the lower inner angle. The inner or smaller area is striated parallel to the inner concave edge *b*; the outer area parallel to the lower gently convex edge *c*. It is about two lines in thickness at the lower edge, but becomes gradually thicker to the upper, the most elevated point being at the nuclear angle, *a*, where the thickness is ten lines in the specimen figured. On the inside, the upper and outer edges are bordered by a thick elevated margin. There is no muscular process, as there is in the operculum found with *M. crenulata*.\nThe operculum represented by fig. 228 is of a sub-cylindrical spiral form, and exhibits no sutures on its outer surface, the stri\u00e6 being continuous all across. There is no muscular process.\n\nFigure 230 has no suture, and although more nearly related to fig. 228 than it is to the other, is still quite distinct therefrom.\n\nThere was also another operculum found at Pistolet Bay, which is nearly straight, and two inches long by six lines in width.\n\nThese four opercula, differing so widely from each other, prove that there are also as many distinct species of *Maclurea* to which they belong. Accordingly at Cape Norman we find fragments of what appear to be forms different from those above described. I propose to name them as follows:\n\n**Maclurea Sylpha.** (N. sp.)\n\n*Description.*\u2014This species is founded on a silicified fragment consisting of the middle three whorls of a specimen which appears to have been somewhat larger and more nearly globular than any of those above noticed. Spire flat; width across the three whorls, 12 lines; last whorl 4 lines wide; height of the aperture as nearly as can be ascertained 10 lines; width of the umbilicus, 7 lines. The umbilicus, which is quite empty in the specimen, is cylindro-conical; the edge scarcely at all projecting, and the sides of the whorls flat. It extends quite to the apex.\n\n**Maclurea Psyche.** (N. sp.)\n\n*Description.*\u2014A specimen 18 lines wide, has the aperture $10\\frac{1}{2}$ lines in height; umbilicus 6 lines wide. The spire is flat, but the number of whorls cannot be made out. The edge of the umbilicus is narrowly rounded as it is in *M. oceana*; inner side of the whorl gently convex. In general aspect resembles a sub-globular form of *M. oceana*, differing therefrom in having a narrower umbilicus which does not ascend to the apex, and in having the aperture more extended in the vertical direction.\nMaclurea rotundata. (N. sp.)\n\nFig. 231.\u2014Maclurea rotundata. \\(a\\), front view of a cast of the interior; \\(b\\), view of the base.\n\nDescription.\u2014Shell about two inches across, strongly convex; spire flat, the inner whorls sometimes a little elevated above the outer; whorls about three, flat on the upper side; margin narrowly rounded; umbilicus half the whole width, with the edge narrowly or acutely rounded; whorls in the umbilicus gently convex. Surface unknown.\n\nWidth of specimen figured 18 lines; height of aperture 12 lines; width of umbilicus 9 lines; width of last whorl at the aperture 7 lines.\n\nThis species is closely allied to \\(M.\\) Emmonsi from which it differs in having the upper side of the whorls flat, even in casts of the interior, and in its somewhat narrower umbilicus. \\(M.\\) Psyche has the umbilicus still narrower and penetrating only half the height of the shell.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014Bonne Bay, entrance to the north arm, and also east arm, south-west side, Newfoundland; Quebec group.\n\nCollector.\u2014J. Richardson.\n\nOphileta Nerine. (N. sp.)\n\nFig. 232.\u2014Ophileta Nerine. \\(a\\), base; \\(b\\), the spire.\n\nDescription.\u2014Smaller than \\(O.\\) compacta; spire gently concave; margin acutely rounded. Lower side deeply concave, with the whorls strongly\nangular along the middle; the edges of all the whorls seen in the umbilicus. In the smaller specimens the outer side of the whorls slope inward at an angle of about 75\u00b0, but in the larger ones it is more nearly vertical. The inner slope of each whorl (from the angular edge which runs along the middle on the lower side), into the umbilicus, is flat; the slope outwards (or the outer side of the whorl) is gently convex.\n\nIn a specimen 8\u00bd lines wide, there are four whorls; width of last whorl at the aperture 2 lines; depth about the same. The largest specimen seen is 15 lines wide. Surface finely striated parallel with the aperture.\n\nThis species is certainly closely allied to O. compacta, and it is not without much hesitation that a new name is proposed for it. The following are the differences:\u2014In O. compacta the spire is always flat, and the lower side of each whorl (or that side which slopes into the umbilicus) concave. In this species the spire is always gently concave, and the lower side of the whorl flat. O. compacta is, also, a much larger species, being usually from 20 to 30 lines, while of O. Nerine, although found in immense numbers, the largest seen is 15 lines wide, and all the others seen, from 3 to 8 lines wide.\n\nAlthough a new name is proposed, I think it only a variety, and further that O. compacta and O. complanata are also varieties of the same species.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014F, Bay of St. John, Newfoundland; Quebec group.\n\nCollector.\u2014J.

The under side.\n\nDescription.\u2014Shell large, consisting of about four sub-cylindrical whorls; spire nearly flat, the inner whorls being only slightly elevated above each other; suture apparently deeply impressed. On the upper side the whorls are slightly flattened along the middle, rounded at the edges. On the under side they are strongly and uniformly convex. The outer side is somewhat flattened and approaching the vertical, but rounded above and below. The umbilicus is about half the whole width.\n\nWidth of the specimen 30 lines; height of the last whorl 9 lines; width 8 lines.\n\nThis species is founded on a single specimen, which retains a part of the shell, but so covered by adherent matter that the surface characters cannot be ascertained. On the outside of the last whorl there are visible some oblique undulations which cross from the margin downwards and forwards. These, no doubt, indicate the course of the stri\u00e6, which, most probably, curve backwards to the margin, both above and below.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014G, Cape Norman, Newfoundland; Quebec group.\n\nCollector\u2014J. Richardson.\n\nHelicotoma Tritonia. (N. sp.)\n\nDescription.\u2014The specimen is a fragment consisting of four whorls; width 19 lines; height about 6 lines. Spire gently concave; whorls sub-cylindrical, on the upper side, with a narrow elevated ridge at the margin,\nor a little within it, then gently convex to the suture; close to the marginal ridge there is a distinct groove following it all the way to the centre of the disc. On the outside the whorls are gently convex and sub-vertical, apparently sloping a little outwards in the last whorl, and inwards in the smaller ones. On the under side the whorls are rather strongly convex, obscurely rounded, descending with a somewhat flat slope into the umbilicus, which is wide and concave. Where the shell is preserved, on the outside of one of the inner whorls, it shews four or five narrow, thread-like ridges, following the whorl longitudinally.\n\nThis species must be closely allied to *H. Proserpina*. It differs from it in having a marginal ridge on the upper side, and in the form of the whorls on the lower side not so prominently rounded.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014G, Cape Norman, Newfoundland; Quebec group.\n\n**Collector.**\u2014J. Richardson.\n\n---\n\n**Helicotoma Gorgonea. (N. sp.)**\n\n**Description.**\u2014Shell large, depressed conical. Whorls about four, nearly cylindrical. On the upper side (as ascertained by a vertical polished section), the whorls are turretted, each rising about one-fourth its own diameter above the preceding. On the under side strongly and uniformly convex, or cylindrical; umbilicus not quite half the width, exposing all the whorls to the apex in stair-case arrangement.\n\nWidth 2\u00bd inches; width of the last whorl at the aperture 9 lines; height about the same.\n\nThe specimen shews the under side, the spire being imbedded in limestone. The whorls below, and in the umbilicus (which is nearly empty), are uniformly cylindrical, apparently a little flattened along the middle of the lower side, but above, as seen in the section, they seem to be obtusely angulated half way between the margin and the suture. The inner upper side of each is also impressed by the one next above it.\n\nThis species, so far as its form can be made out, resembles closely some of the large *Euomphali* with cylindrical and slightly angulated whorls, which abound in the Devonian and Carboniferous series.\n\nIt may be that this species is only a variety of *H. Proserpina*.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014H, Table Head, Newfoundland; Quebec group.\n\n**Collector.**\u2014J. Richardson.\nHelicotoma Eucharis.

Spire nearly flat, the inner whorls a little elevated above the outer; margin narrowly rounded; upper side of whorls flat and sloping a little downwards to the suture, the outer edge being more elevated than the inner. Outer side of the whorls gently convex. Umbilicus a little more than half the whole width; the edge acutely rounded; the whorls within, gently convex.\n\nSurface with fine stri\u00e6, which curve backwards to the marginal edge.\n\nWidth, 4\u00bd lines; height of the aperture, 3 lines. Of this species only two specimens have been found. One of them has the edge of the umbilicus quite acute, but in every other respect the two are identical.

Width of the whole coil, 27 lines; width of the inner whorl (supposed to be the second,) 10 lines; thickness of the last whorl at the aperture, (or where broken off,) $4\\frac{1}{2}$ lines.\n\nOn the lower side the whorls are uniformly convex; on the outer side more depressed, but still it is moderately convex; inner side apparently a little flattened; upper side, judging from the fractured extremity, with a carina at about the outer third, inside of which there seems to be a flat slope.

A fragment shewing the siphuncle and some of the septa.*\nDescription.\u2014This is a large, elongated, gradually tapering species, with a large lateral siphuncle. A specimen, three feet in length, tapers from a diameter of about four inches at the larger extremity, to one inch at the smaller. The siphuncle in the same length tapers from about sixteen lines to nine lines; and it is thus more than one-half the whole diameter near the apex, but less than one-third near the chamber of habitation. The section is circular, or nearly so.\n\nIn one specimen, where the diameter is nine lines, there are six septa to one inch in length. In another specimen of a siphuncle, seven inches in length, eleven lines in diameter at the larger and seven at the smaller, there are twenty-three septa. In the large specimen, where the diameter is three inches, there are four septa in fourteen lines. The average appears to be between three and four septa to the inch, from a diameter of two inches and upwards. The detached siphuncles are usually a little flattened on the ventral side along the line of the contact with the shell.

The siphuncle in one of these specimens is in contact with the shell at the smaller extremity, where the diameter is about one inch, and distant from it about one line, where the diameter is nearly two inches. In the other it is two lines distant from the shell throughout.\n\nBoth specimens are somewhat distorted by pressure, and, therefore, the dimensions cannot be given precisely. They are each about 5 inches in length, 2 inches in diameter at the larger, and 15 lines at the smaller extremity.\nThe only difference between this species and *O. Bigsbyi* is, that in the latter the siphuncle is in general a little more than half the whole diameter, whereas in this species it is less than one-half.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014I, Point Rich, M, Table Head, Newfoundland; Quebec group.\n\n**Collector.**\u2014J.

It resembles *O. Priamus*, but is more nearly cylindrical, the rate of tapering being on an average about one line to the inch. The siphuncle is stated in the original description, to be full one-third of the whole diameter, but in the majority of the specimens from Newfoundland it is about one-fourth. I would classify these, from this locality, as a distinct species, were it not that among them there is one with the siphuncle full one-third the whole diameter, and several with it between one-fourth and one-third.\n\n---\n\n**Orthoceras Flavius.** (N. sp.)\n\n**Description.**\u2014Shell of medium size; section apparently circular; siphuncle cylindrical, in contact with the shell; septa from nine to thirteen to the inch.

The specimen, however, is distorted by pressure. The siphuncle is 3 lines in diameter in the lateral direction, and 2\u00bd in the dorso-ventral. It is nearly of the same size throughout. There are 10 septa to the inch. Another siphuncle of the same length, is 4 lines in diameter at the larger, and 3 lines at the smaller extremity.

The septa cross the sides obliquely, sloping towards the aperture, in proceeding from the dorsal to the ventral side. Surface unknown.\n\nOne of the specimens shews that on the ventral side, the siphuncle is in contact with the shell. Another specimen, a longitudinal polished section of which is represented by fig. 240, shews that at two inches from the\napex, the shell must be at least one inch from the siphuncle on the dorsal side; and, as the specimen is mutilated on that side, the distance may be greater. The septa are excessively thin, and at their junction with the siphuncle are curved towards the apex, forming an attachment similar to that observed in the ordinary species of Orthoceras and Nautilus.\n\nIn a specimen 30 lines in length, the dorso-ventral diameter at the larger extremity is 14 lines; lateral, 11 lines, at 1\u00bd inches nearer the apex, the dorso-ventral diameter is 11 lines, and the lateral, 9 lines. Thence more rapidly tapering to the apex. In the first 18 lines there are 12 septa or 8 to the inch on an average, but in the apical inch there are 12 or 13. In other specimens they are a little closer together.\n\nIn P. Canadense the siphuncle is in general, more curved, and the septal ridges cross it, sloping from the dorsal side downwards in proceeding to the ventral side. In this species they slope in the opposite direction (assuming always that the most curved side is the ventral).\n\nDedicated to A. H.

Richardson.\n\nOther Species of Cephalopoda.\n\nAt all the localities, from Division F, upwards, fragments of undetermined orthoceratites occur, many of which will, no doubt, turn out to be undescribed. It is remarkable that no species of *Cyrtoceras* has been collected in these rocks in Newfoundland, while they abound at Point Levis. Of other genera I propose to name the following species, provisionally:\n\n1. *Nautilus insolens.*\u2014About 6 inches across; whorls all seen in the umbilicus; aperture 3 inches wide and 2\u00bd inches in the dorso-ventral diameter; siphuncle apparently near the centre, 3 lines in diameter consisting of segments, which are constructed or shaped like a dice-box. The septa have not been distinctly observed, but judging from the length of the segments of the siphuncle they appear to be 3 or 4 lines apart. The section is broadly elliptical, flattened along the ventral aspect, rounded at the sides. The specimens are all more or less distorted. It occurs in Division L, at Point Rich.\n\n2. *Nautilus desertus.*\u2014The specimen is a fragment, consisting of the two central whorls of a strongly annulated species. Diameter 16 lines; dorso-ventral diameter of the last whorl, where broken off, 6 lines; lateral diameter 9 lines; distance of the annulations from each other 3 lines. The whorls envelope each other to the depth of one-sixth the dorso-ventral diameter; they are moderately convex on the ventral aspect and narrowly rounded on the side. It occurs in Division L, Point Rich.\n\n3. *Nautilus calciferus.*\u2014Whorls slender, compactly inrolled, the outer a little impressed by the inner; septa twelve to the inch on the ventral aspect, where the diameter of the coil is three inches; siphuncle small, close to the shell in the median line of the ventral aspect.\n\nA specimen 3 inches across, consisting of about 3 whorls, has the last whorl 13 lines in the dorso-ventral diameter, and the siphuncle about 1\u00bd lines in thickness.\nThis species has more numerous septa than has *L. Palinurus*, (ante, p. 25.)\n\nIt occurs, both at Port aux Choix and Cape Norman, in F and G.\n\n4. *Nautilus versutus.*\u2014The specimen is 5\u00bd inches across, and consists of about four whorls. Septa, in the last whorl, ten to the inch. The ventral side of the last whorl is broad and nearly flat, the sides narrowly rounded. Siphuncle unknown.\n\nThe last whorl has a breadth of 27 lines on the ventral aspect, and a dorso-ventral diameter of 18 lines.\n\nIt is evident, that in perfect specimens this species must exhibit a wide shallow umbilicus, exposing all the whorls. Its form must be much like that of *N. Ponponius*, (ante, p. 26), but has more numerous septa. It was found on the west side of the east arm of Bonne Bay, apparently in Division H.\n\n5. *Lituites Pluto.*\u2014The specimen is a portion of the free whorl. It is 7 inches in length; apparently about 20 lines in diameter at the larger extremity, and 16 at the smaller. There are about 12 septa to the inch throughout. It is curved to a radius of about 12 inches. It occurs at Point Rich, in Division L.\n\n---\n\n**CRUSTACEA.**\n\n**Bathyurus Saffordi and B.

Saffordi* occurs at Cow Head, in Division P, in white limestone, associated with great abundance of *Maclurea ponderosa*. It is the most common trilobite at Point L\u00e9vis and Phillipsburgh, in the limestones of the Quebec group.\n\n*B. Cordai* also occurs at Cow Head, in P, but in a greyish limestone. Some imperfect specimens of a species which appears to be identical with it were found at Bay St. John, in Division F. It occurs at Point L\u00e9vis\nand Phillipsburgh, along with *B. Saffordi*, but is not so common as that species.\n\nIn a blue limestone, evidently belonging to the Calciferous formation at Comstock, in the State of New York, numerous specimens of the glabella of a trilobite, which can scarcely be distinguished from *B.

Head strongly convex, with the posterior angles produced backwards into long stout spines. Glabella oblong, a little wider in front than at the neck segment; sides nearly straight and sub-parallel; well defined all round by the dorsal furrows; strongly convex or semi-cylindrical; abruptly elevated in front; the outline, on a side view, nearly straight, with the exception of the front, or gently arched as in fig. \\(b\\); neck furrow concave, rather deep, extending all across; neck segment rounded, well defined. Pygidium semi-elliptical, strongly convex, broadly rounded behind; front margin slightly convex; length a little greater than half the width; axis very convex, about four fifths the length and a little less than one third the width of the pygidium; obtusely rounded and abruptly elevated at the apex, with five strong transverse rings; sides with four ribs, besides the half rib at the front margin; these ribs are, in small specimens, divided or simply forked by a groove, for half their length next the margin; in large specimens the groove becomes deeper, and crosses the rib obliquely from behind, forwards and outwards, leaving a large tubercle next the axis in front, and another behind the groove, near the margin.\n\nThe whole of the surface, so far as yet observed, is covered with strong tubercles.\n\nNo entire specimens have been seen; but the detached cheeks, found in the same hand specimens of rock, show that the posterior angles of the head are spinose, as above mentioned.\nLocality and Formation.\u2014F, Keppel Island; G, Port aux Choix and Cape Norman; H, Port aux Choix, Schooner Island, in Pistolet Bay, and Table Head; N, west side of Pistolet Bay, Newfoundland; Quebec group.\n\nCollector.\u2014J.

Axis concave, semi-cylindrical; a little less than one third the whole width; gently tapering, obtusely rounded, and abruptly elevated at the apex, with five strong rounded rings, the last two of which are only partially separated; side lobes with three broad but strongly elevated ribs, the last one sub-triangular.\n\nIn small specimens, the grooves between the ribs are narrow and angular, but with age they become wider and concave in the bottom, as in the above figure. Surface, when well preserved, finely tubercled.\n\nAssociated with these pygidia is a single specimen of a glabella, as strongly convex as that of Menocephalus globosus. From the surface characters, and its occurrence in the same beds, I think it belongs to this species.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014G, H, Port aux Choix, Newfoundland; Quebec group.\n\nCollector.\u2014J.

The front margin has a narrow flat rim which is elevated at an angle of about $45^\\circ$; between the rim and the front of the glabella a narrow deep groove. The dorsal furrows are deep, but narrow, all round the glabella. The fixed cheeks are convex. The eye appears to be small and situated about the mid-length, and distant from the dorsal furrows about half the width of the glabella. There are no glabellar furrows. The surface appears to be smooth.\n\nLength of glabella, 1 line; width, a little less than 1 line. The groove and marginal rim in front of the glabella occupy about $\\frac{1}{4}$ of a line. Total length of the head, $1\\frac{1}{2}$ lines.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014N, Table Head, Newfoundland; Quebec group.\n\nCollector.\u2014J. Richardson.\n\nGenus. Bathyurellus. (N. gen.)\n\nGeneric characters.\u2014Trilobites of a medium size, oblong, ovate; head, thorax, and pygidium, sub-equal; head convex with the posterior angles sometimes produced backwards into spines; glabella conical, usually convex, and without glabellar furrows; eyes, lunate; facial suture in front of the eye curving outwards, then either straight forwards or curving\ninwards on approaching the margin, behind the eye running outwards sub-\nparallel to the neck furrow, and cutting the margin before reaching the\nouter angle. Thorax distinctly tri-lobed, about nine segments; pygidium\nwith the axis usually short and not strongly grooved; side lobes, with\nshort ribs sometimes indistinctly developed; a broad smooth border all\nround, which is sometimes concave.\n\nThis genus should perhaps be regarded as a sub-genus of *Bathyurus*.\nThe typical species of this latter, such as *B. extans*, *B. Nero*, and *B.\nCybele*, have a sub-cylindrical glabella rounded in front, strongly convex,\nand with obscure glabellar furrows. In this genus the glabella is conical\nor pointed in front, and exhibits no trace of furrows. The pygidium also\ndiffers in not being strongly convex, in having a shorter axis, and in\ngeneral a wider border.\n\nIn Newfoundland we first find this genus in Division F, in rocks which\nappear to be of the age of the lower part of the Calciferous formation, and\nit ranges upwards to Division P, through a thickness of more than 3000\nfeet. It occurs in Newfoundland, near Quebec, and at Phillipsburgh.\nAt Swanton, in Vermont, a species has been found in the Trenton, which\nmay belong to this genus.\n\n**Bathyurellus abruptus.

Neck furrow narrow, extending all across. Neck\nsegment rather broad, and depressed convex. Judging from the form of\nthe palpebral lobe the eye is large and semi-annular, and a little more\nthan one-half the length of the glabella, the posterior angle close to the\nneck furrow, and the anterior angle almost in contact with the side of the\nglabella a little in advance of the mid-length. Around the front of the\nhead there is a smooth border which is somewhat concave, and varies in\nwidth from one-fifth to one-fourth of the length of the glabella. On a side view the head is rather strongly convex, the outline gently arched along the median line of the posterior two-thirds of the glabella, and then descending with a convex slope to the smooth anterior margin, which is slightly concave between the apex of the glabella and the edge of the head. There is scarcely a marginal rim to the head of this species so far as yet observed.\n\nThe pygidium, represented by fig. 250, has a strongly convex and rather acutely conical axis, a little less than half the whole length, and a little less than one-third the whole width. The side lobes have three or four short and very obscure furrows near the anterior margin, but elsewhere, are smooth, and descend with a concave slope to the margin. The anterior angles seem to be abruptly bent downwards, and just behind the deflected portion there is a short curved groove, the convex side forwards, deeper than the others. This groove dies out before reaching the axis on the one hand, and, on the other, before reaching the margin. There is, however, an obscure rounded fold, in front of the groove, which reaches the margin.\n\nNo perfect specimens of this peculiar pygidium have been discovered, but as nearly as can be ascertained, its form is obscurely sub-quadrate, the posterior margin obtusely rounded, the sides somewhat parallel, but diverging from each other forwards. The central portion next the anterior margin is strongly convex, and the peculiar slope of the wide margin gives it a shape resembling that of a duck's bill.\n\nLength of the largest pygidium collected 6 lines; width about the same. Length of the largest glabella 4 lines.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014F, G, and H, Port aux Choix, and Keppel Island, Newfoundland; Quebec group.\n\nCollector.\u2014J.

(N. sp.)\n\nFig. 248.\n\nDescription.\u2014Glabella cylindro-conical, narrowly rounded in front, rather strongly convex, uniformly arched along the median line; width, a little more than half the length; neck segment depressed convex; neck furrow narrow, extending all across. The front of the head has a flat horizontal margin\u2014its width equal to one-sixth the whole length of the head. From this to the glabella, there is a convex ascent\u2014the width of the margin and ascent being one-third the whole length of the head. The glabella is two-thirds the whole length of the head. Eyes and cheeks, unknown.\nThis species differs from *B. abruptus*, in having the glabella proportionally shorter.\n\nThe pygidium, fig. 249, supposed to be that of this species, is nearly flat, and very much resembles that of a *Bronteus*. It is nearly semi-circular, width not quite double the length; axis small, convex, conical, not quite half the whole length, with four or five obscure annulations; side lobes nearly flat, with four wide ribs. The anterior rib has a short pleural groove close to the anterior margin next the axis, and another at about the middle of its width, but in the outer half of its length. The other ribs are undivided, and curve backwards, so that the posterior two (consisting of one from each side) are parallel with the median line.\n\nOnly one specimen of the head of this species has been observed. The pygidium appears to be somewhat common.\n\n*Locality and Formation.*\u2014F, G, and H, Keppel Island, Port aux Choix, and Table Head, Newfoundland; Quebec group.\n\n*Collector.*\u2014J.

Head convex, with a wide concave border; front uniformly rounded; posterior angles apparently without spines. Glabella conical, strongly convex, its outline on a side view forming a gradually rising arch from the front to the mid-length, then nearly horizontal to the neck furrow, the latter narrow and slightly impressed; dorsal furrows distinctly defined, but narrow all round; sides straight and parallel for half the length, then gently curving forwards to form a somewhat pointed apex. Eyes large, lunate, half the length of the glabella, their posterior ends about half their own length from the posterior margin of the head; their anterior ends a little in advance of the mid-length of the glabella. They are distant about their own width from the sides of the glabella, or\na little less. Just outside of the eyes is an obscure linear groove, which forms a semicircle round them and the front of the glabella.\n\nThorax, with nine segments; axis strongly convex, semi-cylindrical, less than one-fourth the whole width, with straight sides, slightly converging backwards. Pleurae flat, apparently falcate at their extremities; the genal angle at about half the length; the pleural groove running along the middle of the ribs, nearly to the extremity.\n\nPygidium much less convex than the head, semicircular, with a wide smooth slightly concave border; axis short, conical, half the length of the pygidium, obscurely defined at the apex; two or three obscure ribs near the anterior margin; side lobes, with obscure indications of ribs near the axis.\n\nThe whole surface appears to be smooth.\n\nThe head of this species is somewhat like that of *B. marginatus*, but differs in the form of the margin. It is closely allied, but still distinct.\n\nLength of the largest specimen observed about 11 lines; length of the head 4\u00bd lines; of the glabella 3 lines; of the eye 1\u00bd lines; width of the head 6 lines; length of the thorax 3 lines; length of the pygidium 3\u00bd lines.\n\n*Locality and Formation.*\u2014P, Cow Head, Newfoundland; Quebec group.\n\n*Collector.*\u2014J.

The form of the head is precisely the same as that of *B. nitidus*, with the exception of the spines and the difference in the width of the margin. The eye is also smaller. From *B. validus*, it is distinguished by the greater convexity and straightness of the sides of the glabella.\n\nIn *B. nitidus* all the space in front of the glabella is concave, forming what I have designated the wide concave border. In *B. formosus* only one-third of the same space, next the margin, is concave; the remainder, extending to the glabella, has a convex upward-slope.\n\nIn both *B. fraternus* and *B. validus* the border is, also, narrow and concave, but the glabella in the anterior two-thirds is scarcely at all elevated above the general convexity of that part of the head, whereas in *B. formosus* it is strongly convex.\nLocality and Formation.\u2014P, Cow Head, Newfoundland; also, in a boulder near Quebec, with Subulites Psyche and other fossils; Quebec group.\n\nCollector.\u2014J.

The pygidium.\n\nDescription.\u2014Head strongly convex, with a narrow concave border. Glabella conical, only slightly elevated above the general convexity of the head in the anterior two-thirds, rather strongly elevated in the posterior third, slightly narrowed between the eyes, greatest width at about two-thirds the length from the neck segment, thence with gradually converging sides to the apex which is pointed or very angularly rounded. Dorsal furrow linear, but distinctly visible all round the glabella. Eyes semicircular, their anterior angles situated just behind a line drawn across the glabella at the mid-length, their centres distant from the sides of the glabella about their own length. No neck furrow is visible in the specimen, but this part is badly preserved.\n\nThe pygidium, found associated with the glabella above figured, is very nearly semicircular, moderately convex, and with a narrow deeply concave margin all round. The axis a little less than one-third the whole width at the front margin, and moderately convex, but becomes gradually less prominent backwards, until it merges into the general surface at about two-thirds or three-fourths the length. It is crossed by four linear grooves, but the segments between the grooves are scarcely at all elevated. The side lobes have also four obscure grooves, all terminating at the deeply concave marginal border.\n\nLength of the head 13 lines; length of the glabella $10\\frac{1}{2}$ lines; greatest width of the glabella, at one-third the length from the apex, 6 lines;\nlength of the eye 3 lines. Length of a pygidium 9 lines; width of the same 15 lines.\n\nThis species resembles *B. nitidus*, but differs therefrom in having smaller eyes, a less convex glabella, and a narrower margin around the front of the head. *B. formosus* has the glabella convex and elevated above the general surface of the head.

The head is strongly convex, and the posterior angles are prolonged in broad, flat spines, as in *B. formosus*. The pygidium is semicircular, with a moderately convex axis, and a very wide and deeply concave margin, which occupies nearly the whole of the side lobes and space behind the axis.\n\nLength of the head 17 lines; width about 30 lines.\n\nShould it turn out that *B. fraternus* has the posterior angles of the head as in this species, then the only difference would be in the pygidium. They should then, perhaps, be united under one specific name; in which case I beg that *B. validus* be retained.\n\nThe beds in which *B. validus* occurs, are about 2000 feet below those holding *B. fraternus*.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014L, Point Rich, Newfoundland; Quebec group.\n\n**Collector.**\u2014J.

No entire specimens have been found, but fragments occur in all the Divisions from \\(F\\) to \\(M\\) inclusive. The pygidium is characterized by a wide concave margin all round, but in other respects has the form of \\(A.\\) platycephalus. A pygidium resembling it occurs in the Chazy limestone, both in Canada, and at the village of Chazy in the State of New York. It is also found in the Calciferous formation at Mingan, and in the Counties of Leeds and Grenville, in Canada West. Several large, and nearly entire, individuals, have been collected in the Chazy sandstone at L'Orignal, Aylmer, and on the Island of Montreal. The specimens from all these localities agree so well with Prof. Hall's description and figure, above cited, of \\(A.\\) canalis (Conrad), that I have referred them to that species provisionally.\n\nIt will be observed that the above figures do not show the two wings that project, one on each side, from the anterior extremity of the hypostoma of an Asaphus. A perfect specimen from Point Rich explains their absence. They are very small, and situated on the upper side, from which they project nearly at right angles to the plane of the hypostoma; consequently, in a view of the lower side (fig. 255, \\(a\\)), they cannot be seen. Fig. 255, \\(b\\), shows the upper side, but in this specimen they are broken.\noff. Prof. Hall's fig. 18, above cited, shows a portion of the anterior half of a hypostoma with the same rounded front margin that is seen in our specimens. The two small muscular pits are well preserved in one of our specimens, but they are scarcely visible in the one figured.\n\nIt may be here remarked that in the Chazy limestone a perfect hypostoma, quite different from the above, has been found, showing that in that formation there are at least two species of *Asaphus*.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Port aux Choix, Point Rich, Table Head, and Bonne Bay, Newfoundland,\u2014F, to M, inclusive; Quebec group.\n\n**Collector.**\u2014J.

Pygidium nearly semicircular, length a little greater than half the width; axis narrow, moderately convex, very distinctly defined by the dorsal furrows, about one-fifth the whole width at the front margin, thence tapering to an obtuse point near the posterior margin, not well defined at the end. There is a smooth concave border all round, the width of which is about one-third of the width of the side lobes at the anterior margin. There are about ten obscure rounded rings on the axis; those in the posterior half of the length being in general scarcely distinguishable. The side lobes have five ribs each besides the half rib at the anterior margin. The length of the axis varies in different individuals from four-fifths to five-sixths the whole length. The anterior angles are strongly facetted.\n\nThe hypostoma is oblong, with two short rounded lobes in front, and a shallow notch between.

Axis well defined, stoutly conical, rather convex, a little less than one-third the whole width, and about two-thirds the whole length; width of the obtusely rounded apex half the width at the front margin. The surface is marked by rather coarse sub-concentric fissure-like striae. On the side lobes there is a single pleural groove at the front margin, and another forming a half\nrib at the anterior end of the axis. In small specimens the axis is without any trace of ribs, but in the largest seen there are indications of eight or nine very obscure grooves on the sides, extending obliquely inwards and forwards; none on the side lobes.

Eyes moderately large, crescentiform; their length about three-eighths the whole length of the head; their posterior corners situated about half their own length from the posterior margin; the distance between them, measured from the most projecting point of the outer curve at the base of the visual surface of each, one-eighth greater than the length of the head (the latter measured along the curve); the height of the visual surface about one-third the length of the whole eye; distance from the posterior angle of the cheek to the eye a little greater than half the length of the head. When perfect the visual surface of the eye is closely covered with minute lenses or tubercles not visible to the naked eye, but which can be distinctly seen with an ordinary pocket magnifier. The eye-lid is depressed convex. The anterior corners of the eyes are a little closer to each other than are the posterior. The facial suture departing from the anterior corner of the eye at first curves slightly outwards and then inwards, and runs all round close to the front margin, but does not cut it. Behind the eye it runs outwards, and cuts the posterior margin at a point half way from the eye to the posterior angle of the head.\n\nPygidium semi-oval, anterior angles rounded, all pressed convex, not tri-lobed, a shallow concave depression all round close to the sides and posterior margin; length equal to half its width. Surface smooth.\n\nThe best preserved head is nine lines in length and about seventeen in width; length of the eye about three and a half lines; distance of posterior angle of the eye from the margin two lines.\nAn obscurely preserved specimen, apparently of this species is three inches in length and one and three-quarters in width. There appears to be seven segments in the thorax.\n\nAnother specimen, also badly preserved, is two and a quarter inches in length, and one and five-eighths in width.

Pygidium rather strongly convex, nearly semicircular, its length a little more than half the width at the front margin, the posterior three-fourths of the margin uniformly rounded to the curve of a semicircle very nearly, the anterior third obliquely truncated; axis one-third the whole length, not defined at the extremity.\n\nA specimen of the head without the fixed checks measures along the curve on the median line, nine and a half lines; width of the middle lobe, four lines; length of dorsal furrows, about three lines; distance of the eye from the dorsal furrow, two lines; distance from the posterior angle of the eye to the posterior margin, a little less than one line; the length of the eye is about one and a half lines. A detached cheek which occurs in the same fragment of stone with several imperfect heads has the outer angle well rounded and distant two and a half lines from the eye. In the pyg-\nidium, the fold of the crust below extends about half the length, and in the cast of the inner surface there is a rounded groove extending from near the apex of the axis backwards becoming obsolete before reaching the margin.\n\nSurface of the head and pygidium with numerous flexuous fissure-like striae, three or four in one line, having a rudely concentric arrangement sub-parallel with the margin.\n\nThis species is certainly most closely allied to *I. crassicauda* both in form and surface markings. It seems however to be a smaller species, for though the specimens are numerous, none that I have seen could have been, when perfect more than one and a half inches in length. *I. crassicauda* has the posterior part of the pygidium very tumid, and a sharp elevated rim bordering the anterior margin of the head, characters which are not possessed by *I. fraternus*.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014L, Point Rich; and N, Table Head; P, four miles N.

(N. sp.)**\n\nFig. 263. *a*, *b*, *c*.\n\n**Description.**\u2014This is a large species, and closely allied to *I. Americanus* of the Trenton limestone. The length of the head (measured along the surface following the curve) is about two-thirds the whole width; glabella defined by the dorsal furrows for about one-third the whole length, and its width equal to about half the whole length. The anterior two-thirds of the head form a broad, moderately and uniformly convex front, inclined at an angle of from $80^\\circ$ to $90^\\circ$ to the plane of the posterior third. The glabella is very gently convex, and the space between it and the facial suture on each side is nearly flat. The anterior margin is gently convex nearly all round the front, a little concave just outside of the facial suture, and has a small, sharp, elevated rim on the edge, which becomes obsolete just before reaching the posterior angles, the latter narrowly rounded. Eyes apparently depressed, lunate, distant from the dorsal furrows about half the width of the glabella, and half their own length from the posterior margin. They appear to be about $2\\frac{1}{2}$ lines in length in individuals of full size.\n\nThorax with ten segments; axis a little more than one-third the whole width, and tapering a little backwards; side lobes flat on each side for a little more than half their width; pleural angle well defined, about $45^\\circ$.\n\nPygidium semi-elliptical, greatest width equal to about twice the length;\nangles truncated for one-fourth the length, at an angle of about $80^\\circ$; all the rest of the margin broadly rounded; axis obscurely defined, about one-third of the length; more distinct in the east of the interior, where it is conical and narrowly rounded at the apex with an obscure ridge proceeding from it to the posterior margin.\n\nSurface with concentric fissure-like, rudely concentric striae. The pygidium is sometimes nearly smooth. Width of the largest pygidium seen 2 inches; length 1 inch.\n\nI have not seen a perfect head of this species, but several deprived of the cheeks. One specimen only, retains the thorax and the pygidium in connection, but without the head. A perfect cheek was found detached, but in the same piece of stone, with several pygidia and portions of the head.\n\nAs before stated, this species is most closely allied to *I. Americanus*. The only differences that I can see, are the following: In this species the middle lobe of the head is nearly flat, and the surface marked with coarse concentric striae. In *I. Americanus* the middle lobe is more convex, and the surface covered with short, wave-like wrinkles, not striae. This latter species, however, is an exceedingly rare form, and a larger collection might furnish some with intermediate characters.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014L, Point Rich, M and N, Table Head, Newfoundland; Quebec group.\n\n**Collector.**\u2014J.

Eyes small, depressed hemispherical, distant from the dorsal furrows the width of the glabella, and half that distance from the posterior margin.\nLength of the head, in the best preserved specimen, in a straight line, is 4 lines; length, following the curve of the surface, 7 lines; width at the posterior margin 13 lines; between the points of the spines 15 lines; width of glabella 2\u00bd lines; distance of the eye from the neck furrow 2\u00bd lines; distance of the centre of the eye from the posterior margin 1\u00bc lines; length of the eye a little more than half a line. The spines extend about 6 lines backwards from a line drawn across the head at the posterior margin.\n\nThis extraordinary trilobite is clearly allied to *I.

Cheeks coarsely punctured, and glabella with a few rounded tubercles.\n\nThe only specimen of this remarkable trilobite discovered, is the anterior part of the glabella, with a small portion of the cheek on each side. The length, from the base of the rostrum, backwards as far as preserved, is $9\\frac{1}{2}$ lines, measured along the median line of the upper side. At 5 lines from the base of the rostrum there is a pair of deep linear glabellar furrows, very gently curved (the convexity forward), their upper extremities distant from each other about 3 lines, the lower extremity about 1 line from the cheek, and 7 lines from the base of the rostrum; length of each furrow 5 lines. About 3 lines behind there is a second furrow not so much curved which extends to the cheek below, and appears to run all across (but this point is not determined owing to the imperfection of the specimen). It seems probable that if this specimen were perfect, the total length of the glabella would be from 12 to 15 lines, and there may be, thus, another pair of furrows besides the neck furrow.\n\nI at first supposed this remarkable fossil to be an Ampyx, and had so described, but fortunately, before printing, other species of the same type were discovered, which shew that it is a Cheirurus with the unusual appendage of a large spine on the head.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014N, Table Head, Newfoundland; Quebec group.\n\nCollector.\u2014J.

The eyes appear to be small and situated opposite the posterior half of the second lobe, and a little less than one-third of the length of the head from the side of the glabella.\n\nPygidium moderately convex, axis conical, convex, well defined, with six segments (the last one triangular terminating in an acute point, and having a rudely semicircular pit just above the middle); side lobes with five ribs on each side, all extending beyond the margin and terminating in flattened pointed spines. The last two ribs are parallel with the axis; the next two diverge a little, but are still nearly parallel; the three anterior pairs diverge more widely, the anterior being at right angles to the axis for about half the length, the outer half curved backwards. In some specimens the anterior ribs are broadly curved, for the inner half. The spinose terminations of the ribs are separated from each other about the width of the rib. The length of the pygidium, measuring to the tips of the spines, is a little more than half the width.\n\nThe surface appears to be finely tubercular.\n\nThis species is closely allied to *A. Lindaueri* (Barrande),* which occurs in rocks lying at the base of the second Fauna in Bohemia, but differs in the form of the triangular or last segment of the axis, and in having the ribs more divergent.

The pygidium.*\n\n**Description.**\u2014Pygidium rather convex, semicircular; axis elongate-conical, strongly convex, with about ten rings, the last three or four obscurely defined. The side lobes have five strong ribs, each terminating in a short slender spine. The grooves between the ribs are deep, and a little less than the width of the ribs. The last rib on each side originates at the mid-length of the axis, and lies parallel and close thereto. The others become gradually more divergent to the first. The true margin of the pygidium does not extend beyond the apex of the axis, but the ribs project a little further, forming a fringe of ten slender, sharp spines. The last three or four ribs of the axis are so obscurely separated that they seem to form a single triangular segment. Length of the axis of the best preserved specimen 3\u00bd lines; width of the same at the anterior margin 1\u00bd lines; length of the spines about 1 line.\n\nThis pygidium has a greater number of rings in the axis than there is in any described species of *Amphion*. It is barely possible that this may be a *Cromus*; but it has fewer ribs in the side lobes than any species of that genus figured by Barrande.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014P, Cow Head, Newfoundland; Quebec group.\n\n**Collector.**\u2014J.

The margin, being imperfect all round the characters of the extremities of the ribs, cannot be made out. The axis has five well defined articulations besides the terminal one, which latter is triangular, and extends backwards in a long point between the last pair of ribs.\n\nLength of the specimen 4 lines; width at the anterior margin apparently about 5 lines.\nAssociated with this pygidium is a glabella, which may possibly belong to it. It is strongly convex; front rounded; neck furrow all across; two pairs of glabellar furrows, inclining a little backwards and extending inwards about one fourth the width or a little more.\n\nLength of the glabella $2\\frac{1}{2}$ lines; width 2 lines.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014G, Port aux Choix, Newfoundland; Quebec group.\n\nCollector.\u2014J.

The fixed cheeks are cres-\ncentiform, rounded on the outside, terminating posteriorly at the front edge of the neck furrow and extending around one-third of the width of the front of the glabella; an obscure groove just outside of the middle of the cheek, parallel with the margin in the front half, but running out to the edge before reaching the posterior corner. In front of the glabella there are two small projecting points. The surface is obscurely tubercular, and there is a small tubercle on the middle of the neck segment.\n\nLength from 2 to 3 lines.\n\nThe detached glabellae occur in considerable numbers, but I have seen none of the other parts in connection with any of them.

(N. sp.)\n\nFig. 282.\n\nDescription.\u2014Head semi-elliptical, width apparently more than twice the length. Glabella clavate, moderately convex, front margin irregularly rounded with a notch in the middle, width at neck-segment half the width of the front, sides straight, neck furrow extending all across, three glabellar furrows on each side, extending one-third across, the anterior furrow with a branch making a notch in the front lobe, the lobes gradually diminishing in size backwards. Fixed cheeks broad, gently convex. Eyes distant from the dorsal furrows about the width of the glabella at the second lobe, and placed about opposite the last glabellar furrow; they appear to be small, and are connected with the front furrow by an ocular ridge. Movable cheeks unknown.\n\nPygidium with an elongate-conical, convex axis with from twelve to fourteen distinctly defined rings or segments. Side lobes with four narrow, convex ribs, the last pair commencing at about the mid-length of the axis, and extending backwards parallel and close thereto, the next also nearly parallel, and the anterior two pairs with the posterior half of their length\nparallel or converging. Between each two of the principal ribs there is a smaller one which is only slightly elevated, and seems to become obsolete before reaching the margin. There is evidence that the four principal ribs terminate in short spines.\n\nGlabella with a few small tubercles; cheeks coarsely punctate; pygidium with three or four tubercles on the principal ribs.

The neck segment is distinctly defined by the neck furrow, and apparently half the width of the space between the eyes. The dorsal furrows extend forward a little more than one-third the length of the head from the neck-furrow, and appear to have each a small pit in the bottom. The eyes are semicircular and two-thirds the length of the head, their posterior corners situated at the front edge of the neck furrow and close to the dorsal furrows. The dorsal furrows are distant from each other at their anterior extremities about one-third the distance between the outer curve of the eyes; they are a little more widely separated behind. The front part of the glabella which forms the projection characteristic of this genus, is one-fifth the length of the head, and is about as wide as the space between the neck furrows.\n\nOnly two specimens have been collected, each a little less than 2 lines in length.\n\nNo glabellar furrows are visible.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014N, Table Head, Newfoundland; Quebec group.\n\nCollector.\u2014J.

Schlotheimi. a, b, two specimens of the glabella, both distorted.\n\nDescription.\u2014Glabella cylindro-conical, rounded and abruptly elevated in front; neck furrow extending all across; three pairs of glabellar furrows all inclining inwards and backwards, the middle pair only, continued across. The eyes are semi-annular, about half the length of the glabella or a little less, their anterior and posterior angles touching the sides of the glabella.\n\nThe specimens are all more or less distorted, and hence the true proportions of the parts cannot be determined. In all of them the space between the side of the glabella and the eye (sometimes called the palpebral lobe) is on a level with the median line of the glabella, thus forming a nearly flat horizontal plane across from one eye to the other. A fine thread-like groove runs round the lobe close to the eye. The surface appears to be quite smooth.\n\nThe pygidium found in association with the glabella above figured, somewhat resembles that of Dikelocephalus magnificus. It is ovate with an acutely conical axis, the side-lobes with five or six well defined ribs each. The axis is about half the whole length, and the ribs of the side-lobes incline backwards like those of a Remopleurides. The specimens are too obscurely preserved to be figured.\n\nWhen compared with the head of Olenellus Thompsoni, the resemblance was so perfect, that I once thought this species was congeneric therewith. Hence the reference in the Geology of Canada above cited. I now think that both it and Dikelocephalus magnificus should be referred to Remopleurides, or perhaps to some closely allied form.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014N, Table Head and Pistolet Bay; P, four miles N.

The proportional length of the glabella varies slightly, but it is, in general, about two-thirds of the whole length of the head.\n\nPygidium, in contour and convexity, like the head. Axis strongly convex, well defined all round by the dorsal furrows; a furrow runs all across at one-third the length from the apex; a short one on each side at two-thirds the length from the apex. The tubercle forms a longitudinal medium lobe in the anterior two-thirds of the axis. It (the tubercle) is, at the anterior margin, slightly elevated above the general convexity of the axis; it is less elevated just over the anterior of pair furrows; but, behind this point, it rises to twice the height, and terminates abruptly at\nthe posterior furrow. The anterior lobes of the axis are distinctly separated from the tubercle by a narrow groove; the second two are not.\n\nSurface apparently smooth, but in one of the specimens there are indications of small wrinkles which unite with each other so as to give a reticulated aspect, somewhat similar to that of *A. reticulatus* (Angelin).\n\nLength of head and pygidium from 1 to 2 lines each.\n\nThis species is allied to *A.

Spire flat, the whorls on the upper side, with two strong, acutely angular carinae of equal height, separated by a deep, concave groove, which is visible quite to the apex. The inner carina is situated a little more than one-third of the width of the whorl from the suture. The outer carina rises vertically from the periphery. From the inner carina, there is a flat slope, extending down to the bottom of the deeply excavated suture at an angle of $45^\\circ$. From the edge of the outer carina there is a vertical descent, one-fourth the depth of the whorl, forming a flat band at a right angle to the plane of the spire. This band is bounded on its lower side, by an angular carina, the upper side of which forms an abrupt projection at a right angle to the band. Below this carina, the whorl appears to be vertical, or nearly so for one-fourth its depth, and then rounded into the umbilicus, this lower rounded part being ornamented by fine sharp stri\u00e6 following the whorls. No stri\u00e6 across the whorls are visible on this specimen, but, no doubt, they exist.\n\nDiameter 6 lines; width of the last whorl at the aperture $1\\frac{3}{4}$ lines; depth about the same. The umbilicus is not visible in the specimen, but it is probably about one third the whole diameter.\n\nOnly one specimen has been seen, and this is perfect above, but has its base imbedded in the matrix.\n\nI have heretofore referred this species to H. perstriata of the Calciferous formation, but now think it may be separated as a closely allied species. In that species the inner whorls of the spire are a little elevated above the outer; and the concave groove between the two carin\u00e6 on the upper side of the whorls, as well as the slope into the suture, are longitudinally striated. The band below the outer carina is not quite vertical, one third the depth of the whorl, longitudinally striated and obscurely divided into two bands by an elevated line along the middle. None of these characters are possessed by H. miser.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014Point Levis; in limestone No. 2, Quebec group.\nOphileta? bella. (N. sp.)\n\nO. uniangulata. Geol.

Different views of a nearly perfect specimen.\n\nDescription.\u2014From one to two inches across; lower side flat or gently concave; upper side concave, with a strongly elevated narrow spiral band; whorls, four or five. On the lower side, the whorls are usually moderately convex, but sometimes they are flattened on the inner half. The outer side of the whorls are convex. On the upper side, the spiral band sometimes runs along the middle of the whorl, as in fig. 301, c, but its position varies between the middle and the outer edge. The aperture has an angular notch above with the apex at the termination of the band: on the lower side, a flexure backwards. Surface with coarse, sub-squamose, transverse lines, of growth about six in two lines.\n\nThe whorls are often somewhat larger in proportion to the width than in the specimen above figured.\n\nI have heretofore referred specimens belonging to this species to the Euomphalus uniangulatus (Hall), but the recent discovery of a number of good specimens leads me to regard it as a distinct, although a closely allied form. That species has the lower side deeply concave, forming a deep umbilicus like Helicotoma planulata (Salter); while in this, it is usually flat, and when concave, is only moderately so. The whorls in this species are also more compactly inrolled.\n\nI have stated (ante, p. 236,) that the genus Ophileta was founded on species of Macurea, with very slender whorls. The specimen above figured was discovered since that page was printed. It shows very clearly that the aperture has a sinus in the lower lip, and a notch in the upper, characters which are not at all exhibited by perfect specimens of Macurea Logani. In M. crenulata (ante, p. 236,) there is a sort of spiral band, and, also, there are indications of a sinus in the lip on the flat side, but\nthey are only incipiently developed. The two genera may be thus distinguished:\u2014in *Maclurea*, the aperture is entire, and the whorls usually large; but in *Ophileta*, it has a sinus below, and a notch above, while the whorls are usually slender.\n\nAll the species of *Pleurotomoria* and *Helicotoma*, of the Lower Silurian rocks of Canada, of which perfect specimens have been found, have this same form of aperture. And so have some of the *Euomphali* of the Devonian and Carboniferous rocks.\n\nIt would appear also that *Maclurea* is a dextral shell, and that the flat side is the umbilicus.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014This species occurs at Bedford, in Stanbridge, range 6, lot 20; in Farnham, range 5, lot 41; and at Cow Head, in Newfoundland, in Division P; Quebec group.\n\n**Collectors.**\u2014T.

The outline on a side view is elongate ovate, the vertical diameter (from the upper side of the aperture through the umbilicus) being usually one-fourth greater than the horizontal diameter, and often more owing to a distortion to which the species seems to be subject. The greatest convexity is close to the umbilicus, whence the surface ascends, at first with a convex, and then with a concave slope to the dorsal edge. The latter is usually very acute, but in many specimens, it is minutely rounded but always with a concavity, of variable width, just within. The umbilicus is small, from one-sixth to one-fifth the horizontal diameter, rounded on the\nedge. The aperture is ovate, indented to the extent of one-third its height on the lower side by the penultimate whorl. Some fragmentary specimens shew that, in the perfect aperture, the lowest lip is much thickened next the umbilicus, and forms a thin layer, on the side of the whorl. The surface is usually obscurely striated, and sometimes irregularly undulated in the direction of the striae; the latter radiate from the umbilicus to the dorsum in a gently sigmoid curve.\n\nThe width, or the diameter transversely through the umbilicus, varies from a little less than one-third to one-half the diameter.\n\nThis species is closely allied to *B. acutus*, (Sowerby,) but is in general not so much compressed.\n\n*Locality and Formation.*\u2014Stanbridge, range 6, lot 20; Quebec group.\n\n*Collectors.*\u2014J.

Missisquoi, the most common form.\n\nDescription.\u2014No specimens of this species with the septa preserved have been found, but the siphuncle, represented by the above figure, occurs in great numbers in one locality, in B 2, at Phillipsburg. The most common form (of the siphuncle) is three or four inches in length, gently curved, tapering at the rate of about one line and one-third to the inch, and marked by from nine to twelve septal rings to the inch. As these rings are most distant from the apex on the concave side, it is evident that the position of the siphuncle, in the fossil, is near the shell on the dorsal side, or on the side of the concave curve.\n\nAssociated with this short curved form, there are numerous others, more elongated, somewhat straighter, and not quite so rapidly tapering. The septal rings are sometimes more rounded, or more like the annulations on such shells as O. arcuatum. Similar differences are exhibited by the detached siphuncles of other species. I think all the specimens found at this locality belong to one species, variable to some extent in its length and rate of tapering. It probably is like a large gently curved Cyrtoceras, from six to ten inches in length, with the siphuncle on the inner instead of the outer curve, and with a diameter at the aperture of from one to three inches.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014Phillipsburg, B 2, section Geol. of Can., p. 844; Quebec group.\n\nCollectors.\u2014Dr. P.

The specimen is somewhat distorted.\n\nDescription.\u2014Pygidium rather strongly and uniformly convex, smooth, no marginal groove; length two-thirds the width; anterior angles obliquely truncated for about half the width of the side lobes; an obscure pleural groove just behind the genal angle, and extending thence nearly to the dorsal furrow; axis about one-third the whole width, scarcely elevated above the general surface; dorsal furrows only distinguishable near the margin. The widest part of the pygidium is on a line drawn across it at about one-fifth the length from the middle of the front margin. The whole margin behind this line is uniformly curved, forming very nearly a regular semicircle. In some specimens the middle of the posterior margin shews a tendency to become more narrowly rounded or obscurely angular. The axis is in general, only distinguishable near the anterior edge. On the under side the fold of the crust, or doublure, is equal to full one-third the whole width of the pygidium. It has a small pit in it near the middle of the posterior margin.\n\nThe hypostoma is short, transversely ovate, its width about one-fifth greater than its length, the alar expansions at the anterior angles small and acute, the notch behind them also small and rounded; the central portion in the anterior half is gently convex; the two side lobes flat; the notch in the posterior margin is shallow, rounded, its depth about one line where the whole length is six lines; the muscular impressions are rather large, about one-third of the whole width distant from each other, and with their centres a little behind a line drawn across at the mid-length.\n\nFragments of the head shew that the posterior angles are rounded angular. The eyes are small, and situated a little behind the mid-length of the glabella.\nThis species resembles *A. platycephalus*, but the form of the hypostoma and the absence of a marginal groove on the pygidium appear sufficient to separate it therefrom.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014East side of the village of Bedford in the bed of Pike River, and upper end of the island of Orleans; Quebec group.\n\n**Collectors.**\u2014Sir W.

Glabella strongly convex, conical, sides in the posterior half, or two-thirds straight and parallel, in some specimens slightly concave just behind the eyes or between them, the anterior third converging to a narrow rounded\npoint. The dorsal furrows extend all round, but they are not deeply impressed. Neck furrow all across. The fixed cheeks all round the glabella are gently convex, or, rather, the glabella seems to be a little sunk into them. In front of the glabella there is a convex slope ending abruptly at the inner edge of the concave border. The eyes are semi-circular, about one-third the length of the glabella; their anterior angles a little in advance of a line drawn across the glabella at the mid-length; their centres distant from the dorsal furrow about one-third the width of the glabella.\n\nThe pygidium is semicircular, its width a little less than twice its length and varying from moderately to depressed convex; anterior angles obliquely truncated for about half the width of the side lobes; sides and posterior margin uniformly curved into a nearly perfect semicircle. The axis is strongly convex, conical, slightly tapering backwards, a little more than half the whole length; apex obtusely rounded, somewhat abruptly terminated; four distinctly defined depressed convex rings (besides the half segment at the anterior margin, and a fifth terminal subtriangular segment at the apex, which occupies twice the space of one of the others). The proportional length of the axis varies a little, but in all the specimens it is distinctly segmented, and well defined at the apex. It also varies in width, being in some one-fourth, and in others one-third the greatest breadth of the whole pygidium. The lateral lobes have a small triangular space on each side, next the axis, which is flat or horizontal. It becomes gradually narrower backwards, and terminates in a point at the apex of the axis. Outside of this the whole of the pygidium is gently concave. There are four pairs of ribs in the side lobes. The first pair, in crossing the flat triangular space, are at right angles to the axis. They then turn backwards, forming an obtuse angle which varies from $120^\\circ$ to about $150^\\circ$. The other ribs are more inclined backwards, and the last pair are nearly parallel with the axis. The first three pairs have an indistinct pleural groove extending outwards from the axis to the edge of the triangular flat space. The main grooves between the ribs are shallow and concave.\n\nIn several of the large specimens the side lobes are more nearly flat, and the ribs more obscure, than they are in the smaller ones.\n\nThe surface is not distinctly preserved in the specimens, but it is not tuberculated, apparently it is smooth. One of the specimens of a large pygidium exhibits some indications of concentric fissure-like striae.\n\nThis species appears to have attained a length of 4 inches, but the majority of the specimens are fragments of individuals from 2 to 3 inches in length.\n\nThis species is closely allied to several of those described in the foregoing pages. The differences are as follows:\n\n1. *B. maryinatus.*\u2014The head of this species, in the only specimen col-\nlected, has the cheeks abruptly elevated from the bottom of the dorsal furrow at the side of the glabella to the eye. The pygidium has a very small axis, and the side lobes are nearly flat.\n\n2. *B. nitidus.*\u2014The glabella and eyes are surrounded by a semicircular groove, and the whole of the margin in front of the apex of the glabella is concave (*ante*, p. 265, fig. 249).\n\n3. *B. formosus.*\u2014Only one-third of the space in front of the glabella is concave; in this species the concave border is at least half the width of the same space.\n\n4. *B. fraternus.*\u2014The head is more convex, while the front part of the glabella is more depressed, being on a level with the general surface. The pygidium is, also, shorter, the axis wider and not elevated at the apex.\n\n5. *B. validus.*\u2014Head strongly convex; front of the glabella not elevated; the whole of the side lobes of the pygidium concave, and the axis not elevated at the apex.\n\nOf all the above, *B. nitidus* and *B. marginatus* seem to be most closely allied to *B. expansus*. They form a remarkable group, and it may yet be found necessary to unite them all into one polymorphic species.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Stanbridge, range 6, lot 20; Quebec group.\n\n**Collector.**\u2014T. C. Weston.\n\n**Other Species of Bathyurellus.**\n\nThe following are named provisionally from specimens of the pygidium.\n\n1. *Bathyurellus rarus.* The specimen is a flat and nearly perfectly semicircular pygidium, nine lines in length and seventeen in width. There are obscure indications of an axis extending one-third the length; it is scarcely elevated above the surface. There is a faint concave depression all round near the margin and the central one; half of the whole upper surface is slightly convex. Surface apparently smooth. It was collected in the upper part of limestone No. 2, at Point Levis, Quebec group, by T. C. Weston.\n\n2. *Bathyurellus litoreus.*\u2014Pygidium nearly semicircular, anterior angles obliquely truncated, sides and posterior margin rounded to the curve of a semicircle; axis not quite the whole length, from one-fourth to one-third the whole width, conical, the apex moderately well defined. There is an obscure groove close to the anterior margin on the axis and side lobes, but otherwise the whole surface is smooth. The side lobes are nearly flat, with a barely perceptible slope to the margin. Occurs with the former and also in band D, on the beach at Point L\u00e9vis.\n**Amphion Westoni. (N. sp.)**\n\nFig. 307.\u2014*Amphion Westoni.* \\(a\\), the glabella with part of the cheeks (the specimen is a cast of the interior, and does not shew the eye); \\(b\\), pygidium found associated with it.\n\n**Description.**\u2014Glabella oblong, pentagonal, depressed convex, most elevated along the middle; sides straight and usually parallel, sometimes slightly converging forwards; anterior margin of glabella rounded\u2014angular in the middle, then straight or gently convex to the anterior corners which are rounded. Neck furrow extending all across. Three pairs of glabellar furrows; the second pair a little in advance of the mid-length; the first pair half way between the second and the neck furrow; the third pair running out just in advance of the anterior corners, sloping inwards at an angle of 45\u00b0 to the longitudinal axis. The furrows all extend inwards about one-fourth the width of the glabella. In most of the specimens there is a small pit in the middle of the front margin. Sometimes the first pair of furrows curve backwards and partially isolate the posterior pair of glabellar lobes. The glabella is well separated from the cheeks by deep dorsal furrows. The position of the eye has not been distinctly made out, but it appears to be opposite the posterior glabellar furrow. Length of largest glabella collected 10 lines; width of the same 7 lines.\n\nThe pygidium above figured, although widely different from that of an ordinary *Amphion* in aspect, still exhibits, in its structure some affinity thereto. It is triangular, tapering uniformly backwards with gently convex sides to the apex which is pointed or very narrowly rounded. Axis cylindro-conical, about one-third the whole width, strongly elevated and sub-angular along the median line, becoming more depressed towards the apex where it is scarcely raised above the general surface; about eighteen rounded ribs, those towards the apex sometimes obscurely developed. In the side lobes there are about ten ribs. Of these, the last four or five are very imperfectly developed, and are nearly parallel with the axis. On a side view this pygidium is very strongly convex, the ribs\nbeing bent down so that only half their length is seen in a view of the upper side as represented in the above figure.\n\nIn general there are only five segments in the axis of the pygidium of an Amphion, but in A. Julius figured (ante, p. 210), there are ten, and in this species eighteen. It is possible that all behind the fifth may be regarded as equivalent of the long triangular terminal segment of such species as A. Barrandei, A. Canadensis, and others. The general form of this pygidium is also very like that of Encrinurus, a genus which is very closely allied to Amphion. Indeed, if the specimens had been found associated with the head of an Encrinurus, I would have had no hesitation in referring them to that genus; but there was not a vestige of anything that could be identified as belonging thereto collected. On the other hand the glabella and pygidium above figured were found in about equal numbers together, and in great abundance. Out of one small piece of rock scarcely a yard in length, there were taken twenty-seven specimens of the glabella, and twenty-four of the pygidium. In this mass of rock there was no other head to which the pygidium could be referred, nor any other pygidium to which the head could possibly have belonged. Notwithstanding, however, this remarkable association, it is with great doubt that I classify the specimens under one name, even provisionally. Should a separation be hereafter found necessary, I beg that the specific name may be retained for the head.\n\nDedicated to Mr. T. C.

Glabella convex, oblong, uniformly rounded in front; sides straight and parallel; dorsal furrows deep; neck furrow all across; three pairs of glabellar furrows; the second pair half-way between the neck furrow and the front margin, the first pair a little nearer the neck furrow than they are to the second pair; the third or anterior pair cutting the anterior margin half way between the middle and the sides, and extending obliquely inwards at an angle of about 45\u00b0. The furrows all extend inwards one-third the whole width. The eyes appear to be large. A line drawn across the glabella at the mid-length would pass through their posterior angles, and they seem to slope inwards from this point towards the middle of the third lobe of the glabella. The distance of the posterior angle of the eye from the dorsal furrow is equal to nearly half the width of the glabella. The cheeks are somewhat coarsely pitted.\nLength of the head $3\\frac{1}{2}$ lines; width of the same 5 lines; width of the glabella, $2\\frac{1}{4}$ lines.\n\nThe glabella of *A.

These two pairs of furrows extend about half way up the sides, and have the convex curve forwards. On a side view, the outline is strongly arched upwards to the mid-length, just behind which rises the spine, from the base of which to the neck furrow there is a straight slope. The front of the glabella appears to be bordered by a very narrow rim. The surface of the glabella seems to be smooth.\n\nThis species is allied to *C. perforator*, (*ante*, p. 287,) but differs in having the spine not so far forwards. *C.

The form varies greatly. In some the outline is uniformly arched from the front margin to the neck furrow; in others, the\narch is depressed in the upper part, as in figure 310, \\(a\\); while some (\\(c\\)) have the posterior part arising abruptly from the neck furrow, and so extremely convex as to exhibit a tendency to become prolonged into a spine.

Without the border, the head is very strongly convex, its width at the neck segment one-third greater than the length; front broadly rounded, sides nearly straight, slightly converging forwards. Glabella elongate conical, cylindrical, rounded in front, with two obscure glabellar pits at the sides; neck furrow all across. The eyes appear to be situated opposite the anterior extremity of the glabella, but their position is very obscurely indicated in the specimen. The border is gently concave, nearly flat, its greatest width in front of the glabella, where it is equal to one-third the whole length of the head from the neck segment to the front margin, a little narrower at the sides of the head, somewhat rapidly tapering from the line of the neck segment to the points of the spines. The length of the spines is four-sevenths of the length of the head from the neck segment to the front margin. The distance between the points of the spines is a little more than half the greatest width of the whole head, including the border. The neck segment, at the posterior margin forms an elevated plate which follows the inner edge of the spines to their points.\nSurface of the glabella and elevated cheeks apparently smooth.

The glabella is gently convex, its width equal to about half the length of the head measured on the curve. The dorsal furrows are strongly impressed, extending a little more than one-third the length of the head, and usually with a sigmoid curve. Eyes about one and a half lines in length; about their own length from the posterior margin, and a little more from the dorsal furrows.\n\nPygidium rather strongly convex, flattened in the axial region; anterior angles obliquely truncated, the line formed by the truncation forming an angle of about 45\u00b0 with the longitudinal axis of the body. The length of the straight side on the angle is about half the width of the side lobe. The axis is gently convex and defined by the dorsal furrows for a little more than one-third the length of the whole pygidium. The sides and posterior margin are uniformly rounded. The length of the pygidium is about two-thirds of the greatest width.\n\nThe whole surface is covered with undulating fissure-like striae, from three to five in one line.\n\nThis species is certainly most closely allied to *I. fraternus* (ante, p.\nand has given me much perplexity on that account. The differences are that in this species the eye is proportionally nearer the glabella, and the glabella itself wider in proportion to the length of the head measured along the curve. Four specimens, A, B, C, D, gave the following measurements, in lines:\n\n|                  | A   | B   | C   | D   |\n|------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| Length of the head on the curve | 24  | 18  | 18  | 18  |\n| Width of the glabella     | 13  | 9   | 9\u00bd  | 9   |\n| Distance of the eye from the dorsal furrow | 3\u00bd | 2\u00bc | 2\u00be | ?   |\n\nFrom the above, it appears that the width of the glabella is about half the length of the head, and the distance of the eye from the dorsal furrow is a little less than one-third of the width of the glabella. In *I. fraternus* the eye is distant from the dorsal furrow at least one-half the width of the glabella, while the latter is less than half the length of the head. A specimen, of which the length of the head is 8 lines, has the glabella 3\u00bd lines in width. In this proportion an individual with the head 24 lines in length would have the glabella 8\u00bd lines in width, or nearly 4\u00bd narrower than the specimen of *I. simulator*, lettered A above.\n\nA number of other specimens of the head of *I. fraternus* have similar proportions; none of them are more than 10 lines in length, and most of them have a small tubercle near the posterior margin on the glabella. *I. fraternus* appears thus to be a smaller species with a narrower axis, and the eye more distant.\n\n*I. Crassicauda* has likewise a more slender axis, and the pygidium more broadly rounded.\n\n*I. Davisii* (Salter) has the doublure on the under side of the pygidium less than one-third the length, while in this species it is more than half the length of the pygidium.

Americanus*, and also some additional fragments of the head of *I. consimilis*, I am now enabled to shew that these are really quite distinct species.\n**Ill\u00e6nus Americanus** (Billings).\n\n*Ill\u00e6nus Americanus* (Billings). *Can. Nat. and Geo.*, vol. iv, p. 371, October, 1859.\n\n![Figures](image)\n\n**Fig. 316.**\n\n*Fig. 316.\u2014Ill\u00e6nus Americanus.* \\(a\\), upper side of the head of the original specimen; \\(b\\), front view of the same; \\(c\\), pygidium of the same; \\(d\\), a specimen in the cabinet of Dr. J. A. Grant, of Ottawa.\n\n**Description.**\u2014Oblong, distinctly tri-lobed; length two or three inches; width from three-fifths to five-sixths the length.\n\nHead large, strongly convex, its height usually a little greater than its length measured on a straight line, sometimes abruptly bent down at less than half the length from behind, often uniformly arched from the front to the posterior margin, equal to about one fourth of a sphere; length from front to posterior margin about two-thirds the width between the cheek angles in a straight line. The glabella is moderately convex; the dorsal furrows extend from one-fourth to a little more than one-third the whole length of the head, measured on the curve, and have an obscure sigmoid curve, at first outwards and then inwards, their anterior extremities usually turning a little outwards; they are distant from each other not quite one-half the whole width of the head. The eyes are of moderate size, about two lines in length, about half their length from the posterior margin, and half the width of the glabella from the dorsal furrows.\nThe cheek angles are rounded, and the posterior margin of the head makes with the lateral lower margin, as seen in a side view, usually a right angle, but in some specimens an obtuse angle of nearly $100^\\circ$, owing to the variable extent to which the front part of the head is produced downwards. In some the portion of the posterior margin outside of the eye curves forwards, and brings the cheek angle to a position in front of the eye. In others, it is behind the eye. The space between the eye and the dorsal furrows is convex, and the eye itself seems to be rather strongly protuberant or sub-conical. The movable cheek is sub-triangular, its width at the posterior margin about one and a half the distance of the eye from the dorsal furrow, its length along the lower margin a little greater than its posterior width. The anterior margin of the whole head is uniformly rounded, with the exception of a slight concave curve just outside of the suture. In some specimens in which the front part of the head is most abruptly bent down the middle portion of the front margin is depressed convex or nearly straight.\n\nThorax with ten segments. Axis moderately convex, from a little more than one-third to nearly one-half the width of the whole animal, a little wider at the anterior than at the posterior segment; the sides sometimes straight, and sometimes slightly curved outwards. On each side of the axis there is a flat space between the side of the axis and the bend of the pleurae. The width of this space is between one-third and one-half the width of the axis. The pleurae are bent at the fulcra at an angle which varies in different individuals, from $25^\\circ$ to $45^\\circ$, and at nearly one-half their length from the side of the axis.\n\nPygidium usually a little shorter than the thorax; varying from moderately to rather strongly convex; the posterior margin broadly and uniformly rounded; the anterior angles truncated nearly half the whole length of the pygidium; the straight sides formed by the truncation forming an angle of from $40^\\circ$ to $60^\\circ$ with the longitudinal axis of the body. The axis of the pygidium is well defined at the anterior margin by the dorsal furrows, which die out at about one-third or one-half the length, converging towards each other, and sometimes obscurely defining the apex.\n\nThe surface characters of this species are peculiar, although somewhat variable. The specimen on which the species was originally founded has the whole of the head and pygidium covered with short squamose fissure-like striae; one edge of each fissure, being more elevated than the other, gives to the surface a wrinkled appearance. These striae vary in length from half a line to two or three lines, and are from one-eighth to one-fourth of a line distant from each other. On the tail they seem to radiate irregularly from the axis as a centre. Near the front margin and parallel with it, are a number of straight continuous fissures. This latter character\noccurs in other species of this genus. In other specimens the striae are more distinct and distant, but still are of the same character. In a specimen in Dr. Grant's cabinet, the middle portion of the front of the head is nearly smooth, and in addition to the striae, is coarsely punctured. The following are the dimensions of the original specimen (A), and the one represented by fig. 316, d, (B), in lines.\n\n| Lines | Lines |\n|-------|-------|\n| Length of the head in a straight line from the anterior to the posterior margin, | 12 | 10 |\n| Following the curvature, | 16 | 14 |\n| Distance between the dorsal furrows, | 7\u00bd | 6\u00be |\n| Width of head at the cheek angles, | 18 | 15 |\n| Distance of the eye from the dorsal furrows, | 4 | 3 |\n| Length of the eye, | 2 | 2 |\n| Distance of the eye from the posterior margin, | 1 | 1 |\n| Length of thorax, | 9 | 7\u00bd |\n| Width of axis at first segment, | 7\u00bd | 6\u00bd |\n| \u201c \u201c at last segment, | 6 | 5 |\n| Bend of the fifth segment from side of axis, | 2\u00be | 2\u00be |\n| Length of the pygidium in a straight line, | 7\u00bd | 7\u00bc |\n| Following the curve, | 9 | 9 |\n| Greatest width, | 14 | 12\u00bd |\n\nThis species is allied to the *I. crassicauda* (Wahlenberg), but still is, I think, quite distinct. In the two specimens of the latter, figured by Dalman, the axis in one is 9 lines in length, and 5\u00bd in width; in the others, it is 10 lines in length, and 7\u00bd in width. In the specimen figured by Angelin, it is 10\u00bd lines in length, and 7\u00bd in width. The axis appears thus to be proportionally longer and narrower than it is in *I. Americanus*. The pygidium is also larger in *I. crassicauda*, and the surface of the head marked by coarse undulating lines, not short wrinkle-shaped fissures.\n\nFrom *I. consimilis* (*ante*, p. 277), this species differs in the form of the glabella, and in the surface characters, but more remarkably in the shape of the posterior angles of the head, as shown in the following figures:\n\nFig. 317.\u2014A detached cheek of *I. consimilis*.\n\nFig. 318.\u2014Side view of a head of *I. Americanus*. The dotted line, a, is an outline of the cheek of *I. consimilis*.\nIn *I. Americanus* the posterior margin of the cheek outside of the eye forms with the lateral margin, in some specimens, an angle of 90\u00b0, and in others from 90\u00b0 to 100\u00b0. In *I. consimilis* the same two lines (without regarding in either case the rounded angle) are inclined towards each other at an angle of less than 50\u00b0; the posterior termination of the cheek being produced into an auriculate projection, altogether different from that of *I. Americanus*.\n\n*I. Americanus* is a rare species, but I have examined three specimens with the head, thorax and pygidium in connection, two others with the head and thorax, and about thirty detached heads and portions of heads. The comparison of these shews very conclusively that it is quite distinct from *I. consimilis*.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Most of the specimens are from Ottawa, but we have it also from L\u2019Orignal and Lake Huron; Trenton limestone only.\n\n**Ill\u00e6nus incertus.** (N. sp.)\n\n![Figures](image)\n\n*Fig. 319.* \u2014 *Ill\u00e6nus incertus.* a, upper side of a perfect head; b, side view of the same.\n\n*Fig. 320.* \u2014 *I. consobrinus.* a, upper side of the head; b, side view of the same; c, side view of another specimen, with the posterior angles more produced.*\n\n**Description.**\u2014Closely allied to *I. consobrinus*. Head strongly convex, width twice the length, broadly rounded in front. Glabella wide, depressed convex, its width equal to one-half the whole length of the head following the curve; dorsal furrows straight and parallel. Eyes of moderate size, ovate, their length about one-third the width of the glabella, about their own length from the posterior margin, and the same distance from the dorsal furrow. The checks are subtriangular, narrowly rounded at the angle, the lower margin a little concave between the angle and the facial suture; the posterior margin outside of the eye, in length, equal to a little more than half the width of the glabella; the lower margin somewhat longer than the posterior.\n\nThe pygidium closely resembles that of *I. consimilis* (*ante*, p. 276),\n\n---\n\n*In the figures of this species (*ante*, p. 280), the facial suture is represented as curving outwards from the eye. On closely examining the specimens, I cannot make out the suture distinctly; the line (only seen on one side) appearing to be a fissure. The figures are therefore reproduced here with the line removed, to guard against error.*\nbut is only one-fourth the size: its length is about half the greatest width, the anterior angles truncated, all the rest of the margin broadly and uniformly rounded; axis gently convex, extending half the length, narrowed to a point at the apex, where it is sometimes obscurely defined all round. Surface covered with coarse undulating striae.\n\nLength of a perfect head following the curve 8 lines; length from the posterior margin to a straight line erected vertically from the front margin 4\u00bd lines; width in a straight line between the cheek angles 9 lines; width of the glabella 4 lines; length of the posterior margin of the cheek outside of the eye 3 lines.\n\nLength of the largest pygidium seen 4 lines; width of the same 9 lines. A number of perfect heads and pygidia have been collected. The largest head is the one above figured; most of the specimens are one-third smaller.\n\nOn comparing a number of specimens of the head of both species, it is found that this one differs remarkably from *I. consobrinus* in the form of the glabella, the dorsal furrows being always straight, and either parallel or with their anterior extremities a little more distant than the posterior; whereas, on the other hand, in *I. consobrinus* they are never straight, but always curved inwards anteriorly. This character must give to perfect specimens a very different aspect, and will be found, most probably, correlated with other differences in other parts. The cheek angles are somewhat variable in both species, but they are always prolonged backwards in *I. consobrinus*, sometimes extremely so, as represented in the above Fig. 320, c. In *I. incertus* they are, as a general rule, only a little less than a right angle, while in some individuals they are rather more.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Stanbridge, range 6, lot 20; Quebec group.\n\n**Collector.**\u2014T.

The glabellar furrows are two deep elongate grooves extending\nfrom about the mid-length backwards and inwards nearly to the neck furrow; their posterior extremities separated by about one third the width of the glabella.

There are three pairs of glabellar furrows, the last pair connected across by a straight line in the middle of the glabella; the other two pairs not so connected; all inclined forwards and outwards. In front of the glabella there appears to be a wide smooth border. On the neck segment there is a median tubercle.\n\nThe pygidium above figured was found in the same mass of limestone. It is not certain that it belongs to this species.

In some the glabella and side lobes, (between the glabella and the eyes) are divided by a transverse groove, as in fig. 323 a, above; in others the side lobes, only, are divided; and in some the groove is not visible at all as in fig. 269 (ante, p. 282). I cannot separate these different forms, as there is a perfect series from those with smooth lobes through others with the groove becoming deeper and deeper until the forms above figured with a deep furrow are reached.\n\nIn addition to the Cow Head locality, it is now found to occur abundantly in Stanbridge, range 6, lot 20, where it was discovered by T. C. Weston.\n\nPROTOZOA.\n\nCALATHIUM? PANNOSUM. (N. sp.)\n\nFig. 324.\n\nDescription.\u2014This specimen is a fragment of what appears to have been a wide cup-shaped individual. In fig. 324 a, is shown the inner concave surface of a portion of one side. The wall of the cup, so far as we can judge from the structure of this specimen, consists of an inner poriferous layer about three lines in thickness as shewn in the unshaded curved band in fig. b. Outside of this there are some appearances of a thick, rough spongy layer without regular rows of pores, but with an obscure lamellar concentric structure. On this point however there is much doubt, as the remains of the outer layer are imperfectly preserved. The inner surface seems to be smooth and compact. At what appears to be the bottom of\nthe cup, there is a space where the pores have no definite arrangement, but from this space they proceed up the sides in regular slightly undulating rows. New rows are introduced at intervals according to the increasing expansion of the cup. Most of the pores have a thin, sharp, slightly elevated margin. The internal structure of the inner layer seems to be reticulated, all the pores communicating with each other by longitudinal and transverse canals of the same size as the external orifices of the pores.\n\nFig. 324.\n\nFig. 324.\u2014Calathium? pannosum. \\(a\\), the internal surface; \\(b\\), side view of the specimen showing the thickness of the inner poriferous layer.\n\nFrom what remains of it, it is clear that the cup of this individual must have been at least 3 inches wide, and \\(1\\frac{1}{2}\\) in depth. But as the edges are all broken, we cannot say how much larger it may have been when perfect. The rows of pores are on an average 1 line distant from each other, and there are about 6 pores in 3 lines of the length of each row.\n\nThe specimen is a silicified fragment, and was dissolved (by hydrochloric acid) out of one of the nodules of limestone, in which the species of Brachiopoda figured on pp. 73, 75, 79, 82, were found. That this species is generically allied to Calathium will appear by reference to the following, which will be described in this place for convenience of comparison.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014Point L\u00e9vis; in the upper part of limestone No. 2, Quebec group.\n\nCollectors.\u2014Sir W. Logan, J. Richardson.\nFig. 325.\u2014*Calathium Anstedi?* Transverse and longitudinal sections of the upper extremity of a specimen supposed to be of this species.\n\nRemarks.\u2014The specimen above figured, when collected, was imbedded in a piece of limestone, the transverse section, only, being visible. Of this, the above fig. 325, \\(a\\), was first made, and then it was sawn in two longitudinally with a lapidary's wheel. The two halves were next treated with hydrochloric acid, and the cup was thus freed from the limestone with which it was filled. The section made by the saw passes lengthwise\nthrough the cup splitting it in two, one half of which is shown in fig. 325, b. It is evident that this specimen consists of only the upper extremity of the fossil, and that the upper right hand sloping side of b, above, represents one-half of the margin. From the form of this part it might be supposed, at first sight, that the fossil was obliquely terminated at the upper end, one side of the cup being lower than the other. But it will be observed that the narrow cylindrical cavity of the cup enters at a right angle to the general plane of this sloping side, and that, half-way down, it is curved so as to meet the lower straight side, also at a right angle. This proves that the fossil, when perfect, was considerably curved.\n\nIn the transverse section at a, is shown the diameter of the cup, five lines. Its centre is seven lines from the exterior on the lower side of the figure, which corresponds to the outer or convexly curved side of figure b. But it is eighteen lines from the exterior of the opposite side. Its position, thus, in this specimen, is very eccentric. In the specimen figured on p. 210, it is central. In the lower part of b, the structure of a portion of the inner wall of the cup is shown. It is perforated by small ovate or sub-quadrate pores, most probably the apertures of a system of radiating canals. These pores are arranged in straight longitudinal rows, and there are from three to four pores in the length of two lines in each row. There are four rows in the width of two lines. In the transverse section, a, the course of the canals radiating from the centre outwards is shown. The whole fossil appears to be composed of a number of concentric laminae from one-fourth of a line to one line in thickness. Each of these is no doubt a repetition of the inner wall of the cup, and they are all perforated by the radiating canals. Between the concentric layers, another set of canals ascends from the base upwards, and it is probable that all communicate with each other, vertically, laterally, and in a radial direction. I cannot determine from these specimens whether or not this species had an external layer of a spongy texture, as seems to have been the case with C. pannosum.\n\nJudging from the form of what remains of it, this specimen must have been 5 or 6 inches in length when perfect. It was found in division H, Pistolet Bay, Newfoundland, along with the specimen figured on p. 210.\n\nI have referred it to C. Anstedi with doubt, because its structure seems to be somewhat different, being more compact towards the exterior. Should it turn out to be a distinct species, I propose to call it Calathium erassum.\n8. New Species of Fossils from the Calciferous Formation, with Remarks on some others previously described.\n\nINCERT\u00c6 SEDES.\n\nGenus Ribeiria. (Sharpe.)\n\nRibeiria. (Sharpe.) Jour. Geo. Soc., vol. ix, p. 157, 1853.\n\nRemarks.\u2014Mr. Sharpe thus describes this remarkable genus. \"Shell univalve, elongated, laterally compressed into the form of a Pholas or Lithodomus; open at both ends and along the pedal margin, with a thick transverse internal plate near the anterior extremity, behind which is a very large corrugated boss for the attachment of a muscle.\n\n\"This curious shell appears related to the family of Calyptraeidae, but it shows no trace of spiral growth; as far as can be judged from the imperfect specimens seen, it is equilateral, and both the transverse internal plate, and the muscular attachment are placed along the middle of the back of the shell; the external form may be described as a Calyptraea pressed together laterally till the sides nearly meet, leaving only a narrow opening for the foot of the animal.\" (Sharpe, loc. cit.)\n\nOne species, R. pholadiformis is described by Mr. Sharpe. It was found in the lower division of the Lower Silurian formation of the Serra de Mucela, and the Serra de Bussaco, in the neighborhood of Bussaco in Portugal.\n\nJ. W. Salter has, I think, referred this genus to the Crustacea, but I have not at present access to the publication containing his paper.\n\nOur species agree, in all general characters with the description of Mr. Sharpe, except that the internal casts do not exhibit the impression of any large boss for the attachment of a muscle. This, however, may be due to differences in the growth of the shell of the individuals examined. It is not uncommon, in the Mollusca at all events, to find in the same species individuals with the muscular scars strongly developed, and others with it scarcely perceptible. In a fragment of a silicified specimen in our collection, the transverse plate is perfectly preserved. Just beneath the umbo, and in front of it, there is a small aperture, of a semicircular shape, which appears to be the entrance to a tubular passage running backwards over the transverse plate into the general cavity of the body. This is visible in so many specimens that I think it scarcely possible that it can be the result of the accidental destruction of the apex of the umbo or beak. My present impression is that it served the function of a byssal orifice, and that these species were anchored by a byssus passing through the beak.\nMr. Sharpe does not notice this character, although one of his figures shows a perfect exterior, and it may be that our species belong to a different genus. At present I shall place them in *Ribciria* provisionally; and should a further examination show that a separation is necessary, I propose *Ribcirina* as a sub-generic name for their reception.\n\nIn England there appears to be one or two species of this genus in the lower part of the Llandeilo formation.

Side view.*\n\n**Description.**\u2014Ovate, compressed, narrowed towards the posterior extremity, anterior broadly rounded; ventral margin more or less convex its whole length, sloping upwards nearly to the dorsal line from about the mid-length backwards; dorsum from the beaks to the upper posterior angle straight, usually a little concave in the posterior half. The beaks are not prominent, and their position varies from one-sixth to one-fifth the length from the anterior angle. The portion of the dorsum in front of the beaks is nearly straight, situated a little below the line of the portion behind, usually sloping slightly downwards from the orifice to the angle. The dorsum is entire, that is to say, it has no hinge, there being only one valve; it is very narrowly rounded or sub-carinated. The posterior extremity is abruptly truncated at an angle of about 100\u00b0, the straight margin formed by the truncation being in length about one-fourth or one-third the height of the shell from the ventral margin to the beaks. The gape of the shell extends all round both extremities and the ventral margin; and it is usually a little less than one line in width. Surface characters unknown, apparently smooth.\n\nMost of the specimens collected are silicified, and some of them are empty. Several casts of the interior were procured. They show the oblique fissure beneath the beak occasioned by the transverse plate in a\nmanner somewhat similar to that of casts of the interior of the genus *Cleidophorus* (Hall), but sloping backwards instead of forwards. There is a line also running round parallel with the ventral margin and near it, resembling the pallial line of the lamellibranchiate shells. The form is somewhat variable, the ventral margin not having always the same amount of convexity. Both sides of the shell are gently convex.\n\nLength from 8 to 16 lines; width of the shell from the beaks to the ventral margin, about half the length.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Counties of Leeds and Grenville; Calciferous formation.\n\n**Collector.**\u2014E.

The dorsum is straight from the beaks backwards. The portion in front of the beaks nearly straight, lower than the portion behind. The orifice beneath the beaks is obscurely seen in the specimen.

The margin in some specimens is acute and turned upwards; in others with a rounded band sometimes one line in width. Umbilicus wide, usually one-half or two-thirds the whole width, the margin sub-angular, and the slope of the whorls within flat or nearly so. The under side of the whorls have usually a slight concave band just beneath the margin; thence to the edge of the umbilicus uniformly convex, often strongly so. The aperture is transversely ovate or obscurely rhomboidal, the outer and inner angles acute, the contour corresponding to the form of the whorl.\nSurface with fine sharp stri\u00e6 of unequal size, the smaller four or five in one line, the larger twice the size of the smaller; usually with shallow undulations one or two lines wide conforming to the course of the stri\u00e6; all curving backwards to the margin, which they reach at an acute angle. In some the surface is reticulated with longitudinal spiral lines following the whorls to the apex. Diameter from 18 to 30 lines.\n\nFig. 329.\n\nThe whorls vary in their width greatly. Fig. 329 represents a cast of the spire of an individual with six whorls, and specimens have been collected which have them still more slender.\n\n*P. aperta* (Salter) is the species most nearly allied to this, the transverse section of the whorls being precisely the same except that in the umbilicus they are not flat but rounded, and, besides, it is a smaller form and never has more than four whorls. The large specimen figured in the Geol. of Canada, p. 117, fig. 28, d, as a form of *P. Laurentina*, belongs to this species. The true *P. Laurentina* has the umbilicus scarcely one-fourth the whole width.

Within the carina there is at first a shallow concave band, and then a concave slope into the suture. Outside of the carina there is a similar but barely perceptible concavity, below which the periphery is uniformly convex. On the under side the whorls vary from uniformly convex to very depressed convex, and sometimes flat along the median line on approaching the aperture. The edge of the suture is usually at first rounded and then angular. Surface with rather strong sub-squamose stri\u00e6. The whorls are sometimes separated two lines from each other, but usually not so distant, and often almost in contact. The depth\nof the whorls is about equal to their width. It is difficult to say whether this species should be called an *Ophileta*, a *Helicotoma*, or an *Ecuiliomphalus*.

One specimen four inches in length tapers from nine lines to five lines, or at the rate of one line to the inch. Where the diameter is between six and seven lines there are four septal rings to the inch. They are most distant from the apex on the side of the concave curve, shewing that the position of the siphuncle is similar to that of *O. Missisquoi*. The curvature is very slight, the height of the arch formed by it being only two lines in a length of four inches.\n\nIt is barely possible that this may be a variety of the *O.

The proportional diameter of the siphuncle to that of the shell cannot be made out with certainty, but it appears to be one-third of the whole section. The shell is not annulated.\n\nThis species has a larger siphuncle than has O. deparcum.

(N. sp.)\n\nDescription.\u2014Shell large, apparently eight or nine inches across; whorls rapidly increasing, the third measuring nearly three inches in the dorso-ventral diameter. Section apparently nearly circular. The whorls are somewhat closely inrolled, the first three slightly indenting each other. In the second whorl there are six septa to the inch, and in the third whorl four to the inch, as seen on the median line of the side. The umbilicus is deep, exposing all the whorls to the apex. Siphuncle and surface unknown.\n\nThe specimen is a fragment consisting of a little more than three whorls, and as there are traces of the septa visible to the extremity or where the last whorl is broken off, it is evident that no part of the chamber of habitation is preserved. In the centre of the umbilicus there is a space eight lines in diameter, in which no indication of structure is seen, and is taken to be the size of the first whorl. The second whorl, commencing with a dorso-ventral diameter of five and a-half lines, enlarges to eleven lines in making one complete turn. The third whorl, commencing with a diameter of eleven lines, enlarges to thirty-three lines. Diameter of the whole specimen, consisting of about three and one-eighth whorls, six inches.\n\nThis appears to be quite distinct from all those described in the preceding pages. It approaches, in form, *N. tyrans* of the Chazy limestone, but is more compactly inrolled.\n\nLocality and Formation.\u2014Mingan Islands; Calciferous formation.\n\nCollector.\u2014J.

Cybele.\n\nRemarks.\u2014The specimen of A. canalis above figured appears to me to be perfectly identical with those that occur in Newfoundland and the localities mentioned on p. 270. It was found in the Calciferous formation near Mirrickville by Mr. Francis Ballantyne, of the Township of Kitley.\n\nThe pygidium above referred to Amphion Salteri, cannot be distinguished specifically from the original specimen on which the species was founded. It was collected in the Calciferous formation in the Township of Oxford, by T. C. Weston. This species was first discovered by J. Richardson in the limestone of the Quebec group at Phillipsburgh.\n\nDolichometopus? rarus differs from D. convexus (ante, p. 269), in having the axis of the pygidium somewhat shorter, and having only two simple grooves in the side lobes. D. gibberulus (p. 269) has a shorter axis, which is smooth. These three species are certainly very closely\nallied to each other, and future discoveries may prove them to be identical. It occurs at Oxford with *A. Salteri*.\n\n*Bathyurus amplimarginatus* (fig. 241, a) has been found only at the Mingan Islands in the Calciferous.\n\n*B. conicus* (fig. 241, b) was originally discovered at St. Timothy, on the Beauharnois Canal, in the upper part of the Calciferous. It occurs also at Comstock\u2019s Landing, in the State of New York, in the same formation. A specimen, only distinguishable from this species by having the surface smooth instead of tuberculated, was collected in the Quebec group at Cow Head, Newfoundland, in Division P. In all these three localities it occurs associated with *Camerilla calcifera*, the most characteristic brachiopod of the Point Levis limestone.\n\n*B. Cybele* occurs at the Mingan Islands, Beauharnois, and in the Counties of Leeds and Grenville. It has been found also at Orwell, in the State of Vermont, and at Comstock\u2019s Landing, in New York.\n\n**BATHYURUS MINGANENSIS.**\n\n*Description.*\u2014Glabella rather strongly convex, sub-conical, sides in the posterior two-thirds of the length straight and nearly parallel, the anterior third converging so as to form a rather narrowly rounded apex. Neck segment large; neck furrow all across. Fixed cheeks moderately prominent. The eye appears to be semicircular; the posterior angle on a line crossing the glabella at almost the mid-length and three lines from the dorsal furrow. From the posterior angle the eye seems to curve forwards and inwards, so that its anterior angle is close to the side of the glabella. The pygidium, of which only a fragment has been collected, has at least four wide rings on the axis. It has also four, and perhaps more segments, in the side lobes. These segments, in the side lobes, are wide and flat, with an obscure groove along the middle. The margin of the pygidium is unknown.\n\nLength of the glabella 9 lines; width at the mid-length 7 lines. The pygidium is apparently about 15 lines in length.\n\nThis species is founded on an imperfect glabella and part of a pygidium, of which however sufficient is preserved to show that it is distinct from any described form. It is most nearly related to *B. amplimarginatus*, but has the glabella broader and the ribs of the side lobes divided by a furrow along the middle.\n\n*Locality and Formation.*\u2014Mingan Islands; Calciferous formation.\n\n*Collector.*\u2014J. Richardson.\nPROTOZOA.\n\nAlthough the zoological rank of *Archeocyathus Calathium* and *Rhabdaria* is not positively established, I shall retain them among the Protozoa for the present, provisionally.\n\n**Genus Archeocyathus.** (*Ante*, p. 3.)\n\n![Diagram](image)\n\n**Fig. 342.**\n\n*Fig. 342.\u2014Archeocyathus Minganensis.* \\(a\\), fragment of the cylindrical portion of a silicified specimen of this species; \\(b\\), end view of the same specimen.\n\n**Remarks.**\u2014The following are some additional details of the structure of this remarkable genus. The general form, as exhibited by the three species at present known, is that of an elongated hollow cone, or, rather, a hollow cylinder, with one end narrowed to a point, the smaller extremity being closed and more or less curved; the larger end open. They thus resemble certain large species of *Zaphrentis* or *Cyathophyllum*, and, in fact, from their form and septate structure were at first thought to be corals. Some of the individuals appear to have attained a length of two or three feet, with a diameter of three or four inches. All of the species are transversely and more or less deeply marked by irregular annulations. The structure consists of an inner, thin wall, or endotheca, lining the great central cavity,\u2014an outer wall, or epitheca, forming the rough external surface and, between these, a system of radiating septa. The outer wall, in two of the species, *A. profundus* and *A. Minganensis*, is perforated\nwith numerous small irregular apertures leading directly into the loculi or empty spaces between the septa. In the third species, *A. Atlanticus*, it (the outer wall) appears to have a compact smooth surface, with only a few perforations. The inner wall is very thin, with numerous pores leading from the loculi into the great central cavity. The septa consist of thin flat plates, arranged longitudinally exactly as in the genus *Zaphrentis*. They extend from the outer to the inner wall, and are perforated with numerous small circular pores, so that the interseptal loculi all communicate with each other as well as with the central cavity and the exterior. The loculi are subdivided by very thin dissepiments resembling those of a *Cyathophyllum*, but they are irregularly distributed, being in some parts entirely absent, and in other places so numerous that they completely fill the loculi with small cells constituting the \"poriferous or cellular tissue\" mentioned in the original description of the genus (*ante*, p. 3). The central cavity extends nearly the whole length, and constitutes a large proportion of the bulk of the fossil. Below it there is a portion of the smaller extremity or base, which is composed only of the outer wall, the septa and the dissepiments. The section across this part shows that the new septa, which are introduced from time to time, as the diameter increases, do not at first extend to the centre, and it would appear from this that they were developed on the inner surface of the outer wall, and gradually widened as in the genus *Zaphrentis*.\n\nFig. 343.\u2014Restoration of the lower part of *Archeocyathus Minganensis*; *a*, the pores of the inner wall.\n\n344.\u2014Spicula found imbedded in the walls of the same species or associated in the same rock-specimens. Enlarged 50 diameters.\nClose to the extreme point of the base the septa and dissepiments have an irregular arrangement, and the loculi sometimes here appear to be mere circular perforations.\n\nThe small branching spicula, above figured, are seen imbedded in and forming a part of the substance of the outer wall of *A. Minganensis*. The fusiform and cylindrical varieties are also seen, but rarely, either adhering to or partially imbedded in the same specimens. As they were obtained in thousands in the sediment left after dissolving pieces of the limestone holding fragments of this species, they were at first thought to belong to it. But I have recently, while treating other pieces of limestone from the same bed, also holding fragments of *A. Minganensis*, found that another large species, *Trichospongia sericea*, occurs in this rock, portions of which are crowded with, and seem to be almost altogether composed of, these spicula. It should therefore remain an open question whether or not these fusiform and cylindrical spicula actually form a part of the structure of *Archeocyathus*, or are those of *T. sericea*. There can scarcely be any doubt about the branched spicula, as they can be seen not only projecting from the surface of the silicified specimens, but also in the thin slices prepared for the microscope. No spicula have been detected in *A. profundus*.\n\nIn *A. Atlanticus* there are several objects visible, in the only specimen of that species that has been collected, which resemble branched spicula. No silicified specimens of these two latter species have been procured, and I think it probable that if such could be examined spicula would be found in them.\n\nAs to the zoological rank of this genus there yet remains some doubt. The general structure is such that it may possibly be a sponge. The apertures in the external wall may be the homologues of the inhalent pores of the ordinary sponge, while those of the inner wall may represent the exhalent orifices. The great internal cavity, in that case, would have the same function as the large central cloaca of the fistulose genera of sponges. A radiated and more or less perfectly septate structure occurs in many undoubted sponges. In this genus, however, the substance of the septa is almost as compact as that of the true corals. The perforated character of the outer wall, and also of the septa, suggest a comparison with corals of the division *Zoantharia perforata*. The *Favosites* have also their walls perforated. Dr. J. W. Dawson, who has examined a number of the slices of *A. Atlanticus* and *A. profundus*, which have been prepared for the microscope, is of opinion that the structure of these two species is similar to that of the Foraminifera.* My own opinion is that all three species\n\n---\n\n* Can. Nat. and Geol. April, 1865.\nbelong to one generic group closely related to *Calathium*. This latter passes into *Eospongia*, which, in its turn, gradually merges into other genera that occur in more recent formations, such as *Rhy sospongia*, *Scyphia*, *Siphonia*, and others. The resemblance between the whole structure and that of the palaeozoic corals seems also to shew that in the Lower Silurian seas organic forms existed combining the characters of the Protozoa and the C\u0153lenterata.\n\n**Genus Trichospongia. (N. gen.)**\n\n*Generic Characters.*\u2014This genus occurs in rudely hemispheric masses from one to five inches across. The skeleton appears to be minutely fibrous, and is full of elongate cylindrical or acerate spicula just visible to the naked eye. In silicified specimens that have been treated with acid there are seen numerous irregular branching canals from one to six lines in diameter.\n\n**Trichospongia sericea. (N. sp.)**\n\n*Description.*\u2014The form appears to be rudely hemispherical, and from one to five inches in diameter. In one specimen an imperfect concentric structure is obscurely indicated. In a very small individual there is a deep concavity in one side, which may be the cup.\n\nThe specimens are very imperfect, consisting, in general, of portions which were sufficiently silicified to resist the acid, and very little can be determined with certainty as to the form. All the fragments that have been observed appear to belong to one species.\n\n*Locality and Formation.*\u2014Mingan Islands; Calciferous formation.\n\n*Collectors.*\u2014Sir W. E. Logan and J. Richardson.\n\n**Genus Rhabdaria. (N. gen.)**\n\n*Generic Characters.*\u2014This genus is proposed for the reception of certain small cylindrical bodies which were found in the residue left after dissolving pieces of the magnesian limestone from the Mingan Islands in acid. They are from one to four lines in diameter, with a rough surface, and have a small perforation along the centre. There are two species which I propose to name provisionally as follows:\n\n1. *Rhabdaria fragilis.*\u2014Small cylindrical stems, with a rough exterior, and a central perforation or canal. At first these were thought to be silicified specimens of *Stenopora fibrosa*, but when others were procured shewing the central canal, it became evident that they could not be thus\nreferred. They have the form of crinoidal columns, but are not jointed. No structure can be made out in thin slices under the microscope.\n\n2. *Rhabdaria furcata.*\u2014A single specimen of this species only has been collected. The principal stem is three lines in thickness, and it sends off a number of branches at angles varying from $15^\\circ$ to $30^\\circ$. The branches seem to be connected in one place by lateral processes as in *Syringopora*.\n\n**Calathium? paradoxicum. (N. sp.)**\n\n![Image](image)\n\nFig. 345.\u2014*Calathium? paradoxicum.* Side view of the upper extremity of a large specimen.\n\n**Description.**\u2014The specimen above figured is a fragment of the upper extremity of an individual which, when perfect, was probably six inches or more in length, and three inches across at the top. It is perfectly separated from the matrix, but split in two longitudinally, giving a vertical section on the side opposite that figured, but showing no structure except an obscure concentric lamellar arrangement near the outside. It is composed of compact chert or quartz. The lower half is cylindrical, slightly tapering. The upper half suddenly expands, and has two projecting lobes at $a$ and $b$, each of which appears to be the base of a branch. On the surface of the lower half there are a number of somewhat prominent rounded longitudinal ridges.\nAnother specimen is four inches in length, and broken off at both extremities. Its diameter in the middle is about twenty lines, and at the upper extremity three inches. It appears to be lobed at the upper end as is the one above figured. The exterior to the depth of three lines has an obscurely concentric lamellar structure. The interior, as exhibited in the fracture of the large end, is a poriferous mass two inches across. The pores are rudely circular, from one-fourth of a line to one line in width, and about the same distances apart from each other. The fossil itself is composed of a whitish chert, and it is imbedded in dark-brown magnesian limestone. This dark-brown rock is injected into the pores, and defines them very distinctly. The external lamellar portion is perforated in a radial direction by small canals about half-a-line in diameter, as shown in one place; but in another place they seem to be much smaller. The central poriferous mass seems to be irregularly reticulated by the canals.\n\nJudging from these two specimens this species appears to be a subturbinate form, which at the height of several inches produced several others by a budding process. It is referred to the genus *Calathium* provisionally.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Mingan Islands; Calciferous formation.\n\n**Collectors.**\u2014Sir W. E. Logan, J.

It resembles *R. occidentalis* (Salter), but differs in having the stolons of a somewhat greater length. This perhaps would not be sufficient to separate the species, but as the one is only known in the Calciferous, and the other in the Black River limestone, the whole of the Chazy intervening, it is most probable that they are distinct.\nThe squares formed by the stolons are on an average 1\u00bd lines on the side. The largest sized squares that can be made out in *R. occidentalis* are 1 line on an average, and in general they are somewhat less.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Mingan Islands; calciferous formation.\n\n**Collector.**\u2014J.

(N. sp.)**\n\nFig. 347.\n\n**Description.**\u2014This appears to be an elongate sub-cylindrical species, several inches in length, about one inch in diameter and probably tapering or more or less rounded at each end. The best specimen is a fragment of nearly half of the cylinder split in two longitudinally and empty. The drawing is made from a gutta-percha cast of the interior, and is too straight, the original being slightly undulated. The whole of the inner surface is covered with obscurely rhomboidal elevations arranged in oblique rows crossing each other at an angle of about 45\u00b0. These elevations leave corresponding rhomboidal pits in the gutta-percha cast represented above. There are on an average four or five pits in the length of two lines. The fossil is imbedded in a finely granular magnesian limestone, and, although the thickness of the wall can be very clearly made out, yet the tubes which ought to be apparent, if it be a true *Receptaculites*, are not visible. Supposing them to exist, they would be, in this species, very slender, and in this kind of rock all delicate structure is usually destroyed. The thickness of the wall is only two lines, and therefore, the tubes would be less than two lines; while their diameter, if in proportion to other species, would be one-eighth of a line or thereabout.\n\nIt is referred to *Receptaculites* provisionally.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Mingan Islands; Calciferous formation.\n\n**Collector.**\u2014J. Richardson.\n\n**Genus Euchasma. (N. gen.)**\n\n**Generic Characters.**\u2014The only species of this genus known to me is strongly convex triangular, inequilateral, equivalve, subcordiform. The posterior? extremity is flat and gaping the whole length. The anterior? extremity is rounded-angular, and seems to be gaping also; but no specimens have been procured with this part perfect, and, therefore, this point remains doubtful. The hinge line is short, and seems to have an external ligament. When the flat side is ground down gradually, it is found that just below the umbones the shell of both valves has a large rounded protuberance on the inside. These leave an impression in the cast of the interior just behind the umbo.\nE. Blumenbachia has been heretofore referred by me to the genus Conocardium, but that genus has not the two large posterior teeth possessed by this shell. It must be closely allied to Eopteria (ante, p. 221, 306, 307), but differs externally in having one extremity flat. This may not be sufficient to separate the genera, and should it hereafter turn out that the internal structure is the same in all the species, I beg that the Euchasma be retained for the group, and Eopteria withdrawn from science.\n\nIn the above description I have called the flat side the posterior with doubt, as the specimens are not sufficiently perfect to enable me to determine which is posterior or anterior.\n\nI may explain here, also, that this genus would have been described on p. 220, only that I had then hopes of procuring better specimens, and thus delayed.\n\n![Fig. 348.](image)\n\nFig. 348.\u2014Euchasma Blumenbachia. \\(a\\), side view of a small specimen; \\(b\\), the flat, posterior? extremity, shewing the long narrow gape.\n\n9. New species of Fossils from the Quebec Group in the Northern part of Newfoundland, with a few from the Potsdam Group.\n\n(Continued from p. 300.)\n\n---\n\nGRAPTOLITID\u00c6.\n\nA number of species of graptolites were collected at Table Head, Bay St. Paul, Pistolet Bay, and Cow Head. Most of them are identical with those that occur at Point L\u00e9vis, but there are a few which may be new species. It would require a larger collection of more perfect specimens to decide.\n\nTable Head.\u2014Two species, in a bad state of preservation, were found at this locality in the black bituminous slates forming the upper part of Division N. One of them resembles G. pristis. The other, of which a single specimen only was collected, consists of twenty or thirty stipes\nradiating from a central point, but so imperfect and distorted that it cannot be determined whether it is a compound species or a number of individuals of one of the simple forms accidentally congregated together.\n\nCow Head.\u2014In the black slates of Division P, the following were collected, all of which occur at Point L\u00e9vis, and are described by Prof. Hall: *Phyllograptus typus*, *G. bryonoides*, *G. denticulatus*, *G. fruticosus*, *G. Headi*, *Callograptus elegans* and *Ptilograptus plumosus*.\n\nBay St. Paul.\u2014From the black slates of this locality, belonging to Division P., we have *G. bryonoides*, *G. denticulatus*, *G. fruticosus*, *Ptilograptus plumosus* and *C. elegans*.\n\nPistolet Bay.\u2014The graptolites collected here are very imperfectly preserved. The most common is a slender filiform species like *G. flaccidus*, but straighter; a species closely allied to, if not identical with *G. ciliatus* (Emmons) and a small *Phyllograptus* about three lines in length. The slates and black dolomite of this locality, in which these species occur, are undoubtedly of the same age as the black slates of the upper part of Division N at Table Head.\n\n**Other Fossils.**\n\n*Murchisonia Anna*, *Pleurotomaria Laurentiana*, and *P. calcifera* occur in Division G, at Port au Choix. At Cow Head in Division P, a trilobite was collected, only distinguishable from *Bathyurus conicus* by having the glabella smooth instead of tuberculated. *Asaphus Pelops* (ante, p. 317) also occurs at Cow Head. *Lingula acuminata* occurs in D, at Bay Ste. Barbe.\n\n**Obolus? Murrayi. (N. sp.)**\n\n*Description.*\u2014The specimen is very nearly circular, broad ovate, width a little greater than the length, uniformly and moderately convex; the shell black and corneous and covered with fine concentric striae. Length 7 lines; width about 8 lines.\n\nOf this species only a single valve was found in a loose piece of grey argillaceous limestone by Mr. Murray at Maiden Arm, Hare Bay, on the east side of the northern point of Newfoundland. It belongs probably to the Quebec group.\n\nDedicated to Alex. Murray, Esq., who discovered it.\n\n**Bathyurus solitarius. (N. sp.)**\n\n*Description.*\u2014Pygidium semicircular, length a little less than half the width, uniformly rounded behind, gently convex; the side lobes smooth\nwith a flat border all round and a furrow close to the anterior margin; axis depressed convex, extending three-fourths the whole length, terminating at the edge of the marginal flat border, not elevated at the apex, distinctly defined at the sides by the dorsal furrows, about twelve narrow but well defined rings.\n\nLength 5 lines; width 9 lines; width of marginal border 1 line; width of axis at the anterior margin 2\u00bd lines.\n\nThis species is certainly closely allied to *B. Saffordi* (ante, p. 259), but differs from it in having the border wider and flat instead of convex, and in the axis having twelve instead of nine rings. These differences, although slight, give to the specimen an aspect distinct from that of any variety of *B. Saffordi*.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Found loose at Hare Bay along with *O. Murrayi*.\n\n**Collector.**\u2014Alexander Murray, Esq.\n\n---\n\n**Bathyurus gregarius.** (N. sp.)\n\n![Fig. 349.](image)\n\n**Fig. 349.\u2014Bathyurus gregarius.** Part of head and thorax, drawn from a cast in plaster.\n\n**Description.**\u2014Ovate, from one to two inches in length. Head semi-circular, broadly rounded in front and with an elevated rounded margin. Glabella strongly convex; sides nearly straight, apex rounded, separated from the cheeks by deep dorsal furrows, a deep and wide groove in front of it; length including the neck segment full three-fourths the whole length of the head; neck segment rather large, rounded; neck furrow well defined all across. Cheeks strongly convex. The eye is situated on a line drawn across the head at one-third the length from the front margin, distant from the dorsal furrow rather more than one-half the width of the glabella. It appears to be a little more than one line in length where the length of the head is six lines. Thorax with at least nine segments, the precise number not known; axis narrow, less than one-third the whole\nwidth strongly convex sides straight, gradually tapering backwards; pleurae with a very wide groove. Pygidium and moveable cheeks unknown.\n\nThe cheeks and glabella are very convex; the glabella separated from the cheeks by a deep groove; the margin in front of the glabella is elevated into a strong rounded cord-like rim between which and the apex of the glabella there is a wide and deep groove. These characters shew that it is closely allied to both *B. conicus* and *B. Cordai*. On comparison with these, it is seen that *B. conicus* differs in having the glabella more narrowed forwards and in the form of the space between the apex and marginal rim, that is to say, convex next to the glabella and concave close to the margin. *B. Cordai* has the glabella proportionally more elongated. The eye also in *B. gregarius* seems to be further forwards and more distant from the glabella than it is in the other two.\n\nThe surface characters cannot be made out from the casts.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014In the primordial slates holding *Paradoxides Bennetti* (Salter) at St. Mary's Bay in the south part of Newfoundland.\n\n**Collectors.**\u2014The specimens were procured by Mr. D. R. McKay of Montreal, who furnished me with a cast holding four individuals in a space of three inches square.\n\n---\n\n**Bathyurus perplexus.** (N. sp.)\n\n![Fig. 350.\u2014Pygidium of B. perplexus.](image)\n\n**Description.**\u2014Pygidium semi-elliptical or sub-triangular, strongly convex; anterior margin gently convex, nearly straight; sides gently convex and converging to form a somewhat narrowly rounded apex; axis cylindro-conical, strongly convex, extending the whole length very nearly, rounded and rather abruptly elevated at the apex, with three distinct segments in the anterior half (besides the half-segment at the anterior margin), the posterior half apparently smooth. Side lobes with a narrow smooth border all round, and three depressed convex segments each, separated by narrow grooves. The anterior segment has a pleural groove close to the margin. These three pairs of segments occupy, with their inner extremities, the length of the anterior half of the axis being separated therefrom by the linear dorsal furrows. Behind the third pair there appears to be a fourth alongside of the posterior half of the axis, and con-\nsisting of two obscurely developed triangular or sub-ovate lobes. The specimen, however, is not well preserved in this part. Surface, apparently smooth.\n\nLength of the only specimen collected 8 lines; width at the anterior margin 11 lines; width of the axis at the anterior margin 3 lines.\n\nIt is scarcely possible to separate this species from *B. extans* of the Black River limestone. The axis is more distinctly segmented, and this is the only difference exhibited by the specimen.\n\nIt may be that this is the pygidium of a species of *Olenellus* or *Dikelocephalus*, both of which genera are evidently allied to *Bathyurus*.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014B, east arm of Bonne Bay, Newfoundland; Potsdam group.\n\n**Collector.**\u2014J. Richardson.\n\n*Bathyurus vetulus.* (N. sp.)\n\n**Description.**\u2014Pygidium semi-circular, obtusely rounded behind, length about half the width, rather strongly convex. Axis cylindrical, strongly convex, with three segments (besides the half segment), in the anterior two-thirds, the posterior third, smooth. Side lobes with three broad convex segments (besides the half-segment at the margin), a narrow smooth border all round. Surface apparently with fine tubercles.\n\nThis species differs from the last in its more obtuse form and more convex segments.\n\nLength 6 lines; width at the anterior margin 12 lines.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014B, east arm of Bonne Bay, Newfoundland; Potsdam group.\n\n**Collector.**\u2014J. Richardson.\n\nBesides the species of trilobites above noticed there are fragments of a number of other species probably all new.\n\nIn the Potsdam group, in B and C, *Olenellus Thompsoni* occurs in vast abundance, but no entire specimens were collected. In *C. Conocephalites Teucer*, and *C. Adamsii* (*ante* p. 11), were also found.\n\nIn the following catalogue, there are several species, such as,\u2014*Scolithus linearis*, *Palaeophycus incipiens*, and some others, which were collected on the north shore of the Straits of Belleisle; on the east side, and also in the southern part of Newfoundland, in rocks which have not yet been strictly identified with any of the divisions. Their position is, therefore, not indicated in the columns:\u2014\n| Page | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | K | L | M | N | O | P

group, consisting of Divisions A, B, and C, we have nineteen species, none of which are found in the Potsdam sandstone in Canada. But in that part of the group, which is usually known, in the State of Vermont, under the designations of the Red Sand Rock, and the Georgia slates, the following occur:\u2014Scolithus linearis, Paleoophycus incipiens, Obolus Labradoricus, Obolella (Kutorgina) cingulata, Olenellus Thompsoni, O. Vermontana, Conocephalites Adamsi and C, Teucer. As these are the most abundant species in the formation, both in Vermont and Newfoundland, there can be little doubt, but that the rocks in which they occur, in these two widely separated localities, are of the same age. None of these species have been found in the Potsdam sandstone of Wisconsin, and other parts of the Western States as described by Owen, Hall, Shumard, and Meek. We have, therefore, no palaeontological evidence that the Potsdam of the West is precisely of the same age as that of Newfoundland and Vermont. The general affinities and aspect of the fossils and the physical relations of the rocks, however, prove that there can be no great difference. In the next overlying strata Division D, Lingula acuminata was found at Bay St. Barbes. I have compared the specimens from this locality with those that occur so abundantly in the upper part of the Potsdam, in the Township of Beverley in Canada West, and believe them to be perfectly identical.\n\nCALCIFEROUS FORMATION.\n\nThe Calciferous formation is represented in Newfoundland, by all the Divisions from D to H inclusive. In this series of strata, there are sixty-three species, of which the following fourteen are found in Canada and New York; Stenopora fibrosa, Stromatopora rugosa?, Lingula acuminata, Euchasma Blumenbachia, Pleurotomaria Calphurnia, P. calcifera, P. Laurentina, Murchisonia Anna, Ecculionphalus Atlanticus, Orthoceras Lamarcki, Piloceras Canadensis, Bathyurus Cordai, Asaphus canalis, and Leperditia turgida,\u2014excepting S. fibrosa and B. Cordai, all of these occur in the true Calciferous in Canada. B. Cordai abounds in the same formation in New York. S. rugosa is doubtfully determined, and is probably distinct from the Black River species of that name. The beds in which L. acuminata occurs in Canada, are placed in the top of the Potsdam; but as Pleurotomaria Canadensis, and an orthoceratite, are asso-\nciated with it, perhaps these particular strata should be more properly referred to the base of the Calciferous, and they would then correspond to Division D. Most of the species are found in Divisions G and H, the upper part of the formation in Newfoundland. Two of the species (S. fibrosa and A. canalis) range upwards into the Chazy, the former continuing to the Upper Silurian. The general aspect of the fauna is peculiarly that of the Calciferous, the most striking features being the great numbers of small Maclurea and species of Piloceras, the latter a genus which seems to have culminated in this particular period.\n\nDIVISIONS I, K, L, M.\n\nThese four divisions consist of 235 feet of magnesian limestones at the base, above which we have 844 feet of light bluish grey limestones, making in all a thickness of 1084 feet. Only thirty-seven species of fossils have been collected in this series of beds; and of these, nine species are found in division H below, while ten of them pass upwards into Division N next above. Three of the species (Stromatopora compacta, Orthoceras Allumettense and Asaphus canalis) occur in Canada, the first two in the Chazy and Black River, and the last in the Calciferous and Chazy. The following are closely allied to Black River and Trenton species.\n\n| Species                  | Allied to          | Location |\n|-------------------------|--------------------|----------|\n| Ctenodonta Angela       | C. contracta       | B. R.    |\n| Subulites Daphne        | S. parvulus        | B. R.    |\n| Murchisonia simulatrix   | M. gracilis        | B. R. & Tr. |\n| Cicelia                 | M. perangulata     | B. R.    |\n| sororcula               |                    | B. R.    |\n| Augustina               | M. bellicincta     | Tr.      |\n| Orthoceras h\u00e6sitans     | O. Bigsbyi         | B. R.    |\n\nThe occurrence of great numbers of individuals of these species, in a silicified condition, and weathered out in bold relief, gives to the slabs of limestone an aspect so remarkably like that of the well-known specimens from Pauquette's Rapids, that at first sight one might be well led to say, this is surely the Black River limestone. But on careful comparison of perfect specimens, it is seen that notwithstanding the resemblance, none of the species are strictly identical. All present such differences that after a study of collections from both localities, they can be separated if mixed up together without their labels. Even O. Allumettense, which I have identified, differs by being much larger than any specimens that have been seen in the original localities.\n\nIf the succession were the same here as it is in Canada and New York, we ought to have the Chazy formation represented in these four Divisions.\nBut no one acquainted with the peculiar and strongly featured fauna of that formation could recognize it in this collection. Three of the species are, indeed, Chazy fossils, but then they are not characteristic forms. The typical and leading species which always go together in great numbers and in one compact army, as it were, in every exposure of the true Chazy, are totally absent.\n\nThe Lamellibranchiata, Gasteropoda and Cephalopoda of these beds have, so far as the genera *Ctenodonta*, *Subulites*, *Pleurotomaria*, and *Orthoceras* are concerned, an aspect very like that presented by the same genera in the Black River and Trenton formations. But species similar to most of those above compared have a great range, and are found in all the different groups of rocks up to the Devonian. Their occurrence here is not, in my opinion, sufficient to counterbalance the negative fact that (excepting those in question) not a vestige of any one of the species of the vast fauna of the Black River and Trenton has been detected. *Tetradium fibratum*, *Columnaria alveolata*, *Lept\u00e6na sericea*, *Strophomera alternata*, *Orthis testudinaria*, *Calymene Blumenbachi* and *Asaphus platycephalus* are sure to be found in every collection of any considerable extent from these two formations. If they occurred here as abundantly and persistently as they do in Canada and New York, it would be difficult to give any reason why these four Divisions should not be regarded as the equivalents of the Black River and Trenton. But not one fragment of anything which could by any possibility be referred to any one of these species can be seen in this collection. A piece of red limestone was found at Bay St. Paul which is full of *L. sericea*, but it was a loose and worn fragment, lithologically different from any of the strata in question. Judging from this specimen I should say that the Trenton may possibly occur somewhere near, but we cannot refer, on any pal\u00e6ontological ground, the series of strata constituting Divisions I, K, L, M, to that formation.\n\n**Divisions N, O, P.**\n\nThe rocks of these divisions, in ascending order, consist of 277 feet of black, bituminous limestone, with some black shales, very fossiliferous; next 700 feet of sandstones, in which no fossils were collected or observed; and at the summit 700 feet of black shales, holding grey and white limestone conglomerates, abounding in fossils, although there are not a great many species. There appear to be, in this series of strata, two formations, distinguishable from each other, both by lithological and pal\u00e6ontological characters. The first includes the black, bituminous limestones and shales, forming the upper 277 feet at Table Head, and those of Pistolet Bay, and 4 miles N. E. from Portland Creek. The rocks at the\nlatter locality appear to lie above the 700 feet of sandstone constituting Division O, and are, therefore, in the foregoing descriptions of species, referred to Division P. Taking these three localities to be on the same, or nearly the same, horizon, we have from them, in addition to a few not yet described, the following 48 species:\n\nLingula Nympha\n\u201c Iole\n\u201c Cyane\nAcrotreta gemma\nOrthis delicatula\n\u2022 Strophomena Aurora\n\u201c imbecilis\n\u201c decipiens (?)\nCamerella parva\n\u201c varians *\nRhynchonella Corinthia\nPleurotomaria sponsa\n\u2022 Murchisona simulatrix\n\u2022 \u201c Augustina\n\u2022 Maclurea crenulata\n\u2022 \u201c acuminata\nEcculiomphalus superbus\n\u2022 Orthoceras piscator\n\u2022 \u201c Allumettense\n\u2022 Bathyurus Nero\n\u201c breviceps\nAsaphus Huttoni\n\u201c Morrisii\n\u201c quadraticaudatus\n\nNileus macrops\n\u201c scrutator\n\u2022 Illanus fraternus\n\u2022 \u201c consimilis\nEndymionia Meeki\nHolometopus Angelini *\nHarpides Atlanticus\n\u201c concentricus\nShumardia glacialis\nCheirurus Polydorus\n\u201c perforator\n\u201c Sol\n\n\u2022 Amphion Barrandei *\nTriarthrus Fischeri\nTelephus Americanus\nEncrinurus mirus\nRemopleurides Panderi\n\u201c Schlotheimi\nAmpyx laeviusculus\n\u201c normalis\n\u201c Rutilius\n\u201c semicostatus\n\u2022 Agnostus galba\n\u201c Fabius\n\nIn the above list those with an asterisk before them are found in some one or more of the Divisions below N; those with an asterisk after them occur in the grey and white limestones of Division P, at Cow Head. Camerella varians is a Chazy species. Orthoceras Allumettense is both Chazy and Black River. Holometopus Angelini, Endymionia Meeki, and Cheirurus Sol occur in the Quebec group of Canada East. We find here, for the first time, among American trilobites the peculiar type of Cheirurus, with a spine upon the glabella\u2014C. perforator (ante, p. 287). Another of the same structure, C. glaucus, was discovered in the Quebec group, in the township of Stanbridge; and a third, C. Satyrus, in the Chazy, at Montreal, by T. C. Weston, last year, 1864 (ante, p. 323). This type has been known for several years among the Russian trilobites by Sphaerexochus cephaloceros (Nieskowski) = Zethus triplicatus (Eichwald), which occurs in the Pleta limestone. The genus Triarthrus has not heretofore been found below the Trenton in America. Remopleurides occurs in the Chazy, and Amphion in both Chazy and Calciferous; but\nneither of these genera have yet been reported as occurring above the Chazy in Canada or New York. The general aspect of the trilobitic fauna of this series of strata seems to me to be more like that of the Pleta limestone of Russia, and Angelin's two Swedish groups, B C and C, than it is to that of any of the American Lower Silurian formations heretofore illustrated.\n\nThe second formation, above mentioned, consists of the 700 feet of black shales with grey and white limestone conglomerates, at Cow Head. In no other part of Newfoundland do we meet with the remarkable fauna which characterizes the L\u00e9vis formation. It undoubtedly occurs here in full force. The following list contains the species collected at that locality, and also shows how many of them occur in Canada:\n\n| Species                                      | C. H. | C.

H., and those which occur in Canada East (as well as Cow Head) C. E. The seven species of graptolites, with *Lingula Quebecensis*, occur only in the black slates; all the others in the grey and white limestones. The three species with an asterisk before them are found in the next group of strata below. No one could compare the collections from Cow Head with those of Point L\u00e9vis and Phillipsburgh without some feeling of astonishment, that in localities nearly a thousand miles distant from each other, there should be such a perfect identity, not only in the fossils, but also in the character of the rock. The specimens, if mixed together, without their labels, could never be separated. Only a small collection was made at Cow Head; and there can scarcely be a doubt that further examination will bring to light a greater number of species common to the two countries.\n\nThis fauna, although, upon the whole, specifically distinct from the one next below, consists of the same types of trilobites, with the exception of *Bathyurus Cordai* and *B. conicus*, which are Calciferous species, as is also the brachiopod *Camerella calcifera*. There are two species, *Amphion Sol* and *Endymionia Meeki*, which are found in Division N, in Newfoundland, and not at Cow Head; but they occur in the limestones of Point L\u00e9vis, which are of the same age as those of Cow Head. There are thus five common species, instead of three, as would appear by the above list.\n\nFrom Cow Head, Point L\u00e9vis, St. Antoine, Stanbridge, Bedford, and Phillipsburgh we have in all 219 described species. Of these, the fifty-one species of graptolites described by Prof. Hall, and also *Lingula Quebecensis*, *L. Irene*, *Obolella desiderata* and *Shumardia granulosa* have been found only in the slates and thin-bedded limestones interstratified in the slates. The other 162 species occur in the white and grey conglomerate limestones. That the slates and these peculiar limestones belong to the same group, is proved by their occurring together in widely separated localities; although as yet we are unable to shew that any of the species are common to both. At Cow Head *G. Headi* was found in a loose piece of grey limestone; but it is not quite certain that the specimen belongs to the conglomerates.\n\nThe evidence that the rocks at Cow Head in Newfoundland are of the same age as those of the L\u00e9vis formation in Canada East amounts to this\u20141, they are precisely the same in lithological characters, and\u20142, out of the 34 species collected at Cow Head 23 are perfectly identical with those collected at Point L\u00e9vis, Bedford, Phillipsburgh, and other typical localities of the formation. There is, however, in Newfoundland an important series of strata, consisting of all the Divisions from I to O inclusive, having a thickness of 2061 feet, lying below the L\u00e9vis formation and above\nthe Calciferous, which has not been recognized in Canada. It thus appears that the L\u00e9vis formation not only lies above the Calciferous, but more than 2000 feet above it. Yet it holds a large number of trilobites of the Potsdam type, and several species, such as Lingula Mantelli, Camerella calcifera, Bathyurus Cordai, B. conicus, and Asaphus canalis, which certainly do occur in the Calciferous.\n\nIn the foregoing general catalogue (ante pp. 366\u2013370) there are 62 species placed in Division P. But if we exclude from that Division all the species, except those collected at Cow Head, only those on the list on p. 375 properly belong to it. The others should be placed in Division N.\n\n10.

The cup is about one-third the whole diameter, and extends nearly to the base. The pores or canal-apertures are ovate, about eight in six lines of the length of each vertical row, and two in one line in the transverse rows.\n\nThe specimen above figured has the cup empty, but does not show the structure of the walls, even in a polished section. Another specimen, a fragment three inches in length, shows, in a longitudinal fracture, that the radiating canals curve downwards, in proceeding to the exterior.\n\nThis species probably attained a length of four or five inches, but only two fragments have been found. It differs from C. Fittoni (ante, p. 211)\nin having the pores, in general, one-fourth smaller, and from *C. Anstedi* (ante, pp. 210, 337) in having them larger.\n\nThe above figure, 352, is copied from Roemer, who gives it to illustrate the internal structure of *Astylospongia praemorsa*, a fossil sponge which occurs in the Lower Silurian rocks of northern Europe, and also, according to him, in rocks of the same age in Tennessee.* The structure of the inner wall of the cup is very much the same in both of the species above represented, but still I think they belong to different genera. In our species the walls are as completely reticulated to the depth of six lines, as in the inner surface of the cup itself. This is clearly shown by the fragment above mentioned. There is a great difference also in the general form of the two groups, the species of *Calathium* being elongate-turbinate like the corals *Zaphrentis* and *Cyathophyllum*, while those figured by Dr. Roemer are more nearly globular. The genus *Aulocopium*, also illustrated by Roemer, has some turbinated species, but the figures of the inside of the cup (of which several are given) do not show any perforations: their absence, however, in the figures may be owing to the imperfection of the specimens.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Mingan Islands; Chazy limestone.\n\n**Collectors.**\u2014J.

II, fig. 6.*\nThe structure and zoological position of *Receptaculites* have been more or less elaborately investigated by Goldfuss, Eichwald, Roemer, Salter, Hall, and other eminent observers, and yet, owing to the imperfection of the materials, a great deal remains to be done before the various questions involved in the relations of this curious genus can be regarded as positively settled. Since the publication of Salter's paper in the first Decade of our Geological Survey, numerous specimens of several distinct species have been collected in the Silurian rocks of Canada, and I am, by the study of these, now enabled to furnish a few additional details.\n\nThe principal new points are, the perforated structure of the internal integument, the existence (in most, if not in all, of the species) of a great central cavity and an orifice in the upper side. The flat watch-shaped specimens which are usually figured as constituting the whole of the body, are probably only the basal portion of the body-wall of the discoid species.\n\nThe genus may be described as consisting of organisms, which, when full grown and perfect, are of a discoid, cylindrical, ovate, or globular shape, hollow within, and usually, if not always, with an aperture in the upper side. In or near the centre of the lower side there is generally to be seen a small rounded protuberance, indicating, most probably, the position of the primitive cell or nucleus from which the animal commenced its growth. In some species the lower side is more or less concave, and often the nucleus is not at all elevated above the surface adjacent thereto. Its place, however, in the absence of any other guide, may generally be found by observing the point towards which the spiral lines or rows of plates on the outer surface converge. The body-wall is of a somewhat complex structure. It consists of three parts,\u2014an external and an internal integument, and, between these, the peculiar tubular or spicular skeleton presently to be described. The external integument may be called 'the ectorhin,' and the internal 'the endorhin.'\n\nThe ectorhin is usually composed of numerous small rhomboidal plates closely fitting together, and arranged in curved rows which radiate in all directions from the nucleus outwards to the peripheral margin of the base, and thence, ascending upwards, converge to the edge of the aperture in the upper side. Two or three of those rows of plates (the precise number is not yet determined) originate in the nucleus, and, as they diverge from each other, new rows are introduced between them. The rows diminish, in number, again on the upper side according as they converge towards the apex of the fossil. The plates at and immediately around the nucleus, and also towards the centre of the upper side, are somewhat smaller than they are at the widest part or middle region of the body. It seems probable that, in some of the species, this integument was of a flexible, coriaceous consistence. In others the plates were solid. In R.\noccidentalis (Salter), when silicified specimens are treated with acid the plates are easily separable, and, therefore, although in close contact, they were not ankylosed together.\n\nThe endorhin is also composed of small rhomboidal plates arranged in curving rows; but it differs from the ectorhin in being perforated by numerous small circular orifices, one of which is situated at each point where the angles of four plates meet. From the centre of each of the plates of this integument there radiate four small canals, one proceeding straight to the middle of each of the sides of the plate, where it communicates with a similar canal in the adjoining plates. Each one of these plates is, therefore, connected by these canals with the four plates in contact with it. The canals are excavated in the substance of the plates, and communicate with the central canal of the transverse tubes. The canals are not always perfectly circular, but are often flattened or irregularly circular. The endorhin varies greatly in the extent to which it is developed. In some specimens the plates are well-defined and rhomboidal, with perfectly circular pores at the angles. In others the plates are not at all defined, the ectorhin being one continuous integument without sutures, but always with the full complement of pores. The latter in such specimens are not all circular, but are variously shaped orifices sometimes with rough edges. There are also specimens in which the endorhin consists of only a thin film, capping, as it were, the tubes and inclosing the canals, the pores being proportionally larger than they are in those with well-developed plates. The end of each tube, in these specimens, forms an irregular, rounded tubercle instead of a rhomboidal plate.\n\nThe tubular skeleton above alluded to consists of numerous small, straight, rarely curved, cylindrical tubes or hollow spicula, placed parallel to each other and at right angles to the planes of the body-wall of which they form the greater portion. They connect, and at the same time keep asunder, the ectorhin and the endorhin. One of these tubes springs from the centre of each plate of the ectorhin: it is, at its base, or next to the ectorhin, very slender, but enlarges so as to attain its full thickness at about one-fourth of its length, and then remains at the same diameter throughout until it reaches the endorhin, by a single plate of which its inner extremity is, as it were, capped. The outer extremity of each tube has four small slender stolons, one proceeding to each of the four angles of that particular plate of the ectorhin from the centre of which it (the tube) springs. It there seems to form a connection with the stolons of the three adjacent plates whose angles meet at that point. The stolons are so arranged that one of them always points inwards towards the nucleus, and another on the opposite side of the tube outwards or upwards.\nIt is proposed to call these the radial stolons; they form continuous lines radiating in all directions away from the nucleus. The other two stolons of each tube project at right angles to the direction of the radial stolons; they form circles round the nucleus, and may therefore be called the cyclical stolons. The connection of all these different parts may be better understood by studying the following figures.\n\nFig. 354.\u2014A small portion of *R. occidentalis* showing the tubes.\n\nFig. 355.\u2014A part of the lower side of the same species showing the nucleus and ectorhin.\n\nFig. 356.\u2014A fragment of the same, showing the endorhin, the pores at the angles of the plates, and the nucleus, which, on this side, is usually deeply concave.\n\nAt the lower side of fig. 354, is shown the ectorhin and the apertures in the hollow stolons, broken off in the specimen. The apertures are slightly enlarged in the figure. In fig. 355, the usual aspect of the central portion of the lower side of this species is given. It will be seen that the greater number of the plates are not truly rhomboidal, but approach the form of a spherical triangle with two of the sides concave. This form of the plates frequently occurs. The convex side of such plates is always outwards towards the periphery of the fossil, and the acute angle formed by the two concave sides always directed towards the nucleus. This shows that the consolidation of the plates commenced at the nucleus and gradually extended outwards. In many specimens the plates are all perfectly rhomboidal, and in such they may have solidified simultaneously all over the body. One corner of the specimen at \u03b1 is represented as denuded of the ectorhin, showing the various markings beneath, which will be here-\nafter explained by other figures. By fig. 356 is represented the ordinary appearance of the endorhin of silicified specimens when cleared of the limestone matrix by treatment with acid. Although the pores have been seen in this species only, yet it seems quite probable that they occur in all others of the genus.\n\nIn the diagram fig. 357 the tubes are placed proportionately much farther apart than they are in any known species, in order to exhibit the structure with the greater clearness. The endorhin is drawn as if it were transparent to show the position of the tubes beneath it. The dotted lines give the outlines of the upper portions of the tubes, and also define the course of the endorhinal canals,\u2014four radiating from the top of each tube. The endorhinal pores\u2014one situated at each of the points where the angles of four plates meet\u2014penetrate through the endorhin into the space between the tubes, and not into the tubes themselves, as might be supposed from a superficial examination. In the ectorhin the rough lines $k$ represent the sutures between the plates; and it will be observed that they have the same direction as the endorhinal sutures in the upper part of the figure. The stolons have not the same direction as the endorhinal\n\n![Diagram](image)\n\nFig. 357.\u2014Diagram to explain the structure of the body-wall of *Receptaculites*; $b$, the endorhin; $c$, the ectorhin; $d$, suture between the plates of the endorhin; $e$, endorhinal pore; $f$, endorhinal canal; $g$, radial stolon; $h$, cyclical stolon; $k$, suture between the plates of the ectorhin.\n\ncanals, but are, as it were, turned one-eighth round, so that the two directions are inclined to each other at an angle of 45\u00b0. The stolons run along the inner surface of the ectorhin, but the endorhinal canals are excavated in the substance of the endorhin. The space between the tubes is almost\nalways filled with the rock of the same kind as that in which the fossil is imbedded. In perfect specimens, the rock, while it was still in the condition of soft mud, must have found its way through the aperture in the upper side into the great central cavity, and thence through the endorhinal pores into the spaces between the tubes. In general the upper side or vault, as it may be called, over the central cavity is not preserved, and the specimens then consist of the whole or a portion of the base with the nucleus, as in fig. 355. These are also filled with matrix; the soft ooze having entered not only through the pores, but also through the broken margin. It is probable that the animal lived with its base partly buried, a portion of the vault with the aperture projecting above the surface of the mud. During the life the central cavity was perhaps kept free from sediment by currents of water which the animal had the power of exciting. But as soon as the currents ceased (with vitality), the mud would enter freely. The vault would also soon fall to pieces, and the fragments of all those individuals of which it (the vault) projected above the surface of the sediment would be soon scattered, while the partly buried base would be preserved.\n\nThe specimen represented by fig. 358 is a fragment of the ectorhin of *R. calciferus*, from the Calciferous formation, Mingan Islands. It shows only the inner surface on which the stolons are still preserved, but the tubes are worn nearly to their bases. It is rare to find specimens in that condition; and this one was not suspected to be a *Receptaculites* for several years after its discovery, until a large portion of the base of an individual of *R. occidentalis* was found, which, by having been slowly weathered down from the upper side, retains the tubes over an area of several square inches, while a considerable space around the nucleus is covered with the squares formed by the stolons, precisely as in this example. Fig. 359 is a cast of the inner surface of the ectorhin of *R. Oweni* (Hall), from the Lower Silurian rocks of Illinois. The integument itself is totally removed. The vertical lines are the impressions of the radial stolons, while the more irregular and slightly curved transverse lines are the imprints of the cyclical stolons. The dark points are the apertures of the cylindrical perforations in the rock once occupied by the tubes now entirely removed. On following any one of the lines, it will be seen that there is, between every two of the orifices, a point where two of the lines cross without an orifice at their intersection. Each one of these marks the point where the angles of four plates met. Four stolons also met at each of these points. This will be readily understood by comparing fig. 357. In specimens in this state of preservation we see no traces of the sutures between the plates, as the whole substance of the ectorhin\u2014plates, sutures, and all\u2014is destroyed.\nFig. 358.\u2014Fragment of *R. calciferus*, showing the inner surface of the ectorhin with the stolons remaining, but all other parts worn away.\n\nFig. 359.\u2014A cast of *R. Oweni*, showing the impression of the inner surface of the ectorhin.\n\nFig. 360.\u2014*Tetragonis Murchisonii* (Eichwald) reduced.\n\nFig. 361.\u2014A portion of 360, natural size.\n\nFig. 360 is a reduced outline of *Tetragonis Murchisonii*, from Eichwald\u2019s \u2018Urwelt Russlands,\u2019 pl. iii. fig. 18. It does not show all the lines given in the original figure, as they could not well be represented on so small a scale. Fig. 361 is the upper part of the same figure, of the size of the original. The vertical lines are the impressions of the radial stolons, and the finer transverse lines the grooves of the cyclical stolons. By comparing fig. 359, it will be seen that the grooves in both figures have precisely the same arrangement; that is to say, the dark points, representing the openings of the cylindrical cavities, once occupied by the tubes, occur at each alternate crossing of the grooves. It would appear, therefore, that Eichwald\u2019s genus *Tetragonis* was founded on a species of *Receptaculites*, with the ectorhin removed. The genus *Ischadites* also exhibits very similar markings, as may be seen by comparing the figures of *I. K\u00f6nigii* (Murch.), on pl. 12, \u2018Siluria,\u2019 and the following of *R. Canadensis*.\n\nThe specimen represented by fig. 362 has been figured by me in the Geology of Canada, p. 309, under the name of *Ischadites Canadensis*. It is the cast of the inner surface of the ectorhin, and differs remarkably\nfrom the similar specimen of *R. Oweni* (ante, fig. 359). It is deeply pitted all over with sub-quadrangular or rhomboidal depressions, the form of each cavity being such as would be made by the impression of a small four-sided pyramid. In the bottom of each is a small rounded orifice, from which radiate three grooves to three of the angles of the square.\n\nFig. 362.\u2014*R. Canadensis* (Billings), a cast of the inner surface of the ectorhin.\n\nFig. 363.\u2014*R. Jonesi*, a polished section through a nearly perfect specimen, showing the central cavity and the aperture at the top.\n\nFig. 364.\u2014*R. Iowensis* (Owen), a weathered section through a specimen, showing the aperture and the central cavity imperfectly.\n\nThese, I have not the least doubt, are the grooves of three of the stolons. The absence of the fourth stolon may be accounted for in this way. Among the detached silicified tubes of *R. occidentalis* which are found in the sediment left at the bottom of the vessel, after dissolving specimens of limestone holding these fossils in acid, numerous specimens have been collected with only three stolons in contact with the plate or at the end of the tube, but with the fourth a small distance from the end. It is evident that in casts of the inner surface of the ectorhin of specimens with all the tubes thus constructed, there would be only the three grooves of the terminal stolons visible on the surface, the fourth being buried beneath the surface. I have also ascertained that this fourth stolon is in *R. occidentalis*, one of the radials, and always when it can be seen *in situ*, the one pointing outwards away from the nucleus.\n\nFig. 363 is a vertical section of *R. Jonesi*, a small species which occurs in the upper part of the Lower Helderberg rocks of Gasp\u00e9. The shaded bell-shaped area is the central cavity. It is distinctly observed in several others of the same species. It will be seen that the body-wall in the vault above and on the sides of the cavity is thicker than it is in the base, but\nthe tubes are much more slender. They here assume the form of the elongated connecting spicula of the true sponges. Fig. 364 is a similar section, through a specimen of *R. Iowensis* from the Trenton limestone at Ottawa. At *a*, the central cavity is distinctly shown, filled with the grey limestone matrix, which has also found its way between the tubes in the base of the fossil. The shaded portions *bb* are replaced by a reddish magnesian spar. The under side of the specimen is deeply concave, and the peripheral margin is so convex as to resemble a cylinder coiled into a ring. The aperture in one specimen of *R. Jonesi* is rounded, and resembles the umbilicus of an apple.\n\nThe figures given by different authors of foreign species show a considerable range of variation in the general form, and apparently also in the structure of the body-wall. The details given in this paper have been made out principally by the study of numerous specimens of *R. occidentalis*, which is undoubtedly congeneric with *R. Neptuni*, the typical form of the genus. In others, such as *Tetragonis sulcata* and *T. parvipora* (Eichwald), there appears to be a transition to species in which the ectorhin was a soft coriaceous integument, not distinctly plated, although connected with the interior by tubes or spicula. The genus *Tetragonis*, instead of becoming obsolete, might be retained for some of the species which have a structure different from that of *R. Neptuni*.\n\nAs to the zoological rank of *Receptaculites* there yet remains much diversity of opinion. At the present time the most ably supported view is that which places the genus in the Foraminifera near *Orbitolites*. Seen in this light, the diagram at the head of this paper would represent the soft and not the hard parts of the animal. If this be the true interpretation, then we must suppose that outside of the ectorhin there was a layer of shell, and another layer covering the endorhin, or lining the great central cavity. All the space between the tubes was also a compact mass of shelly substance similar to that of the Foraminifera. But not a vestige of any such shell has ever been discovered. The space between the tubes is invariably filled with the same kind of rock as that in which the specimens are imbedded, while all that is, in this paper, described as constituting the skeleton is in the same mineral condition as are the hard parts of the corals, crinoids and molluscs found buried in the same beds. In the ordinary limestone, whenever the solid portions of the other fossils are replaced either by calcareous spar or silica, or partly by one and partly by the other, the skeleton of *Receptaculites* is always found converted into the same mineral substances. And again in the magnesian limestones, where the hard parts of fossils are, in general, totally removed, so that the cavities once occupied by them remain empty, we find *Receptaculites* in the same condition. We have not the tubes themselves, but only the\ncylindrical perforations in the rock which they at one time filled, while\nthe existence of the stolons is only indicated by grooves such as those\nrepresented in figs. 359, 362. These facts seem to prove clearly that\nthe space between the tubes was not filled with shell substance, but either\nempty, or entirely, or partly full of soft matter, which was immediately\ndissipated after the death of the animal, and its place occupied by the\nsoft mud in or on which the creature lived. Were it otherwise, we would\nnow find the space in question a compact mass of calcareous spar or amor-\nphous silex, while the tubes (or cells as they would be in that case) might\nbe filled with limestone. In the magnesian specimens the ectorhin seldom,\nif ever, remains; and in species with flat plates the form (of the plates)\ncan rarely be made out, the only markings on the surface being the\ngrooves of the stolons. But where the plates were deeply concave the\nposition of the sutures is indicated by more or less strongly elevated ridges\nenclosing rhomboidal depressed spaces with a tube cavity in the centre.\nFig. 362 represents a fragment of *R. Canadensis* in that state of pre-\nservation. The rhomboids in this case are not the plates themselves, but\nonly their impressions. In describing such specimens, the tubes are\nsometimes spoken of as having rhomboidal openings, but this is an error;\nthe tubes when perfect, as can be proved by hundreds of specimens, are\nnot open at all, but completely closed, at one end by the ectorhin and at\nthe other by the endorhin. They all, however, communicate with each\nother through the stolons and endorhinal canals.\n\nWere the tubes of *Receptaculites* to be closely crowded together so that\ntheir walls would everywhere be in contact, and no space between them,\nthen the structure would be similar to that of *Orbitolites*, but with the\nsystem of connecting stolons arranged on a different plan. The genus\nwould then also closely resemble *Dactylopora*; but I do not yet see that\nthe evidence is sufficient to prove clearly that the tubes are strictly the\nhomologues of the cells of any group of the Foraminifera. They appear\nto me to be more nearly related to the connecting spicula of the Spongidae.\nEach tube with its cylindrical shaft, and plate at each extremity, resembles\nnot remotely a birotulate spiculum. Or it might perhaps with more pro-\nbability be described as consisting of two spicula united at their points.\nThus the ectorhinal plate with the four stolons may be a peculiar form of\nthe foliato-peltate spicula, of which many different kinds are figured by\nBowerbank. The cylindrical shaft may be a spiculum approaching the\nacuate or acerate varieties with its point inserted into the nucleus of the\nfoliato-peltate spiculum. Most sponge spicula are hollow; and we know\nhow often it happens in the structure of the animal kingdom that organs\nmay at one time subserve one function, and elsewhere a very different\nfunction. The cylindrical cavity, which in the spicula of the ordinary\nsponges seems to be functionless, may in *Receptaculites* be transformed into a canal for the transmission of fluids. But although the cavities of all the tubes in *Receptaculites* communicate with each other through the endorhinal canals, and perhaps through the stolons also, they may not constitute a canal-system. The so-called tubes are extremely slender, and may be solid in some species.\n\nOn comparison it will be found that the general form of *Receptaculites* and structure of its body-wall are almost precisely that of the seed-like body that plays so important a part in the development of *Spongilla*. This consists of a small ovate or spherical sac with an aperture on one side leading into the cavity within. The enclosing wall consists of a coriaceous membrane on the outside of which there are arranged, perpendicularly to the surface, numerous small birotulate spicula, exactly as the tubes of *Receptaculites* are arranged on the endorhin. The outer extremities of these spicula give off at right angles a number of small spines corresponding to the stolons above figured. These spines coalesce, and (if I understand the figures rightly) become connected together, so that they form by their union a plate similar to that of *Receptaculites*, only that it is hexagonal. The plates of all the spicula enlarge until all come into contact, and thus an outer tesselated integument corresponding to the ectorhin is formed. In this stage a section through the seed-like body shows an inner integument (or endorhin), and an outer plated integument (or ectorhin), the two being separated and at the same time connected by the pillar-like cylindrical shafts of the spicula representing the tubes of *Receptaculites*. The space between the tubes is, according to some authors, filled with a gelatinous silicious matter; but Bowerbank says he did not detect this substance in the specimens examined by him. This little sac or cell is a *Receptaculites* in miniature, and it is also one of the embryonic stages of a sponge. When we consider that the full grown and adult individuals of many of the long extinct tribes of animals never attained in their structure a more advanced organization than that exhibited by the embryos of orders living at the present day, it does not seem surprising that we should find in the palaeozoic rocks a sponge which although often of large size, never became more highly developed, than is the recent genus *Spongilla*, when it has only advanced to the sac-like stage above described. It is not intended to assert here positively that *Receptaculites* is a sponge, or to determine the question of its zoological rank one way or the other, but only to direct attention to such peculiarities in its structure as appear to me worthy of being taken into account in the investigation.\nReceptaculites Jonesi. (N. sp.)\n\nFig. 365.\u2014Receptaculites Jonesi. \\(a\\), side view; \\(b\\), view of the base. Owing to the peculiar condition of preservation, the grooves of the stolons are imperfectly seen in this specimen. They are well shown in the fragments of other individuals collected in the same bed with the one here figured.\n\nDescription.\u2014The specimens of this species that have been as yet collected are small, turbinate, or depressed conical bodies, from one to two inches across, and from six lines to one inch in height. The broadest extremity, supposed to be the base, is usually circular, sometimes ovate, gently concave, and with an obtusely rounded margin all round, the thickness of which is from three to five lines. The smaller extremity, or the upper side, is a depressed cone, with an apical angle of 110\u00b0 to 130\u00b0, with an irregularly rounded truncated apex. The grooves of the radial stolons, as shown in the cast of the interior of the ectorhin, radiate straight outwards to the margin, and run upwards over the rounded edge. There are here (on the peripheral edge) four or five grooves in a width of three lines. The grooves of the cyclical stolons are closer together, there being about nine in the width of three lines. From the margin to the apex both systems of grooves become more crowded together, and, at the apex, the ectorhin appears to have been of a somewhat pliable, coriaceous integument. At the apex there are indications, in all the specimens which have this part preserved, of a small irregularly rounded aperture, which is usually depressed, in form, somewhat like the umbilicus of an apple.\n\nSeveral specimens have been collected which show the internal cavity.

From the Middle Silurian, Anticosti.\n\nFig. 367. \u2014P. globosus, Trenton limestone, Ottawa.\n\nThe fossils of this genus are of an ovate or globular form covered with an integument of small polygonal plates (?) and with one or more circular apertures. Two species are at present known to occur in the Silurian rocks of Canada, both of which are above figured.\n\nP. Halli is of an ovate form, from one to two inches in length and about one-fourth less, in width. At one end there is a narrow prolongation which, most probably, constituted the pedicle by which the body was attached to the bottom. No trace of any other point of attachment can be seen; and it is almost certain, therefore, that this smaller extremity is the base. A little below the mid-height of the body there is a small circular elevation which appears to mark the place of an orifice; but as the integument is not preserved in this part, it cannot, at present, be positively determined whether there was an aperture here or not. All that can be said is that there appears to have been an orifice where this elevation occurs. The specimens collected are all casts of the interior, but of the one figured a portion of the integument remains attached to the matrix. It is about one-third of a line in thickness, of a translucent, horny color, the surface covered with minute corrugated wrinkles just visible to the naked eye. No sutures can be distinguished, and the form of the plates can only be made out as so many obscure convexities on the\noutside. But where the integument is removed the cast shows the place of the sutures most distinctly, and that the plates were deeply concave on the inside. The polygonal spaces, in the above figure, represent only the outlines of the casts of the inner surfaces of the plates, and, as those are deeply concave, of course the whole surface of the cast of the fossil is covered with small convex elevations. In some places these are so exceedingly convex that they present the appearance of a mass of small globular cells just so much pressed together as to produce the hexagonal outline along the boundary of contact. Many of these elevations have a small round knob in the centre with an obscure ridge radiating to the middle of each of the sides, where they meet similar ridges from the other convexities. These markings are very obscurely developed, and in some places cannot be seen at all.\n\n*P. globosus* only differs from *P. Halli* in being larger and of a spherical shape. The specimens are sometimes three inches across, but the common size is about two inches. They are, usually, more or less compressed and distorted, in general of a hemispherical shape, the base flattened as if the body had been a soft globular sac of matter which had settled down by its own weight. They are, however, occasionally found of a nearly spherical form. On one side (the flattened side) of a specimen in the cabinet of Dr. J. A. Grant, of Ottawa, there is a small elevation which may have been the point of attachment. No orifices have yet been made out, but it must be observed that no specimen has been collected in which the whole of the surface can be examined. None that I have seen have a vestige of the integument remaining. The plates (or rather their impressions) are, in these specimens, for the greater part, strongly convex and precisely like those of *P. Halli*, only larger. In some they are partly concave and partly convex or flat. Individuals also occur which have them either convex, all flat, or all concave. Yet as these occur together in the same localities, I think them all one species. They have, as yet, been found only at the city of Ottawa in the Trenton limestone.\n\nIn one piece of shale scarcely a yard square, I collected about fifty individuals, but although they occur thus abundantly in certain spots, good specimens are exceedingly rare.\n\nThis genus was first described by me in the Report of the Geological Survey of Canada for 1857, p. 342, and placed among the fossils of uncertain class. The two species above figured are also there described. They have been on exhibition in the cases of our museum for the last ten years, and have been examined by a great many of the naturalists of all countries. But I do not think we yet know to what class they belong. *P. Halli* and *Ischadites Canadensis* are figured on p. 309 of the Geology\nof Canada, as members of the *Tunicata*. The latter, however, is a true *Receptaculites*. It is barely possible that the former may be a tunicate, but we have no positive evidence that it is.\n\nEichwald, in his *Lethaea Rossica*, has described and figured two species, *Cyclocrinus Spaskii* and *C. exilis*, which appear to me to be either congeneric with our two, or, at least, to belong to the same family. Both of Eichwald's species are small globular bodies covered with hexagonal or pentagonal plates. The plates of *C. Spaskii* have a tubercle in the centre and a number of obscure rounded ridges radiating to the sides. He says there is a small oral orifice on one side, and on the side opposite, a rudimentary pedicle. One of his figured specimens is covered with a tubular incrustation consisting of small cells which he considers to be a part of the integument itself. It may be, however, a coral. A fragment of one of the specimens of *P. Halli* from Anticosti is incrusted in precisely the same manner with what I take to be a species of *Stenopora*. Eichwald places his genus among the Cystidea; but the more general characters, such as a jointed crinoidal column, the arms or pinnulae, and the peculiar orifices which characterise all true Cystideans, are not forthcoming. It is barely possible that his view may be the correct one.\n\nThe fossil called *Spheronites tesselatus* (Phillips), from the English Devonian rocks has the surface covered with hexagonal plates, and resembles, in general aspect, a species of *Pasceolus*. Mr. Pengelly has figured a specimen in the Geologist, vol iv, which shows the interior, covered with a net-work of vertical and horizontal ribs, giving the appearance of the inner surface of the specimen of *Receptaculites calciferus* above noticed. He proposes a new generic name, *Sphaerospongia*, for it. If the specimen figured by him be truly of the same species as that described by Phillips, it would seem that an internal structure like that of *Receptaculites* is not inconsistent with an integument of hexagonal instead of quadrilateral plates. I do not see, however, how the net-work figured by Mr. Pengelly can be made to fit hexagonal plates in the way that the squares formed by the stolons of *Receptaculites* are adjusted.\n\nM. M. Edwards and Haime have referred Eichwald's genus *Cyclocrinus* to the Zoantharia. Whether they are right or not with regard to the Russian species, I can most confidently assert that *Pasceolus* is not a coral. It may be allied to *Receptaculites*, but its true zoological position is quite undecided at present.\nECHINODERMATA.\n\nPetraster bellulus.

Outside of these there is a row of marginal plates, which appear to extend to the extremities of the rays, but on this point there is doubt, as the specimen is not perfect.

The anterior angles are narrowly rounded. The upper side in one specimen has an obscure lobe along the middle, and is covered with fine striae parallel to the anterior margin. Just in front of the apex, on the under side, there is a thin plate, as shown in fig. a.\n\n**Locality and Formation.**\u2014Pauquette Rapids, on the River Ottawa; Black River limestone.\n\n**Collector.**\u2014E.

It does not seem improbable, judging from the fact that all the three varieties of limestone occur in close proximity to each other, that these species may yet be found more or less intermingled in the same beds, but for the present it is best to keep them separate. I shall designate the rocks simply as limestones Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4.\"\n\nThe genera collected in each are as follows:\n\nThe species were collected by Sir W. E. Logan, the late John Head, Esq., Dr. T. S. Hunt, Prof. R. Bell, and J. Richardson.

Both magnified.\n\nNote.\u2014All the figures in this article are of the natural size, unless otherwise specified.\nDescription.\u2014Head oblong semi-oval, rather strongly convex, most elevated at the posterior one-fourth of the length, thence descending with a depressed convex slope in all directions to the sides and front; margin with a very narrow projecting border. The glabella is elongate oval; width, one-third that of the whole head; length, rather more than two-thirds the length of the head. It has two transverse furrows which completely or partially divide it into three segments. The anterior furrow extends all across at one-third, or a little more, of the length from the front. The posterior furrow is interrupted in the middle and is only distinctly seen on each side, penetrating one-third the width, while its position is a little in advance of the posterior third of the length of the glabella. The space between the two inner extremities of the posterior furrows is occupied by a low conical tubercle, with the apex directed backwards. At each side of the glabella at the posterior extremity there is a small triangular lobe. The glabella is defined all round by a very narrow groove, just distinctly visible to the naked eye, and from the apex a similar groove runs straight to the middle of the front margin. The surface is ornamented by from fifteen to twenty irregular, slightly impressed, radiating rugose striae.\n\nIn the pygidium the posterior segment of the median lobe is equal to the two anterior in size; and there are no triangular lobes at the anterior margin. The tubercle is well developed, and its backward sloping apex reaches nearly to the posterior furrow. It seems to divide the two anterior segments, so that each has a sub-quadrate lobe on each side. The surface is striated like the head. Two heads and one tail have been found.\n\nLength of the tail three lines and one-fourth; of the largest head, three lines, and of the other, two lines and three-fourths. The width is about equal to, or a little less than the length.\n\nThe contour appears to be not a regular semi-oval; the sides and terminal margins being only gently convex, and the angles broadly rounded.\n\nThe structure of the tail is similar to that both of *A. tardus* (Barrande) and *A. glabratus* (Angelin); but in these species the median lobe of the head is smooth, and consists of one plate only, without furrows.\n\nIt may be that the tail above figured belongs to a different species, but even if that should be the case, it is specifically distinct from *A. tardus* and *A. glabratus*, for these are both smooth, while ours is striated like *A. exsculptus* (Angelin), and besides the proportions of the parts are sufficiently different to be of specific value, especially when the character of the surface is taken into account. *A. tardus* and *A. glabratus* both belong to the upper part of the Lower Silurian. *A. exsculptus* to Angelin\u2019s Region B, which is the upper division of the Primordial Zone in Sweden,\n\nIn Limestone, No. 1.\nAgnostus Orion.

A fissure from the apex of the glabella to the anterior margin. Length two lines.\n\nThis species only differs from *Apisiformis* as figured by Salter in the 3rd Edition of Siluria by having the glabella proportionally shorter.\n\nLimestone, No. 1. In No. 2 there are two specimens of an *Agnostus* which resemble this species, but more are required to decide whether they are identical or not.\n\nAgnostus Canadensis. (N. sp.)\n\nFig. 374, a, b.\n\nDescription.\u2014Head, obtusely oblong, semi-oval; width, a little greater than the length; a concave border nearly as wide as the glabella all round. Glabella in width, less than half the width of the head, and in length a little more than two-thirds the length of the head: a triangular tubercle on each side of the neck, and a transverse furrow a little in advance of the mid-length; the tubercle is obscure, and appears to be indicated by the small indentation forward in the middle of the transverse furrow.\n\nThe specimen represented by Fig. 374 a, is provided with a tubercle, but I cannot see in which direction the apex is directed, and consequently am unable to say whether it is a head or a tail. It has the broad margin of Fig. 374 b, and I think therefore it belongs to the same species. The segment next the thoracic extremity is a little less than one-third the whole length, and about one-third the whole width. The posterior segment is large and convex, extending quite to the concave border, where it is full one-half wider than it is at the suture between it and the smaller segment. The tubercle is situated in the transverse suture, and makes a small indentation in the edge of the larger segment.\n\nLength of the specimens, about two lines.\n\nLimestone, No. 1.\nConocephalites Zenkeri. (N. sp.)\n\nFig. 375.\n\nFig. 375.\u2014Conocephalites Zenkeri.\n\nDescription.\u2014Length apparently about two inches. Head very convex nearly semi-circular, with a strongly elevated thin sharp margin all round the front and sides, and just within this a wide deep uniformly concave furrow, the width of which is equal to about one third the length of the glabella. The posterior margin is strengthened by the neck segment which extends the whole width of the head, and becomes much elevated on approaching the outer angles. Glabella conical, very convex, most elevated at about the mid-length, with a well defined neck furrow, the posterior lateral furrows directed obliquely forwards at an angle of 45\u00b0 with the longitudinal axis of the body, their inner extremities separated from each other by full one third the width of the glabella; the posterior lobes sub-triangular, their anterior angles situated at nearly one third the length of the glabella forward excluding the neck furrow and segment; the middle lateral furrows represented by a small depression or indentation on each side situated on a line drawn across the head passing through posterior half of the eyes; in front of these a much smaller indentation on each side representing the anterior furrows. The eyes are small and conical, situated on a line crossing the glabella at one half the whole length of the head, their distance from the glabella equal to one-third the width of the neck segment; ocular ridge extending from the eye forward to a point situated a little in advance of the anterior lateral indentation or furrow of the glabella. From the eye a strong ridge runs outwards to the margin of the head in two of the specimens, but in another it is not seen. Between the eye and the posterior margin, and situated near the posterior lobe, on each side is a large sub-semicircular tubercle. This elevation is very slight in the small specimens. The surface of the glabella and cheeks adjacent thereto are apparently smooth, but the whole of the concave border around the head is ornamented with fine rugose stri\u00e6 distinctly visible to the naked eye.\n\nLength of head in largest specimen seen eight lines; length of glabella six lines; width of head fifteen lines; width of glabella four lines; distance between the eyes six lines.\nThorax and pygidium unknown. I have not ascertained whether the posterior angles of the head are rounded or produced into spines.\n\nLimestone No. 1.\n\nGenus Dikeocephalus. Owen.\n\nIn the species which I have referred to this genus, the general form and aspect of the glabella and pygidium and the course of the facial suture are the same as in *D. Minnesotensis* the type of the genus, specimens of which I have before me from the sandstone of the Western States. From numerous fragments of *D. Oweni* exhibiting the underside of the head, I have ascertained that the facial suture does not separate the cheeks from each other by cutting the fold of the margin. The head is therefore composed of three pieces only,\u2014the glabella, hypostoma and united cheeks. This separates the genus from *Proetus*, some species of which, such as *P. striatus* (Barrande) have an expanded front margin and a spinose pygidium very like those of *D. magnificus*. The head of *Proetus* consists of five pieces. The hypostoma found associated with our specimens is much like that of *Proetus*, and it is also not unlike that of *Ogygia*. According to the figure given in *Siluria*, plate III, fig. 2, representing the sub-marginal fold of the cephalic shield, and the hypostoma attached thereto of *Ogygia Buchii*, the structure of the head of *Ogygia* must be the same as that of *Dikeocephalus*. The affinities of the two genera are still further indicated by the form of the glabella.\n\nDikeocephalus magnificus.\n\nDescription.\u2014Eight or nine inches in length. Head large with a short broad obtusely conical depressed convex glabella, in front of which there is a broad flat margin with from five to eight obscure radiating ridges. The neck furrow is represented by an obscure shallow groove which is visible in the middle two-thirds of the width, but dies out before reaching the sides of the glabella. In front of this there are from one to three shallow pits or faint depressions on each side of the median line representing the glabella furrows. A line drawn across the head at one-third the length from the posterior margin would pass through the centres of the eyes nearly. The eyes are annular about one-sixth the whole length of the head, situated their own length from the posterior margin and with their centres about the same distance from the side of the glabella. The facial suture runs from the inner anterior corner of the eye forwards and outwards at an angle of about $45^\\circ$ to the longitudinal axis of the body.\nuntil it crosses a line drawn through the eye parallel with the axis of the body, and having gained a point situated outside of this line at a distance from it equal to the length of the eye or thereabout, it curves inward and reaches the front margin at a point somewhere near the line. It then appears to run round the margin. Behind the eye its course is, after a short inward and backward curve, directly outwards nearly parallel with the posterior furrow apparently one half the width of the cheek when it curves back, and cuts the posterior margin before reaching the angle. On each side of the glabella nearly opposite but a little behind the position of the eye there is an obscure rounded elongated prominence.\n\nJudging from several detached cheeks the posterior part of the head must be very wide and the angles produced into moderately long triangular spines.\n\nThe pygidium is somewhat fan-shaped, the posterior margin terminating\nin six triangular points or spines, the outer ones of which are the longest and the inner ones diminishing in length so as to produce a semicircular emargination for the posterior outline. The greatest width of the pygidium is at about one-third its total length from the front measuring to the extremity of the longest spine. In front of a line drawn across at this place the contour is nearly semicircular, but behind the line the sides are straight or only gently convex, and somewhat parallel, slightly converging towards each other. The main body of the axis is about one-fourth the total length, convex conical and with four shallow concave transverse grooves; four ribs in each of the side lobes besides a rudimentary ridge along the middle being a continuation of the axis. The surface is marked by fine fissure-like undulating lines.\n\nThe pleurae which seem to belong to this species are broad, flat, falcate, and with a moderately strong groove running obliquely nearly their whole length.\n\nJudging from the form of the three pygidia figured by Angelin on Plate 41 of the Palaeontologia Scandinavica, it appears probable that this species connects *Dikelocephalus* with *Centropleura*, a genus which occurs in the base of the Lower Silurian of Sweden, in Regio B and C of Angelin. It is perhaps an extreme form, but the course of the facial suture and characters of the glabella are the same as they are in *Dikelocephalus*. The pygidium differs from *D. Minnesotensis* in having fewer ribs and a greater number of spines, but this difference is not of itself, I think, of generic value.\n\nLimestone No. 1.\n\n**Dikelocephalus planifrons.** (N. sp.)\n\n*Fig. 377.*\n\n**Description.**\u2014Head with a broad smooth margin in front, the width of which is about equal to the width of the glabella: the latter oblong conical,\n\n---\n\nFig. 377.\u2014*D. planifrons.*\nFig. 378.\u2014*D.

The front of the glabella is broadly rounded, the sides straight or nearly so, sub-parallel or slightly converging from behind forwards; the posterior margin straight in the middle, turned forward at the sides. At the base of the glabella there is an obscure transverse furrow, and I am not sure whether this should be regarded as the posterior glabellar groove or the neck furrow. The front of the head is strengthened by a depressed convex rim just within which there is a curved row of punctures, four or five in one line. From these punctures fine somewhat flexuous striae converge towards the front of the glabella. Eyes, cheeks, thorax and pygidium unknown.\n\nLength of head of a specimen which appears to be of the average size ten lines; length of glabella, seven lines; width of glabella at neck segment five lines and a half, and at front margin four lines and a half; width of the marginal rim, one line and a half.\n\nThe depressions representing the glabellar furrows are sometimes obsolete, and sometimes only one or two are visible on each side.\n\nOne of the specimens has the anterior striated margin proportionally one fourth narrower than the above and only five punctures in the width of one line. The glabella is smooth and not narrowed in front. I do not at present think, however, that these differences are of specific importance.\n\nIn another specimen where the crust is preserved, the punctures are scarcely visible, but where it is removed they are distinct.\n\nDedicated to Dr. D.

The glabella just in front of the neck furrow is abruptly elevated into a sharp rounded roof-shaped ridge from which it descends with a flat or gently concave slope to the front and lateral margins. Eyes very large, full one half the whole length of the head, their posterior angles close to the glabella at the neck furrow; thence they curve outwards so that their centres are distant from the sides of the glabella rather more than one third the width of the neck segment, thence more gradually curving inwards they reach the sides of the glabella (nearly) at a point a little in advance of its length.\nLength of head in largest specimen seen four lines; of glabella about three lines; width of glabella at base two lines, a little narrower in front. Surface with the exception of the striated and punctured front, apparently smooth.\n\nJ'mestone, No. 1.\n\nFig. 384.\n\nFig. 384.\u2014The pygidium represented by Fig. 384, appears to belong to a species of *Dikelococephalus*, but the small fragment of stone in which it occurs resembles Limestone No. 2, in which no recognisable fragments of that genus have been found.\n\n*Genera.*\u2014*Arionellus* (Barrande) and *Menocephalus* (Owen).\n\nThese two genera seem to be closely related, and I shall therefore notice them collectively. In *Arionellus* the glabella is cylindrical or sub-conical with three or four lateral furrows. The facial suture proceeds from the eye forward with a slight inward inclination to the front margin which it cuts on a line drawn between the eye and the glabella parallel with the axis of the body. Behind the eye it cuts the posterior margin at a point situated on a line drawn between that organ and the outer angle of the head. In the thorax of *A. ceticephalus* there are from 7 to 16 segments according to the age of the individual. The pygidium is small.\n\nThe head (all that is known) of *Menocephalus* only differs from *Arionellus* in having the glabella exceedingly convex. Owen discovered the glabella and a portion of the cheek plate, but none of the other parts. He describes the former as being circular, highly arched, hemispherical and pustulated. Judging from this description and the figure given by the author, and also from the aspect of the associated fossils, it appears to me highly probable that the species which I have called *M. globosus* is not only congeneric with Owen\u2019s *M. Minnesotensis* but that it is closely allied thereto. *M. Sedgewicki* cannot be separated generically from *M. globosus*, and this latter leads us through *A. subelavatus* to *A. cylindricus*.\n\nThis latter appears to me to be an *Arionellus*. The specimens are too imperfect to enable me to prove whether or not our four species belong to two distinct genera or one only. I shall place the two most convex forms in *Menocephalus*, and the other two in *Arionellus*.\n**Arionellus cylindricus. (N. sp.)**\n\nFig. 385.\n\nFig. 386.\u2014Arionellus subclavatus; \\(a\\), side view of the glabella.\n\n**Description.**\u2014Glabella sub-cylindrical slightly narrowed from behind forwards, the sides nearly straight and separated from the very prominent cheeks by a deep furrow; the front obtusely rounded or nearly straight. The neck furrow is deep and rounded and the neck segment well defined but apparently not very prominent. The posterior glabellar furrow is well defined all across, parallel with the neck furrow for half the width of the glabella and then directed obliquely forward on each side at an angle of 45\u00b0; it is about its own width distant from the neck furrow. The next furrows forward are situated a little in advance of the mid-length of the glabella; they are slightly oblique and their inner extremities are separated by about one-third the width of the glabella. In front of these are two other furrows on each side very inconspicuous and not always visible. The anterior margin of the head consists of a narrow elevated ridge separated from the front of the glabella by an angular groove of about its own width. From the summit of the terminal ridge the margin descends with an abrupt slope so that on a front view the head appears to be bounded by a flat nearly vertical band, the width of which is equal to rather more than one half the elevation of the glabella. The surface appears to be smooth or finely granular. Eyes, fixed cheeks, thorax and pygidium unknown. Length of longest head seen three and a half lines; width of glabella about two lines at neck segment and a little less at the anterior extremity. The form of the glabella of this species is almost exactly like that of *Dikeloccephalus granulosus*. (Owen.) [See Geo. Rep. Wisconsin, Pl. I, Fig. 7.]\n\nLimestone, No. 1, not common.\n\n**Arionellus subclavatus. (N. sp.)**\n\nFig. 386,\u2014\\(a\\).\n\n**Description.**\u2014Glabella as long as the head, separated from the front margin by a narrow groove only, strongly convex and elevated in the anterior two-thirds, less convex, more depressed, and somewhat narrower\nin the posterior third; sides gently convex, nearly straight, sub-parallel, slightly more distant from each other towards the front than behind, front obtusely rounded. The neck segment and furrow are rounded and well defined all across; the posterior glabellar furrows are rather strong, directed forwards at an angle somewhat less than 45\u00b0, their inner extremities separated by one-third the width of the glabella, and distant from the neck furrow about the width of the neck segment. In front of these are two obscure, nearly vertical furrows on each side, at about equal distances from each other. The fixed cheeks are strongly elevated, and separated from the glabella by the deep, narrow dorsal furrows. The eyes are small, and situated on a line drawn across the head, passing about midway between the two posterior glabellar furrows. They are connected with the front lobes of the glabella, by slender ocular ridges, as in the genus *Conocephalites*. The distance of the eye from the glabella is a little more than half the width of the neck segment. The facial suture cuts the front margin, a little inside of a line drawn through the eye, parallel with the length of the body. Behind the eye it runs obliquely outward with a gentle curve, and cuts the posterior margin at a point between the line passing through the eye, and the posterior angles of the head. The surface in the large specimens is finely tubercular, but in the small ones apparently smooth. Length of largest head seen five lines and a half; the width of the glabella at one-third the length from the front, is about three-fourths of its own length, excluding the neck segment and furrow. Moveable cheeks, thorax and pygidium unknown.\n\nLimestone, No. 1.\n\n*Menocephalus Sedgwicki.* (N. sp.)\n\nFig. 387.\u2014*Menocephalus Sedgwicki.*\n\n388.\u2014*M. globosus.* a, side view of the head; b, upper side; c, front view.\n\n**Description.**\u2014Glabella very convex, conical gradually tapering from the neck segment to the front, which is obtusely rounded. Neck segment and neck furrow well defined all across. Two glabellar furrows on each side, which divide the glabella into three pair of lobes, the anterior pairs a little the largest, the other two nearly equal to each other. The posterior furrows sometimes curve so far backwards as to isolate the lobes from the body of the glabella; their depth, however, is inconsiderable. The gla-\nbella is separated from the cheeks and front margin by the deep, narrow dorsal furrow which runs all round. The eyes are situated opposite the anterior glabellar furrows, and distant from the glabella about one-fourth the width of the neck segment. The front margin slopes from the front of the glabella downwards, and is then turned up to form a slightly elevated but well defined wire-like rim, which probably runs all round. Surface covered with small tubercles. Cheeks, thorax and pygidium unknown. Length of largest specimen collected, four lines; length of glabella, including neck segment, three lines; width of, at neck furrow, two lines.\n\nIn some specimens a third glabellar furrow is represented by an obscure indentation close to the front.\n\nThe facial suture is evidently the same as in *A. cylindricus* and *A. subclavatus*.\n\nLimestone, No. 1.\n\n**Menocephalus globosus.** (N. sp.)\n\nFig. 388\u2014a, b, c.\n\n**Description.**\u2014Head globose, the posterior angles produced into small slender spines directed outwards, at an angle of about 45\u00b0 with the axis of the body. Glabella exceedingly convex, almost hemispherical, its length slightly exceeding its width; either totally destitute of lateral furrows, or with two inconspicuous indentations on each side. Neck furrow and segment well defined; the margin of the head with a narrow, wire-like border all round, which turns up in front of the glabella, and forms an obtusely pointed rostrum; cheeks moderately tumid, but drooping on each side, so as to give a great depth to the outline of the head. Eyes about one-fifth the total length of the head, situated opposite the mid-length of the glabella, and about their own width from it. Facial suture as in *A. subclavatus*. Surface covered with small tubercles. Width of head in the specimen figured, five lines; length, three lines; length of glabella, two lines and one-fourth.\n\nAssociated with these are very numerous glabella of a larger size, in general four lines in length, which probably belong to this species.\n\nLimestone, No. 1.\n\n**Genus Bathyurus.** Billings.\n\nThis genus was described in the \"Canadian Naturalist and Geologist,\" vol. iv, p. 364, in the article on the fossils of the Calciferous Sandrock. It differs from *Asaphus* by having nine segments in the thorax, the front\nof the hypostoma not forked, and the glabella well defined by the dorsal furrows. It somewhat resembles both *Megalaspis* and *Niobe* (Angelin), in the form of the glabella, but the hypostoma is precisely like that of *Ogygia*. I have some evidence to show that the head is composed of three pieces only, as in *Dikelocephalus*. The species heretofore described are, *B. amplimarginatus*, *B. conicus*, and *B. Cybele*, from the Calciferous Sandrock:\u2014*B. Angelini*, Chazy; *B. extans*, (*Asaphus extans*, Hall,) as yet known only in the Black river limestone, and *B. spiniger*, (*Acidaspis spiniger*, Hall.) This latter species occurs both in the Black River and Trenton, in Canada.\n\nThe following species are referred to this genus provisionally. I am not at all satisfied that they belong to the genus, but I know of no other to which they bear so near a resemblance.\n\n**Bathyurus capax.** (N. sp.)\n\nFig. 389.\n\n**Description.**\u2014Head convex, forming a depressed quarter of a sphere. Glabella oblong, separated from the flat, sloping rim of the front margin by a narrow angular groove; sides gently concave, nearly straight, with a short obscure outward curve opposite the eye, slightly converging towards each other from behind, forwards. The neck furrow is represented by an obscure transverse impression, which occupies the middle third of the width of the glabella, but does not reach all across.

The eye is situated at mid-length of the head, semi-annular; its centre distant from the side of the glabella, two lines, when the length of the head is thirteen lines.\n\nThe anterior margin of the head to front of the glabella is strengthened by a flat rim, which slopes downwards and forwards at an angle of about 60\u00b0, with the horizontal plane of the body. This character is constant in head specimens of all sizes, from a length of six lines to thirteen. The width of this rim in the largest specimens, is one line and one-third. Cheeks, thorax and pygidium, unknown.

These tubercules are of an elongate oval form, pointed at both ends, bounded on the outside by the dorsal furrow which runs all round the glabella, and on the inside by a shallow, rather obscure groove, but which seems to separate them completely from the main body of the glabella. The lower pointed extremity of each terminates a little below the level of the neck furrow, and the upper, a little behind the mid-length of the head.\n\nLength of the largest head seen, eight lines and a half; width of glabella just behind the neck furrow, six lines; length of each tubercule two lines and a half; width of same in the middle one line.

The neck furrow in the cast of the interior is well defined all across, but when the crust is preserved it dies out on approaching the sides. The rim which forms the front margin has a flat slope inwards to the anterior edge of the glabella.\nLength of the largest head seen, five lines and a half; width of glabella at neck segment, six lines, and at two lines from the front, three lines and a half.

Another of the same size and type occurs at Phillipsburgh.\n\n**Asaphus Illaenoides. (N. sp.)**\n\n*Description.*\u2014Head very convex, in shape like that of an *Illaenus*, equal to about one-fourth of a sphere, posterior angles rounded; width a little less than twice the length. Glabella obscurely defined, oblong, slightly narrowed just behind the eyes, thence a little widened both forwards and backwards. Eyes sub-globular, of a medium size, close to the glabella, the distance between their centres about equal to the length of the head. The facial suture runs from the inner anterior angle of the eye, with a scarcely perceptible curve outwards, directly forward to the front margin, being in this part almost parallel with the longitudinal axis of the body. From the inner posterior angle it runs outwards and backwards, and cuts the margin at a point in a line drawn parallel with the axis of the body, passing outside of the eye at a distance therefrom equal to one-half the width of that organ. The cheeks from the eye to the posterior angle of the head, descend with a flat slope of about $45^\\circ$ to the horizontal plane of the body. The surface appears to be smooth.\n\nThe pygidium is depressed, convex, semicircular, the posterior margin regularly rounded; the axis depressed, semi-cylindrical, sub-conical, sides a little concave, rather prominent, the extremity very obtusely round, the length varying from a little more than one-half to two-thirds the total length; its width a little less than that of the side lobes, five very obscure segments, of which the last two are sometimes blended into one. The anterior margins of the side lobes are almost at right angles to the axis for one-half or thereabouts of the width, then sloping backwards to the outer corners, which they reach at an angle of about $30^\\circ$ to the transverse diameter of the body.\nJust behind the margin there is a single groove, obscure towards the axis but more distinct outwards. There are in some specimens, several faintly marked ribs, but in general the side lobes, with the exception of the anterior furrow, are smooth.\n\nLength of head of a specimen of medium size, seven lines width, twelve lines; distance between centre of eyes, seven lines.\n\nLength of a pygidium of medium size, six lines; width, twelve lines; length of axis, four lines and a-half; width of same at front margin, three lines and a half, and at half a line from the posterior extremity, three lines.\n\nI have seen the underside of the head of this species and the sub-rostral fold is distinctly divided as in *A. platycephalus*. Had not this character been observed, I would have, without much hesitation, referred the head to the genus *Ill\u00e6nus*.\n\nIn Limestone, No. 3.\n\n**Asaphus goniurus. (N. sp.)**\n\nThe above name is proposed for a small triangular pygidium found in No. 3. It is evidently distinct from any described Silurian species of this country, but allied to one that occurs in the Chazy Limestone at Mingan. The form is triangular, the length three-fifths, or thereabouts, of the width, the axis scarcely at all elevated above the surface, and indistinctly divided into segments in the anterior half, but towards the extremity becoming strongly elevated, smooth and pointed. The largest specimen seen is about half an inch in length.

The first twenty-four pages, as noticed in the Preface, were reprinted in 1865, with the following alterations. On page 3 the parts in brackets in the reprint consist of new matter. On pages 4, 5, a new species (*Archeocyathus profundus*) is instituted for the specimens from Anse au Loup, originally referred to *A. Minganensis*. On page 8, *Kutorgina* is inserted in the name of *Obolella cingulata*. Page 11, *Olenellus* is adopted instead of *Paradoxides*. The notes on pages 10, 11, 12, of the original are withdrawn.\n\nPages 57 to 72 have been also reprinted, from 57 to 66 inclusive, and part of 67 being entirely new matter.\n\n2. *Stricklandia.*\u2014As this generic name is preoccupied, I have changed it to *Stricklandinia*. (See *Can. Geol.*, vol. viii, p. 370.) The two species (*ante*, p. 85) must therefore be called *Stricklandinia Arachne* and *Stricklandinia Arethusa*. I have still some doubts as to the generic affinities of these fossils; but so far as their internal structure can be made out, they appear to be more nearly related to this genus than to any other. They are also allied to *Camerella*.\n\n3. *Fossils from the Black Hills.*\u2014*Meek* and *Hayden* have re-described the fossils from these localities (*ante*, p. 58) under the name of *Lingulepis pinniformis* (Owen), *Lingulepis prima* (Conrad), *Obolella nana*, *Theca gregarea*, *Agraulos Oweni*, and *Agraulos?*\u2014? (Palaeontology of the Upper Missouri, by F. B. *Meek* and F. V. *Hayden*; published by the Smithsonian Institution, April, 1865.\n\n4. *Fauna of the Levis Formation.*\u2014The number of graptolites is put down at 53 species (*ante*, p. 62), but this includes *G. Milesi* and *G. secalinus*, which have not yet been found in rocks clearly identified with the Levis formation. The correct number (51 species) is given on p. 376, and also in the foregoing list, p. 417. There are also five species of *Asaphus* instead of four, as mentioned on pp. 62, 63\u2014the total number of trilobites being 74, of which 73 are described. There are also 29 species of Brachiopoda. As to the total number of species of all orders, in this formation, I am satisfied that we are still far from the truth. Every new locality furnishes several new forms. I have stated (*ante*, pp. 62, 376) that there are 219 described species; but as several of these are doubtfully identified, it would be better to say that there are between 215 and 220.\nCyrtoceras Juvenalis. (Ante, p. 177.)\n\nFig. 400.\u2014Cyrtoceras Juvenalis.\u2014a, side view of a nearly perfect specimen; b, ventral view of the original, showing the surface characters.\n\nRemarks.\u2014Since the description of this species was printed, Mr. J. F. Whiteaves has discovered a nearly perfect individual, in the Trenton limestone near Montreal, which is figured above.\n\nThe specimen is $2\\frac{1}{2}$ inches in length measured along the outside, and is curved to a radius of about 11 lines. It tapers, in the lateral diameter, from 8 lines to 3, and, in the dorso ventral, from 9 to 3 lines. Near the mid-length a number of the septa are well preserved,\u20146 in 4 lines measured on the side, and 7 in 6 lines on the median line of the ventral aspect. There appears to be a constriction near the aperture.\n\nClisospira curiosa. (Ante, p. 186.)\n\nFig. 401.\u2014A portion of the spire of C. curiosa, which retains the shell and surface markings.\n\nRemarks.\u2014Among the specimens of this species lately collected by T. C. Weston is one which retains a part of the shell. The surface is beautifully reticulated by ascending and revolving lines as above represented.\n| Acrotreta gemma | 216 |\n|-----------------|-----|\n| Agnostus Americanus | 395 |\n| \" Canadensis |
