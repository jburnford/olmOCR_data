His Grace uses the strongest language and accuses the continuances of the bishops of being responsible for the conduct of the clergy to break up the Catholic schools by excluding priests from school boards, which he declared, the last few years, had been the only Catholic schools left in the province. He condemns the furore made about the Queen's jubilee processions, and says they should be confined to school business and leave politics alone. The holiest patriot would most likely agree with him.

After which Mr. Macdonald, Haldimand, rose to move the address in reply to the message from the Governor General to Lord Lansdowne, promising renewal, and expressed the regret the people of Canada would feel, when a second Lord Lansdowne was in warm place. The honour might be said by the Opposition Speaker that there was nothing not suggesting much legislation, but this was a matter of congratulation, showing that the country had been brought into such a good shape that no legislation was necessary. He spoke of the changes so many years ago, and referred to the similar to that in the older Provinces, and spoke of the prosperity of the country, and said that all it wants is increased immigration.\n\nMr. Jonas seconded the motion speaking twenty minutes in French.\n\nMr. Laurier replied. He admitted the movement and the spirit of the address, but expressed doubt as to the manner in which it was delivered by the Speaker, and wanted to know why the Department of Trade and Commerce\u2014about which he had been speaking\u2014had not been restored. He also attacked the government as a tyranny and threatened to appeal against the minister general. He would like to see amendments to the Executive Act, and said that the minister should not be left in the Provinces to make up for the deficiencies of the government. He marvelled at the tendency with which the government was bringing this country to be powerless. He maintained exactly the opposite, and said the country was stronger than ever before, and that it was more powerful than at present, that it was on the verge of ruin, and hundreds and thousands of our proper workmen and working honest men of United States and Canada lost was due to the actions of the government, who forced many of the C. P. R. men to go to the United States and Manitoba in the grip. With all its magnificent crops, Manitoba and our own was being shipped down by the Canadian\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b\u94c1\u8def\u516c\u53f8 and combined by a gang of thieves who had made their speech in order to voice the grievances of the subject mentioned, but intended selecting no amendments to the address.\n\nSir Richard Cartwright, the long-time friend of Mr. Laurier on his previous visit, joined in the regret expressed by the leader of the Opposition for the absence of Mr. Laurier, who was regarded as a partner of Lord Lansdowne. He commented on the insincerity of Mr. Laurier in not supporting the government of the Board of Trade and Commerce, and a Solicitor general. The reason a Trade and Commerce Department had not been established was that His Excellency had not yet considered it necessary to provide a minister for the department. He was perfectly satisfied with the existing arrangement, and felt that the administration had not followed in the footsteps of the past, and urged the blame rested upon the Opposition whose decryings had kept people out. Every day while the government was in session had been marked by the same unchanging position as to the terrible condition of the country, and the depressing effect the present policy had on the people. He persistently failed to see it and continued to support this party which so persistently tried to destroy the country. The people evidently preferred ruin at the hands of the party now in power to prosperity under the other.\n\nSir Richard Cartwright followed, and in extravagant language, spoke of the crimes and depredations which brought up the Winnipeg Train of Treason, and stated that tens of thousands of barrels of wheat were lying rotting in the streets of Winnipeg. This statement was promptly denied by Mr. Diefenbaker.\n\nPeter Mitchell spoke about ten minutes and the debate closed. The address was then adopted.\n\nMessrs.

He contended that the Speaker had erred in his action, and asked for the privileges of the House in dismissing these men. He asked the Speaker to refer the papers, etc., in case to the House.\n\nSir John said there was no doubt but that the Speaker would comply with the request.\n\nAfter other discussions the House adjourned at 10 o'clock.\n\nA Liberal caucus was held today at which Mr. Laurier's conduct yesterday was discussed. There is a decided feeling in the minority of the Liberals wishing some action in the Liberal ranks, some wishing Cartwright to take charge in Laurier's place, others thinking they should elect Laurier for a new post.\n\nThe Hon. Richard Hanna was duly discharged from the hospital today. Mr. Hanna, Mr. Smith, and two others.\n\nToronto, Feb. 28.\u2014Robert Neill, who visited his grand-son, Robert Neill, in the General Hospital, died this morning.
