I asked Mr. McKenzie, husband of the teacher at the school, who is a very capable carpenter to give me an estimate of the cost of labour in carrying out these repairs. His estimate is enclosed herewith. Although Mr. McKenzie has gone beyond the rebuilding of the steps and the repairs to the veranda, the work on the steps and veranda at a cost for labour of $102.80 and repairs and kalsomining should be done. The inside work could be done at a later date. The approximate cost of materials to complete the above work would be $80.00.\n\nWill you please advise in this matter as Mr. McKenzie is prepared to do this work now.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\n[Handwritten calculations]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Your letter is not exactly clear but I infer that the cost of labour in repairing the verandah would be $108.60 and that there would be an additional charge of $13.50 for labour for kalsomining and repairing the kitchen. This would make a total cost for labour of $116.60 plus an amount of $80.00 for materials. From the information we have available it is difficult to justify such a large expenditure. If the verandah at this school is in such bad condition why not demolish it and replace it with a landing and steps?\n\nYou might obtain an estimate of the cost of handling this matter in the manner suggested by the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Vouchers were submitted to the Department, for this work, on October 27, 1943, and are as follows:\n\nVoucher No. 474, $77.50.\nLabour on soft water cistern $35.00\nMaterial for kitchen, ceiling and walls $20.00\nLabour on walls and ceiling $22.50\n\n$77.50\n\nNo. 474 $66.45 Materials for building cistern.\n\nAccording to Mr. Pavelle's letter, Mr. Strom only received a cheque for $60.45, which still leaves a balance outstanding of $83.50 due Mr. Strom.\n\nI would be pleased if this matter could be adjusted as soon as possible, as it is very difficult to have work done on outlying reserves, and delay in payment makes it doubly difficult.\n\nJ.

This cheque has been returned to us through the bank. It is endorsed by Mr. Strom. I cannot see why he told Mr. Favell that he had only received $60.45.\n\nYour second voucher No. N. 474 for $77.50, issued in favour of John Strom, reached this office on February 21, 1946. Cheque No. 12601 for the amount stated was issued and sent to him on February 26. This cheque has not yet been returned to the bank, but I presume he has received it by this time.\n\nR.A.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nAbout a year ago the Lower Fairford Day School was repainted. The work was well done, but owing to this school being closed during week-ends from Friday night until Tuesday morning the plaster has cracked and is falling. If my belief that plaster will not stay on the walls and ceiling under the present arrangements, the school being closed over a too long weekend.\n\nI would suggest that the walls and ceiling be lined with beaver-board, and at the same time the walls and ceiling should be insulated.\n\nI am asking the Farm Instructor to obtain a price on labour installing the board and as soon as this is received a further report will be submitted.\n\nJ. Weite,\nIndian Agent.\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nApril 12, 1944.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI wish to inform the Department that the Fairford Improved day School has been cold during the even moderate weather this past winter, and no amount of firing seemed to make any appreciable difference.\n\nDuring my visit to the reserve, I closed several cold air registers and made a few improvements. The school rooms still remained cold.\n\nThis school was built in 1915? It has a stone basement which possibly should be pointed, and there is an air space between the weather board and the stone work. This would consider the furnace adequate, although the damper will have to be repaired. This would have to be done by an expert. Is it possible that the building will have to be insulated and possibly all the siding renailed. The cost of this work would be considerable and I would like to have the services of an expert on matters of this nature. There is no man in the district capable of doing this work and one would have to be sent in from the City of Winnipeg.\n\nI would be pleased if the Department would name a firm who would give an estimate on the work required at this school.\n\nJ. Waite,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nApril 19, 1944.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nI enclose copy of a letter that has just been received from Mr. Waite, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, Manitoba. The letter does not give us any estimate of the probable expenditure that will be necessary and the Department would like to have some idea of this before authorizing the work. You will note that there is no one capable of doing the work in the vicinity of the school. Possibly you could suggest someone to Mr. Waite. I should appreciate it if you would give this matter consideration and advise me what you feel ought to be done and the probable cost.\n\nR.A.

Chase, Davis Point, Manitoba.\nWe were advised in a letter dated September 25 from\nHamilton Hamilton that Mr. Chase was prepared to\nsupply the material required and at that time Mr.\nHamilton forwarded to us a copy of a quotation\nthat he had received from Mr. Chase. We do not\nappear to have any correspondence on our file\nindicating why the business was given to Mr.\nSmith rather than to Mr. Chase.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a tender received from one Homer Chase, for installing a damper in the furnace at Fairford Improved Day School. The amount of the tender is $14.00.\n\nThe damper was bought from The Winnipeg Paint & Glass Company, Winnipeg and at that time I interviewed their heating expert in regard to installing the damper. He claimed that it would be only an hour or so work, a matter of taking off the casing, moving the heating drums and bolting in the new damper. This may be correct on the floor of a showroom.\n\nI looked over the furnace when I was on the reserve recently; at that time an attempt was made to insert the damper through the fire-box. Apparently this could not be done. The casing of the furnace is bolted to the hood and cannot be removed but has to be cut, to take off the outside. There is also the work of taking down all the cold and hot air pipes, and these would have to be replaced after the repair was made. I consider there is a good two days work.\n\nThe damper was purchased on voucher No. 0387, dated September 25, 1944.\n\nJ. Weite,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nDecember 20, 1944.\n\nMr. J.

At first glance the amount required for this work seems extremely high, but from the fact that there has been made it is evident that the furnace has to be taken apart before the damper can be installed. Under the circumstances the Department approves the expenditure of $14 and it is hoped that the installation of the damper will make the heating of the building more satisfactory.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nLittle Saskatchewan Reserve,\nGypsumville, Manitoba.\nNovember 2nd, 1944.\n\nTo, Department of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\nIn account with Mr. Homer Chase, Davis Point, P.O., Man.\nFor labour building short steps and landings, repairing cement sink in basement, insulating ceiling, Fairford Improved school.\n\nBy labour, 153\u00bd Hours @ 70\u00a2 per hr. $107.60.\nTotal $107.60.\n\nSigned Homer J.

Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage La Prairie.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nInclosed herewith please find invoices made out in triplicate covering material supplied by Mr. A.J. Smith Eriksdale, P.O. Man. For repair of the Fairford improved school. It would appear by your letter of October 14th, 1944 File 50-39, that the Department was purchasing the material direct from Mr. O'Connell, but yesterday I spoke to Mr. Smith over the phone yesterday and he informed me that at the time delivery of the repair material was made, he was under the impression that payment for same would be made direct to him by our Dept. It would therefore simplify matters if you would kindly arrange to have the cheque for material made out in favor of Mr. Smith. Accounts for labour will be in the mail shortly.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nR. E. Pavelle,\nLittle Sask.

The material was supplied by Mr. Smith, Lumber Merchant, Eriksdale, Manitoba, and it would simplify matters if payment was made direct to him.\n\nI would recommend that voucher O 552 be accepted in favour of Mr. Smith.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJanuary 2, 1945.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 5, 1945.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, with regard to purchase order No. 26865. I have read the Farm Instructor's letter very carefully and I cannot see that it explains the matter.\n\nIn a letter dated September 25, Inspector Hamilton wrote to us as follows:\n\n\"Re: Repairs to Fairford Schools\nYour file 126-5-5, dated April 19/44\n\n\"The enclosed quotations have just been received from Agent Waite. It is difficult to get anyone to do work at these outlying points, and I would recommend that Mr. Waite be instructed to proceed with the work at once.\n\n\"The Lower Fairford School is very cold. I do not think a teacher has been appointed yet, so the inside repair work could be carried on any time.\"\n\nAttached to the letter were the quotations showing distinctly that the prices had been obtained from Homer S. Chase, Davis Point, Manitoba. We so informed the Purchasing Branch and, as we felt from Inspector Hamilton's letter that the work should be done at the earliest possible date, we recommended to the Purchasing Agent that Chase's quotation be accepted. This was done and purchase order 26865 was issued.\nI note that the material was supplied by Mr. Smith, but before placing the order with him the matter should have been referred back to this office. There must be some definite reason why the business was placed with Smith rather than with Chase, or there must be some reason why the voucher was issued in favour of Smith instead of in favour of Chase. Under the circumstances we feel it necessary to withhold payment until more definite information is supplied.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nRequisition for School Material\n\nDate: 9th January 1945\n\nFor Indian Day School Manitowahk Agency\n\nNOTE:\nTo avoid delay, teachers should give full particulars regarding each article required.\nThe name, series, number of grade, and name of author and publisher of all books required should be given as fully as possible.\nWhen ordering kindergarten material, the catalogue number of some well known firm should be given for each article required.\nOnly one item should be specified on each line of this requisition and no entry should be made under heading \"Number Authorized\".\n\n| ARTICLES | NUMBER ON HAND | DATE OF LAST RECEIPT | NUMBER REQUIRED | NUMBER AUTHORIZED | REMARKS |\n|----------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------|\n| Coal oil lantern 3\u00bd lb axe (complete) | | | | | |\n\nN.B.\u2014Explicit information regarding address must be furnished.\n\nName: Mary E.

I am enclosing the account which was submitted to us, also copies of the following letters:\n\n(a) Letter of December 14, 1944, addressed to Indian Agent Waite;\n\n(b) Letter of January 2, 1945, from Agent Waite; enclosing letter from Farm Instructor Favelle;\n\n(c) Letter of January 5 to Agent Waite;\n\n(d) Letter of February 7 from Agent Waite.\n\nThis transaction appears rather peculiar, but under the circumstances it would be appreciated if you would revise the purchase order so that payment can be made to Mr. Smith.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nFebruary 9, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nOn September 22, last, two estimates were forwarded through Mr. Inspector Hamilton's office, for certain repairs to the Fairford Improved Day School and the Lower Fairford Day School. The amounts of the repair work were as follows:\n\nFairford Improved Day School, Material $223.96, Labour $107.60.\nFairford Lower School, Material $151.99, Labour $80.00.\n\nAuthority was received for the work on the Improved School, the material being ordered through Mr. Smith of Erickdale by Mr. Chase, the Order being No. 26865. On October 14, I wrote to Mr. Favelle, Farm Instructor, advising him that Mr. Chase's estimate had been approved and that $104.00 had also been approved for labour.\n\nIn the latter part of December accounts were received here in amount of $152.00, in favour of Mr. A.J. Smith of Erickdale for material, and $60.00 in labour in favour of Mr. Homer Chase. The accounts were submitted through Mr. Favelle. I immediately wrote to Mr. Favelle asking him for the letter of authority, as I thought it might be possible that Mr. Chase had been advised direct about the repair to the Lower School from the Department at Ottawa. A copy of Mr. Favelle's reply is appended. This did not appear to be satisfactory and I arranged to meet Mr. Chase at Gypsumville on January 23.\n\nMr. Chase informed me that Mr. Favelle had told him to go ahead with the work on the Lower School. He claimed that he told Mr. Favelle that he did not have the authority and was doubtful about the matter. However, he thought perhaps Mr. Favelle would have some author-\nity in the matter, because he had previously told him that the $104.00 had been authorized for the labour on the Improved School.\n\nMr. Favelle readily admitted his mistake. He figured that the authority would be approved in time and as he had Mr. Chase on the reserve he would have the work done. There is a labour shortage in the district and there is no doubt that Mr. Chase is a very busy man and would not be able to return to do the work at the Lower school for some months. There is no doubt that the work was very necessary if the school was to open.\n\nI beg to recommend that the accounts be paid.\n\nYou will also kindly note that Mr. Chase purchased the material from Mr. Smith of Erickdale. He has no lumber yard of his own and the prices of materials submitted were quoted by Mr. Smith.\n\nJ. Weite,\nIndian Agent.\nLittle Saskatchewan Reserve,\nGypsumville P.O., Manitoba.\nJanuary 2, 1945\n\nMr. J. Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nFortune la Prairie, Man.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to yours of the 27th ultimo File #50-34. With regards to the supplies sent in for material and labour repairing the interior of the Lower Fairford school. As requested in your letter I endeavoured to obtain from Mr. Chase the order No. also the date of the letter he received from the Department pertaining to the repair of the Fairford schools, however the latter could not be found. It is likely, however, the letter was refered to as order No. 26865. It would therefore appear that the work on the Lower Fairford School has been completed without the proper authority. It is very unfortunate that this should have been so, as you know how difficult it is to secure labour for work of this nature, also how necessary it was to have this work completed. Would you kindly advise me further in this connection.\n\nYours respectfully\n\n(Sgd.) R.E. Parelle\nLittle Sask.

It would appear by your letter of October 14th, 1944, File 5039 that the Department was purchasing the material direct from Mr. Chase (the contractor). However, I spoke to Mr. Smith over the phone yesterday and he informed me that at the time delivery of the repair material was made he was under the impression that payment for same should be made direct to him by our Dept.

I have read the Farm Instructor's letter very carefully and I cannot see that it explains the matter.\n\nIn a letter dated September 25, Inspector Hamilton wrote to us as follows:\n\n\"Re: Repairs to Fairford Schools,\nYour file 126-6-6, dated April 19/44\n\n\"The enclosed quotations have just been received from Agent Waite. It is difficult to get anyone to do work at these outlying points, and I would recommend that Mr. Waite be instructed to proceed with the work at once.\n\n\"The Lower Fairford School is very cold. I do not think a teacher has been appointed yet, so the inside repair work could be carried on any time.\"\n\nAttached to the letter were the quotations showing distinctly that the prices had been obtained from Homer S. Chase, Davis Point, Manitoba. We so informed the Purchasing Branch and, as we felt from Inspector Hamilton's letter that the work should be done at the earliest possible date, we recommended to the Purchasing Agent that Chase's quotation be accepted. This was done and purchase order 26865 was issued.\n\nI note that the material was supplied by Mr. Smith, but before placing the order with him the matter should\n\np.t.o.\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba,\nFebruary 7, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: 126-6-6, Ottawa, December 14, 1944.\n\nWith reference to the above noted letter, I wish to advise that I interviewed Mr. Homer Chase at Gypsumville on the 23rd ultimo regarding the account for lumber furnished by Mr. A. J. Smith of Eriksdale.\n\nMr. Chase advised that he obtained prices for material from Mr. Smith of Eriksdale and these prices were forwarded to the Department. He has no lumber yard of his own and materials had to be obtained from outside.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith an order signed by Mr. Chase, authorizing that cheque for the material be paid direct to Mr. Smith.\n\nI trust this order will clean up this matter.\n\n(sgd.)

Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to endorse herewith a list of materials required to build a lean-to to the Lower Fairford Day School. At the present time and under present conditions it seems impossible to obtain a bill of material from any lumber merchant. I would be pleased if the bill of material be checked before any purchase is made. The cost of labour is also estimated. The building (School) is approximately 26 feet long and I suggest that two rooms be built, 12 feet wide.\n\nThere has been no teacher at this school for almost two years. It is approximately 1\u00bd miles from the Improved Day School and the walk appears to be too much for a teacher on an Indian Reserve. The fact that this school is closed is an excuse for the average Indian not to send his children to the Improved School, although in many cases he is just as close to the Improved School as the Lower School. This leads to a controversy, especially if the Indian's children attended the Lower School before it was closed. It also leads to some injustice in the administering of Family Allowance. This school should be open in justice to the Indian and in fairness in the administering of the Family Allowance as far as Indians are concerned. The school was renovated just over a year ago and is now in good condition. Wood fuel has been placed at the school for the operation of the school stove only. A list of needed furniture and approximate costs is also attached. I would suggest a cement foundation only, with a dug-out cellar. A well should also be drilled. The depth of the well at the improved school is approximately 60 feet. The lay of the land at Lower Fairford is slightly different, but I think water should be found at 100 feet. The approximate cost at this depth would be $450.00.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nIndian Affairs.

We could allow a teacher sufficient extra salary to pay for her transportation.\n\nI understand from your letter that the main reason for you suggesting the erection of a teacher's residence at the Lower Fairford is to enable us to secure a teacher's services for a school which has been closed, owing to the fact that we have been unable to secure a teacher who would consent to walk from the Fairford Improved School to the Lower Fairford School. If my suggestion is feasible, it might be possible for us to secure a teacher. This would solve the difficulty for the year 1946-47, at least.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nLittle Saskatchewan Reserve,\nGypsumville, Manitoba.\nOct. 24th, 1946.\n\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\nIn account with Alex Bruce treaty No. 114, Fairford-\nband, Fairford, P.O., Man.

The class-room especially. This room on a cold day requires all the heat from the furnace turned into it to make it at all bearable. This means the rest of the house is without heat except from the cook-stove. The building has had the ceiling raised immediately a few years ago. The walls cannot be insulated as every four feet down the walls the scantlings are braced across. The furnace at present in use was installed approximately twelve years ago, and was supposed to be large enough to heat the whole building. While new, it was satisfactory except on very cold or windy days. A full-time caretaker has been installed at this school. And while the heating of the building has improved, the problem is not solved. I beg to suggest the following improvement.\n\nThe class-room is 32 X 22 X 14. Kindly note the ceiling is very high and has to be taken into consideration in providing heat for this room. I beg to suggest a pipeless furnace of 12,000 to 15,000 cu. feet capacity. Heat for the class-room only. This would mean the closing of the radiators, both hot and cold into the class-room, thus allowing the present wood furnace to heat the living quarters only. I might state that the living quarters comprise a large living room, kitchen and dining-room on the ground floor with five bedrooms upstairs. The cost of a pipeless furnace would be approximately $180.00. I would recommend that a coal burner be supplied, as wood on the Fairfield Reserve is getting in short supply.\nTen tons of coal would be sufficient to fire a furnace of this type during the winter months.\n\nThe installation of an additional furnace would mean the building of a new chimney at an approximate cost $100.00. The present chimney is only large enough to carry the wood furnace and the cook stove. It is also not possible to connect the smoke pipe of a new furnace to the present chimney. The pipe would be too long and dangerous. A total figure $400.00 would buy the furnace, cost of installation and build the chimney. The purchase of fuel would be additional. The installation of the additional furnace would make it possible to again employ a part time caretaker at a salary of $25.00 per month, as against the present full time caretaker at $60.00 per month.\n\nThis school requires re-roofing. I have been trying to obtain prices on this work, without success. I think the cost would be close to $800.00, as new sheeting will be required in places, all new shingles will certainly have to be put on.\n\nBoth these jobs can only be done during the summer months, but I beg to bring them to the attention of the Department at this time, so that arrangements may be made for the expenditure.\n\nJ. Waite,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 3rd, 1947.\n\nJ. Waite, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, Man.\n\nWe have your letter of the 28th ult., with reference to the school and teachers' residence on the Fairford Reserve.\n\nWe have noted that you consider a new furnace and chimney should be supplied and that the school requires re-roofing.\n\nYou should bring this matter to our attention again early in June so that the necessary action can be taken during the months of July and August when the school is closed for holidays.\n\nIt is hoped that by that time you will be able to obtain a quotation for the re-roofing.\n\nBernard F.

Please find attached a copy of the basement plan for this house which is their catalogue Number 422 R. We are advised that their 20 by 24 basement on a 9\" by 7' 6\" wall with a 30\" by 10\" footing and a 4\" floor will take 30 cubic yards of concrete with 120 bags of cement at a six to one mix.\n\nYou will note on the right hand side of the plan diagram of the anchor bolt settings in the 2 by 4 sill. The bolts are placed approximately 6 ft. apart 24 inches from the outside edge of the basement wall. North American Buildings, Limited, supply the sill, anchor bolts and centre beam but nothing below the beam. If there is any further technical information required I suggest that you write directly to the North American Buildings, Limited, at the above address. If you require the 120 bags of cement please send a telegram immediately to this effect and we will request our Purchasing Agent to obtain it for you. However, if cement is obtainable locally, this letter will serve as authority for the immediate local purchase of amount required.\n\nEncl.\n\nBernard F.

This is the first intimation I have received regarding the purchase of a prefabricated house.\n\nMy understanding is, that I am to arrange for the construction of the basement for this house, which is to be 20 X 24 with a 7' 6\" wall, 9\" thick.\n\nThis will mean an excavation 8' deep, dimension and board material for forms to hold concrete. The purchase of 32 cubic yards of gravel and 50 lbs of 3\" nails. It would appear that exact measurements would be required and as there is no one in the vicinity of the reserve capable of doing this work, it would have to be done by a contractor from the outside.\n\nAnnuity payments are to be made on the Fairford Reserve next Monday and I would be pleased if the Department could supply definite instructions regarding the excavation of the basement and if I am to go ahead with this work according to plan submitted.\n\nJUN 27 1947\n\nIndian Affairs.

A coal furnace was installed last fall\u2014this for heating the class room only. The house portion, which consists of eight rooms arranged downstairs and five up, is being heated at the present time by a wood furnace. It seems impossible to obtain heavy wood fuel on this reserve, as the heavy wood is badly depleted. I would suggest that a coal furnace be installed. The windows and doors are loosely fitted and considerable cold enters the house through these openings. I would suggest that all windows and doors in the building be refitted. Most of the floors are in bad shape; they are of fir, old, and badly blistered. The installing of the furnace should be done by an engineer and I would request that Mr. Connally be requested to check over the heating system in this building and furnish a report. I would also be pleased if the Agency Superintendent could be authorized to obtain the cost of refitting the windows, doors, etc.\n\nJ. Waite,\nField Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nThe Lower Fairford School recently opened under Mr. Murray as teacher, is crowded with approximately thirty-nine pupils. There are still fourteen to sixteen children of school age that should attend. The ventilation is very poor and I have requested, assistant Agent Favelle to obtain prices of the installation of two ventilating windows on the north wall. Prices will also be obtained for the removal of the partition between the school proper and the two cloak rooms. This will enlarge the school approximately ten feet and later a partition lean-to could be built to the school as cloak rooms. This change will mean that the chimney will have to be removed and rebuilt at the end of the school. The cost of these changes should not be high and as soon as estimates are received the bill of cost will be forwarded to the Department for approval.\n\nThe two toilets are in poor condition and I have requested that an estimate be obtained for the building of two new ones. This cost will be forwarded to the Department for approval when received.\n\nJ.

Hamilton,\nPortage La Prairie, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe #50-295\n\nRequisition for thirty panes of glass.\n\nThis glass is necessary and urgent since that many panes are broken, some being the inner windows and 4-stone windows have no glass at all. There have been no replacements of glass for several years. Glass was requisitioned for but it could not be obtained by local dealers. The large sizes in particular are difficult to obtain by\nlocal dealers.\n\nIn fact I missed two 10 x 20 panes when I requisitioned. The place is as drafty as can be owing to need of glass and weather stripping.\n\nYours truly,\nG. L. Marsh\nTeacher\nFairfield Improved Day School\nNovember 29, 1948.\n\nMr. A.G.

It has the same living quarters and 1 classroom. A new school was built here last summer, so there are now 2 classrooms; previous to that, the dining room was used as a classroom. The\n\nThe senior room is taught by Miss Thomas and the junior room by Miss McCabe. There are 67 children on the register and on the day of my visit at the school there were 32 in the junior room and 25 in the senior room, a total of 57. The average attendance, I believe, was about 55.\n\nTwo vans are used in transporting the children to and from school, one from Lower Fairford and the other from Upper Fairford. These children are also supplied with a mid-day meal. An Indian who lives about two miles from the school acts as Janitor, keeps on fires, etc., and a girl is employed in the kitchen to do the housework, look after meals, etc. This is generally an Indian girl.\n\nI spent half a day in the classrooms and I was favourably impressed with the work that is being done here. I consider that Miss Thomas and Miss McCabe are splendid teachers and they are certainly very much interested in their work. They keep the children clean and tidy and take an interest in their health just as much as they do in their school work. They have a pony at the school, that they drive around with, and in cases of sickness they always give all possible assistance. They have also done considerable work in advising the mothers about keeping their children clean, etc. These two ladies are now in their fourth year on the reserve.\n\nMiss Thomas asked me if there was any such thing as an increase in salary for teachers on an Indian Reserve, as she pointed out that they were still getting the same salary as they did when they started. Miss McCabe is getting $700.00 a year and Miss Thomas, $800.00. Out of this, of course, they have to provide themselves and the girl that is in the kitchen. Miss Thomas further stated that it was not just for the sake of getting more money, but that even if they got a small increase in salary, she would feel that their work was satisfactory to the Department.\n\nOne thing I would recommend is that they be furnished with a little more furniture. These women are living an isolated life and I think we should make them as comfortable as possible. And when I see how well some of the boarding schools are furnished, I think the Department should supply this place with the bare necessities, as most of their furniture is makeshift, made out of boxes, etc. Should the Department have funds for this purpose, I can furnish a list of what is actually required. The school building as a whole is in good shape.\nThe Inspector comments favourably on the Improved Day School on the Fairford Reserve. The teachers, Miss Thomas and Mrs. Macdonald, seem to be doing good work, and they have a large attendance at the school. I would draw your attention to the Inspector's remarks regarding an increase in salary for these teachers, and I am of the opinion that if there is any way of granting the request it should be done.\n\nWith reference to the Inspector's remarks regarding the poorly furnished condition of the living quarters at this school, I think, myself, that we should do something to make living conditions more comfortable for these women. And for an outlay of about $200.00 we might be able to buy the necessary furniture. I do not know whether any rugs or linoleum are required or not; if so, they would be additional.\nOttawa, March 5th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nRelative to the request made by Mr. Inspector Christianson in his report on his inspection of the Fairford Improved Indian Day School that a quantity of furniture be supplied for the use of the teachers' residence, and also to your request regarding this request as contained in your No. 205-9 of the 23rd ultimo, I beg to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding $200 in the supplying of the necessary furnishings. I shall be pleased if you will arrange for the purchase and delivery of the furnishings which you consider necessary, the cost of which should not exceed the above authorized amount. We will have funds in our next year's appropriation to cover this expenditure.\n\nPlease forward accounts in the usual manner covering the cost of the furnishings supplied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6233, file 510-8, part 1)\nApril 22, 1948.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nWith reference to the attached statement requesting an additional payment of $231.00, I enclose for your information a copy of your invoice of December 6th.\n\nIf you add the items that are specifically mentioned on this invoice you will note that the correct total is $1,968.72 and not $2,199.72. Evidently you neglected to include the gravity furnace in your December 6th invoice which, of course, would bring the invoice to the total mentioned in its name of $1,968.72. We noticed this mistake when we received the account and we added to your invoice the cost of the furnace and forwarded you cheque No. 84741 for $2,199.72 on March 4, 1948.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nNorth American Buildings Ltd.,\n711 Royal Bank Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nPP/MCD\nI beg to advise that the work of erecting the prefabricated house at Lower Fairford is completed, except for painting inside and out. The cost of labour was forwarded under Vouchers Nos. 335 and 340, amounting to $287.50. If it is the intention of the Department to have this building painted, the attached letter from North American Buildings Limited gives the quantities of paint required. The cost of labour I would estimate at approximately $300.00. The fiscal year may be too far advanced for this work to be finished in time to have vouchers paid before the year closes. However, it might be possible to obtain the paint under the present year's allotment.\n\nThe above letter gave authority to have a well drilled at this house and also one at Lake St. Martin proposed school site. The season was too far advanced to have the work started and I would be pleased to be advised if this authority will be approved during the coming fiscal year.\n\nJ. Waite,\nIndian Agent.\nApril 28, 1948.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd ultimo, regarding the painting of the teacher's residence on the Fairford Reserve, in your letter you stated that you were forwarding the quantities of paint required. This was not received.\n\nThe cost of labour appears high. Would it not be possible to have the painting done at a lower cost?\n\nWith reference to drilling the well, the same authority is given as was in our letter of last year.\n\nBernard F.

Neary\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI just returned from the Fairford Reserve, and on checking over the buildings, I found that the new teacher's residence at Lower Fairford School was sinking in the middle causing the partition to come away from the floor about 1/2 inches. Also, there is a leak in the roof. I believe this was caused by water getting into the basement, the building not having any eavestroughs.\n\nI have ordered eavestroughs to be put on the school at once, and also for Mr. Helgesson from Ashern to come up and repair the building before it gets any worse. The cost of this should not be very great.\n\nI will be forwarding accounts for this at a later date, and hope my actions meet with your approval.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Affairs\n\nIndian Affairs.

Davis,\nRegional Supervisor Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWINNIPEG, Manitoba.\n\nDear Mr. Davis-\n\nWe attach hereto a Requisition for school\nResidence furniture and items for the Fairford Indian Day\nSchool, Mrs Dora E Olds, Teacher.\n\nApparently, this is a large residence, and\nMrs Olds has requested many items not on the standard list\nfor one-room day school residences.\n\nWe have omitted from her list several items,\nsuch as chairs, 2 complete bed sets, she ordered 3, bath\ntub, etc., If there are several rooms now required, there\nshould be no need to furnish them. However Miss Olds has\nprobably, people staying with her, and we feel that they\nshould look after their own requirements. We trust though,\nthat the items listed on the requisition will be allowed to\nstand to make the residence reasonably well furnished, keeping\nin mind the standard allowed.\n\nWe are attaching her letter herewith (copy)\nand also listed the items omitted from her list at the end\nof the requisition.\n\nYours very truly\n\nR.L.Bewell,\nSuperintendent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of a number of reports upon the schools of the Northern part of Lake Winnipeg, and must say that the school educational work is not generally carried on very satisfactorily, whilst there are very great defects of a more material nature.\n\nPisshar River. The complaint here is that up to lately and for a year past insufficient teachers have been in charge. With the large population to be found at this point, it seems essential that a well qualified and permanent teacher should be employed.\n\nBerens River. Here there is a fine building and good chances of a fair attendance, but since last June either through the absence of a teacher, or the presence of measles, or even when a teacher was in charge, the school has been practically closed right along. True the grant has not been paid, but little good can be effected unless the school is continually kept open.\n\nPeylar River. At this point there appears to be the need of a new building. Unfortunately we have no funds and it will take some time before provision is made for the purpose.\n\nRev. John McDougall,\nCalgary,\nAlta.\ngranted that same can be carried through the House.\n\nReservoir Bay School. Here the funds are available but nothing very great has been achieved. Part of the lumber has not yet reached the premises and no work has been done and the probabilities are that a part of the $600 voted will lapse.\n\nCross Lake. Up to lately the teachers have been inefficient. This is to be regretted as the population offers fair prospects of success. The building is not in good shape, but nothing can be done by the Department just now.\n\nNorway House Boarding. Here the defects are especially in connection with the buildings; but I am sure you will agree with me that the Department has contributed its full share towards this institution. At present the cellar is full of water and remains that way when a cheap hand pump it could be emptied in a short time. There is no curtain between head of stairs and girls bedroom - this is really such an important matter and the remedy so cheap that one would think this trouble should never have existed. The accommodation is very cramped and several rooms are needed - at the same time the Principal's family live in the building which, besides the room they occupy, is otherwise objectionable.\n\nI think that it is the duty of the Methodist Missionary Society to remedy matters at an early date.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) D. Laird,\nIndian Commissioner.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to inform you that the schools of the Berens River Agency have been found by Mr. Indian Agent Semmens to give on the whole very little satisfaction, as you will judge yourself by the reports forwarded.

It would not, however, consent to such a change unless it would be in the interests of the Indians and not the teacher herself. If the Indians are on the reserve during these months and absent at some other time of the year, it might be well to change the holiday season accordingly.\n\nBefore finally deciding the matter the Department would like to have a report from you.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

You spoke of having decided to give me a grant of $50. I am not going to teach this year. I would like to know if I get this increase or will my successor benefit by my hard work?\n\nYou asked for a report of my work at Fisher River, suggestions to improve the school.\n\nI might say that the \"Indian\" was an entirely new subject to me when I went to Fisher River two years ago.\n\nI found the children very reserved but not stupid.\n\nIn fact I may say I found some of these children (especially boys) what you might term brilliant.\n\nI endeavoured to engage them in\nEnglish conversation as much as possible and I found much improvement during my stay.\n\nThe Indian children are very easily disciplined.\n\nThey are excellent writers and drawers. If something could be done to interest the parents it would be a great encouragement to the teacher.\n\nI think the Dept. should pass some kind of a law compelling the parents to send their children to school. I had 47 children on the roll out of 58 but some days I would have 5 present and probably 32 the next. Now a teacher cannot do perfect work with the attendance so irregular.\n\nIf I take a school next year I would be quite willing to take up sewing and gardening. In fact I tried to interest some of them at Fisher River along the line of a school garden. I also asked to have the school ground fenced in but\nthere was no fence when I left.\n\nPlease answer and let me know if that $50.00 is mine.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nMarie C. Demers,\nLachute Mills,\nQue.\nOttawa, July 12, 1910.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant in which you advise the Department of your resignation as teacher of the Fisher River school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is regretted that you had not previously intimated your intention to resign so that the question of appointing a successor could have at once been taken up.\n\nYour remarks with regard to the aptitude of the children have been noted with much interest and there is no doubt good results would have been attained had you remained at the school.\n\nAs to the increase granted you on the 1st of April last, I beg to say that you will be paid at the rate of $350.00 from that date and can, of course, only draw the portion of the increase earned during the three months.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMiss Maude C.

However, to get properly qualified teachers for such positions, that are so isolated it will be necessary to raise the salary to $500 and in some cases more. You know any lady teacher can command $60 per month in our ordinary country schools.\n\nIn the mean time I have written asking our missionary Rev. M. Stevens to take charge until I can secure one. I have not heard from him as to his decision. I am writing to see Miss Hayley who was at Stevens River. She has not replied definitely.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6233, file 511-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI am thankful of receiving an answer of my letter. And I am thanking the Indian Department of looking after our Roads and Bridges in our Reserve and also other things of our welfare.\n\nAnd now about our School, our day School was closed about the 15th of May and the day is still closed. We have the control of this School in the Indian Department or in Chiefs or Ministers. These last 2 years School was carried on fairly good but formally the School has very much neglected very bad. Sometimes was closed 4 or 5 months in the year, and they are doing just the same again.\n\nOn the Bank of Robe River\n\nIndian Affairs.

We in the Chief's Council, our chief is not fit for his position as chief he does not work to pass us to get our land we would like to get better land who would encourage us to improve we are anyone & do better every year.\n\nSo we will look for an answer to those who is the head of this school affair.\n\nAnd also our School House the School building is too far from some of our people, they have to run 3 miles for their dinner before they reach the school are late and are punished. So some of our people are taking up lands at about 4 mile further from the school.

Surely some person is to blame for this state of things. Meantime the Indian children are the losers.\n\nI took a photograph of this School Building and inclose it.\n\nIt is rumored that the Department is proposing to make it a semi-boarding School. In this case some addition must be made at the rear of the present building in which a kitchen and a dining room could be placed with a door cut through the back of the School to connect the same with the present room.\n\nIf the Department desires to take action I shall be glad to prepare plans and cost estimates for a guide in making these improvements.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nIndian Affairs.

If you can obtain a capable teacher with professional qualifications the Department will allow a minimum salary of $500.00 per annum. This is a reserve where there is an opportunity to have a successful day school and it is hoped that you will be able to nominate someone for the position without any further loss of time. In your letter you mentioned that you had asked Rev. Mr. Stevens to take charge until a teacher could be secured, but a communication just received from Rev. Inspector Samsen shows that the school was not in operation at the end of October.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nSupt., Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nLake Winnipeg Inspectorate\n\nInspectors Office\n\nWinnipeg November 26th 1910\n\n376274\n\nIn reply to your letter No 118277/1 of November 18\n1910 you say that the Department would be glad to\nhave my views as to the desirability of making pro-\nvision for the giving of a mid-day meal at the Fish-\ner River Day School.\n\nBefore saying anything in reply I must call the\nattention of the Department to a Report of mine on\nthe question of a School for the Peguis Reserve sent\nto Ottawa on the 22nd inst. This has reference\nto the whole situation at Fisher River and it must\nbe understood that anything which I may have said\nthere takes preference over this.\n\nIn this letter I am simply answering your\nquery in the letter quoted above and am just speaking\nof things as they are today and as they might be\nat a given place under other conditions. I am by no\nmeans abandoning the idea of the Boarding School at\nFisher River which as I said before would do away\nwith Day Schools in this locality.\n\nIn speaking of a Mid-day meal the first consid-\neration is a suitable kitchen and dining room where\nthe meal could be prepared and eaten without distur-\nbing the routine of School work.\n\nThe Kitchen should not be less than 10 x 10 in\nsize. The Dining Room should be 12 x 15 at least.\nThat is to say you want a building 12 feet broad\nand 25 feet long to be divided up into kitchen\npantry and dining room.\n\nThen you will have to consider who shall do the\ncooking and whether house room must be provided for\nthe person who prepares the meals takes care of materials and keeps the place clean. If such a person were married and had no family possibly we might consider them in planning the new building so as to make room for them over head. That is to say again that an upstairs might be added when we were constructing the building for the accommodation of the cook who if a woman could not live alone in the place.\n\nThis then will give us a basis from which to calculate the cost of the necessary building. I write this down as likely to cost $375.00\n\nNext comes the cost of furnishing the place providing tables, chairs, dishes, cooking utensils, cook-stove, table cloths, towels and fuel. This would cost us in the neighbourhood of $800.00\n\nThen comes the cost of Provisions for say thirty hearty youngsters every day. The cost at the Lumber Camps of a single meal is 10 cents. The number of School days in the year is say 216. The average attendance if a meal be given might be twenty. This gives us a simple calculation like this:\n\n\\[ \\text{20 Scholars at 10 cents per day equals } 2.00 \\\\\n\\$2.00 \\text{ multiplied by 216 days in year equals the astonishing sum of } \\$432.00 \\text{ for the school days of the year} \\]\n\nNext is the salary of the cook which at the low sum of $1.00 per day is $216.00. If it be suggested that the Teacher can do this without extra salary I for one would not take such a proposition seriously. Not one in forty Teachers could or would do it.\n\nIt is likely that wood and water might be provided by the children without cost.\n\nThe wear and tear would not be great if the right sort of dishes and utensils were provided.\nNow let us put these charges together:\n\nBuilding $375.00\nFurnishings $200.00\nProvisions $432.00\nSalary-Cook $216.00\n\nCost $1223.00 For the first year or for each succeeding year say for provisions and Cook only $648.00\n\nThe next question that comes to one is how many extra children can be drawn to the School in this way and on this point I am confident that there would be a large increase possibly so great that you would have to build a new school somewhere to take the overflow away and then add another kitchen at proportionate expense.\n\nIt would seem to me to be an immensely popular idea and every Reserve would demand similar privileges and the expense of extension on these lines would be enormous.\n\nIf we were to have two such establishments in Old Fisher River and there are children enough for that then the yearly expense there would be $1296.00 Then do the same in Peguis at each end of the Reserve and we have $2592.00 as against a Boarding School expense of 40 pupils at $72.00 or $2880.00 but the Boarding School would be an all day and every day School and twice the work could be done at nearly the same expense.\n\nSo far as I see it there is much in the proposition to commend. It is decidedly creditable to the heart of the man who suggested it. It would indeed be a boon to the children who attend school. It would no doubt popularize the Department and attract many pupils. The only question in the case is that of expense. It would be easy to make a start in the new direction but hard to tell where it would land us.\n\nI have the honor to be\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nThe Secretary\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, in duplicate, giving your views as to the desirability of giving a mid-day meal at the Fisher River school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you apparently have a wrong conception of the wishes of the Department in this respect. In a great many of our schools a simple lunch is now being given and in most cases prepared in the school-room by the teacher. In the experience of the Department there has never been a refusal on the part of a teacher to prepare this meal with the aid of the older girls, on the contrary most of them have taken hold of the scheme with a great deal of enthusiasm and with splendid results. The proposal is not to furnish a full meal, but rather to supplement the lunches brought by the children. Where possible beef is supplied and soup made and where this cannot be done bacon, beans, rice and tea are given along with the usual biscuit ration. It is expected that a new teacher will be secured for this school at an early date and when one is appointed this matter will be again taken up.

This year the enrollment is at present 82 and the prospective enrollment, by Christmas time 85. The average attendance for September was 81.\n\nIt requires that 5 different classes shall be kept going all the time in addition to something for the smallest children.\n\nI would like to enquire whether it is not possible to obtain some additional salary recognition for the work that I have to do. I may be permitted to add that I am doing all I can to increase the attractiveness of the schoolroom, and the school life, and have organized for the children such things as sewing and singing classes outside of school hours.

A larger and new building is greatly needed there, and I would respectfully recommend that a school with a class room be built so that an assistant teacher could have charge of the junior grades. I should think for this an ex-pupil from the Brandon Industrial school would be able to give the teacher valuable assistance for a small salary. I am of the opinion that such assistance in the Fisher River school is necessary, the attendance there being a large one and the work for one person being too hard. If this does not meet with the approval of the Department it would seem that Miss Royan's request for an increase of her salary to be a reasonable one.\n\nI respectfully submit the matter for the judgement of the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be your obedient servant,\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nIndian Affairs.

There is a large attendance of pupils at this school, varying in number from 65 to 80, with an average attendance of about 41. Miss Royan is a qualified teacher with twelve years' experience previous to her entering on Indian school work. This school is conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church and Rev. Mr. Ferrier, in the list of salaries he requested for the various day schools conducted under the auspices of that church, only asked for a salary of $500.00 for the teacher of this school. As Miss Royan, however, has such a large attendance and as this is one of the largest day schools in Manitoba, I would recommend that she be granted an increase in salary of $50.00 per year.\n\nThe Agent brings up the question of providing a larger\nlarger school building, which, he states, is greatly needed on this reserve. Mr. Ferrier also made the same request a short time ago and he was informed that this matter would receive consideration.

The attitude of the Methodist Missionary has been on several occasions such as to make her work more difficult and this last intervention seems to make it impossible for her to retain self-respect and continue as teacher after this year, seeing that she must be a member of Mr. Stevens's household if she remains. The work she has been able to do seems to me of such value to the Indian community that her departure would be a misfortune. Would it be possible to so define the teacher's position in relation to the resident missionary in an authoritative communication to her as to protect her from possible recurrence of such unpleasant\nincidents?

The Chief stated that the fathers of children punished had said that if the teacher continued his cruelty they would take it upon themselves to chastise the Teacher, and that many parents would not send their children to school so long as Mr Stevens was a teacher.\n\nI warned the Chief and Councillor, and impressed it upon them that they must notify their people that they must refrain from any act of violence and that the matter would be investigated.\n\nThe Teacher denies having punished the children too severely and exhibited a small strap with which he states the chastisement was given.

Perrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa, December 1, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th ultimo in regard to certain complaints made by the Chief and Councillor of the Fisher River Band of severe punishment inflicted on the children attending the Fisher River School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Rev. Mr. Perrier has been written to on the subject and as soon as his report is received you will be further advised. In the meantime be good enough to inform the Indians that the matter is being inquired into and that they should take no retaliatory action, as, if their statements are correct, a change of teachers will be made. The Department would like to know your opinion in regard to the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nT. H. Carter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHodgson P.O., Man.\nTo The Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI received yours of the 1st, #116277/1, and also Mr. Carter's report of Nov. 15th, which you enclosed, and the following is my reply.\n\nWhen looking for teachers to fill vacancies at mid-summer, I had no guarantee nor assurance that the new school at Fisher River was going to be ready for occupation at an early date. It appeared to be doubtful whether it would be ready before Christmas, as the Department is probably aware, it was opened on the 15th of November. I endeavored to get a male teacher for the Senior room who would be a suitable person to look after and supervise both of the rooms, but while I had several applications, none did not appear to be one that was just suitable for that particular position. In the meantime, Mr. Carter's daughter had written me asking for the position of Junior teacher. I may say that his daughter has a professional teacher's certificate, and I have every reason to believe that she is a good teacher, having taught in other schools. She is about 25 years of age. So I accepted her application to take charge of the Senior room.\n\nIn the meantime, the Rev. Mr. Stevens' son, W.G. Stevens, who has taken up the Junior and Senior Matriculation work in Winnipeg schools, applied for the position, and not being sure just how long the Junior teacher's services were needed until we had given the matter a trial, I engaged him. It was felt that two teachers will be required between April and the summer holidays.\n\nNow as to the trouble that has arisen, I find on enquiry that there are just two boys that have been troublesome, and they have been troublesome to other teachers and as soon as Mr. Stevens took charge he deliberately set to work to interrupt the school and defy authority. These two boys were punished with a strap about 20 inches long and a little heavier than an ordinary skate strap. It was on the hands, and with such an instrument could not be called severe and cruel. The Chief and Councilors were informed of this, and so far as they are concerned he was punished more severely if they continued as they had done.\n\nI understand that there has been no trouble since that date, and that, at the present time, things are moving along very pleasantly. The school is well attended and none are staying away on account of the fracas.\nI talked this matter over with Mr. Carter and Rev. Mr. Stevens and pointed out to them that if I took any steps whatever to remove either of the teachers on such a slight pretext, it would neither be just nor proper and it would be difficult to keep order and discipline in the future, inasmuch as the Chief and Council would consider that all they had to do was to kick up a fuss and the teacher would be dismissed.\n\nThese engagements are for the present fiscal year. I have not seen the building, but I understand that there is room for a married man to live in it. This being the case, we will endeavor to have a suitable man to take charge after June. In order to do this, a salary of at least $1000 per year will have to be provided for the same and an additional grant of $500 for the Junior teacher.\n\nAs Mr. Carter stood by his report, the school has been running smoothly and handled effectively, and good progress has been made during the past 3 or 4 years. I think we will be safe in assuming that there will be no break in this record, but that it will rather be increased on account of a better building and more hopeful signs for the future.\n\nIn the meantime, we have two smart, bright persons in charge and the school seems to be moving along nicely, and it is to be hoped we will have no further trouble.\n\nTrusting that this explanation will be satisfactory,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT.F./M.O.E\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6233, file 511-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nPlease return to schools\n\nMr Benson\n\nPlease see me\n\na + b\nReferring to your letter No. II8277/I. of the last instant, relative to the complaint of severe punishment inflicted upon the children of the Fisher River Day school, by the teacher, Mr. W. Stevens, I respectfully beg to state that I have delayed my reply until now in order that I might visit Fisher River and obtain more information.\n\nI also beg to state that Mr. Ferrier has sent me a copy of his report upon the matter.\n\nMy opinion is that a very grave mistake was made by placing in charge of a school a youth entirely devoid of training or experience in teaching. The literary attainments of a person, however profound, is no guarantee of the ability to conduct a school, and I can see no reason why duly qualified teachers cannot be obtained for the Fisher River school.\n\nMy daughter, who is at present in charge of the senior room was trained in the Winnipeg Normal school and has had some five years experience in teaching, but she cannot continue at Fisher River longer than about April next, having pre-engaged herself for the more permanent occupation of marriage.\n\nI would strongly recommend that, at any rate not later than the end of the summer term, two trained and experienced teachers be obtained for the Fisher River school.\n\nMr. Ferrier's remarks that $1,500.00 be allowed as salary for these teachers, and that, possibly between April and the summer holidays two teachers will not be required,\nwould appear to be an oversight. $1,000.00 with quarters and fuel is fully equal to the remuneration received by any two trained certificated teachers in the rural schools of the Province of Manitoba, and the attendance during the time referred to should be quite equal to the best at any time of the year.\n\nI quite agree with Mr Ferrier that it would not be wise for the Indians to have the idea that they can have a teacher removed whenever they may happen to wish it, and should think the appointment of two teachers to commence the fall term would settle the whole matter satisfactory to all.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nFisher River Agency.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nTo the Indian Department Ottawa\n\nSir,\n\nThe undersigned Chief Macmillan on behalf of the Band held a meeting to consider about our, one of our School teachers of our Crew School, the Son of our Amulet William Stephen age 16 years.

They would be preferable to a married man and his wife or to young, inexperienced male teachers and there should not be much difficulty in securing competent lady teachers at the salary the Department is prepared to pay, as there is excellent accommodation provided.

Ferrier had been asked to attend to this matter and they replied that Mr Ferrier would not believe anything that the people might state, that about six years ago they had asked Mr Ferrier to remove Mr Stevens, but Mr Ferrier had informed them that he would not, and that all that the Missionary stated was accepted but that the people were not listened to.\n\nThere is no doubt something to be said for both sides, but I would respectfully urge that the proposal contained in your letter of January 12th, last, that two lady teachers be appointed and required to board themselves in the quarters provided, be strictly insisted upon.\n\nCouncillor\nCouncillor Cochrane said that Mr Stevens had stated that he, Mr Stevens was the one who had caused the new school to be built and that he was responsible for the teachers.\n\nAdditional charges were made against the teacher, Mr W.

There are children available and everything would point to a successful school, if we were fortunate in our selection of teachers.\n\nI hope, therefore, that you will be able, without much further delay, to nominate two competent lady teachers for this school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Miss Higginbotham was away to have her teeth attended to in Winnipeg and Miss Gibson conducted all the classes during her absence. The attendance at this school is very poor considering the number of pupils of school age in the reserve.\nOttawa, February 6th, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nIn your monthly report for January, it is noted that you visited the Fisher River day school and found that the attendance is very poor.\n\nAs you are, no doubt, familiar with conditions on this reserve, the Department considers that you should be able to devise means for increasing the attendance.\n\nThe advantage of education should be pointed out to the Indians and they should be encouraged both by the teacher and yourself to send their children to school regularly. They might also be warned that if they do not comply, the compulsory sections of the regulations will have to be enforced.\n\nThe Department trusts that by means of your earnest cooperation the attendance at this school will improve in the near future, and will expect a report from you as soon as you have an opportunity of taking up this important matter.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nT.H.

I drew attention to the poor attendance and impressed it upon the Headmen that the apparent indifference and lack of appreciation was far from encouraging and that the education which could be derived from the facilities provided would be of great value to their children in the future.\n\nI also warned them that if the attendance of the children of school age did not improve the neglected children would have to be committed to an Industrial School.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nSir,\n\nAfter the election of a chief and three councillors at Fisher River reserve on the 21st inst., I had a talk with these new officials of the band.\n\nThe New Chief is Joseph Everett, a very sensible and industrious man, so far as I have known him. The Councillors elected are Daniel Cochran, John Thomas Cochran and David Rundle, these with the old life councillor Henry Constable, make up the full council. The election was orderly, and the selection of the men elected, was most definite.\n\nThe chief in his remarks spoke of the school, and he desired that the school should kept open according to regulations, and in accordance with the wishes of his people. In this regard, he stated that he was sorry that the school had been closed so early this summer. He also promised to give his duties careful attention, without neglecting his personal obligations to his family. I commended him for his sensible and common sense address. He was followed by his new councillors, in the same strain of expression. They all intimated that they desired good teachers, and that they would do all to have good attendance. Mr. Ferrier was present and heard this, and their full remarks.\n\nThey asked for a team of oxen, this I promised to submit, intimating that during war times, their wants would have to be very carefully considered, as there was not much money to provide these things.\n\nThey spoke of assistance in looking after roads, I\nI told them that it would not be possible to expect this for old and established roads or bridges, but if any new roads were needed, and absolutely necessary, the Department might again consider the matter, but again the war conditions made this a very difficult matter, and this would be so, for the whole period of the war.\n\nLieut Joseph Jones made an appeal for men to go to the front, with #2 Forestry Company, the Indians did not take this in a favorable way at first. I told them of the war, and asked them to seriously think this matter over, the work of such a company would be most useful, and they were men who could do much for the cause in using their skill to assist in this way. I might now say that some of the young men of this band have made the supreme sacrifice, and there are a number of others in the fighting line. I am hopeful that they will respond, in some measure, to the appeal made.\n\nThis covers the matters brought forward at this meeting, and the manner in which they were handled.\n\nAs to the opening and closing of the school, I have treated that in my letter, of this date, dealing with the school building, its condition, and school matters in general.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nExtract from letter from Inspector Bunnin reference to the Fisher River School, dated June 28th, 1917.

So far this resolution has not received the acknowledgment of the Department.\n\nAfter the meeting of the Band I asked the teachers of the Fisher River School if they had any intention of closing the school before the end of the June month and was informed that they had bargained to teach the Fisher River School for 200 days and as this amount would be reached about the 8th of June the teachers were expecting to leave about that date.\n\nThe school returns for the quarter ended June 30th will show that the Fisher River School was closed on June 10th, last.\n\nI do not know why or by whose authority the Fisher River School was closed at the time stated, but I do know that the attitude of the teachers was strongly indicative that they considered they were not under the management of the Department or its officials and as I have had occasion to many times refer to the drawback to efficient or smooth running of the Fisher River School, I feel diffident about making any further reference to the matter lest I be judged to have a grudge or ill-feeling.\n\nI pointedly asked Miss Gibson if Mr Steven's conversation...\nhad the tendency to prejudice her against the Indians, the Department and its officials and was informed that it had most decidedly, and that also both Mr and Mrs Stevens had stated that the teachers were mostly responsible to the Missionary in charge.\n\nIt would appear to be necessary to thoroughly instruct the next teachers of the Fisher River School as to their duties and whose instructions they should follow in all matters pertaining to the proper management of the school.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nFisher River Agency.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nAt a meeting of the Fisher River Council, held at The Halfway on the 24th instant the following resolution was passed:\n\n\"Moved by Councillor D.Cochran, seconded by Chief Everett, that the Department be asked to supply teachers for the Fisher River School immediately as the school was closed on June 5th last.\"\n\nCarried.\n\nI advised the Council that I was of the opinion that a teacher would be in charge at the commencement of the next month and by the time this resolution would reach the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be your obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\nFisher River Agency.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada,\nExtract of letter received from Rev.

Mr. Bunn took a list of furniture that would be required to make it at least habitable for a couple of lady teachers. I am engaging Miss Menzies and Miss Follett to take charge of the school for the coming year. Both are excellent women for this type of work. Miss Follett taught our junior room in this institute for about seven years. She is a first class teacher for Indian children. I have engaged them with the understanding that this furniture would be supplied by the Department. School will be opened next Monday.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd. T.

This school is in the Little River Reserve (and as you know) accommodation for teachers is provided in the building.\n\nNow there are sundry things provided for the use & scholars such as pails, wash bowls, cups & soap etc. There was an abundant supply of soap and I used several bars of this while there, as I lived in the building.\n\nNow I desire to know if I am right in so doing or is that only for the Indian children? If the latter I will gladly estimate the quantities used, purchased and forward to Little River, as I am also doing, of a small ball & wool I feel...\nI heard in the basement, that is the remainder of it to gather with a full hall to compensate.\n\nWhen I took it I thought no harm; it appeared to be a scrap left over and useless to me, but last week I was obliged to use it so I must return with other supplies and may God preserve me from anything stolen again for I am eager to be rid of it and am eager to return the soap also if I had no right to use it.\n\nThanking you, I am\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Mrs) W.

Taylor has given up her duties as one of the teachers of this school and has been succeeded by Miss Jennie Y. Huntsman. The Department has received no intimation as to change of teachers at this school and you will be good enough to state whether Miss Huntsman was appointed by you and if so, what are her qualifications and the amount of salary which she is to receive.\n\nThe salary due for the September quarter is being withheld until the above information is received from you.

The Department is aware that there have been two teachers at Fisher River. There was not perfect harmony between them; it was thought best to make a change. On account of the influenza epidemic it is quite likely that no one will be able to manage all right for the balance of the school year, and I do not think any serious effect will result from this arrangement for a short time. The people may ask for the second teacher and if so it might be well for the Department to suggest to them that one is quite able to finish for this year. Miss Huntsman is a Second-class Professional teacher and is doing excellent work.\n\nMiss Menzies will be entitled to the balance of the war bonus inasmuch as she continues in the service.\n\nTrusting that this will be satisfactory to the Department, I remain\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndustrial School, Brandon.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Her salary and war bonus will be paid her as teacher of the Fisher River school until the 31st ultimo. The balance of the bonus will be paid her at Kishpiox at the end of the March quarter if she continues in the service. Her salary will be continued at the same rate as was paid her at Fisher River.\n\nIt is noted that you consider that one teacher will be sufficient to carry on the work at Fisher River until the end of the current school year, namely, June 30th next.\n\nMr. Agent Carter will be informed accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nRev.

The ordinary academic year has 200 teaching days. On the Quarterly Report, \"Instructions to Teachers\" it reads, \"All authorized holidays will be paid for.\"\n\nDoes this mean that legal holidays e.g., Good Friday, Labor Day, and such, if coming on a school day and observed, will be paid for?\n\nAlso where schools are more than 30 miles from a railway station and difficult to reach does the Dept make any slight allowance of time, that is does the Dept require the teacher to commence and end exactly on time regardless to say the distance.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nH.G. Mingay\nOttawa, March 15, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant regarding the holidays allowed during each school year.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that all Indian day schools are required to be kept open not less than two hundred days in each year, except the Roman Catholic schools, which are allowed five days extra holidays as days of obligation. It is considered that there is no call for all holidays, there is ample time in each year to teach the required number of days, and, in order to draw the full yearly salary, teachers of day schools should teach the required number of days. The Department makes no provision to allow extra leave for teachers who live at a distance from the school in which they teach to travel to and from their homes during vacations.\n\nA copy of the Indian Day School Regulations is enclosed herewith for your information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Ferrier,\nBrandon, Man.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nI am writing to you in regard to my salary as teacher here. I am going to ask you for an increase of a hundred and fifty dollars on the fixed salary of seven hundred dollars, which, plus the bonus, would bring the total salary to one thousand dollars.\n\nMy reason for doing this is the increase in the cost of living since last autumn. This is greatly augmented here by high freight rates as we are so far from the railroad. It is impossible for a married man to keep things going on the present salary plus bonus. One cannot live under a thousand dollars per year.\n\nI honestly think my work is worth this increase. And again, living so far from town or city should make the salary more attractive than that of the ordinary school, which, however, is not the case. You will probably have noticed the increases which have been granted to the teachers in the ordinary schools. Quite recently I was offered a good school in the Province by the Dept. of Education but rather than accept I determined first to ask you about an increase in salary.\n\nI trust you will see fit to forward this to the Indian Department with any recommendation you may see fit to add.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nH.G. Mingay\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nRegarding the request made by H. G. Mingay, teacher of the Fisher River Indian Band School, to the Rev. T. Ferrier for an increase of $150.00 in his present salary I beg to say that Mr. Mingay began duties at this school on August 20th, 1918, with salary at the rate of $700.00 per annum, and his wife was appointed assistant teacher at a salary of $600.00 per annum.\n\nMr. Mingay is a returned soldier. He completed his second year in Arts at Toronto University, but has never taught school before. Mrs. Mingay has Ontario Normal Entrance and was in her first year in Arts at Queen's. She has had two and a half years' experience in white schools in the Province of Ontario. There are 75 pupils enrolled at this school, with an average of 35.\n\nMr. Ferrier informed me that Mr. Mingay was greatly interested in his work and was making a success as teacher and that he would be very sorry to lose his services.\n\nAt present the combined salaries and bonus received by Mr. and Mrs. Mingay amount to $1600.00. Mr. Mingay personally is receiving the highest salary paid to teachers in the Indian schools in Manitoba. We pay as high as $800.00 to several teachers in British Columbia. Mr. Armstrong strongly recommended that an increase be granted, and I would advise, in order to retain the services of the Mingays at this school, that he be granted an increase of $100.00, making his salary $800.00 per annum, and that such increase date from the first of April, next.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hope to hear from you soon.\n\nYours truly,\nDaniel Cochran.\nI heard honorable David Laird Indian Commissioner said when the Indian Chiefs ask him why their children could not be taught soon he said it is your fault because you take your child into as soon as he is 18 years of age because he said the Department is willing to help your child to go to high school for four years after he leaves the day school so I talk to you as a father and I humbly ask if it is possible that our children would be taught so they can compete with our white brother, we are too far behind we do not want to beg all the time so we can see it is going to happen.\nOttawa, May 12, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant in regard to the higher education of Indian children.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department regrets that it cannot provide a grant for the education of your daughter at a high school, as it has no funds available for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

The Department would like to have a full report from you in regard to this matter. It is considered that a pupil sixteen years of age is not too old to attend a day school, and this girl should be allowed to attend the Fisher River School, unless there are some very good reasons to the contrary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.

(RG 10, Volume 6233, file 511-1, part 1)\nReferring to your letter No. 118277/1 of the 12th ultimo requiring information as to the correctness of a report received from Daniel Cochrane of the Fisher River Band to the effect that he has a girl over fifteen years of age who was told that she could not attend school next year, I respectfully beg to state that the teacher Mr. H.G. Mingay has informed me that the girl who is fifteen is still attending the Fisher River Day School, but the other two girls of Daniel Cochrane, he has discharged as Mr. Mingay states they have been at a standstill for some time, taking attention that could be more profitably given to others.\n\nMr. Mingay reports in writing as follows:\n\n\"In reference to the children of Daniel Cochrane I might say that when I took the school I found three girls of Mr. Cochrane in attendance. On consulting birth registers of the Mission and comparing these with old registers at the school I found their ages to be 15-16 and 16\u00bd respectively. I discharged the girl who was eighteen and the other girl attended all winter. After the year's work was covered and the girl was over seventeen I discharged her as I did not wish to renew the work with her. She had been in the same form for three years. I gave my attention to the advancement of a junior class. The last girl completed her fifteenth birthday and attended school the whole year.\"\n\nSigned\n\nH.G.

It is thought she will comply with the discipline of the school and show an interest in her studies. It is considered, however, that the two other girls are too old to attend the day school, as the attention that would be given by the teacher to them could be more profitably given to the younger pupils. You will be good enough to inform Daniel Cochrane accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. W. Carter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Halfway P.O., Man.\nDear Sir:\n\nJust before I left the school at Fisher River, Mr. Reid Carter showed me a letter from you to the effect, that if Mrs. Mingay and myself were leaving the school at the end of the year would we please forward our resignation.\n\nI might say I am not going to teach at Fisher River next year but intend to get more professional work for the reason, and that Mrs. Mingay's health was not too good we have come out for a year.\n\nWe liked the work and rather than resign would prefer a year leave of absence without salary of course so that we are normally civil servants. If this could be done will you kindly let us know?\n\nIf you have any particulars regarding the new Indian Act I would very much like to have one by new address as above.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nH. E. Mingay,\nTreasurer of Fisher River,\nManitoba.\nOttawa, July 29, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 2nd instant, which only reached the Department yesterday, requesting that a year's leave of absence without salary be granted to Mrs. Mingay and yourself, as it is not your intention to resume duty at the Fisher River Indian Day School next year.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this school is conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church, and the nomination of teachers for Methodist schools is in the hands of the Rev. T. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools. It might be well next year, if you and Mrs. Mingay wish to return to the work as teachers in an Indian school, to communicate with Mr. Ferrier.\n\nThe new Indian Act is in the hands of the printer and has not yet been received. Your request for a copy has been noted and as soon as they are received a copy will be sent you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. G. Mingay, Esq.,\nR. R.

Carter Esq.,\nHalfway P.O., Man.\n\nSir;\n\nAllow me to draw your attention to a requisition for school supplies that was forwarded some time ago.\n\nI sent the requisition in ample time for a return of the supplies from Ottawa before the people returned from their fall fishing. Up to date no word has been received from the Department of Indian Affairs re the same, and as a result I am seriously\nHandicapped through scarcity of material, especially the first readers. I have over 30 children that I cannot supply with books, and my requisition was prepared to cover this situation.\n\nI regret also that the Department does not consider musical exercises as fundamental. When assuming her duty here Mrs Hough was recommended especially because of her ability to handle this phase of the work and it is disappointing for her to find no instrument to assist her in this. We would appreciate it very much if you would use your influence with the Department to procure an instrument suitable for this work.\n\nI would also suggest a more considerate remuneration for the caretaker. He is not\ngiving sufficient time to the school and complains that he cannot afford to do so under the present conditions. I feel that he is justified in his attitude and strongly advise rectifying the situation.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nyour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6233, file 511-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSir,\n\nI respectfully beg to submit herewith a letter received from the teacher of the Fisher River Day School.\n\nI have gone over with Mr Donagh the matters mentioned therein and have advised him that the supplies he is expecting would perhaps be at the Hodgson Express Office and I have requested the mail-carrier to be good enough to call for the supplies and freight to Mr Donagh at Fisher River.\n\nIn reference to a musical instrument for the Fisher River School Mrs Donagh would prefer a piano, but I pointed out that the distance from Winnipeg would entail great difficulty and expense for the services of a tuner which would be frequently required, and suggested that an organ would be more suitable for the Fisher River School. I would submit this request for your consideration and would recommend that an organ be supplied.\n\nIn the matter of the remuneration of the Janitor I am quite in accord with the views expressed by Mr Donagh; there being considerable work in connection with the Fisher River School and it cannot be expected the janitor will give the amount of time required for this work at his present pay.\n\nIn talking over with Mr Donagh matters of a general character pertaining to the School and grounds etc I advised that consideration of requests made for things extra to ordinary requirements would be much more likely to receive favour if the intention of the teachers was for a permanent service with a due interest.\n\nI regret to state that Mr Donagh feels that his attainments which qualify him for high school work, are wasted to a considerable extent at Fisher River and that he does not expect to stay at Fisher River longer than the end of the June quarter.\n\nI have the honour to be your obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent,\nFisher River Agency.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, November 5, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo enclosing a communication from W. T. Donagh, principal of the Fisher River Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say with reference to the school supplies asked for that a requisition reached the Department on the 28th of September and as you were advised by letter of following date, the articles considered necessary were ordered from the Government Stationery Office to be forwarded to the teacher's address. Information has been received from the Stationery Office that the sixty scribblers and six blackboard erasers have been sent, while the readers, plasticine, drawing books and weaving material will be forwarded at a later date. The Stationery Office is now being requested to endeavour to have all the supplies asked for forwarded as soon as possible.\n\nWith reference to the musical instrument asked for I beg to say that the Department does not provide pianoes nor organs for Indian schools.\n\nWith reference to the salary of the caretaker I beg to say that $100.00 per annum is allowed for this work. This is as high a salary as is paid caretakers of two roomed schools. If the present caretaker will not perform the duties for that amount, you should endeavour to obtain the services of a competent person who will.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. S. Williams\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nT. H. Carter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Halfway P.O., Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6233, file 511-1, part 1)\nOttawa, January 10, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nThe attention of the Department has been drawn to the poor attendance of Indian children at the Fisher River Indian Day School. The average attendance as shown by the returns received during the last year is less than fifty per cent of the enrolment. There does not seem to be any reason why all the children in good health should not attend regularly. The Department has been under considerable expense in the past year in repairs and improvements at this school and good educational facilities are provided and the Indian parents should take advantage of the same and see that their children derive full benefit by regular attendance.\n\nYou will, therefore, be good enough to inform the parents that it is expected that their children of school age and in good health will attend regularly each day school is open. If, after due notice is given, any of the parents refuse or neglect to see that their children attend, steps will be taken in the case of the worst offenders to have their children sent to the Brandon Industrial School, or to a residential school of the religious denomination to which the parents belong. The Department will expect you to give your attention to the matter of attendance at this school and you will, therefore, inform the teacher a list of those children who do not attend regularly and at a later date inform the Department, when the question of placing such delinquent children in residential schools will receive consideration and you will be advised as to the steps you should take in the matter. You will, therefore, inform the parents that the Department must insist on a more regular attendance at this school and, if they neglect this warning, their children will be sent to a residential school. Be good enough to give this matter your earnest attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. H. Carter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Halfway P.O., Man.\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nI respectfully beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 136-2-I of the 10th instant relative to a report sent the Department about the attendance of children at the Fisher River Day School.\n\nA number of Indian families have removed further up the Fisher River in order to take advantage of better lands; the children of these families are considerably over 2\u00bd miles from the school and sometimes reside with friends near to the school.\n\nThe attendance of these children is consequently irregular. Several requests for school in the vicinity of these families have been submitted. There are, however, some who neglect to send their children to school who live near to the school and I will at once again notify the parents of children living within reasonable distance from the school as you direct and report to you as desired.\n\nI have the honour to be your obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\nFisher River Agency.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nI can speak in the highest terms of Miss Emily N. Royan, who held the office of Teacher of the Fisher River Day School in the Fisher River Reserve for some time.\n\nShe is an earnest, capable and most successful teacher, obtaining perfect order in a form without harshness, and children work well with her. She takes a great interest in the out-of-school and home life of her pupils. Children are quick to note this and appreciate it.\n\nWhile I cannot do less than testify that Miss Royan is thoroughly capable to carry out the duties of the position she is receiving, I must regret that the Department of Indian Affairs...\nAffairs is losing the services of an efficient and reliable teacher.\n\nSigned -\nJ. H. Carter,\nIndian Agent,\nPiketon River Agency\nDear Sir,\n\nLast week I was making inquiries from Mr. Shields, chief clerk of the Education Committee of Sheffield, Manchester, England, under whom I served for a number of years previous to my teaching on the two reserves, Goshen Point and Norway House.\n\nIt is my intention to take a further examination over here, and Mr. Shields states that I would be exempt from teaching.\nfor same if you would kindly write me a note and address it to the Secretary Board of Education Whitehall London to the effect that I had been teaching for six years and whether my teaching and work in general was satisfactory to the Department. If I may trouble you to send the note on to me I will forward it along with my application to sit for the examination.\n\nI have plenty of English references but my six years teaching in Canada must be accounted for.\n\nI will enclose a copy of Mr Carter's letter so that you may see what he has to say.\n\nInspector Bunn and T.

Tong, teacher of the Fisher River Indian Day School, states in his annual report that the Indian parents are taking great interest in the education of their children and encourage regularity of attendance, and that some of them leave their children with friends while they themselves go away hunting. He recommends that it would greatly encourage the children if a few prizes were given for punctuality and regularity of attendance.\n\nWe have, in the past, allowed a small grant to a few Indian schools for the purpose of purchasing suitable prizes to be distributed to the children before the schools close for the summer holidays. In the case of the Fisher River School we will authorize an amount not to exceed $10.00 in the purchase of books or other articles which may be considered appropriate by the teacher to be given to the children as prizes. You may, therefore, arrange with the teacher for the purchase of books or other articles at a cost not to exceed the above amount.\n\nItemized accounts, in duplicate, should be received, which you will be good enough to attach to proper voucher forms and certify the same and forward to the Department for payment.\n\nThese prizes should be given to the pupils whom the teacher considers should be awarded the same on some day before the school closes for the summer holidays, and the parents and others interested should be present on the occasion of the distribution of these prizes.

Murdock, 2 boys 12 & 14 years, 2 girls 7 & 10 years\n* Alex Hudson, 1 girl 7 years.\n\nAt the present time there are only the 7 children of school age.\n\nOn this Reserve, in the case of boys, when they become the age of 12 & 14 it practically requires a special policeman for each family to get them to school.\n\nAs it is 5 miles from the west boundary of the Fisher River Reserve to the present school, by putting a new school in the centre, the benefit, I do not think, justifies the expense.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nyour obedient servant,\n\nM. McCuish,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 21st, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 15th ultimo, enclosing a petition signed by yourself and the other members of the Fisher River Band requesting the establishment of a day school on the western end of the reserve, I now beg to inform you that after full enquiry having been made, the Department is not prepared to erect a school building, and carry on classroom activities at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nChief Dan Cochrane,\nFisher River Indian Reserve,\nKoostatak, Man.\nOttawa, July 21st, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, regarding the petition of the Fisher River Band for the erection of a new school building on the western end of the reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is considered that there are not sufficient children to warrant the expense that would be necessary in the erection of a building at such a distance from the reserve. The Department is, therefore, not prepared to accede to the wish of the Indians for the establishment of a school on the western end of the reserve at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I wish to assure you that the Department is aware of the distance of some of the homes from the Fisher River Day School. The last report which we have received from Mr. Indian Agent McQuish in this connection indicates that there are not a sufficient number of children to warrant a new school. It is the Department's opinion that the parents who live near the Fisher River Reserve should be advised to apply to have their children educated at an Indian residential school. I should be pleased if you would let me have the names and ages of the children who are living at the western end of the reserve, more than two miles from the present school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6233, file 511-1, part 1)\nof school age and 4 miles from School.\n\nBen Cochrane has five children, three of school age and lives 4\u00bd miles from School.\n\nAlex Hudson has one girl of school age and lives 3 miles from School.\n\nJames Albert Murdoch has five children from 1 year to about 6 and lives 5 miles from the School.\n\nThere are 13 children school age at the present time living over two miles from the School.\n\nTwo others of school age whose home is over two miles from the School are living with their grandparents but may be back at their home at any time.\n\nThese are fourteen houses over two miles from the School, twelve of which are occupied, and, as before, reported the population in this quarter will be increased as the west of the Fisher River is the best from homes and cultivation.\nThe Fisher River Band is very much opposed to sending their children to a residential school and would wish to refer to their treaty which states that, \"a school shall be established and maintained upon the reserve when the Indians shall require.\"\n\nOn behalf of the Fisher River Band I would again ask for a school to be built for the education of the children living over two miles from the school. If this cannot be done then I would ask that a conveyance be provided to bring the children to the present school and take them home in the evening.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nChief.\n\nPhilip Sinclair.\nJohn Thickfoot.\nJim Albert Murdoch.\nOttawa, March 24th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has again been requested by Chief Dan Cochran, of the Fisher River Reserve, to establish a school for the benefit of the Indian children residing at the western end of the Reserve and who live at too great a distance from the present school to attend. The Chief submits the following statement of children of school age residing over two miles from the Fisher River School:\n\n| Name            | Number of Children | Distance from School |\n|-----------------|--------------------|-----------------------|\n| Willie Stevenson| 2                   | 2\u00bd miles              |\n| Fred Amos       | 3                   | 2\u00bd miles              |\n| James Murdock   | 1                   | 4 miles               |\n| William Murdock | 3                   | 4 miles               |\n| Ben Cochran     | 3                   | 4\u00bd miles              |\n| Alex Hudson     | 1                   | 3 miles               |\n\nThe Chief further states that there are several other children who will, in a short time, as they come of age, be available for the school, and that the population in this section of the Reserve will increase, as it is the best part of the Reserve for cultivation. The Chief asks that a school be built for the education of these children, or, if this cannot be done, that a conveyance be provided to take the children to and from the present school.\n\nPlease enquire into this request of the Chief, and furnish a recommendation as to whether you would advise that the expenditure necessary be provided to erect a building and conduct a school on the west end of the Reserve, or whether arrangements could not be made for the transportation of children to the present school. I should be pleased if you could give any information you can regarding the cost of carrying out the suggestions made by you for providing the education of these children on the west end of the Reserve. I may say that the Chief states that the parents are very much opposed to sending their children to a residential school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAas.

(RG 10, Volume 6233, file 511-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter #136-2-1 of the 24th ultimo, with reference to a request made by Chief Dan Cochrane of the Fisher River Band, for a school in the West end of Fisher River Reserve.\n\nI have looked into this matter, and I find the Chief has not stayed within the facts. The Chief gives thirteen children of school age. As a matter of fact, there are only ten, ranging from seven to thirteen years of age. The distance the majority of these children would travel is not as great as the mileage given by the Chief. This school would come up very prominently when times are hard on this reserve to provide work for some of the men on the reserve. There is also a belief among the people on this reserve, that any money that comes from the Department grows on trees.\n\nI have discussed this matter at different times with the missionary on Fisher River Reserve, also with the two teachers at present on the reserve, and we have always come to the conclusion that Fisher River has a first class school, at present large enough to accommodate all the children on the reserve, and with the present school accommodation and arrangements, there is no extra hardship put on the children from the West end, as there are children attending school from the East end who have as far to travel, and not nearly as good a road, among them being Chief Dan Cochrane's children. This not only applies to the Fisher River Reserve, but also to the schools on Peguis Reserve, where we have children attending regularly from a greater distance.\n\nAfter taking all facts into consideration, I cannot recommend any expenditure for the erection of a new school, or the transportation of any children to the present school, as I find to erect, and equip a school would cost a greater amount than $1000.00 and that would be for a log building such as we have on Peguis, which I hope never will be built.\n\nFor transporting the children 200 teaching days at $3.00 per day, would be $600.00.\n\nI am enclosing a list of children, with date of birth, living in the West end of the reserve.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nyour obedient servant,\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nM. McCuish,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 17, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to thank you for your letter of the 7th instant, reporting on the request for a school at the west end of the Fisher River Reserve. I am informing Chief Dan Cochrane that the Department cannot give favourable consideration to his request at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6233, file 511-1, part 1)\nOttawa, April 17, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 12th ultimo, relative to the establishment of a school at the western end of the Fisher River Reserve, I have to inform you that careful enquiries have been made and favourable consideration cannot be given. The present Fisher River school is large enough to accommodate all the children on the reserve and the children living at the west end have more difficulty going to school than have some at the eastern end of the reserve. The cost of transporting the children daily would be so heavy that the expense is not warranted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nChief Can Cochrane,\nFisher River Reserve,\nLootatok P. O.,\nMan.\nI am writing on behalf of the children, under my care, at the Fisher River Indian Day School, Koostatak, to thank you for your most kind and generous consideration in sending a dentist Dr R.H. Murdoch, to attend the dental work on this reserve. It is, to my estimation, a great necessity to have all the children's teeth attended to.\n\nDr Murdoch, before doing any extractions etc examined all the children of the school and found only 4 per cent perfect. By his kindly, courteous and friendly way, he easily won the children over to put confidence in him.\n\nAfter the examination was over, I gave the children a short lecture on the care of the teeth and then asked for volunteers to go to the dentist and in this way kept the dental parlor well supplied with patients until his departure, which was all too soon.\n\nI have 78 children enrolled and only one third of them were able to receive dental treatment, owing to the large amount of work to be done on each child.\n\nUnfortunately, for Dr Murdoch, Treaty payments were on and no children attended for the first 3 or 4 days of his visit.\n\nIt is the great desire of all my pupils, that you be so good as to use your every power, to send Dr Murdoch to this reserve in the near future to finish the good work he has started.\n\nMrs Tong and myself and the pupils of this school thank you most heartily for your kind thoughts for the welfare and health of the children of this reserve.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.G. Tong,\nTeacher i/c\nOttawa, July 10, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 2nd instant, in which you report that satisfactory work has been done by Dr. R. H. Murdoch, the dentist who was sent in by this Department in cooperation with the Manitoba Junior Red Cross. At a later date it may be possible to have him complete the clinic for the pupils of the Fisher River Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. G. Yong, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nFisher River Indian Day School,\nKoostatak, Man.\nIndian children sing of police and friends.\n\nR.C.M.P. check sale of liquor to Fisher River Indians.\n\nUp at Fisher River, the Indian children have a song about the R.C.M.P. who have checked the worst type of criminal\u2014the seller of liquor to the Indians. In a Christmas season letter, the Free Press correspondent at Fisher River tells of the training of the Treaty Indians in Canadian citizenship, mentions the fight against liquor, and sends a copy of the song, the Indian children sing.\n\nI am sure that your readers will be interested in hearing about how the work of training our Treaty Indians in Canadian citizenship is being carried on.\n\nYour readers have been informed from time to time during the last two years as to the efforts of the R.C.M.P. police to put down the traffic in intoxicants among the Indians about and adjacent to Lake Winnipeg. After a long, tedious fight against the vendors of intoxicants\u2014aided by lawyers whose whole effort is to protect criminals\u2014this to their shame\u2014this iniquitous business has been pretty well curtailed. Friends of the Indians are glad and are thankful to the R.C.M.P. police for their good work.\n\nWe know that there are people in Canada who think we have come to the day when the R.C.M.P. should be disbanded but if they lived among Indians or on the edges of civilization\u2014the last frontiers\u2014they would not think so.\n\nRecently Inspector Meads visited Fisher River and we hope he has put the lid on the liquor traffic among the Indians. When here, our school teachers Mr and Mrs W.G. Tong invited him to visit our day school. Indian Agent McGuish and Constable Curry and Rev Mr Stevens were also invited.\n\nThe school children, seventy in number, all looking very clean and happy had been taught to sing a song for the occasion.\n\nThe Mountie is a very good man,\nHe will help us all he can;\nWe will work with all our might\nHelping him to enforce the right.\n\nIf we fail our bit to do,\nHe will never think us true,\nIn the promise, that we say\nWe will try and keep each day.\n\nWhen our Agent comes this way\nWe often get a holiday;\nFor this \"Thank you\" we will say.\nCome again some other day.\n\nFarewell Mr Mountie, farewell, adieu,\nWhen in Winnipeg we'll think of you,\nWe were a little frightened\nWhen the Mounties first came through\nBut now we find them faithful friends\nWho're constant, brave and true.\n\nTeaching like this must have an effect for good on the rising generation of Indians.\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI am enclosing a copy of a \"news item\" from the Wpg Free Press. I think it will interest you. Our day school is fine. You ought to come and visit us and see for yourself. You will see from this \"news item\" that the \"whiskey business\" which I wrote you some years ago has been successfully dealt with. As I write Inspector Meade is over to Blood Vein. We are very thankful to know that our Indians are being protected by the law. With lots of good wishes.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nF.G. Stevens\nOttawa, December 16th, 1925.\n\nRev.

Tong, teachers at the school in Fisher River Indian Reserve, are being extended very hearty congratulations on the splendid Christmas programme presented by the children in their charge. The Junior school-room was very tastefully decorated for the occasion. The programme consisted of songs, recitations, dialogues and a splendid by the girls. When it is remembered that the performers were Indians, and more familiar with the Cree language than with the English, the performance was remarkable. The children were all well and tastefully dressed and all clean and neat. There was a big crowd of parents and friends present, all proud of their children and taking a keen interest in the whole performance.\n\nFISHER RIVER CHRISTMAS TREE\nFisher River Christmas Tree was held in the United Church on Christmas Eve. There was a great crowd present, room not being found for all. The tree was a great spruce 20 ft tall and having a spread of branches 14 to 16 ft. Lines extended to both sides of the church and a great display of gifts was to be seen. Silk embroidery on deerskin or moose skin was much in evidence.

The present teacher is not qualified and her methods, to say the least, are poor. No matter how good a senior teacher we may secure, if the pupil has not received the elementary training, progress will be slow and the child will be handicapped all through the grades.\n\nThe class room was clean and tidy and the seats and furniture all in good repair. The room is well equipped with blackboards, which are all in good shape. The children in this room are also provided with individual towels and cups, which are neatly arranged on the side wall.\n\nThis year the basement was fitted up with tables and benches for the purpose of providing a noon-day meal. This makes a splendid dining room with ample accommodation for 60 or 70 pupils. It is also supplied with a range, cooking utensils and dishes.\n\nAt noon the children are served with a vegetable soup made with meat or, in the absence of meat, beans, rice or potatoes are served, with sometimes dried prunes or peaches. Cocoa and milk are also served at times. The meal was so elaborate that the biscuits were not needed and were being issued at the close of school - two to each pupil. In many cases these were taken home and given to other members of the family. I explained, both to Mr. Tong and the Agent, that this must not continue and the meal must be reduced so that the biscuits may make up part of the dinner. The meals served have been very reasonable, never exceeding the cost of 3\u00bd\u00a2 per child per meal.\n\nI learned further that to serve this meal, Mrs. Tong was obliged to be in the kitchen from 9 A.M. until 2 P.M. each day. She claimed it was impossible to trust this work to the school girls. This simply means we are paying...\nFISHER RIVER DAY SCHOOL (Cont'd.)\n\npaying Mrs. Tong $75.00 per month as a teacher and scarcely 2 hours per day is spent in the class room. Mr. Tong tries to carry on both rooms with the result that neither are receiving proper attention. This is a situation that the Indian Agent should have known as he was aware of the Department's wishes as regards this work. He was informed that the meal was to be a simple one, prepared by two girls under Mrs. Tong's supervision and the biscuits were to make up part of this meal. This was not to take fire, Tong from her class room work. Both Mr. & Mrs. Tong claim it is impossible to carry on unless she or some capable woman supervises the meal. However, I believe that a meal, such as the Department wish served, can be done by the girls, but if the meals are to continue in the manner in which they are now served, help will need to be employed. Even then, I believe it could be carried on for about 5\u00a2 per child per meal.\n\nI also noticed that after dinner the children were allowed out until 1.30 P.M., and then the girls were called to the kitchen to wash up, which spoiled the first half hour of school. I pointed out that this should not be and again met with opposition from Mr. & Mrs. Tong - that the girls needed the play and Mrs. Tong needed the rest. However, I explained that this washing up could be done in 20 minutes, and it certainly would not hurt the girls, nor did I think Mrs. Tong needed to be present while it was being carried on. The outside doors could be locked and the girls left to clean up.\n\nBoth Mr. & Mrs. Tong are very enthusiastic over the work, but they are simply carrying it too far and making too much unnecessary work for Mrs. Tong and thus keeping her from the class room. I pointed this out, but they both...\nFISHER RIVER DAY SCHOOL (Cont'd.)\n\nthey both feel that the meal should not be cut down, but that extra help should be provided.\n\nMr. Tong is very much interested in his work and I believe is a fair teacher, although he does not hold a Manitoba certificate nor Normal training.\n\nMrs. Tong I consider a poor teacher. She is interested in the work, but as far as I can learn has no special training to fit her as a teacher. The cause here is big and I believe good qualified teachers could do splendid work.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nFISHER RIVER DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThis is a two roomed school with living accommodation for the teachers. The building is heated by two furnaces and can be kept quite comfortable, even in severe weather.\n\nThe class work is divided into junior and senior classes. The junior room is taught by Mrs. Tong and the senior room by Mr. Tong.\n\nIn the senior room I found present 11 girls and 16 boys, a total of 27. The roll called for 31 pupils. The grades range from 3 to 8 and the class room work examined was fair. The reading was very poor with no expression and was scarcely audible. The spelling was good. Their exercise books were tidy and their writing showed care.\n\nThe seats are all single and in good repair. The class room was clean and tidy. All the children were provided with towels and drinking cups, which were neatly hung on one wall.\n\nIn the junior room 35 were present, with 37 on the roll. The attendance has been good. The children were quite neat and their faces and hands were clean. Only grades 1 and 2 are kept in this room. The work heard was only fair and I doubt if much headway is being made.

He states that the lunch served is too elaborate and should be reduced so that biscuits will make up part of the food served.\n\nThe preparation and serving of this lunch should not interfere with the regular classroom duties of Mrs. Tong, the assistant teacher. The older girls should assist her in the preparation and serving of this meal. It would point out that the purpose of the midday meal is to supplement the lunches brought by the pupils from their homes by a few items of hot food. You should take this matter up with Mrs. Tong and explain the Department's requirements. The lunch served should be a simple one, and should be prepared by the older girls under Mrs. Tong's supervision. It is expected, however, that the classroom duties will not encroach on during the regular hours for that purpose. I shall be pleased to have a report from you after you have discussed the matter of the midday lunch with Mrs. Tong and impressed upon her the necessity of serving a very simple lunch, using the minimum of her time in the preparation and serving of same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. E. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. Templeman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHodgson, Man.\n7. The washing-up of dishes and utensils after meal is done by all the girl pupils and the sweeping of dining room, splitting of wood, and filling of wood box for the next day's meal by the boy pupils between 12:30 p.m. and 1 p.m. Mrs. Tong re-enters her classroom at the regular time of 1 p.m. and is there until 4 p.m.\n\n8. The average cost of meals since the commencement has been 3.26 cents per meal per pupil per diem. This is the lowest I have heard of in any institution.\n\nIn view of the fact that Dr. Bird, whose knowledge of such matters is superior to that of anyone not acquainted with dieting from the health standpoint, does not consider them too important, I myself do not consider it too elaborate and feel that my recommendation of any reduction in the items of diet would not be in the best interests of the pupils.\n\nUnder these circumstances, I beg to recommend that a woman be hired from the Reserve to superintend the preparation of the meal each day, she being assisted by two of the girl pupils, two different girls being appointed each day to assist her. This would do away with the necessity of Mrs. Tong visiting the kitchen and dining room at other times during the day or for any other purpose and enable her to spend her whole time during the morning in her classroom. The services of such woman could be obtained for not less than $10 or more than $12 per month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

The total time spent each day in the basement kitchen and dining room by Mrs. Tong is from 9:50 a.m. until 12 noon, amounting to two hours and 10 minutes each day during which she is absent from the classroom.\n\n2. The preparation each morning consists of cutting up meat, washing potatoes, peeling carrots, onions and turnips. In addition, food on stove has to be watched and fire in range kept going. On days during which beans, split peas, rice, etc., are used in place of fresh vegetables, preparation consists in cutting up of meat and cooking of dinner. During these days Mrs. Tong usually makes dumplings or fresh biscuits for the meal.\n\n3. The average amount of vegetables used each day consists of 25 lbs. potatoes, 4 lbs. carrots, 6 lbs. turnips and 2 lbs. onions. Average amount of fresh meat used each day is 10 lbs.\n\n4. After a number of trials, both Mr. and Mrs. Tong state that it is not possible to carry out the daily preparation of meal without her constant supervision. These boys and girls attending school who are over 15 years of age and girls under that age who do the work each day in the kitchen are not dependable unless Mrs. Tong is thereto watch them.\n\n5. The meals served are the simplest possible taking into consideration what growing children need. The created appetite for vegetables and the increased consumption of them by the children has brought about a great improvement in their health. Dr. Bird has looked over the daily menus and states that there is nothing superfluous in any of the meals. Vegetables especially, from the point of view of health, are essential.\n\n6. Regarding Biscuits, one is now served with the meal and the other given to the children at 4 p.m. When the meal was first started, Mr. Tong asked Mr. Inspector Christianson about reduction in supply of biscuits. He was informed that there would be no reduction in the supply of these and to use them as he thought fit.\nOttawa, January 25, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, reporting on the work which is undertaken by Mrs. Tong, the assistant teacher at the Fisher River Indian Day School, in the preparation and serving of the midday lunch for the pupils.\n\nIt is considered that the time occupied by Mrs. Tong in the preparing of this lunch militates against her duties in the classroom. In order that she may devote more attention to these duties, the Department will approve of engaging the services of a woman from the reserve to prepare the midday meal, with the assistance of two of the older grade pupils. If you can obtain the services of an Indian woman who would be willing to supervise the meal, the Department will be prepared to allow her a remuneration not exceeding the sum of $12 per month. It may be that you can secure the services of a woman for the sum of $10 per month.\n\nIf this woman is engaged, you may forward certified vouchers, from time to time, for the amount of salary due her. Mrs. Tong might exercise supervision over the work, but this should not take up her time from the regular classroom duties.\n\nWe note that both yourself and Dr. Bird do not consider the meal being served to be too elaborate and that you believe any reduction in the items of diet would not be in the best interests of the pupils. It is hoped, however, that all expense for the food supplies and the preparation and serving of the meal will be kept down to the lowest possible cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Has your office had any complaints in this connection? The information on the Department's files does not warrant such drastic action as dismissal. In fact, the Public School Inspector writes in part as follows: \"Mrs. Tong is sympathetic with little people and has a motherly attitude that appeals.

G. Tong, the teacher of the junior room at Fisher River, I may say that Mr. Stevens, both in correspondence and in conversation, has made the same suggestion to Mr. Banner and myself.\n\nMrs. Tong is not a qualified teacher and she is not the least bit missionary. Both Mr. and Mrs. Tong, as I understand the situation, attend church very infrequently and take no interest in the Sunday School so that, so far as the missionary and his share of the work on the Fisher River Indian mission are concerned, they are of no help but more or less of a hindrance.\n\nOn the other hand, Mr. Tong is an exceptionally fine teacher and they have, on the whole, rendered quite satisfactory service from the educational standpoint. Sooner or later there must be a change at Fisher River but I doubt if Mr. Banner and I are prepared to say that it should take place this year. Unfortunately when I visited Fisher River myself Mr. and Mrs. Tong were both away so that I did not see them at work in the school.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J.

Tong, and consists of two classrooms and living quarters. He is assisted in the junior room by his wife. In the senior room there are 36 children on the roll, and the grades range from 3 to 7. The children speak out well, are bright and alert. I found their exercise books neat and the work nicely set out. Mr. Tong is very interested in his work, and the children have made good progress under his supervision. The average attendance for November was 29.25, and should be well over 30 for December.\n\nIn the junior room there are 28 children on the roll, 18 in Grade I and 10 in Grade II. Mrs. Tong is not a qualified teacher, but with the assistance which she obtains from Mr. Tong, the children make fair progress. A qualified teacher should be placed in charge of this classroom.

I wish merely to state that it is now three years since I raised this question personally with Mr. and Mrs. Tong and with Mr. Ferrier, who was then Superintendent of Indian Education. We have also had some communication with Mr. Hamilton, the Department's Inspector in Winnipeg. I tried to see him last Saturday in Winnipeg, but unfortunately he was out of the city.\n\nI have tried to be as fair as possible to all the parties concerned in this very difficult situation. We have on file a letter from Mr. Tong, accepting the suggestion that a Major Teacher should be appointed in place of his wife, who has certain educational qualifications, and stating that he considered that the United Church had dealt very fairly with him in permitting him to remain as teacher of the Senior Room for one more year.\n\nI have my own ideas as to what has stirred up the Chief and the Councillors to send in the petition in question but cannot see that anything is to be gained by discussing the matter in correspondence.\n\nIn the meantime, I wish to nominate for the Junior Room at Fisher River, Miss Helen Gaudin. Miss Gaudin was, as you will remember, previously in the service of the United Church and the Department but had a rather serious illness two years ago which made it necessary for her to resign from her school. I saw her in Winnipeg last week end she now has a splendid medical report. She has been doing during the last year practically full time work as regular teacher in the Winnipeg Public Schools. I feel satisfied that she will fit into the rather strained relationships which will inevitably exist at Fisher River for the next academic year very much better than a teacher who knows nothing whatever about Indian Reserves and Indian missions. She is well\nOttawa, June 20, 1933.\n\nRev.

The Department notes that Miss Gaudin is well qualified professionally, and that her health is now satisfactory, also that you feel satisfied she will fit into the rather strained relationships which at present exist at Fisher River.\n\nThe Department will approve of the appointment of Miss Gaudin as junior teacher as from September 1st, next, at a salary of $85 per teaching month, less 10% during the present fiscal year. It is hoped that Miss Gaudin will use tact in her dealings with the Indians and in her relationship with Mr. and Mrs. Tong.

I could not help but discuss the issue in detail by correspondence, but merely to state that it is now four years since I raised with Mr. Russell Ferrier the question of a change in the teachers at Fisher River, and it is three years since I told Mr. and Mrs. Tong personally that we had to look forward to a change. There has also been some correspondence with Mr. Hamilton, the Inspector in Manitoba.\n\nI merely want to state that on March 13th, 1933, I wrote Mr. Tong that while it was impossible to continue the employment of his wife, I would be willing to name her for one more year. These paragraphs, taken from my letter of that date, explain the attitude of the Board of Home Missions, and I feel free to state that there is no way in which Mr. Tong can continue at Fisher River after the end of June:\n\n\"As you are undoubtedly well aware, there are hundreds of United Church teachers - University graduates and others possessing the very highest professional qualifications - without employment at the present time. It is often difficult for us to explain to those who raise the issue why we should employ people who belong to another Church and who are not vitally interested in the missionary work or the Reserve of which the School should be an integral and related part. On the other hand, we cannot overlook the splendid reports which have been given concerning your work in the classroom during the years that you have served with us in our programme of Indian Education at Fisher River.\n\n\"The conclusion at which we finally arrived was that, if you desire to continue with us, we will recommend your appointment as Principal of the School for the year...\"\n\"1933-1934, the understanding being that during that year you will make whatever plans are necessary in order to secure another mission. Beginning with the new school year we will recommend a new teacher for the Junior Room, with the necessary professional qualifications. So far, we have done nothing towards the securing of this specialist in primary and junior work, but will try to find an experienced teacher with a vital missionary purpose, who will be able to direct a certain amount of extra-curriculum activity.\"\n\nThe main issues, of course, are not mentioned in this correspondence, but I shall be in Ottawa before the end of next week and be glad to go over with you in detail the whole situation.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nKJB: GWF.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nJune 14th,\n1934.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Fisher River Indian Day School.\n\nI wish to recommend that Miss Mabel Farris, who for the last three years has been the teacher of the Day School at Cross Lake, should be transferred to the Senior Room at Fisher River at the beginning of the Fall term.\n\nMiss Farris has served the Department of Indian Affairs and the Church for three years in a very difficult and very isolated school and merits promotion.\n\nI believe that this recommendation has the support of Mr. A. G. Hamilton, Inspector for Manitoba.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nKJB.MIT\n\nIndian Affairs.

As you know, it has been the custom of the Board of Home Missions to cover moving expenses of teachers on Indian Missions around Lake Winnipeg who spend a given length of time in our service. As I understand, of settling your house, your moving expenses will amount to, I thought the simplest thing was to give you a month's salary, which would be more than ample to cover your needs in this connection.\n\nI should be glad to receive from you the name of the person whom whom you have left the key of the School, so that I can inform your successor where to look for it.

In conversation with him, I enquired as to why he was not teaching and he replied that he had been instructed that his services were no longer required. I informed Mr. Tong that there was nothing on my files to show that he was still not the teacher at Fisher River and advised him to return. Mr. Tong was greatly delighted to have the opportunity and assured me that any last time would be appreciated. In an indirect way, I knew that the church's recommendation, in connection with Miss Farris to fill Mr. Tong's place, had been turned down and that the Department had refused to make any change.\n\nMr. Tong has rendered excellent service at this point and I trust his services will be retained.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Tong of the Fisher River Day School. He returned to duty and found a letter from Rev. F. G. Stevens; the contents were that he - Mr. Stevens - had received a wire from Rev. K.J. Beaton to ask him if he would take charge of the school until Christmas.\n\nMr. Tong is delighted to continue, but would like to hold the school by the year as has been the custom. He had moved out at considerable expense and is now moving back again.\n\nA year ago Mrs. Tong gave up her work at the request of church authorities. Last year Miss Gaudin taught in her place and the work was carried on successfully. I understand Mr. Tong and Miss Gaudin carried on without any friction and, according to Mr. Tong's letter, he received a welcome on his recent return, both from Miss Gaudin and the Indians.\n\nIt is hard to work cheerfully and to the best advantage if one feels they are not permanent or might at any time be discharged.

Hamilton who informed me that my services were required at the Paskapoo Indian Day School and instructed me to return as soon as possible and report for duty to the Indian Agent Mr. H.G. Lavender.\n\nUpon my arrival home I found a letter from Rev. J. S. Stinson in which he stated he had received a wire from Rev. K. F. Beaton requesting me to return to the school until Christmas.

At that time, you advised that no action for the present be taken. Mr. Tong resumed duties on September 4th, last, and now wishes to be informed if his services will be terminated at the beginning of the Christmas holidays.\n\nThe uncertainty occasioned Mr. Tong in his tenure of the position and the difficulty he would have in moving his supplies during the winter would be unfair.

I am replying immediately, however, to your communication of November 14th concerning the Junior Room at Fisher River. Miss Gaudin's letter of resignation is on my desk, but I have not yet replied to it. I shall send you a copy when I write again.\n\nIn regard to your enquiry concerning Miss Marguerite Stevens, I would like to say that I know Miss Stevens personally, as she was for a year the Secretary of our Hospital at Fort Simpson. In addition to the secretarial work and bookkeeping, she spent one-half of each day teaching the children who are patients in the hospital. She handles children well and has exceptional ability along the line of handicraft and art work. I think that if she were requested to spend the month of December observing in Miss Gaudin's room and the Department were prepared to appoint her for the Spring term, she could carry on acceptably.\n\nThe feeling at Fisher River is so tense - both among Indians and whites at the present time - that one hesitates to send in a thoroughly qualified teacher to become embroiled in the feuds. We are prepared to nominate Miss Stevens as teacher of the Junior Room from January to June, on condition that she does spend the month of December or a considerable part of such day, observing Miss Gaudin's methods and that both Miss Stevens and the Agent are notified that it is only a temporary appointment and no question of re-engagement is to be raised at the end of the six months.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nKenneth J.

G. Long\nDear Sir,\n\nThe development in the senior classes at Peguis and Fisher River Schools is such that we would need some statement of policy in regard to Junior High School. It seems to me that the somewhat simple course on General Science in Grades VII, VIII, and IX would be both useful and attractive to the pupils just at the time they are likely to think of dropping off from school. This will call for an expenditure of $5 to $10, with possibly a two dollar expenditure annually to maintain the equipment in each school where the pupils reach this grade.\n\nAs you may observe (See Peguis Centre and Fisher) I am recommending an initial expenditure say $5-10 for such equipment. I understand that up to date the Department has been making no such outlay; and I would be glad of a statement of the attitude of the Department on this question.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG.W. Bartlett\nInspector of Schools\nEXD.\n\nOttawa, November 10th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to his recent visit to the Peguis Centre and Fisher River Indian Day Schools, Inspector Bartlett states that the development in the senior classrooms is such that he considers it advisable to encourage junior high school work; particularly the simple course on general science for Grades VII, VIII and IX.\n\nAt the present time, he recommends an initial expenditure of $5.00 for the equipment necessary to follow the general science course.\n\nNo doubt, the teachers of both the Peguis Centre and Fisher River Schools know what equipment is necessary and you may, therefore, expend the amount mentioned above at each of these schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

This latter date is that on which the school will close for the Christmas holidays. It is noted that you can have this work done for $3 a day. You should arrange to have a statement prepared each day showing the names of the children who have been driven for the period December 1st to December 15th. This statement should be forwarded to the Department immediately following the close of the school for the Christmas holidays, and we will then decide whether or not the attendance justifies our continuing transporting the children for the balance of the winter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

MacKenzie Esq.\nSecretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge yours of 10th inst. above named teacher. My plan is to require a reading course sufficient for an academic year; but which she may be allowed to take in a longer time, up to two years or more; so long as she shows evidence of progressive thinking and a tendency to apply her reading in her school work.\n\nIf she shows such professional growth it might not be necessary to tie her down to tests or final examinations, but merely to assure ourselves that the studies are going on. Such work might somewhat follow the pedagogy and psychology of a Grade XI normal, together with special methods in arithmetic and reading.\n\nThanking you for your letter I am\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. B. Bartlett\nInspector of Schools\nOttawa, November 25, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI enclose another letter which has just been received from the Fisher River Indians.\n\nThe Department cannot understand why Farm Instructor Murdoch has apparently given them the impression that the Department is considering the erection of another school.\n\nOur decision to permit the driving of the pupils for a limited time was conveyed to you in official letter of the 17th instant.\n\nIt is noted that, while you stated in your letter of the 13th instant that it would cost $3.00 a day for suitable conveyance, the Indians state that a driver could be obtained for $2.00 a day. If it is possible to secure a driver at the lower rate, you should do so.\n\nPlease return the letter for our file.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. J. Clarke, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHodgson, Man.\nNovember 18, 1936.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSir,\n\nReverting to our letter of the 22nd ultimo we respectfully beg to state that we have received no reply, except that one of our people, James Albert Murdoch, received some indefinite information to the effect that it was understood that some consideration had been given by the Department of Indian Affairs for the erection of a school in the western portion of our reserve.\n\nJ.A. Murdoch states that this information was given to him by the Farm Instructor, upon the Peguis Reserve.\n\nIf the Department of Indian Affairs will be good enough to give favourable consideration for the establishment of a school for the children living in the west of the Fisher River Reserve, it would seem that it will be about a year before a school can be in readiness for pupils.\n\nWill, therefore, the Department kindly instruct that a conveyance be provided for our children to attend the present school, pending the building of a school in the western part of the Fisher River Reserve?\n\nOne of our number is willing to convey our children to and from the present school for the sum of two dollars per day.\n\nMay we again ask that some definite answer be made to our request?\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6233, file 511-1, part 2)\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter 136-7-1 of Nov 25th re the driver for the van at the Fisher River Day School.\n\nThe Indians had asked Mr. Spence, our Farming Instructor what the Department were going to do re a van or a new school. He told them that he did not know but that he understood that some consideration was being given the matter of getting the children to the school. I might add that on investigation I found that some of the Indians, whose names are on the letter, did not sign the letter submitted to you.\n\nWith regards to the hire of a van driver, the man whom offered his services for $2.00 per day can not be considered a reliable person for this job. I do not believe he would continue to run the van at that price. I am of the opinion that $3.00 per day is a fair wage for this job. You will understand that while the van is running it is a full time job for the driver and he will have practically no time to earn any other money and whoever takes this job will have to buy grain for his team which is a considerable item this year.\n\nI might say that on the authority of your letter of Nov 17th, I hired Jas A. Murdoch to drive the van at the rate of $3.00 per day. This man had practically no means of earning a living except by trapping and he has a family of eight children to support. If the Department decide to continue the van after the new year I would recommend that the above named continue as the driver @ 3.00 providing his services continue to be satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

A. Murdoch to drive the van for the children being transported to the Fisher River Indian Day School, at a cost of $5.00 a teaching day.\n\nThe statement requested in official letter of the 17th ultimo should be forwarded to the Department immediately following the close of the school for the Christmas holidays, in order that a decision can be made in connection with continuing transportation for the balance of the winter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

The driving of the children should be discontinued at the end of this month, and, during the months of May and June, the teacher should keep a statement showing the attendance during those two months of those children who have been driven to the school since last November.\n\nWhen the driving of these children was first authorized, the Department understood that this would be necessary only during the winter months. To drive the children during the whole academic year involves a very considerable expenditure and is something that is not done at other Indian day schools. Would it not be possible to have the Indians whose children live at a distance from the school take turns in driving all the children to Fisher River, either in shifts any expense to the Department or at a much lower cost than we are paying at the present time?

Clarke,\nIndian Agent,\nHodgson, Man.\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to submit the following report on the above school, inspected on February 24, 1941.\n\nThe senior room was in the charge of Mrs. Tong, with 21 pupils present. There are 36 pupils enrolled in this room, but severe colds have greatly affected the attendance. The grades are arranged as follows:\n\nGrade 3 - 18 pupils\n\" 4 - 8 \"\n\" 5 - 6 \"\n\" 6 - 2 \"\n\" 8 - 2 \"\n\nThe children appeared to be interested in their work. The book-work was very neat and in most cases well done.\n\nThe children were well-dressed, clean and neat in appearance.\n\nThe class-room was bright and tidy, and the walls in fair condition.\n\nMr. Tong, the teacher, was home but unable to work. He appeared in poor condition and did not know when he would be able to return to work. Personally, I doubt if he will be able to do much work before Easter.\n\nMiss Margaret Stevens is in charge of the junior room with 46 pupils enrolled. There were 19 present and the average attendance during the past month was 22. Here, again, the attendance has been affected by bad colds which in many cases required attention from the Doctor. I consider the children are making fair progress. There are 26 in Grade 1, and 20 in Grade 2. They were quite well clothed, and clean.\n\nThe room was tidy, clean and neat. Miss Stevens thoroughly understands her work quite satisfactory.\n\nThe school building has been delivered and is now ready for school. The flag has been repaired and a new one should be purchased.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mrs. Tong has been attempting to keep the work going. He is able to look in for a little while each day and help direct the work to some extent. The year's work has been badly broken up and the attendance is poor.\"\n\nIn reviewing our file the only reference to the proposed absence of Mr. Tong is contained in your letter of January 25 at which time it was presumed that Mr. Tong would resume duties at an early date. In view of his continued sickness it is difficult to understand why you have not notified this Breach. Please let me have a complete report on Mr. Tong's present condition and you should state definitely if you consider he will be able to resume duties on October 1 when this school will re-open for the academic year 1941-42. It is likely the absence of Mr. Tong has affected the attendance which you will note the Inspector reports being very poor.

The van did not operate after Apr 30th.\n\nMr. Tong states that he will be able to take over his duties when the school opens on Oct 1/41.

G. Tong, who has retired for the coming academic year owing to illness. Miss Smith-Windsor was formerly at the Rossville Indian Day School.\n\nMiss Haywah replaces Miss Marguerite Stevens, who has resigned. Miss Haywah was formerly in charge of the Cross Lake United Church Indian Day School.\n\nThe Fisher River School will be reopened on October 1, and you should give the new teacher every possible assistance.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Chas. N. C. Roberts,\nIn charge, Indian Agency,\nNorway House, Man.\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to submit the following report on the schools in the Fisher River Agency, inspected during the week of November 17, 1941:\n\nFisher River Indian Day School\n\nThe senior teacher is Miss E. Smith-Windsor. There are 24 pupils enrolled, arranged in grades as follows:\n\n- Grade 3 - 6 pupils\n- Grade 4 - 10 pupils\n- Grade 5 - 3 pupils\n- Grade 6 - 4 pupils\n- Grade 7 - 1 pupil\n\nThe junior teacher is Miss G. Haywah. There are 47 pupils on the roll call, and the grades are arranged as follows:\n\n- Grade 1-B - 22 pupils\n- Grade 1-A - 6 pupils\n- Grade 1 - 12 pupils\n- Grade 2 - 7 pupils\n\nThe children were fairly well clothed, clean and neat in appearance.\n\nThe attendance has been quite good, but has been kept down due to the measles and chicken-pox. Even yet cases exist in several homes.\n\nBoth teachers are qualified and have teaching experience. Several parents stated their children were making good progress and enjoyed school. I am sure both teachers will do their best to make school life bright and interesting.\n\nThe school building is in good repair. On the first floor are two large classrooms and a living room for the teachers. Upstairs there are four bedrooms.\n\nI would recommend that four 1-gallon pyrene fire extinguishers be supplied, one for the basement where there are two furnaces, one for the kitchen, one for the front hall and one for the upstairs.\n\nOne soft water tank is likely to become useless at any time. There are two tanks joined together so that...\n\nDr. H. W. McGill,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nThe water remains at the same level in each. One tank already has about 40 holes. The teachers plugged these with sharp pointed slivers of wood. However, new holes are constantly appearing. The tanks are badly rusted and very thin. The tanks cannot be made in Winnipeg and shipped because they will not pass through the basement door. It will therefore be necessary to ship the material and later have a man go up and put them together. If possible, this work should be done before the early spring rains.\n\nPeguis South Indian Day School\n\nMrs. Shergold is the teacher here. She is qualified and has had several years of experience. There are 40 pupils enrolled, and the grades are arranged as follows:\n\nGrade 1 - 26 pupils\n\" 2 - 7 \"\n\" 3 - 5 \"\n\" 4 - 1 \"\n\" 5 - 2 \"\n\" 9 - 1 \"\n\nThe pupils in attendance were clean and neat in appearance. Their book work was good, and I consider they are making fair progress. It was cold and snowing during the week I was at the Agency, and consequently the attendance was poor. Nineteen were present.\n\nThe van is not yet in use, but I think should operate after Christmas. Some children have five and six miles to travel, and this is altogether too far when the snow becomes deep and the temperature gets below zero.\n\nThe school and residence are in good repair. The house is scantily furnished, and I would recommend that four chairs be provided, two for the dining-room at approximately $8.25 each, and two for the living-room at approximately $8.00 each.\n\nPeguis Centre Indian Day School\n\nMiss Alice Clarke is the teacher in charge. She is qualified and understands Indian children. There are 25 pupils enrolled, and 15 were present. The grades are arranged as follows:\n\nGrade 1 - 16 pupils\n\" 2 - 4 \"\n\" 3 - 3 \"\n\" 6 - 2 \"\n\nThe children were alert and apparently keenly interested in their work. They spoke out clearly and all book work was neat and tidy. The children were clean but none too well clothed.\n\nThe school is in good condition. The teacher's residence has a lot of water in the basement. This water has been pumped out several times but comes in again within 24 hours. The trouble arose after the well was drilled at the school over a year ago. It not only keeps the house damp but apparently is affecting the cement wall as....\nAll as the foundation at one corner is crumbling badly. It looks as though the gravel used in the wall was not free from clay and probably this is why the water has caused it to crumble. It is perhaps too late now to carry out the repair work necessary, but certainly the matter should be attended to next spring.\n\nPeguis North Indian Day School\n\nMiss Eaton is in charge of this school and is doing splendid work. She has made marked progress with these children and has also done good work with her Women's Club. There are 50 pupils enrolled, and 19 were present. The grades are arranged as follows:\n\nGrade 1 - 18 pupils\n\" 2 - 1 \"\n\" 3 - 2 \"\n\" 4 - 3 \"\n\" 5 - 2 \"\n\nThe classroom work is good. The children were clean but scantily clad.\n\nRed Cross work is carried on and already five small children have each knit one sock. They have also knit almost enough squares for an afghan.\n\nThe school and residence are in good repair. The repair carried out on the classroom walls by the use of wall board has made a big improvement and looks well.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nOttawa, July 10, 1942.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, nominating Miss Olive H. Mascall as teacher of the junior room of the Fisher River Indian Day School.\n\nWe have not received any previous intimation that Miss Gladys Hayswah had decided to resign. However, I understand from your letter that she has done so, and consequently the appointment of Miss Olive H. Mascall as teacher, at a salary of $350 a teaching month, plus bonus, is approved. Her appointment will be effective from October 1, 1942.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n339 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nTHE Educational Committee of the Manitoba Game and Fish association, under the chairmanship of R. H. G. Bonnycastle, has conducted a Nature study competition among the pupils of Manitoba schools. With the approval and advice of the minister of education, Hon. Ivan Schultz, and under the guidance of Miss O. A. Anderson, the competition ran from January to May and covered such subjects as trees, birds, fish, butterflies, and other natural phenomena.\n\nFifty cents in prizes was subscribed by two or three members of the Game and Fish association and prizes in books on nature, animals and waterfowl were distributed. The prizes were donated by the Hudson's Bay Co., and Ducks Unlimited.\n\nThe work of conducting the competition was borne by the Manitoba Game and Fish association. The prizes were in the form of nature study books, field glasses, dictionaries and subscriptions to outdoor magazines such as Canadian Nature and Bird Life.\n\nMore than 30 schools competed, the largest number being 15. Each letter size loose-leaf note book in which drawing papers and filled exercise pages were provided, was used for sketches, colored drawings, and personal notes written up on the subject matter.\n\nFirst prize was won by Fisher River Indian school, Grades 1 and 2, Koostatah, Man., teacher Miss O. Anderson. The pupils showed remarkable ability in drawing, sketching and composition. In addition, the essays are masterpieces of simple, direct writing. For instance, a wealth of accurate information is given by the anonymous author of the following essay:\n\n\"The weasel is white in winter and grayish brown in summer. It has short legs. It kills birds and animals. It will kill chickens. We trap them when they are in the time.\" The Indian children revealed their knowledge of nature and their interest in such matters.\n\nBowman school, Grades four to six, Bowman River, Man., teacher Miss T. Wilson, won second prize with an entry which was particularly rich in forest lore. The pupils showed an understanding of forest conservation principles. The art work was excellent.\n\nBower rural school, McCreary, Man., teacher Miss M. B. Wood, won third prize with an entry which was rich in original drawing and composition.\n\nA special prize was awarded Maidstone school, Fisher Branch, Man., teacher Miss E. J. Smith, for an entry which placed it in a class by itself.\n\nFour days of steady, cold rains starting May 23 caught the wren and other small birds. The mortality among these insect eaters was very high. I was in Portage la Prairie May 25 and was surprised to see a Redstart dodging about in the shrubs along the walls of Saskatchewan ave.\u2014the main street of Portage la Prairie\u2014between the corners of the buildings for insects.\n\nAs I write (June 3) we are into another prolonged cold rainy spell. A gale of wind is blowing and the heavy, persistent rain is slanting down from leader to leader. I am at the Danby Marshes. Yesterday Ed. Ward of Toronto told me that Hungarian Partridges had been seen near here without young. He suspects that the birds are hiding in the last prolonged cold spell.\n\nDr. Fred Cadham raked up a house sparrow nest in his garden at Delta on May 26 and saved the young birds from cold and hunger. He and his visitors fed it honey and water in the afternoon of May 27 and brought it back to full health and strength. The warm sunshine promised the advent of spring, but the promise was a false promise for here we are again with April weather in June.\n\nThe first sign of the arrival of Yellow-throated vireos and Wood Thrushes was heard at Portage la Prairie. I heard them singing there on June 2. A male Scarlet Tanager was heard at Selkirk, Man., on May 31, by Torrey Ward.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA Ontario.\n\nI enclose a clipping from the \"Tribune\" which I thought might be of interest. I consider the Grades 1 and 2 did well to win first place in the competition.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\n\nEncl.\nREPORT ON SCHOOLS OF FISHER RIVER AGENCY INSPECTED\nJANUARY 17th & 21st, 1944.\n\nIndian Improved Day School - Fisher River.\n\nIn this school we have Miss Smith-Windsor in charge of the senior room, with thirty-three enrolled. Miss MacCall in the junior room, with fourteen pupils. The attendance has been fair, but there is room for improvement. A number of the Indians have been camped with their families near the lake where they are fishing, and consequently the children could not get to school; however, most of these people have moved back now so that the attendance should be much better.\n\nThe pupils are well along in their respective grades and the work seen was well done and neatly set down. I am certain the children are making good progress.\n\nThe pupils were all well dressed; many with dresses, skirts, coats and windbreakers made from Army clothing. These were all re-modelled, and the average person would never know the material was from old Army clothes. The sewing club under the direction of Miss Smith-Windsor has done some excellent work.\n\nThe school building is badly in need of exterior painting and if at all possible this should be done during the coming summer. The front and back steps are also badly rotted and must be renewed.\n\nThe furnaces appear in good condition and the building was warm and comfortable.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nI submit the following report on the Fisher River Improved Day School, inspected June 15th, 1948.\n\nThe junior room is in charge of Miss Macal with 21 pupils in grade 1 and 36 pupils in grade 2. There were 24 pupils present. The children were neatly dressed and clean. The attendance is down now due to the fact that some of the fishermen have left for the summer fishing and have taken their families along.\n\nThe other room is in charge of Miss Smith-Windsor with the grades arranged as follows:\n\n| Grade | Pupils |\n|-------|--------|\n| 3     | 9      |\n| 4     | 9      |\n| 5     | 4      |\n| 6     | 1      |\n| 7     | 3      |\n| 8     |        |\n\nSixteen were present and I consider them well along in their respective grades. The children were well dressed and neat in appearance.\n\nThe two teachers at this school are doing excellent work; and both are well liked by the Indians.\n\nThe building is in good repair; but the walls and ceiling of the class-rooms are dark and gloomy.\n\nThe fence around the school yard should be repaired, otherwise the reserve stock may do considerable damage. It will cost about $30.00 for labor and posts. I trust this expense will be authorized.\nThe furnaces appear in good condition, except that a fire grate is needed for each. Mr. Clarke has already placed an order for the two grates.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian agencies for Manitoba.\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH. DEPT MINES & RESOURCES. OTTAWA.

The case here refers to a breaking, entering and theft, the school in question and the theft therefrom of those items mentioned at para 6.\n\nThe date of offence is reputed to have been between June 27th and August 29th, but believed by an association of offences, to have occurred shortly before the discovery.\n\nMethod of entry is noted at para 3.\n\nPara 5 shows that the offenders had occupied the quarters as a temporary residence.\n\nMay note be taken of file under the heading of:\n\n\"B.E. & Theft (460) from Garage of Anthony SARULLAK, Hudson, Manitoba,\"\n\nupon which an association of offences is covered and special direction sent to Hudson and Ashera Detachments.\n\nS.H.I.\n\nJ. A. Wright,\nSupt.,\nO. C., WPC., 3/Division.\n18. It will be noted from paragraph 7 of this report that a quantity of \"Indian Biscuits\" were stolen. I might here state that it was uncertain that these biscuits are only issued to the Indians during the school time, and not during the regular holidays of July and August. In this connection also please refer to the attached the caption of \"D. & R.\", with intent (444) of Dallas School No. 197, Dallas District, Man., wherein it will be noted that one of these biscuits was placed up by the writer outside the school. This school was checked by the caretaker, Leonard McKee of Dallas District, Man., on the 22-6-45, at which time it was in order, and it was found that the biscuits were missing. When the biscuit in question was also found, it would therefore appear to be evident that the Fisher River Indian Day School was broken into during the week between the 22-6-45, and the 30-6-45, and also by the same party or parties.\n\n19. It might here be stated that it is alleged that there is a desertion from the army, the name of Morris LAMBERT, appears in the bush encampment in the Dallas District, Man. (reference file under the caption of: Deserter, Military Service, Morris LAMBERT, No. 10, District South - Edmonton, \"P\" File, File No. 439 1165-2-108, Exp. 5/37, File No. 447-69). This man is well known criminal, and there would appear to be little doubt that he is stopping in the Dallas district, about 4 miles from the Fisher River Indian Day School, and is therefore a logical suspect in this case. However, I have so far been unable to obtain any information whatsoever as to where his camp might be.\n\n20. It will be noted from paragraph 6 of this report that the serial number of the radio in question is not known, but that same was purchased from the Honorable James G. McFARLANE, Esq., Winnipeg, Man., in the fall of 1944, by Mr. John B. HILL of Big Creek, Man. I would therefore respectfully request that a check be made by a member of Winnipeg detachment to ascertain what records, if any, they have of this sale, and if they have the serial number of this radio on file.\n\n21. Form 55-1 has been forwarded direct to the Home Opwond Section, \"D\" Division, R.C.M.P., Winnipeg, Man.\n\n22. Enquiries in this matter are being continued, and a further report will be submitted in due course.\n\nSd./s:\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It was further learned on checking that one of the boxes of \"Indian Biscuits\" had been opened and about half of the box of biscuits taken. These biscuits are issued to the school by the Department of Indian Affairs, and their value could not be ascertained.\n\n8. Examination was made to see if any possible fingerprints could be found, and it appeared that some of the cups and cooking utensils had some partial prints on them. These were taken to Winnipeg on the 31-8-45, where they were checked by Sgt. J.H. Godkin, F.P.S., who stated that the only prints to be found on them were fragments, and not suitable for comparison purposes and were useless to this investigation.\n\n9. No tracks or other marks could be found that would assist this investigation in any way.\n\n10. I might here mention that this school is practically completely surrounded by trees, and is set back about 50 yards from the main road going by foot. Dalhousie, Man., to Keestatik, Man., being about 14 miles from the Keestatik Post Office. The nearest dwellings to the school are the residence of the Rev. Gordon J. BICKELL, in charge of the Mission at Fisher River, Man., whose home is about 150 yards south-east of the school, and the dwelling of Gladys (Mrs. Fred) KIRKNESS, whose home is about 150 yards north-west of the school.\n\n11. I interviewed Mr. BICKELL and his daughter, Marjory, and his son, Ivan, who are stopping with him, but none of them had observed anything suspicious in or near the school, and had not even known that same had been broken into until informed of the fact.\n\n12. Gladys (Mrs. Fred) KIRKNESS and her sister, Elizabeth McKAY, who is stopping with her, were also interviewed, but were unable to give any information of value to this case.\n\n13. Enquiries were made around the neighborhood, but no-one was able to give any information regarding this matter.\n\n14. A check was made of all local suspects, and youngsters whom it was thought might have had a hand in this offence, but without result.\n\nP.Y.O.\nIn the fall of the 30-46, information was received from Mr. William F. Ross of Kootenay P.O., District, B.C., to the effect that the Fisher River Indian Day School at Fisher River, Man., had been broken into, and a quantity of goods stolen.\n\nI immediately patrolled per R.O. Order No. 2770 to the Fisher River District, where the teachers of the school, Misses Victoria Harkness of Shuswap District, B.C., and Miss Mildred Ross of Elm Creek, Man., were interviewed.\n\nThese teachers informed me that they had both taught at this school during the winter and spring terms of 1945, and had left the school on the 15th of April, having locked the school before leaving. They had returned to the school in the evening of the 29-46, and had found that it had been broken into, entrance having apparently been gained through a basement window at the right front of the building.\n\nI might here state that this school consists of two class-rooms which open onto a hall in the middle. The front door of this school opens onto this hall, and the back of the hall is a door leading into the living quarters, where the teachers live. This room is used as the kitchen, and there is a stairway leading upstairs from the kitchen, and there are four bedrooms upstairs, although only three of them are in any way furnished, each of the teachers using a separate room, and one room being kept as a sitting-room or store-room. The stairway down to the basement is in the hall. There is a full basement to the building, and at the back is a room where various canned foods are kept. In the hall-way are stored what are known as \"Indian biscuits\", which are made by Watson's in Toronto. These biscuits are about 6 inches in diameter and half an inch thick, and are shipped in 25 lb. boxes. There were 6 boxes of these biscuits in the hall.\n\nThe teachers informed me that when they arrived at the school in the evening of the 29-46, they found that the key to the back door, which had been left in the lock on the inside of the door, was missing. Their beds upstairs had been slept in. Soup and onions had been cooked in the kitchen, traces of same being found in several tin cups. A pair of old felt socks, such as are used by most of the residents of the district during the winter, were in the fire-box of the kitchen range.\n\nThey had made a thorough check and so far as they could find out, the following had been stolen:\n\n1.

I thought this unusual call as the Indians agent happened to be in the school at the time. I mentioned this matter to him. He informed me that a new system was in force and therefore upon receiving such information forwarded the cheques to our separate savings account. Today I am in receipt of a cheque from the Home Mission Board of the United Church of Canada for salary to end of June quarter.\nOttawa, May 17th, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, regarding the cheques which you received in payment of salary of yourself and Mrs. Teng for the quarter ended March 31st, last, as teachers at the Fisher River Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, through error, these cheques were sent direct to you instead of to the Treasurer of the United Church of Canada, Toronto. It will adjust matters if you return to the Church authorities the amount of the cheques which you received concerning salary for the March quarter. When your returns of attendance, etc., for the current quarter ending June 30th, next, are received, cheques in payment of salary will be forwarded to the Treasurer of the United Church.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nW.

Tong, teachers at the Fisher River Indian Day School, cheques covering their salary for the quarter ended March 31st, last, instead of sending same to the Treasurer of the United Church of Canada.\n\nA communication has been received from Mr. Tong, in which he states that he deposited these cheques to their separate savings accounts and that, subsequently, cheques were received from the Home Mission Board of the United Church for salaries due Mr. and Mrs. Tong, requesting Mr. Tong to refund to you one quarter's salary to himself and Mrs. Tong. When returns are received from this school for the quarter ending June 30th, next, cheques in payment of the teachers' salaries will be sent to you as Treasurer of the United Church of Canada.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev.

Her resignation is effective at the close of the present month.\n\nOn the nomination of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada, the Department is approving the appointment of Miss Stevens to be the teacher of the junior room for the period January 1st to June 30th, 1935. It should be distinctly understood with Miss Stevens that her appointment is only for the six months mentioned. You should, also, inform her that it is the Department's wish that she spend part of the current month in the classroom observing Miss Gardin's methods.\n\nThe salary allowed Miss Stevens for the six months of her engagement will be at the rate of $85 a teaching month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

(RG 10, Volume 6233, file 511-3, part 1)\nJuly 28, 1936.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nReferring to memoranda of the 5th and 10th instant, regarding the teaching services at the Fisher River Indian Day School (located in the Electoral District of Selkirk), I would say it is noted you direct that the services of Mr. W. G. Long be retained.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of memorandum of the 5th instant, you approved the replacement of Miss Raymondite R. Stevens, the assistant teacher. The authorities of the United Church of Canada now withdraw their original nominations, and, as Mr. Long's services are being retained, they request that Miss Stevens also be retained for a further period. The reason is that there is no place in the community where the junior teacher can be found except in the home of the missionary, who is the father of Miss Stevens.\n\nI am therefore of the opinion that it would be in the interests of all concerned to make no change in the teaching services for the present time and that Miss Stevens be re-engaged. I submit the matter of her re-engagement for your approval.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, August 1, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that it has been decided to retain the services of Mr. W. G. Tong as senior teacher and Miss Marguerite M. Stevens as junior teacher at the Fisher River Indian Day School. They should both resume duties when the school reopens after the present holidays - on September third, next. Salary will be allowed them at the same rate as previously paid.\n\nPlease give these teachers any assistance you can in their work at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

In their place, I beg to nominate, for the senior room, Miss Mildred Enns. Miss Enns is about 23, has had three years' teaching experience and expects to have her permanent teaching certificate this fall. For the junior room, I beg to nominate Miss Susan Suderman. She has already taught one year on a permit in Manitoba.\n\nWe regret that we cannot get teachers with normal training but, as a matter of fact, there are, I understand, some eight hundred schools in Manitoba now being taught by untrained teachers.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD:EWS\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, advising us of the resignation of the two teachers at the Red Deer River Indian Day School. These resignations are accepted and the Indian Agent is being advised that we approve the appointment of Miss Mildred Bann as teacher of the senior room and Miss Susan Sudeman as teacher of the junior room. The former will be allowed salaries of $100 a teaching month, plus bonus, and the latter at $90 a teaching month, plus bonus.\n\nYours truly,\n\nFor Deputy Minister.\n\nRev. Geo.

Mr. McCay had seen the school himself, he & Mr. Haffie considered himself relieved from any further business with the matter, so that there has been a misunderstanding between Mr. Haffie and McCay with regards the reporting of the completion of the building. I have waited for a brief time for Mr. McCay to come in, but since last night by his wife here who is in, that Mr. McCay will not be in this hall, but Mr. Haffie is in Winnipeg she promised me that he would call at your office & explain the matter to you, he is to leave Winnipeg tomorrow, but will telephone him to see you before he leaves.\n\nTrusting dear sir, you will do your best for me on the matter \u2014 I remain\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ross Esq., M.P.,\nGovernment House, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI hope I wont be intruding to much on your valuable time by asking your assistance regarding a little trouble between myself and the Indian department. The trouble is regarding the building of a School house at Fisher River on Lake Winnipeg. First I entered into a contract with the Department through Mr. Inspector W. Hall about the 25th of May 1877 to build the School according to plans & specifications furnished by the department, which contract had to be completed & reported to Inspector W. Hall at the Indian Office Winnipeg or or before the 30th of June. Agent McKay of Berens river was to be the Officer in charge and from him I was to get the certificate for the buildings completion so that on my way to Fisher when going out with my buffal to build the School, I sent a note to Agent McKay notifying him that the School would be finished on the 24th of May and requested him to be there on that date to inspect the building, so that he called on me to inspect the School on the 26th but the building was not quite completed. But he said the reason he called before the 24th was that he was on his way to Winnipeg to arrange for the coming Treaty. And told me that he would not be at Fisher river until he came there to the Treaty which was set to meet about the middle of July, so I pointed out to him the bad position it would leave me in if the building was not reported on according to the contract which report should be in by the 30th of June. So he suggested that he would ask the Revd. Mr. McAffie the missionary there to see in his place regarding the overseeing of the work.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6233, file 511-5, part 1)\nwork & to give me a certificate to Inspector McCall as soon as he was satisfied that everything was done according to the contract. So I very gladly accepted his suggestion, but before going further I requested Agent McRay to thoroughly examine the building which was finished on the outside. This he did & at the same time seeing the plans & specifications for reference &c. He expressed himself well satisfied with the whole work. So he then asked the missionary to act for him & to give me a certificate to Mr. McCall as soon as he was satisfied that everything was done in fulfillment of the contract. This Mr. McAffie agreed to do & afterwards acted as overseer on the work. This was the last favor of Agent McRay.\n\nI would now like to point out to you that after Mr. McAffie was in charge that I was in the act of putting down the platform in the school when the teacher said he would rather not have a platform so he turned the matter over with Mr. McAffie & they wished me not to put in the platform. Then again I looked out special lumber with me to make the required blackboards & table for the School, but the teacher being a carpenter himself had very promptly made two blackboards & a table for the old School which he showed me & they were equally as good as new. So he, the teacher requested me that if I would make him a cupboard for the School I put a lock on the doors so that he could keep the biscuits away from the children. That he would put his blackboards & table in the new School. So Mr. McAffie being satisfied I accepted the proposition & immediately on my return to Selkirkton I made the cupboard & sent it back by the same boat that brought us here. So I completed the work of the School in the 24th of June & Mr. McAffie was well satisfied & gave me a certificate to Inspector McCall.\nin every respect than collect for, & the stone wall under the porch were he say there is no stone in the highest stonework of all on account of the ground been lower at that end of the building. & the lumber all through was the best bill of lumber that ever I saw go out of this yard.

He is correct in that he has now remedied the existing condition by having them made warmer by following the directions given in my memo of the 17th July 92. The hail holes in the outer & inner linings would have to be properly stopped with putty - Mr. McColl seems to think that it is better not to do this to the existing building, but in all future buildings to have the extra lining put on. He informs the Dept. that he has written to the Contractor to have the back and clothes hooks renewed on the Fisher River School.\n\nMr. McColl considers that the siding (i.e., outside) should be trimmed & grooved and matched instead of merely clipping each other. This would be an extra expense and pleasure would be better - but this way they...\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa,\n\nSheetings are put on in a matter of material moment. Carelessness in construction, with no proper party to see to the work while being constructed is one of the principal things to ensure a good building. The specified Chip Boards if well put on should answer the purpose for these buildings.\n\nAgain he objects to the position of the Door and the placing of the seats. The former is the Door being on one side of the porch of the building admits of a good window being placed on one side of it in the main building. Also being a more convenient way of breaking the cold drafts of winter blowing in when the doors were opened upon the children. And as regards the seats, for the width of the building, the School architecture published by the educational Dept. in Ontario shows that the three row is used, as regards the ventilation it is just the ordinary mode in these buildings by letting air in at windows below and the bad air to escape by a small trap in the ceiling of the school room.

Van Koughnich Esq.\nDeputy Superintendent\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6233, file 511-5, part 1)\nWho will corroborate the following statement, as they assisted me in the inspection of the Schoolhouse, and are therefore witnesses of its actual condition.\n\nThe foundation of the Schoolhouse and of this porch, in connection therewith, is made of stone laid in mortar of lime and sand, and not of dry-laid stone, as represented by Mr. Agent Rockingham. There are no spring clocks nor any other clocks under the porch. The floor of the schoolhouse is perfectly level, for it was found to be so, according to my examination of it with a spirit level furnished me by the Rev. [signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6233, file 511-5, part 1)\nMr. McNaughton. It is impossible to ascertain without taking up the floor, whether Cedar Posts are just under the Centre Pillar or not. Mr. McNaughton is under the impression that Cedar Posts were placed there as the Contractor bought them and with him for that purpose. The siding is overlapping each other about an inch and a half an inch on an average. The grooving on the boards of the ceiling is about an inch and a half an inch, but the lumber not having been properly seasoned has shrunk considerably since it has been placed in the building. There are six knotholes about an inch wide in diameter, and...\nand about twelve small pine beams in the ceiling of the building, but no knotholes in the flooring, but the teacher informs me that no downspout was done to convey disks, nor anything else from drippings from pine beams. The flooring is of an and a-half inch lumber and is made of the best pine lumber available in these parts, in fact the lumber used in the whole building with the exception of a few boards with knotholes and pine beams could not reasonably be expected to be of better quality of species.\n\nThe windows are well fitted, but badly fitted in...\nCasing, and the storm windows were not fitted at all, as they were not even unpacked by the contractor. There is no opening in the casing on outside of the windows to place the storm windows properly on the windows, consequently it is impossible to keep the schoolhouse warm without properly fitting the windows and storm windows in their places, for the cold air comes into the building between the windows and casings without anything to obstruct its ingress. There is no platform for the teacher in rear of the school-room nor a blackboard furnished by the contractor as required by the plan and specifications of the building furnished.\nFurnished him for his residence, but he supplied a cupboard for holding a couple of cases of biscuit instead of these omission which is not worth more than $5.2. This cupboard is made of pine lumber and is 4 ft long, 3 ft high and 13 inches deep with one shelf in it.\n\nThe schoolroom is supplied with three clockboards taken from the old schoolhouse, and therefore no more is required for the present but there is no credit due to the contractor for these, as he had nothing to do with furnishing them.\n\nThe platform in front of the church is 9 ft long, 4 inches wide and is made of...\nsuch thinner boards; nailed to five cross-pieces 2 x 6 inches in size. These joints are resting on 6 x 6 inch scantlings. The outer side of these scantlings is resting at an angle on the ground and at the other side a piece of a scantling of the same size, and the inner scantling is nailed to the sill of the building. There is a step made of a wide board running along the whole length of the front of the platform to it. The jointing of the boarding fairly, but somewhat roughly done. There appears to be sufficient joint used if properly put on.\n\nThe backway, backs and clothes hooks are perfectly worthless, as represented by Mr. Agent MacKay.\nIn conclusion, I would recommend that the sixty dollars left back from the contractor be not paid him, but that amount be expended in providing proper locks (two for outer or porch door, and another for the inner or school-room door) these locks to be the full or American ones; the storms and the other windows to be properly fitted; the backway to be made larger and properly fitted and furnished with hinges and staples & hooks; and good strong clothes hooks made of cast steel attached thereto. The holes in the ceiling and behind to be properly plugged up with wooden pins, and a thicker plate-form...\nForm placed in the school room according to the plans and specifications furnished the contractor. The only thing which can be done to remedy the shrinkage of the ceiling, if the school house is too cold after fixing the windows is to place two layers over the ceiling and seal it over again on top of this two layers, for it is worse than useless to attempt to take off the present ceiling in order to put the boards close again for the taking out of the nails from this thin ceiling would split and destroy it altogether.\n\nI have the honor,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Coll's letter shows that he lately visited the Fisher River school house and that he found a number of things that had not been done in accordance with the specifications and he therefore recommends doing so immediately. I would recommend that the sixty dollars kept back from the Contractor be not paid him, but that amount be expended in providing proper locks to the school house.\n\nI am therefore respectfully submitting Mr. W.

Beard who is drilling in the vicinity of Hodgeson at the present time.\n\nMr Beard's offer is as follows:\n\nDrilling $3.00 per foot\nCasing 1.25 \"\nPump and Head 25.00\nPump-piping .27\u00bd \"\nMoving outfit, actual cost, receipts to be submitted.\nBoard for two men, actual cost, receipts to be submitted.\n\nIn reference to the moving Mr Beard has explained that it takes four teams to move his outfit and that he cannot have his own two teams for this as they would be idle for too long a period while drilling and that the only method he can follow is to hire for the necessary moving to and from the work required.\n\nThe above offer is for one well at Fisher River or for four wells; three upon the Peguis Reserve.\n\nMr Beard would like to be advised of the decision of the Department as soon as possible as the work he has in the Hodgeson district will soon be completed.\n\nI have the honour to be your obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent,\nFisher River Agency.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nLast July, a request was received from Rev. T. Ferrier to have a well dug at the Fisher River Indian Day School. The Agent was asked to furnish an estimate of the cost of the work, and he states that the well at the Agency, which was dug in 1915, cost $580.00, and that the school is further from the river than the Agency.\n\nIn February last, he suggested that if the Department was considering the drilling of a well at Fisher River, it would be advisable at the same time to arrange for the drilling of wells at each of the three schools on the Peguis Reserve.\n\nHe now submits an offer which he has received from Mr. W. J. Beari, who has a well drilling outfit and is at present working in the vicinity of the Peguis Reserve. The offer submitted is as follows:\n\n- Drilling: $3.00 per ft.\n- Casing: $1.25\n- Pump and Head: $25.00\n- Pump-piping: $.27\n\nBesides, there would be the cost of moving the outfit and board for two men. The Agent is unable to state the depth it would be necessary to drill at each of these schools to obtain a good supply of water, but it would probably cost from $400.00 to $500.00 per well.\n\nAt present the water supply for these schools is obtained from the river, which is stated to be unfit for use. There has never been any wells at these schools and, no doubt, they are needed, but as our funds will be limited this year and there will be many calls, it is doubtful whether the expenditure mentioned should be made. These schools have got along with the present arrangements for obtaining water, and I consider that until funds can be found the question of digging these wells might remain in abeyance.\n\nHowever, I shall be glad to have your views on\nOTTAWA, May 6th, 1921.\n\nLast July, a request was received from the Rev. Mr. Ferrier to have a well dug at the Fish River Indian Day School. Mr. Agent Carter was asked to furnish an estimate of the cost of having the work done.

We will be glad to receive at your convenience any information regarding this matter, and whether you consider the work be proceeded with.\n\nWe also state whether you consider the well satisfactory one for doing the work to be drilled.

Schools.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. dated\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nReferring to Department letter No. 136/2 of the 6th inst., stating that a request had been received from Reverend T. Perrier to have a well dug at the Fisher River Indian Day School, and that Mr. Agent Carter has been requested to furnish an estimate of the cost of having the work done, which estimate is submitted in your letter; when I received your letter, it seemed rather strange to me that we should be asked to have wells dug at the three schools where they were situated on the banks of a running river, and knowing the Indians state that they will not use well water if they can get water from a stream or river, I thought it well to investigate the matter. When Mr. Christianson was on the Fisher River Agency investigating other matters, I asked him to go into this matter of water supply at the schools, and ascertain how they had been getting water in the past, and the necessity for digging wells.\n\nMr. Christianson tells me the three schools are situated on the banks of the Fisher River, that the stream is rapid and runs over rocks and sand, and that he took samples and had them examined by the Bacteriological Branch of the Provincial Board of Health of Winnipeg, who state that it contains bacterial dusted from forage and is not injurious for drinking. Inspector Bunnin reporting on this matter states that the water can be classed as a good, healthy water. My own opinion is that if the Department were to sink wells at this place they would never be used, and I think the Department can figure on a saving here of between $1000 and $5000.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nD.C.

G. Gray\nRosetts\n\nTo Department Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nGentlemen,\n\nRespectfully request to bring your notice that the walls of the school house and living rooms are badly in need of repainting. I mentioned this fact to the agent and he advised me to write direct to your office. It appears that other than the kitchen nothing has been done since the school was built. The kitchen was done years ago by an Indian, whose charge was out of season, seeing that the kitchen would be kept in a dry state quite willing to do the whole building for the small sum of $25 plus half a crown and 2 shillings. This would consider a good time to have it done, should my proposition meet with your approval.\n\nYours,\nYour obedient servant\nW. G. Gray\nSir:-\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, drawing the attention of the Department to certain renovations required to the walls of the classrooms and living rooms at the Fisher River Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of having the walls calcimined. It is noted that you will undertake to perform the labour needed in carrying out this work, for the sum of $25.00, the necessary material to be supplied. We are requesting Mr. Agent McCuish to purchase the calcimine and brushes and to have them delivered to you. We are also instructing him, upon completion of the work, to forward properly certified vouchers in duplicate covering the amount allowed for labour and for the cost of the material.\n\nIt is expected that a satisfactory job will be completed by you in renovating these walls. You will, no doubt, hear from the local Indian agent, who will be asked to supply you with the material at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. G. Tong, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nFisher River Indian Day School,\nKoostatak, Man.\nOttawa, Nov. 15, 1922.\n\nSir:-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Mr. W. G. Tong, Teacher of the Fisher River Indian Day School, in which he drew attention to the need for certain renovations being made in the walls of the schoolroom and living rooms. He states that the walls should be calcimined, and he has agreed to perform the labour required for the sum of $25.00.\n\nThe Department will approve of having this work undertaken and completed at as early a date as possible. Will you please arrange for the purchase and delivery to the teacher of the quantity of calcimine needed, also two brushes. If the expenditure for this purpose exceeds the sum of $10, it will be necessary for you to obtain competitive prices; the purchase of the above materials should be made from the firm quoting the lowest price. You might consult the teacher as to the colour he desires.\n\nWhen the work has been completed, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the amount to be paid Mr. Tong for the labour, viz: $25.00, as well as the cost of the material supplied. It is expected that Mr. Tong will do the work of putting on the calcimine in a satisfactory manner.\n\nThe purchase of the above material should receive your early attention, in order that the work can be carried out as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nM.

The South wall starting at the South West corner is cracked about the same distance from the top and extending about half way across the basement wall, this wall is also dividing from top to bottom one half projecting in, the other half projecting out. Not being a building expert or an architect I am not able to say why this has happened, but venture the statement that it is caused from three causes. First poor material used in construction, poor workmanship and thirdly the ground expanding and has the frost went down into the ground the wall was gradually pushed into the basement. As a precautionary measure I have engaged a builder to come and living outside the reserve and reinforce the South and West wall with square bridge timbers to prevent the collapse of the building and I would recommend that a competent person be sent to Fisher River School at an early date to examine the whole foundation and furnish estimates of the material required for permanent repairs, in order to have the material delivered there on the ground before the 1st of March, as the gravel will have to be teamed from the shores of Lake Winnipeg a distance of 2\u00bd Miles, also the cement will have to be teamed from Hodgson during the winter months.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nyour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nM.

SCOTT,\n\nIndian Agent McQuish has reported that the foundation of the west wall of the Fisher River Day School has cracked the full length of the building, about 18\" below the ground; the portion below the ground is leaning in, and the portion above the ground is leaning out. The South wall also started to crack and endangering the collapse of the building. As a precautionary measure the Indian Agent has employed a bridge carpenter to repair the South and West walls with timbers to prevent the cracks. In order to remedy this condition and make the building safe, it will be necessary to rebuild the foundation of the building, at an approximate cost of $1,000.00.\n\nAs the gravel required for mixing the concrete will have to be teamed from the shores of Lake Winnipeg, a distance of seven miles, and the cement required from Hudson during the winter months, I beg to recommend that the Indian Agent be authorized to purchase the gravel and cement required, after obtaining competitive prices, and have the materials delivered this winter in order that the work may be carried out early in the spring.\n\nThe Schools Branch have made a note of $1,000.00 in the estimates to cover this work.\n\n[Signature]\n\nARCHITECT.\nJanuary 3, 1922.\n\nMemorandum,-\n\nHon.

You should purchase the materials at once in order that they may be delivered this winter.\n\nWhen the cement arrives, it is very important that it be stored in a perfectly water-tight place. In purchasing the gravel and cement, competitive prices should be obtained and the materials purchased from the firm quoting the lowest price.\n\nIn figuring the materials required, it will be on the basis of mixing concrete in the proportion of one part of cement to four of gravel. The gravel should be perfectly clean and free from loam or other foreign substances, and no stones larger than will pass through a 3\" ring. It is also very important that the gravel used in mixing the concrete is free from alkalis.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nE. B. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nM.

He states that although the furnace is equipped with a large hot air pipe, the entrance for hot air into the west room is only about 6 inches wide. It should be possible to have the furnace overhauled and put in good condition in order that it will heat the building.

M. McGuish Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6233, file 511-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSir,\n\nI again wish to refer to the basement under the Fisher River Day School, of which I wrote to you on Dec 15, and your letter 136-2-5 of the 10th inst in reply.\n\nI now wish to advise that I have examined the foundation under this building very thoroughly, and as far as my knowledge of building goes, I would say that the whole of this foundation needs to be taken out and reconstructed. I have also looked up a portion of the cement basement floor, and find that the present foundation is built on mud, which there is a thickness of about seventeen inches, under that is hardpan, very unable, after my examination further owing to water coming into the hole, that I found in the floor; but by testing with a sharp pick, I do not think it is more than a few inches to the rock; this I cannot state definitely. This test satisfied me that before a new wall is put in, some under drainage will be required to be provided for.\n\nWhile in Fisher River I took the opportunity of visiting the Lake Shore where the gravel will be procured, this is a high grade washed gravel; but hard to get at. I also interviewed a man who has been quoted for prices for gravel delivered at the school building, at so much per cubic yard. The only bid I received which I would consider was from Joe Williams on at three dollars and fifty cents per yard. The greatest difficulty in accepting a price for gravel, is they have not got the horse power, to with any degree of certainty deliver the gravel by the break up of sleighing. During the Spring and Summer months teaming over this road would be an impossibility.\n\nIn your letter 136-2-5 of the 10th inst you did not state the thickness of the wall required. The size of the building is seventy feet by thirty two inside measurement, with two dividing walls thirty two feet long. I do not know if these walls would have to be removed, or if they could be undermined, in places, and supported, to build under.\n\nThe floor space will be thirty two by seventy feet, and the thickness is not stated in your former letter.\n\nPlease inform me by night letter, or otherwise the amount of material, that tenders should be asked for.\n\nThe cement upon arrival will be stored in the old school house, which is perfectly watertight. I have had the entire building supported with tamarack bridge timbers, this is a precautionary measure, as each visit I make to this building, the foundation is cracking in new places.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nyour obedient servant,\n\nM. McCuish\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nNote:\nHeight of wall 8 ft above present floor.\nOttawa, January 29, 1923.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 23rd inst., with further reference to the rebuilding of the basement under Fisher River Day School, I beg to say that the outside foundation walls should be rebuilt 13\" thick, and the floor laid 6\" thick of concrete, finished with 1\" of cement, in the proportion of two of sand and one of cement, trowelled to a smooth surface.\n\nWith reference to the two interior supporting walls, it might be more economical if these have to be rebuilt, to build in a 6 x 12 wood beam supported on wooden posts, spaced approximately 10' apart. If this style of construction is used, it will be necessary to build a suitable concrete footing under each of the posts in order to avoid any settlement. The following is an approximate list of materials required:\n\n**OUTSIDE WALLS:** (13\" thick) 60 cubic yards of gravel; and 75 barrels of cement.\n\n**FLOOR:** (6\" thick) 30 cubic yards of gravel; and 37 barrels of cement.\n\nIf two inside supporting walls are rebuilt of concrete 12\" thick, the following materials will be required: 15 cubic yards of gravel, and 9 barrels of cement.\n\nEvery effort should be made to have these materials delivered before the spring in order that the foundation of this school may be put in a safe and satisfactory condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J. D. McLean)\nAss't Deputy and Secretary.\n\nM. McQuish, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHalfway P.O., MAN.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI understand that the Department are preparing to put a new foundation under the Fisher River Day School. This building is a good building but the foundation is wrecked. The plan seems to be to just dig out, take out the present walls and floor of the basement and rebuild the same. I have been informed that the rock formation is not far below the present depth. The foundation should be on the stone or the footings must be below the frost line. The whole of the basement should be well drained with tile out to the river bank. To do this you will require about 700 sacks of cement and 125 yards of gravel. This would give a mixture of about one to five, which would be quite strong enough if the gravel is clean and the cement is fresh.\n\nI am simply offering this as a bit of information.\n\nWhen this is being done it would be well to have the connection from the farm air pipes to each class-room enlarged. There is a 20\" pipe from the furnace to the floor of the class-room and from there up to the grate the passage is in a pipe in a space made by a 2 x 4 scantling with a 14 or 16\" centre. The grate is large enough to accommodate the 20\" pipe. This can easily be done by an extension in the cloak-rooms and leave the wall of the class-room in each case untouched. These funnels should have been removed instead of putting a stove in each class-room.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I think is the proper time to make any alterations, as the furnace is not in the right place, and part of the wall will have to be removed in order to give greater range for the heat from the furnace to enter the Day School Room. I would not care to venture an estimate for the cost of the same.\n\nReferring to the 4th paragraph of the letter I beg to report that I have placed an order for blinds for the Junior Room, and has suggested to the teacher that the desks be placed Westward, in accordance with the Inspector's recommendation.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nyour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nM. McCuish,\nIndian Agent.\nOTTAWA, February 24th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, regarding the unsatisfactory condition of the furnace at the Fisher River Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that any alterations or changes in the position of the furnace should be carried out at the time the repairs to the basement walls are being undertaken in the spring. You should draw this matter to the attention of the Department in time to authorize the carrying out of the work when the basement repairs are being made. At the same time you should state what alterations are required to the furnace to place it in good condition, and to provide a satisfactory heating arrangement for the school. It is presumed that, if certain alterations are made to the present furnace, it can be made satisfactory, and it will not be necessary to obtain a new furnace.\n\nWe note that you have placed an order for the blinds for the junior classroom, and also that the change in the desks, as recommended by the Inspector, will be carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nM. McCuish, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Halfway P.O., Man.\nWinnipeg 22nd February, 1923.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nI have asked for competitive prices for the cement of a recognized Portland brand, to be used at the Fisher River Day School, from the several firms named in your letter, number and date as given above.\n\nThe Commercial Cement Co. quote a product of cement that they manufacture themselves, and known as Commercial Cement. It is a little cheaper than Portland. I have made inquiry about it, and I am informed that it is immune from alkali action. It has been used quite a lot and has given satisfaction I am informed.\n\nWith the quandary of taking Commercial Cement at the lower price as against Portland at a higher price, I decided to ask you by wire, which I should purchase. I beg now to confirm my wire of last evening, which was as follows:\n\n\"Car Portland Cement costs four hundred and seventy-eight dollars.\"\n\"Car Commercial Cement costs four hundred and thirty-four dollars.\"\n\"Later immune from alkali action. Which shall I purchase.\"\n\nPlease advise what action to take. The above prices are all F.O.B. at Hodgson, the nearest railway point to where these supplies will be used.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nWinnipeg 2nd March, 1923.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nThe attached voucher # 2480 of Lake Winnipeg Inspectorate, covers the cost of Cement purchased to make repairs on the foundation of the Fisher River Indian Day School, on Fisher River Indian reserve.\n\nI beg to point out that the quantity purchased is 124 bbls, the letter of authority called for 114 bbls. Agent McCusker noted the discrepancy and informed me that it would require 12 bbls more, so I added the quantity, with the intention of submitting my action for approval, when I made explanation of why I did this.\n\nThe price is given on the attached abstract of tenders, and I have deducted the discount quoted, and submit the account thus corrected for settlement.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nyour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n| ARTICLES | FIRMS ASKED TO QUOTE | REMARKS |\n|----------|----------------------|---------|\n| Portland Cement | Canada Cement Co., Winnipeg Supply Co., Board McNally | Hos Jackson Sons |\n| 405 tons @ $1.15 | 405 tons @ $1.15 | 405 tons @ $1.15 |\n| 405 tons @ $1.15 | 405 tons @ $1.15 | 405 tons @ $1.15 |\n| 405 tons @ $1.15 | 405 tons @ $1.15 | 405 tons @ $1.15 |\n| 405 tons @ $1.15 | 405 tons @ $1.15 | 405 tons @ $1.15 |\n| 405 tons @ $1.15 | 405 tons @ $1.15 | 405 tons @ $1.15 |\n| 405 tons @ $1.15 | 405 tons @ $1.15 | 405 tons @ $1.15 |\n| 405 tons @ $1.15 | 405 tons @ $1.15 | 405 tons @ $1.15 |\n| 405 tons @ $1.15 | 405 tons @ $1.15 | 405 tons @ $1.15 |\n\nNote Quotation is by the Bbl. or Cloth Sacks.\n\nOrder placed and marked above.\n\nI recommend that lowest tenders, as underlined, which have been accepted, be approved\u2014tenders marked with circle not satisfactory, for reasons given in remarks column.\n\nSigned: [Signature]\n\nDate: Feb 23\n\nIndian Affairs.

N. Moyer Co. Ltd. In order to have uniformity in the seating arrangements, it will be necessary to purchase the same type of desk as at present in use. You may therefore place an order with the E. N. Moyer Co. Ltd., 110-120 Princess St., Winnipeg, for the supplying of the 10 single desks needed. In placing this order, be careful to give the exact number or the size of desk desired, and the prices charged should include freight charges to the nearest railway station to the school. Please retain accounts which you will be good enough to certify and forward to the Department in order that payment can be made. Also furnish the firm with full shipping directions and, when the desks arrive, you should see that they are taken to the school and set up in the classroom.\n\nThe teacher also requested that 50 cakes of carbolic soap be supplied, or one for each family. If you consider it necessary, you may purchase a small quantity for the use of the school children, but we are not prepared to furnish soap for each family.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

April 19th 1923\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 166, amounting to $24.85 in favour of Hodgson Trading Co.\n\nfor Supplies for Fisher River Day School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 136-2-5 dated Feb. 20th 1923.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. M. McQuish\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDallas, Man.\nApril 10th 1923\n\nM. McCuish Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHalfway P.O.,\nMan.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nHaving examined the furnace in Fisher River Day School I have come to the conclusion that the present state of the basement wall is largely due to the faulty installation of the furnace and I would recommend reconstructing the basement that the present cress walls be substituted by pillars in order to let the hot air circulate through the play room in the basement. The furnace at present in use is too small. The firebox will not hold fuel enough to keep fire all night. The consequence is the furnace has to be fired to full capacity, which is very wasteful on fuel. The only two cold air pipes on the furnace get their cold air from outside. A few feet from the outside intake is a cold air register in the hall. Much of the cold air taken from outside enters the building through this register. This pipe from outside should be greatly reduced in size and the size of the flue increased. This would insure a good circulation, and if the present pipe from the outside was reduced to 10 inches, it would give plenty of cold air from the outside. In addition to the two cold air pipes and the new 10 inch fresh air pipe, two 22\" cold air pipes are required to make up the difference in the cold air supply to force a proper circulation, as it is absolutely necessary to take the cold air out of these rooms before you can get a proper circulation. The class room hot air pipes are diminished in size from the elbow below the floor to about 6 ft. above the floor. This should be done away with, and registers put in the floor. The register now in use in the wall would do fine used in the floor. The furnace fireplace is cracked, which lets the smoke circulate through the building. To what extent I could not say as there was a good fire in the furnace when I examined it. If this furnace was properly installed, with the aid of the two box stoves new in use, it should heat the entire building. The water pipe in this furnace should be raised, as it does not evaporate half enough water.\n\nInstalling a larger furnace would be most advisable. All the alterations and additions of pipes are necessary. The best furnace not installed properly would be a failure, under any conditions. For doing this job, which consists of taking down the furnace, putting it in the building, putting it up again, putting in 1.10\" fresh air pipe and damper outside, and 2.22\" cold air pipes and registers in class rooms. Closing up cold air pipe and fitting same in first floor. Increasing one pipe to its proper size. Altering all hot air pipes in class rooms, and lengthening all hot and cold air pipes will cost $75 dollars. This price does not include any repair to the furnace itself. I would recommend that if the same furnace is used that a galvanized casing, and asbestos and tin lined around the furnace instead of brick. This could be done at a slight increase in cost.\n\nThe best price I am able to get on a furnace larger than the one in use, has a capacity of 75,000 cu ft. at a cost of $675 set up plus 4% sale tax. A furnace of this size would require 2350 bricks. Bricks and brickwork extra.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) D. Seebach.\nSir,\n\nI again wish to refer to the furnace in the Fisher River Day School, as requested by you in your letter #136-2-5 of Feb. the 24th last. Also herewith enclose report of Mr. D. Seebach who has had thirty years experience in this work who examined the furnace, and who has submitted to me the following report.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nyour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nM. McCuish,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 9th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo, enclosing copy of a communication which you received from Mr. D. Seebach, regarding the repairs and alterations required to the present furnace and heating system at the Fisher River Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is considered that, if the existing furnace is repaired, as recommended by Mr. Seebach, and the alterations made in the flue and pipes, the deficiency in the present heating system would be overcome. The Department will approve of having this work done in accordance with the report submitted by Mr. Seebach. It will, however, be necessary, if possible, to obtain prices from several persons competent to do the work, and the contract should be given to the one quoting the lowest price. All labour and material required to complete the work should be supplied by the person to whom the contract is given. As you have no doubt, a copy of the report prepared by Mr. Seebach, you will be good enough to see that the work is performed in accordance therewith, and that tenders are called accordingly. It is hoped that when the above recommendations have been carried out, there will be no further trouble in keeping the school in a comfortable condition. When the work has been completed, you will please forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, together with the tenders received.\n\nIt is also hoped that you will take the necessary action to have the repairs required to the outside foundation walls carried out, the material for which has been purchased and forwarded.\n\nThe repairs to the heating plant and foundation should be carried out and completed before the school re-opens after the summer holidays. The Department will expect you to give this matter your personal attention, and see that all work is completed in a satisfactory manner, and as cheaply as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Packer. Mr. Packer is an experienced workman in this line of work.\n\nWhen in Winnipeg during the past month, I called on two contractors; but as this work was so far from the city they did not care to tender for it.\n\nIf this tender is considered too high I respectfully wish to suggest that Mr. Inspector Bunn be asked to ask for tenders in Winnipeg also for the 350 ft. ef agricultural drain pipe and 4 fifty lb. bundles of baling wire.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nyour obedient servant,\n\nM.

The price appears rather high, and I should be pleased to know if you are in a position to engage a competent foreman and the necessary labour and supervise the work from the agency office. The materials which are needed, other than those already purchased or secured by Mr. Inspector Bunn of Winnipeg, please inform the Department, without delay, whether you are in a position to supervise this activity and engage the necessary labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

This firm of contractors have done some work for the Department at Fort Alexander and they now have a contract to erect a residence for the Methodist Mission at Fisher River. Mr. Wyatt will be at Fisher River on the 10th of July and will give me further details of the contract. If you find it convenient to take the work, this firm tell me it will cost in the neighbourhood of $1400. They will also take the lumber and used for casings and any other building material left over, which has been purchased by the Department, at a valuation.\n\nThere is also another firm, of Packer Bros., who wish to tender for the work.\n\nI respectfully wish to recommend that I be authorized to accept either one of these tenders, if they are in the neighbourhood of $1500.00, as I do not think the same work could be done by day work at the same price.\n\nThe Asst.

This cuts down the capacity and will not give service.\n\nThe furnace is too small to handle the building; In this country we rate all furnaces at 60% of the given rating, but if the piping was enlarged and the cold air pipes changed so that the cold air could be taken from the rooms instead of from the outside when the building is unoccupied, the present furnace by forcing could be made to heat the class rooms in coldest weather but it would be necessary to store in the basement to heat it.\n\nWe would suggest the installation of two furnaces one for either side, which arrangement would handle the heating of the basement.\n\nWe would like to hear from you in regard to this matter and if possible receive your instructions to proceed with the work of\nMaking such changes as you may suggest, which we would be pleased to do either under contract or on percentage.\n\nYours very respectfully\n\nWyatt - Ireland Limited\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I presume that the bush around the school, has something to do with it.\n\nThe only remedy would be to add another two or three feet to the top of the chimneys. If I find this is necessary, I would ask your authority to have this done. There are two chimneys on the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

Residence at the South, Centre and North Schools require painting. The Agent figures that it will cost in the neighborhood of Fifty Dollars for each building, and that the work can be done by Indian labour.\n\nThe Fisher River School is in need of a stable. The Agent has already made arrangement for the logs. The cost of purchasing lumber and shingles and erecting the building will be about Sixty Dollars ($60.00).\n\nThe school also needs to be painted outside, and kalsomined and painted inside. The figures I have received from the Agent, in connection with the work, are Three Hundred Dollars ($300.00) for the outside, and One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) for the inside work, the total asked for the School in that agency, being Six Hundred and Ten Dollars ($610.00).\n\nI would like to have your authority to have this work done immediately, as it is urgently required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

BRANDON TRAVELLING NURSE, ON HER VISIT TO THE FISHER RIVER RESERVE IN JANUARY, 1924.\n\nThe noon day lunch is a rather poor one and a number of these children depend upon their two biscuits for this meal. I might mention that the supply ran short and was exhausted by the end of the month of November. Last year they were short for ten weeks and I spoke to the Agent who borrowed enough from the North School, but this would last only ten days with the attendance good. I make note of this circumstance only on account of this being a rather hard year and from now for some little time there will be scarce. I should like to see even a hot drink served at noon time as many walk and run over two miles to school and are on time and attend regularly. A good lunch would mean so much to these pupils, nearly all of whom the Medical officer states are predisposed to T.B. Mrs. Tong takes the girls into the kitchen and have them assist her in other domestic duties and instructs them well. Permit me to recommend that on this account I feel that it would be a workable scheme to give a lunch to all pupils and would beg to make such a recommendation. There are many big teen age girls and boys in attendance to do the duties.\n\nI took the liberty of drawing the attention of your Agent to the heating plant, which does not seem to be a very safe one. A new chimney was built, but feel convinced that some dampers are required, to distribute heat and might say that otherwise I believe the school to be in good condition.\nOttawa, February 28th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nMiss Brandon, Travelling Nurse, in a report on her visit to the Fisher River Agency recommends that, as the noonday lunch brought by the pupils is a rather poor one, a hot drink be provided for them at noon, if Mrs. Toner will take the assignment of the older girls, prepare a hot drink or serve soup. You may arrange for the purchase and delivery of a sufficient amount of cocoa or supplies for the serving of a hot drink or soup to the pupils until the end of April, next. You may also supply a small quantity of sugar, pearl barley and rice for the soup. Should any utensils be required to prepare and serve a lunch, you may also purchase and supply the utensils absolutely necessary. You should take this matter up with Mrs. Toner, and if she will arrange to serve a hot drink or soup, you may purchase the supplies required as above mentioned. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred for the purpose. It is presumed that there are biscuits on hand which could also be served.\n\nMiss Brandon reports that she drew your attention to the heating plant which she states did not seem to her to be quite safe. She states that dampers are required in the new chimney to distribute the heat evenly. You may enquire into this matter and see that the proper changes and alterations are made to overcome any danger and to evenly distribute the heat in the building. No unnecessary expense should be incurred, and properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering any outlay in making any changes in the present heating arrangements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMcKenzie, Acting Agent,\nIndian Affairs,\nThe Halfway P.O.,\nMan.\n\nIndian Affairs.

When the work was in progress it was discovered that the roof of the teacher's residence at the South Peguis school required shingling before painting was undertaken. This work was left until the last in order that it might be ascertained whether the appropriation referred to would cover this. It was found that this would be sufficient and the work was proceeded with.\n\nThere is yet another voucher to submit for $60.00 covering the labour, but I have been directed to return this to the Agent for the insertion of certain further particulars, and it will be forwarded at a later date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nW.

The matters reported in the first paragraph of your letter will be attended to without delay.\n\nWith reference to the second paragraph of your letter referring to the furnaces in the school, I am at a loss to know what to do farther. These two new furnaces were installed by expert mechanics. I again had expert advice, when the new chimney was constructed, and as far as I can understand or find out, these furnaces, and heating apparatus are perfectly satisfactory. As I pointed out to Nurse Brandon on her visit to the above school, that new dampers would be no good if the ones already installed were not made use of. It has got to be a mania that nothing is right about this school, unless there is a continued expenditure.\n\nThe mechanic that installed the new furnaces pointed out to me, that by having no dampers in the hot air pipes there was an even distribution of heat, whereas with dampers in the pipes, where there is no furnace man, such as Fisher River School they are often turned off, and the pipes become heated, and often fires follow. This was pointed out to Nurse Brandon.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nyour obedient servant,\n\nM. McQuish\n\nThe Asst.

I had intended to take Mrs. Murdoch with me but owing to her illness at this time I thought it better not to do so. We arrived in Hodgson by 6 o'clock in the evening. Mr. Stevens, Missionary and myself Friday evening. Mr. McCuish, Indian Agent Fisher River came out to meet us. He managed to get as far as Hodgson with his Ford car. We spent a very pleasant evening there at the home of Mr. McCuish and after careful consideration Mr. McCuish decided that it would be best to start the clinic at Fisher River. We thought it would be a good idea to have as many of the children as possible out on Lake Winnipeg fishing and would not have an opportunity to receive any dental attention should they require it.\n\nAccordingly Rev. Stevens and myself drove down to Fisher River Saturday June 6th while an Indian with his team came along bringing the dental equipment, personal baggage, etc. From Hodgson to Fisher River, I should judge, is nearly thirty miles. This would be too far for ordinary roads but excepting the few miles between the Halfway and Hodgson stations the roads were inscrutable. On several occasions our horses went down and it was a struggle to get them out. This was before the very heavy rains which started on the Sunday after our arrival and continued almost steadily for about eight or nine days.\n\nAfter examining all buildings close to the school I accepted Mr. Stevens' kind offer of the dispensary of the Mission as an operating room in which we could attend to the cases. Tuesday after checking over the school I found 91% with defective teeth. This gave us nearly one hundred children under the ages of eighteen who required dental attention.\n\nMonday I set up my chair and equipment and by Tuesday night the clinic had started. The children came very willingly thanks to the cooperation of Mr. and Mrs. Long the resident teachers at Fisher River.\n\nRight here is a good place to give a slight description of the conditions under which the clinic was conducted. The Mission and school are situated on four acres of clearing which is higher than the surrounding country. Both the school and the Mission on the banks of the Fisher River are about four miles inland from the mouth of the river at Fisher Bay. The buildings are fine and substantial\u2014buildings are log and all well finished inside so that both missionary and teacher have comfortable living quarters. The buildings extend as far up as halfway down to the lowlands along the Bay shore. It is indeed a pretty place in summer and a fine place for mosquitoes. Crossing the river in front of the school in a log foot bridge used by the Indian children when going to and from their day school.\n\nUnfortunately directly the clinic started on the Tuesday noon came the rain so that practically all the children went to bed. This would have made them more inclined to have their trouble after extractions. Indeed in several cases I postponed treatment until another day when I thought it might be dry. Besides the children we had several adults wanting extractions and as they had toothache I could not very well turn them down, in spite of the fact that our clinic was really a children's clinic. In the past Rev. Stevens has had to do a lot of extracting because very often the roads are too bad for the doctor to get down, and when the doctor did happen to be there the chances were that the teeth did not ache and so the patient did not show up. The Indians like a lot of other people do not believe in showing a tooth to a dentist unless it is aching.\n\nDuring my stay in Fisher River it rained nearly every day. The river rose and on the fifth day of my visit the children's foot bridge was impassable. The day before the bridge went the Indian Agent Mr. McCuish who was down to pay out treaty money had a narrow escape from...\nbeing drowned when his buggy upset in midriver and he was thrown put\nin water nearly up to his shoulders with a very rapid current. As\nMr. McQuish has had paralysis he is unable to swim and had he been\ntaken off his feet a rescue would have been difficult indeed in such\na strong current. As it was he lost his blankets and everything in\nthe rig. The treaty money was being carried over the foot bridge or\nit would have gone too.\n\nAgainst all odds, rain and high water, I was kept more than\nbusy during my stay in Fisher River. A test was made of the dental\nwork to see what the cost of a plate would be. While in Fisher River\nI made up two plates for an Indian woman who had the extractions com-\npleted over a year ago. I figured the cost of material approximately\nfive dollars a plate. Of course, this is not the most expensive but\nis something that I think would do for the majority of treaty cases.\nFor the children some two hundred fillings were completed and about the\nsame number of extractions for children and adults. Some forty children\nreceived treatment and there are twice as many more to receive treatment\nat some future date if arrangements can be made.\n\nI had intended to put a clinic on in Dallas on the way back but\nowing to the impassable condition of the roads I did not see how the\nchildren or the white settlers could possibly hope to get to Dallas\nand I accordingly called it off.\n\nOn June 23rd I finally got an Indian to risk his team through\nthe mud as far as the Halfway. Mr. McQuish had figured that we might\ntake it up the river road but thought it useless to do so. The\nequipment is insured for $1000.00 against fire but not against water\nand I felt that neither the Indian Department nor the Red Cross Society\nwould care to be faced with a bill of that size.\n\nSo on Tuesday evening at nine p.m., after a drive of nearly all\nday through pouring rain my Indian teammate and I reached the Halfway\nboth soaked to the skin but our equipment dry, as we had big tarpaulins\nover it.\n\nOn Wednesday I set up my equipment in Dr. Bird's office, the\nresident doctor at Halfway and on Thursday I inspected the Peguis\nreserve schools. We found 95% of the children with defective\nteeth and several with external openings on their throat as a result\nof acute abscesses. I do not believe this condition was all\nwork in outlying districts as much suffering directly caused from dental\nwork as exists in these two reserves. In many cases Peguis was a duplication\nof Fisher River, only the rain had stopped and the roads were much better.\nHere again we were overwhelmed with work and had to turn over a hundred\naway. Even with this we tried hard and myself working until late in the\nevening it was impossible to get anywhere nearly through in the month\nallowed for work among the Indian children. Here again I had a very\nworthy adult case \u2014 a halfbreed veteran of the Gordon's Highlanders in Europe,\nwho I was forced to turn down rather than turn away any more children.\nThe old gentleman was very disappointed, but some day he may be able\nto get a set of teeth. The Department will help him to come to the\ncity but it will cost much more than it would have done if we could\nhave found the time to do it right on the ground, as five dollars\nwould have covered our expenses as far as material was concerned.\n\nBefore closing I wish to mention the case of a boy of fourteen\nwho had been suffering with severe toothache for several years but was\nafraid to have his tooth extracted. As a result he developed an acute\nalveolar abscess, the pus burrowing through and causing ulcers on his\nthroat. Dr. Bird and I gave him good extraction the roots end in three\ndays he was well on the road to recovery. This is only one case out of\nfive that we had during our stay. No wonder the tubercular trouble is\ndeveloping at a rapid rate amongst children living or rather existing\nin these reserves when they have such septic mouths. That is a suffi-\ncient load for the system to fight without the additional load of\ninfluenza and tuberculosis following.\nIn conclusion I wish to thank Mr. and Mrs. McCuish for their kind hospitality at the Hartwood House. Dr. Bird and his humble assistance and Rev. Devons for his hospitality at Fisher River and all the teachers and missionaries for their kind assistance because the results could never have been accomplished without cooperation between us all, I am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(signed) R.

H. Murdoch\nREPORT OF DR. R.H. MURDOCH, JUNIOR RED CROSS DENTIST TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS, OTTAWA, ONTARIO.\n\nFisher River - Halfway House - June 1925.\n\nOn the morning of June 5th I left Winnipeg for Hodgson, Manitoba. I had intended to take Mrs. Murdoch with me but owing to her illness at this time I thought it better not to do so. We arrived in Hodgson June 6th. The Rev. Stevens, Methodist Missionary and myself Friday evening. Mr. McQuish, Indian Agent from the Halfway was there to meet us. He managed to get as far as Hodgson with his Ford car. We spent a very pleasant evening there at the home of Mr. McQuish. After much consideration Mr. McQuish decided that it would be best to start the clinic at Fisher River first because just as soon as treaty would be over many of the children would be out on Lake Winnipeg fishing and would not have an opportunity to receive any dental attention should they require it.\n\nAccordingly Rev. Stevens and myself drove down to Fisher River Saturday June 6th while an Indian with his team came along bringing the dental equipment, personal baggage, etc. From Hodgson to Fisher River, I should judge it is nearly thirty miles. This would not be far on ordinary roads but navigating the few miles between the Halfway and Fisher the state of the roads was indescribable. On several occasions our horses went down and it was a struggle to get them out. This was before the very heavy rains which started on the Sunday after our arrival and continued almost steadily for about eight or nine days.\n\nAfter examining all buildings close to the school I accepted Mr. Stevens kind offer of the disposal of the Mission as an operating room in which he could attend to the children.

The children came very willingly thanks to the cooperation of Mr. and Mrs. Long the resident teachers at Fisher River.\n\nRight here is a good place to give a slight description of the conditions under which the clinic was conducted. The Mission and school are situated in a few acres of clearing which is higher than the surrounding country. Both the school and the Mission on the banks of the Fisher River are about four miles inland from the mouth of the river at Fisher Bay. The buildings are log and the out-buildings are log and all were supplied inside so that both missionary and teacher have comfortable living quarters. The buildings extend as far up as pallas and down to the lowlands along the Bay shore. It is indeed a pretty place in summer and a fine place for mosquitoes. Crossing the river in front of the school is a log foot bridge used by the Indian children when going to and from their day school.\n\nUnfortunately directly the clinic started on the Tuesday came the rain so that practically all the children had wet feet. This would have made them more inclined to have acute trouble after extraction. In several cases I postponed treatment until another day when I thought it might be dry.

As it was he lost his blankets and everything in the rig. The treaty money was being carried over the foot bridge or it would have gone too.\n\nAgainst all odds, rain and high water, I was kept more than busy during my stay in Fisher River. A tent was made of the adult work to see what the cost of the same would be. While in Fisher River I made up two places for an Indian woman who had the extractions completed over a year ago. I figured the cost of material approximately five dollars a plate. Of course, this is not the most expensive but is something that I think would do for the majority of treaty cases. For the children some two hundred extractions were completed. About the same number of extractions for children and adults. Some forty children received treatment and there are twice as many more to receive treatment at some future date if arrangements can be made.\n\nI had intended to put a clinic on in Dallas on the way back but owing to the impassable condition of the roads I did not see how the children of the white settlers could possibly hope to get to Dallas and I accordingly called it off.\n\nOn June 23rd I finally got an Indian to risk his team through the mud as far as the Halfway. Mr. Schuch had figured that we might take it up the river by boat but I thought it unwise to do so. The mileage is insured for $1000.00 against fire but not against water and I felt that neither the Indian Department nor the Red Cross Society would care to be faced with a bill of that size!\n\nSo on Tuesday evening at nine p.m., after a drive of nearly all day through pouring rain my Indian teammate and I reached the Halfway both soaked to the skin but our equipment dry, as we had big tarpaulins over it.\n\nOn Wednesday I set up my equipment in Dr. Bird's office, the resident doctor at Halfway and on Thursday we inspected the Peguis reserve schools. We found 95% of the children with defective teeth and several with external openings on their throats as result of acute abscesses. I do not believe we have ever seen in all my work outside of distant reserves such suffering directly caused from dental sources as in these two reserves. In many cases Peguis was a duplication of Fisher River, only the rain had stopped and the roads were much better. Here again we were overwhelmed with work and had to turn over a hundred away. Even with both Dr. Bird and myself working until late in the evenings it was impossible to get anywhere nearly through in the month allowed for work among the Indian children. Here again I had a very worthy adult case\u2014a halfbreed veteran of the Boer War in his 60s who I was forced to turn down rather than run another young child. The old gentleman was very disappointed. But some day he may be able to use a dentist of the Department will help him to come to the city but it will cost much more than it would have done if we could have found the time to do it right on the ground, as five dollars would have covered our expenses as far as material was concerned.\n\nBefore closing I wish to mention the case of a boy of fourteen who had been suffering with severe toothache for several years but was afraid to have his tooth extracted. As a result he developed an acute alveolar abscess, the pus burrowing through the bone and lining the throat. Dr. Bird and I gave him gas, extracted the roots and in three days he was able to go about to recover. This is only one case out of five that we had during our stay. No wonder the tubercular trouble is developing at a rapid rate amongst children living or rather existing in these reserves when they have such septic mouths. That is a sufficient load for the system to fight without the additional load of influenza and tuberculosis following.\nIn conclusion I wish to thank Mr. and Mrs. McGuish for their kind hospitality at the Halfway House, Dr. Bird for his invaluable assistance, Rev.

Murdoch, 211 McIntyre block, Winnipeg. This expenditure was in connection with the Dental Clinic held in this Agency between June 4 and July 4, 1925. In the summary to the doctor's report he states where one upper and one lower set of false teeth were furnished on Fisher River Reserve and giving the regular dental rates at $40.00. The doctor informs me that the cost of this set to the Department was $4.50. In connection with this set of teeth I wish to offer the following explanation: There are a great number of men and women in this Agency who have practically no teeth left in their head so we decided to furnish one set in Fisher River and one in Pequis. Both parties chosen were women raising young families. This was done in hopes that others on the reserves would supply themselves with teeth at their own expense. The woman picked on Pequis was found to be so loaded with poison that the doctor had not time to fit her teeth and I would recommend that this case be completed. This voucher was authorized by Department Letter 136-2-5, January 28, 1925.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. McCuish,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nAugust 13th, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 20th July and voucher No. 237, amounting to $238.68, therewith submitted in favour of Dr. R.H. Murdoch, Dentist of Winnipeg, who visited Fisher River and Peguis Reserves, and treated the teeth of certain Indians and did other dental work for them. I have seen that a cheque is being forwarded in payment of the said voucher, but it will be necessary for receipts in support of the following items to be furnished, namely a receipt for $2.95 covering \"express supplies on laundry, 5th June\". A receipt should be furnished also for $3.00 covering the laundry charge made by Mrs. S.J. Thomas on the 2nd July.\n\nKindly see that the Department receives the necessary receipts.\n\nYou have recommended that the Doctor furnish a set of teeth for an Indian woman at Peguis, but you have omitted to state whether it will be necessary for the woman to visit Winnipeg to have this work done. Your further report in the matter is desired. The Department is prepared to authorize expenditure in this case if the same will not be large. Particulars should be furnished.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.F. MacKenzie)\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. McQuish, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Halfway, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The only complaint that the teacher had to make was about the heating. There are no dampers in the hot air pipes leading from the furnace, and most of the heat seems to go to the two classrooms, and in cold weather the upstairs gets so cold that the children have to sit there. The only way this could be remedied would be to place dampers in the two large pipes leading to the classrooms. After school is over in the daytime, these could be closed off and the heat diverted to the upstairs. It would be a simple matter to do this, as there is a man at Dallas, about eight miles from the reserve, who is a tinsmith and would put these dampers in at a very small cost. He was not at home when I visited there and I therefore could not get prices but I cannot see that it would cost very much. When this building was painted two years ago the front and back doors were not varnished. The teacher said that if he were supplied with the varnish he would do the work. It would take about one quart of vernish and a small brush.\nOttawa, January 25, 1926.\n\nSir:-\n\nMr. Inspector Christianson in a report on his inspection of the Fisher River Indian Day School states as follows:\n\n\"This building is in good shape.

He lives at home when I am there and I, therefore, could not get a price, but I cannot see that it would cost very much. When this building was painted two years ago the front and back doors were not varnished. The teacher said that if he were supplied with the varnish he would do the work. It would take about one quart of varnish and a small brush.\"\n\nI have to request that you will arrange, as soon as possible, to have the dampers installed in the two large pipes leading to the classroom. It is noted that the Inspector states that it would be a simple matter to have the dampers placed. You may also purchase and forward to the teacher one quart of varnish and a small brush in order that he can varnish the front and back doors. After the dampers have been installed and the varnish supplied you should furnish properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred. Please give these matters your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Templeman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 1\n\"At the present time the requirements are a bookcase for the senior room and a desk or table for the junior room. Mr. Tong has no bookcase in his classroom and is using a box at the present time. Mrs. Tong is using an old table made out of packing boxes for a desk, and would like to have a desk or table placed between her and Mr. Tong, but due to my attention the matter of supplying a midday meal for the children. Although I have been at the school before, this was the first time Mr. Tong has mentioned the matter to me. He claims, however, to have taken it up several times with the Agent, who evidently never brought it to your attention, as I have stated in my report. Moreover, he has mentioned the supplying of a midday meal. At the present time the children get a cup of cocoa and biscuits. The teacher points out that while some of them bring fair lunches with them, there are others who bring practically nothing, and as he puts it, probably had very little breakfast, and subsisting on a cup of cocoa and a couple of dry biscuits all day does not give them enough nourishment. Arrangements could be made to turn one of the rooms in the basement into a diningroom. The only thing that would have to be done to it would be to paint the basement floor with cement paint to keep down the dust. Cheap tables and benches could be made by the girls, and a cook would have to be supplied. It could be worked out on practically the same basis as at Fairford. It would cost about $10.00 a month for additional help. As Mr. and Mrs. Tong both teach they would have to get a woman to come in during the noon hour. There are several women around there who are capable of doing this work and, of course, bigger girls could help; the services of a woman would only be required for about two hours each day. No doubt if this meal were supplied it would be a great benefit to the children, as the Doctor also pointed out that he knew some of the children were not getting sufficient nourishment.\"\n\nUnder cover of a letter dated October 28th, forwarding the above report, Mr. Commissioner Graham states:\n\n\"In connection with the Fisher River Day School, I think the bookcase and desk asked for should be furnished for the classes. The suggestions with regard to fixing up a room in the basement for use as a diningroom might be followed; it would cost very little. I would also recommend that $10.00 a month be allowed as wages for an Indian woman to come in and look after the preparation of the midday meal.\"\nOttawa, November 12th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Christianson and Mr. Commissioner Graham recommend the supplying of a midday meal for the children of the Fisher River Indian Day School, and the fitting up of one of the rooms in the basement as a dining room for the purpose of serving this meal.\n\nYou may, therefore, arrange to have the basement floor painted with cement paint, in order to keep down the dust. You may also purchase and supply the material required to make inexpensive tables and benches. It is thought that this work could be carried out by the older boys under the supervision of the teacher. You may also purchase a cook stove to be used for preparing the meal.\n\nThe Department will be unable, owing to lack of funds, to pay for any additional help in the preparation and serving of the meal. It is considered that Mrs. Tong, with the help of the boys, given the necessary directions, should be able to prepare and serve this meal. It is not intended that any large expense be incurred in the supplies for the meal, as it is expected the children will take their lunch with them from home. It is thought that if they were served with a plate of soup, or hot cocoa and biscuits, it would be sufficient.\n\nWhen the work of fitting up the room is completed, you should furnish properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure, which it is hoped you will be able to keep down to the lowest possible point.\n\nYou may also arrange for the purchase of the cocoa and biscuits, also for a small quantity of rice and barley for soup, for the midday meal.\n\nThe Inspector has recommended that a bookcase and teacher's desk and chair be supplied for the use of the classrooms. You may place an order with the Western Seating Company, 179 Ramsay Ave., Winnipeg, for the supplying of the following equipment:\n\n1 Teacher's Sanitary Desk, No. 121,\n1 Chair, No. 150c,\n1 Schoolroom Bookcase, No. 8.\n\nWhen placing the order with this firm, you should give full shipping directions, obtain accounts in duplicate, and when the goods have been received, you should certify the accounts and send them to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

There was no expense for labour in this connection, the work of painting and whitewashing, erection of tables, benches, cupboards, etc., being carried out by Mr. Tong, the teacher, and the older boy pupils.\n\nThe total cost for lumber, paint, utensils, etc., has been $165.27 made up as follows:\n\n| Voucher No. | Description                        | Cost   |\n|-------------|------------------------------------|--------|\n| 219         | Nails, hinges, etc.                | 3.95   |\n| 220         | Cook Stove                         | 46.51  |\n| 221         | Table Oilcloth & Dish Tswelling    | 13.20  |\n| 243         | Floor Paint, Kitchen & Table Utensils | 49.57 |\n| 244         | Stove Pipe Connections             | 1.55   |\n| 255         | Freighting Number                  | 5.95   |\n| 256         | Laminate for tables, benches, cupboards, etc. | 37.64 |\n| 266         | Plates & spoons                    | 23.10  |\n| 267         | Sundry small items                 | 4.00   |\n\nBeyond a few small items which may be required at a later date, there will be no further expenditure apart from foodstuffs.\n\nThe amount of $35.70 was expended for provisions and the serving of the midday meal was commenced on February 1st. From 40 to 68 meals have been served at noon each day and a very careful record of the cost of each day's meals has been kept. The average cost has been around 4\u00a2 per pupil per meal. The meals are all prepared by the older girl pupils under the direction and personal supervision of Mrs. Tong.\n\nMr. Tong reports a marked improvement in the appearance and the schoolroom work of a number of his pupils, which he attributes to the wholesome food they receive at midday.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

Templeman,\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nRe Midday Meal,\nFisher River Day School.\n\nI beg to recommend that an amount not exceeding the sum of $100.00 be allowed for the purpose of carrying on the supplying of the noon meal to the pupils at the Fisher River Day School for the period April 1st 1927 to March 31st, 1928.\n\nThe amount of $100.00 is arrived at by keeping of careful record of cost of meals supplied during the months of February and March, 1927. Mr. Tong keeps a record of provisions used each month and number of meals supplied each day and advises me that during the month of February the meals cost 2.99 cents per meal per pupil and during the month of March, 3.07 cents per meal per pupil, making the average for the two months 3.03 cents per meal per pupil. The number of meals supplied each day averaged 65 and there being 200 school days in the year, the total cost would be approximately $364.00 for the year.\n\nI am attaching hereto a list of supplies giving the total amount of each commodity required for the year with the approximate cost. Meals and vegetables, with the exception of onions which do not grow successfully at Fisher River, would be purchased on the reserve. Having a market for their vegetables would be an incentive to the pupils to raise them at their own homes. The other items on the list would be purchased at competitive prices from the local stores on the Fisher River Reserve.\n\nI am also attaching a list of utensils and other supplies required which would be sufficient for the year. May authority be granted to purchase these?\n\nThe supplying of the midday meal has brought about a considerable improvement in the pupils' health, attention to school work and general interest in the school work. I would recommend strongly that the meals be carried on under the arrangement of the past two months. They have the added beneficial effect in that they enable Mrs. Tong to give the older girls a well needed lesson in cookery. The meals are prepared by two of the older girl pupils under the supervision of Mrs. Tong and each girl takes her turn at the work of cooking the meals and washing up.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Templeman,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6233, file 511-5, part 2)\nOttawa, April 30th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, in which you recommend that an amount not exceeding the sum of $400 be allowed for the purchase of supplies required for the noon-day meal to the pupils of the Fisher River Indian Day School for the present fiscal year ending March 31st, 1928, and enclosing a list of the quantities of the various supplies required and the utensils to be used in preparing and serving same.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may incur, during the present fiscal year, expenditures not exceeding the above amount in the purchase of the supplies for the midday meal. You should arrange to obtain and forward to me weekly the quantities required from time to time during the year. Accounts should be forwarded by you at the end of each quarter covering the cost of the various items purchased during the period. You may also purchase the utensils and supplies mentioned in the list. As far as possible, competitive prices should be obtained from local stores in the purchase of supplies other than those obtained from the Indians.\n\nWe note that the supplying of the midday meal to the pupils at this school has brought about an improvement in the health of the pupils and in their attention to school work and general interest in the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

March 13th, 1951.\n\nInspector Christianson's report on Schools in\nthe Fisher River Agency.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have the honour to report that on my last trip to the Fisher River Agency, I inspected all the schools in that Agency.\n\nFISHER RIVER IMPROVED DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThere are two classrooms in this school; the junior room is taught by Mrs. W. G. Tong, and the senior classroom by Mr. Tong. At the time of my visit there were 60 pupils in attendance, out of an enrolment of 67. The grades range as follows:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| I     | 19     |\n| II    | 18     |\n| III   | 10     |\n| IV    | 10     |\n| V     | 5      |\n| VI    | 3      |\n| VII   | 2      |\n\nThe average attendance for the year is about 57.\n\nI spent considerable time in the classrooms, and must say that I was well impressed with the work that is carried on. The children looked well, and they were clean and tidy. Their reading was good, and, in fact, all the work carried on in the classroom is much above the average found in Indian day schools. In my opinion, Mr. Tong is one of the best teachers we have in the service. Mrs. Tong is probably not as well qualified to teach as her husband, but she has greatly improved during the last few years.\n\nA mid-day meal is served at the school.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6233, file 511-5, part 4)\nFISHER RIVER IMPROVED DAY SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nand I was present during the time the children were having it. This is certainly a great blessing as the parents of some of these children are very hard up at times, and it is gratifying to know that the children receive at least one good meal a day.\n\nI might say that Mr. & Mrs. Tong are very much interested in their work and the welfare of the children. They not only take an interest in them while they are in school, but continue their interest after they leave the school. I consider that they are doing all they possibly can to make good citizens of them.\n\nThere are certain matters in connection with this school, regarding recruiting for Brandon School, etc., which you instructed me to look into, and which I am dealing with in a separate letter.\n\nThe school is in a good state of repair; the exterior was painted last summer, fences, etc. repaired, and the building itself is in A1 shape. The grounds are also well cared for, trees having been planted, etc.\n\nM. Christianson\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6233, file 511-5, part 4)\n**STATEMENT**\n\nMarch 28th 1931\n\nM. Fr.

G. Young, teacher of the Fisher River Indian Day School, to reimburse him for payments made in taking off storm windows, cleaning windows and fitting screens.\n\nIn this connection, I would point out that salary for janitor's services is allowed at this school at the rate of $5.00 per month and, also, payment for sweeper at $5.00 per month. It is considered that the work of taking off and putting on storm windows, also the cleaning of the windows of the school, should be part of the janitor's regular duties. The costs of conducting this school are rather high each year and, as our funds this year are extremely limited, it will be necessary to curtail all expenditure to the lowest possible point.\n\nThe above remarks regarding the services the janitor should perform will apply to all the day schools in your agency where accounts are forwarded for payment of work which it is thought the janitors should perform in the course of their regular duties.\n\nThe voucher which you submitted will be paid in this instance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The teachers can be instructed that only these foods will be supplied to supplement whatever the children may bring from home.\n\nReference to other schools in this agency. There is Fisher River day school where there has been a regular mid-day meal served so that the children need not bring anything from home.

Owing to lack of funds, the Department finds it necessary to economize wherever possible and it has been decided that the cost of the midday meal at this school should not exceed, approximately, $25.00 a teaching month. You should confer with the teacher at once and make the necessary arrangements for reducing the expenditure for midday meal purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG.

In view of the fact that the Department requires the midday meal supplies considerably curtailed, it is considered that it should be possible to dispense with the services of the cook.

There is a crack from top to bottom at the north-east corner of the south-west corner and the ground pressure is gradually pushing the wall inward. The south wall at the east corner, for about thirty feet has dropped several inches and it also is being pressed inwardly by ground pressure.\n\nThe situation as I see it is serious, for in the matter of another year or possibly two considerable damage is liable to be done to the whole of the structure. From my examination I would lay the fault to lack of reinforcement of the concrete and a poor mixture of concrete at the extreme footings of the walls.\n\nThere are several ways that the condition might be remedied without the expense of entirely new concrete walls but whatever way you consider this repair it is going to be an expensive proposition. I will bring the condition of these walls to Inspector Hamilton's notice on his next visit to this agency.\n\nI would also bring to your notice that the interior decoration of the classrooms in this school needs attention and the walls should be painted. If any appropriations have been set aside for the upkeep of school buildings I would ask that the matter of decoration be given attention during the vacation period, July to September.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. H. Lavender,\nIndian Agent\n\nTHE SECRETARY,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nNo statement has been received from your Department with respect to the supplying of biscuits for the schools of this agency. We have no biscuits on hand for the term commencing September 1st. Therefore we would appreciate some information as to what we may expect along this line.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. H. Lavender,\nIndian Agent\n\nTHE SECRETARY,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 9, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, with regard to the condition of the concrete walls in the basement of the Fisher River Indian Day School. Please bring this matter to the attention of Inspector Hamilton when he next visits the reserve and forward a full report to the Department stating the approximate cost of having the foundation repaired and placed in good condition. You should keep in mind that our funds are limited.\n\nWith reference to the interior painting of the classrooms, you should let me know the approximate cost of this improvement.\n\nRegarding your second letter of the 30th ultimo, I beg to say that an order has already been placed for biscuits, but it is not the Department's intention to ship these until about the first of September. During past years the Department has received frequent reports regarding deterioration of biscuits owing to hot weather, and it is considered that if the biscuits were not forwarded until later in the year, this loss would be avoided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nG. H. Lavender, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHodgeon, Man.\nSir:-\n\nI have received a copy of a letter dated June 30th, 1934, from Mr. G. H. Lavender, Indian Agent, Hodgson, which letter is addressed to The Secretary and deals with the Fisher River Day School.\n\nI note Mr. Lavender's remarks in connection with the basement wall and am of the opinion that it might be well to leave this until such times as I can visit the Agency, which will be late in the summer or early in the fall. I have no doubt the wall is in need of repair, but it is possibly not greatly changed from what it was a year or two ago.\n\nIn connection with the interior decoration, this work is needed and should be done during the summer holidays. If permission is granted, I would suggest that the authority be given through this office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, July 13, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to Mr. Agent Lavender's letter of the 30th ultimo regarding the Fisher River Indian Day School.\n\nIn replying to the Agent's letter on the 9th instant, the Department informed him that, on the occasion of your next visit to the Reserve, he should bring to your attention the condition of the concrete walls in the basement of the Fisher River Indian Day School.\n\nThere are so many demands on our Appropriation that it is doubtful if funds can be provided for the interior painting of this school. However, the Agent was requested to supply an estimate on the cost, and on receipt of this information, the matter will receive further consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter 136-25, dated July 9/34, in the matter of the Fisher River School, I am leaving all questions of repairs, painting etc., until such time as Inspector Hamilton visits the reserve. A full report can then be submitted and the approximate costs placed in our estimates for 1935 and the work proceeded with during that year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. H.

A.G. HAMILTON,\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN AGENCIES, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE\nFISHER RIVER INDIAN DAY SCHOOL IN OCTOBER, 1934.\n\nOriginal on No. 136-2-6.\n\nThe east basement wall has a bad crack reaching from one end to the other, about half way between the floor and the joists. The wall also has a bulge inward, probably 2 x 3\". I do not consider this very serious and it might be remedied by placing an 8 x 8 timber under the floor joist and supporting same with heavy rests, thus somewhat relieving the pressure from the wall. The chimney of the school has a small crack from the basement to the roof. There may not be any danger from this and yet I understand the chimney is only one brick thick. It would perhaps be advisable to have bands of heavy strap iron clamped about the chimney, thus preventing any further spread. The crack could then be filled with mortar.\n\nNew swings have been erected. The work has been well done, but new rope should be provided as that now in use is badly worn out. I would recommend that rope be purchased at once in order that an accident might be avoided.\nOttawa, November 29, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nIn a report regarding his recent inspection of the Fisher River Indian Day School, Inspector Hamilton writes as follows:\n\n\"The east basement wall has a bad crack reaching from one end to the other, about half way between the floor and the joists. The wall also has a bulge inward, probably 2 x 3\". I do not consider this very serious, and it might be remedied by placing an 8 x 6 timber under the floor joist and supporting same with heavy joists, thus somewhat relieving the pressure from the wall. The chimney of the school has a small crack from the basement to the roof. There may not be any danger from this and yet I understand the chimney is only one brick thick. It would perhaps be advisable to have bands of heavy strap iron clamped about the chimney, thus preventing any further spread. The crack could then be filled with mortar.\"\n\nPlease let me know the approximate cost of making the above repairs.\n\nMr. Hamilton also states that rope is required for the swings. You may purchase what is necessary in this regard.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. J.

In considering these children that attend school here and at Brandon Indian Industrial School they don't learn any better and I see when I look at the sun and see the water flows.

Sometimes we claim 2\u00bd miles and four miles from the school west and we ask the department to grant us a School to build or a van as we like to see these children to learn education only we cant compel the parents to send their children to school as their too far for them.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6233, file 511-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nDear Sir;-\n\nWith reference your letter 136-2-5 and attached letter from the Chief and Councillors Fisher River Band this Agency.\n\nRegarding the question of providing another School or a van for transportation of the children mentioned. On investigating the case at first that there are 11 children of school age which lives from 3 to 4 miles from the present improved school on the Fisher River Reserve, no doubt it would be less expense to supply a van than to send these children away to a Residential School it would entail an amount of $2.00 per teaching day for a van, but if this was done we may then have a complaint from others at North end of the Reserve as there are some who live about 2\u00bd miles from the present school. I should think that the parents who reside so far distant from the school should resume some responsibility between themselves in getting their children to the school. The present situation does not warrant a new school as there is ample room in the present one.\n\nRe the matter mentioned about the Rev. F. G. Stevens, as near as I can understand they wish him to leave Mr Tong alone and not interfere with him, as they are quite satisfied with his teaching. They also wish that he would not recommend any more pupils to be admitted to the Brandon Residential School, they think they can get just as good an education in the Day School on the Reserve.\n\nI enclose herewith letter from the Chief and Councillors as requested.\n\nTrust the above information satisfactory,\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir.\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6234, file 511-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nWasagaming, Manitoba,\nNovember 15th, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Fisher River Indian Reserve Day School.\n\nAs per your instructions of the 26th of October I have examined the foundation of the above named school, and wish to make the following report in this connection.\n\nThe building in question is a frame structure, approximately 72' x 36' in size, with a full concrete foundation. This foundation is built partially on clay and rock strata.\n\nThe part of the building reported to be on the rock strata is in excellent shape, while that part on the clay is in very poor condition and should be reconstructed in the near future.\n\nIt is interesting to note that this foundation has been reconstructed in its entirety since the original foundation was installed in 1919. I am, however, given to understand that while the whole of the foundation was rebuilt the condition at that time was similar to the condition that exists today.\n\nIn investigating this work I examined the ground below the fracture walls to a depth of approximately four feet, and the material encountered was a heavy clay in a saturated state immediately below the floor or wall level and gradually decreasing in moisture content until at a depth of approximately 5.5 feet it was quite dry and hard. Two test holes were put down with a post hole auger, one in the entrance to the basement to the South of the building and one in the center under the basement floor in approximately the center of the floor where the failure of the walls has taken place. In the hole in the entrance we did not encounter rock, but in that it is in fairly close proximity to the well, and as the rock strata in the well is encountered at a depth of twelve feet, it is, I believe, reasonable to assume that we did not encounter rock at about the same depth. I mean of course, twelve feet from the ground surface, or approximately four feet from the present basement floor level. Rock was encountered at a depth of four feet two inches in the hole below the basement floor, and the material above the rock was almost identical to what referred to as a very plastic clay at the surface, saturated to such an extent that when the auger was being used a slight trickle of water was perceptible in the hole. Immediately above the rock strata the clay was almost dry.\n\nT.S. Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nIn considering the failure of these walls, it would appear that the near collapse is a result of the plastic nature of the clay upon which the foundation is constructed. This clay has apparently been forced out by the pressure of the walls, with the result that the walls have settled. The settlement not being uniform has caused the walls to tip, and the action has apparently been supplemented by considerable lateral pressure on the East wall, as this wall is not only badly fractured but is also bulging considerably into the basement. Some disintegration of the concrete is noticeable, but in that the whole of the basement wall was constructed of the same materials and those parts which exist show that I would say that the disintegration is a result of excessive moisture and perhaps a very weak mix rather than faulty materials. However, before any repair work is carried out the materials to be used can be carefully tested. I am told that the field tile for the reconstruction job, carried out some years ago, was received too late to be installed. I am also advised that the original size of the trench was exceedingly wet when the concrete was poured.\n\nHaving carefully considered the above mentioned details I would suggest that the walls be reconstructed and I would recommend that the new walls be carried down to the rock strata, also that adequate drainage be provided for the ground immediately around that part of the building affected.\n\nThe following is an estimate of the cost of the work proposed:\n\n| Size of wall approximately 100' x 1' x 12' |\n|------------------------------------------|\n| Material | Labour |\n| 56 cu.yds concrete 1:8:4 mix | $308.00 |\n| Cement, 250 sacks @ $1.10 | $275.00 |\n| Sand & gravel, 75 cu.yds.@ $2.00 | $150.00 |\n| Form Construction | |\n| 3,000 Shiplap @ $35.00 | $105.00 |\n| 100 pieces 2\"x4\" x12' @ $5.00 | $20.00 |\n| Miscellaneous, wire, nails, etc. | $20.00 |\n| Field tile for drainage | |\n| 300 lineal feet 4 inch | $27.00 |\n\nWet excavation of extra depth\n40 yds. @ $1.00 | $40.00 |\nErecting and tearing down forms\n100 hours @ .50 | $50.00 |\n100 hours @ .50 | $50.00 |\nMixing and placing concrete (Hand Mix)\n56 yds. 4 hrs. per yd. = 224 hrs.@ .35\u00a2 | $78.40 |\nSupervision and miscellaneous | $100.00 |\nCost of removing concrete wall\n1,412 cubic feet @ .08\u00a2 | $112.96 |\n\n$644.00 | $471.56 |\n$644.00 | $471.56 |\n$1,115.56 | $1,115.56 |\n$111.54 | $111.54 |\n\n$1,226.90\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nT.S.

(RG 10, Volume 6234, file 511-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES OF CANADA\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Wardle,\n\nRe: Fisher River Indian Day School.\n\nAs requested in your memorandum of October 26th last arrangements were made with Mr. Atkinson to make an inspection of the above school and submit a report of repairs required. A copy of a report received from Mr. Atkinson is attached.\n\nFrom this report it would appear that Mr. Atkinson had made a fairly thorough examination of foundations and walls of the school. From his examination Mr. Atkinson's deduction is that the near collapse of the wall is a result of the plastic nature of the clay upon which the foundation is constructed. A further deduction which could apparently be made is that possibly a sufficiently thorough examination of the foundation upon which the walls were constructed was not made at the time of erection. It will be noted that Mr. Atkinson's recommendation is that in re-building these walls, they should be carried down to the rock strata and also that adequate drainage be provided for the ground around that part of the building affected.\n\nIn view of Mr. Atkinson's report on the present condition of the walls, it would appear that the only thing to do is to replace them and the recommendation to this effect in the attached report is therefore concurred in. The estimate of cost of work is of course based on such recommendation and as will be noted, totals slightly over $1,200.00.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.M.

However, the amount required is not available at the present time; besides, I believe it would be undesirable to do this work before the school closes for summer holidays. This would mean that the repairing of the walls could be done during July and August.\n\nDirector.\nThe Secretary:\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn August 27th of last year we addressed you in connection with matters of importance to us because we are Indians, bound and restricted under the terms of a treaty made with the Dominion Government of Canada.\n\nUp to the present date we have had no reply to our requests or acknowledgements of our communication.\n\nWe, therefore, respectfully beg to again present for your kind consideration matters that we feel sure, if given attention, will be found reasonable.\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nWe again beg to request that a school be established at the west side of our reserve and that the materials for the building be hauled before the break up of winter. The west part of our reserve is the most suitable for farming and the future will take more and more of our people to take up residence there.\n\nJas. A.

The Chief has been advised as instructed in your letter.\n\nWith reference to their request for a school at the West end of their reserve. In my opinion this is not needed at present and I believe that while they have the services of a van from this area it is all that is required.\n\nF. J. Clarke.\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMay 4, 1939.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt has recently been brought to my attention that a letter has been received signed by Chief Murdoch and Councillors Joe Cochrane, E. Bowers and Joe Malett, of the Fisher River Band, in which they make the following statements:\n\n\"We again beg to request that a school be established at the west side of our reserve and that the materials for the building be hauled before the break up of winter. The west part of our reserve is the most suitable for farming and the future will take more and more of our people to take up residence there.\n\n\"Also as yet there is no yarn distributed to the children attending the Fisher River school. The teacher has advised us that he has not yet received this year's supply of yarn.\"\n\nI should appreciate having your comments on the above and I may say that it was our understanding that when arrangements were made to drive the children to the Fisher River school you considered it unnecessary to erect another school on the west side of the reserve. As a result no provision has been made in our current year's appropriation for the erection of a new school on the Fisher River reserve.\n\nI cannot find any record of our having refused to allow yarn for use at the Fisher River school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.J. Clarke, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHodgson, Man.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter 136-2-5 of May 4th re a letter written to the Department by the Chief and Councillors of the Fisher River Band.\n\nWith reference to their request for a new school on the west end of their reserve. I would not be prepared to recommend this school. The van provided for the transportation of the children from this area is in my opinion sufficient for the present time. The majority of the men on this reserve are fishermen and will not be moving away from the present school to the farming area in the west end of the reserve.\n\nThe delivery of the yarn to the schools was late last season as we did not receive same from the company until Feb 15th.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.

There are two tanks joined together so that the water remains at the same level in each. One tank already has about 40 holes. The teachers plugged these with sharp pointed slivers of wood. However, new holes are constantly appearing. The tanks are badly rusted and cannot be made in Winnipeg and shipped, because they will not pass through the basement door. It will therefore be necessary to ship the material and later have a man go up and put them together. If possible, this work should be done before the early spring rains.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reporting on his recent inspection of the Fisher River Day School Inspector Hamilton writes as follows:\n\n\"One soft water tank is likely to become useless at any time. There are two tanks joined together so that the water remains at the same level in each. One tank already has about 40 holes. The teachers plugged these with sharp pointed slivers of wood. However, new holes are constantly appearing. Both tanks are badly rusted and very thin. The tanks cannot be made in Winnipeg and shipped, because they will not pass through the basement door. It will therefore be necessary to ship the material and later have a man go up and put them together. If possible, this work should be done before the early spring rains.\"\n\nWe have reviewed our file but do not appear to have received any previous report regarding the above matter from you. If two tanks are necessary you might let me have full particulars regarding what is required and an endeavor will be made to secure it before the end of March.

I would recommend that these two tanks be replaced with one new tank of a capacity of approximately 200 gallons. As an estimate of the cost, I would state that the Canadian Rogers Sheet Metal Co., Winnipeg, in Feb 1939 installed two similar tanks in the Doctor's residence at a total cost of $85.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.

Clarke,\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8st instant with reference to the water tank for the Fisher River Indian Day School. It is noted that you recommend one tank similar to those supplied to the Doctor's residence by the Canadian Rogers Sheet Metal Co., Winnipeg. As you state, the total cost of two tanks supplied in 1939 to the Doctor's residence was $55.00 and presumably one tank would now cost approximately half of that amount. Owing to present conditions I am not certain if you can secure a similar tank just now. However, you may communicate with the Company and if you can secure the tank you may arrange for its purchase and delivery.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F.J. Clarke,\nIndian Agent,\nHodgson, Man.\n| DATE | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Jan 30 | Driving Fisher River School van for 20 days                           |        |\n|       | @ $6.00 during Jan/42                                                  | 60.00  |\n|       | Average pupils = 15                                                   |        |\n|       | 196-5-6, Nov 19/41                                                    |        |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 50C\n\nVoucher No.: 88451\n\nDate: Feb 4/42\n\nIndian Affairs.

Clarke, Indian Agent,\nHodgson, Man.\n\nWith reference to requisition dated April 27, received from the teacher of the Fisher River Indian Day School, the Department approves purchase of the following articles:\n\n- 50 yds. cotton print,\n- 2 doz. spools white thread,\n- 2 pkgs. needles,\n- 100 lbs. sweeping compound,\n- 8 galvanized furnace pipes\n- 2 pipe joints.\n\nThere is also a request on the requisition for the following:\n\n- 5 school desks EL\n- 5 SL\n- 10 4R small\n\nAt the same time the teacher states there are 76 school desks on hand. You did not make any comment on the request for additional desks. Are they needed to supply seating space for new pupils and is there accommodation in the classroom for them? At the present time desks are made in three sizes - large, medium and small. You should let me know the number of each size that is needed.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Canada.\n\nIn reply to your letter June 1st file 136-2-5 in regard to School Desks for the Fisher River Day School, the teacher would like 5 Desks Large, 5 Desks Medium and 10 Desks Small. There is not really room for these Desks, except by over crowding. Possibly, about 5 large and 5 small desks would be enough.\n\nThere should be erected, if possible, a one room school at the West end of Fisher River Reserve, or near the West end, as there are some 17 children of school age in this vicinity. If this school were built, it would serve these children who are from 4 to 6 miles from the present Fisher River School. Some of the above children are attending, but very irregular, owing to distances and bad roads. The FAMILY ALLOWANCES ACT has played a big part in School attendance, and too, this Act allows children to attend at six, whereas prior to this, they did not start until seven years of age. We have an Indian who is willing to give a part of his land for a school location, as there is really not room for these children at the Fisher River School.\n\nIf a new school room were erected at the West end, the above desks requisitioned for the Fisher River School would probably not be needed.\n\nF J Clarke, Indian Agent\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nOttawa, June 20, 1945\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa.

They are old. In the kitchen there is a small hand pump at the sink, which is connected with the soft water tanks, but owing to the distance between the pump and the tanks, it is impossible for the pump to draw water. The kitchen sink is not connected with the sewer, but the pipe from the sink ends above the furnaces in the basement.\n\nTo remedy these defects, it is suggested that a concrete cistern be constructed in the basement directly beneath the kitchen sink; that the eavestroughing be renewed and connected with the concrete cistern; and that the kitchen sink be connected with the sewer. To this end I have secured verbally, the following estimates of the cost:\n\n| Description                                      | Cost   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Construction of concrete cistern, with necessary re-inforcement. (Wylie & Compton) | $527.00 |\n| Plumbing. (Mr. Jones)                            | $125.00 |\n| Eavestroughing. (Kildonan Sheet Metal)           | $150.00 |\n\nTotal:- Materials & Labour. $802.00\n\nWylie & Compton are the firm who have been doing the building of the new Clerk's House, and other construction...\nwork at this agency during the past summer, and who have not yet quite completed their work. Mr. Jones is the plumber who was employed by Wylie & Compton for the plumbing work on these buildings, and the Kildonan Sheet Metal is the firm who were employed by Wylie & Compton for the furnace work and other sheet metal work on the projects.\n\nMrs Jean Scott, the principal teacher at the Fisher River Day School, advises that the teachers are much handicapped with the above noted facilities being unavailable to them, and she took the matter up with Mr. Inspector Hamilton, who asked me to procure the estimates set out in the foregoing.\n\nWill you kindly advise me if the Department will approve of the necessary expenditure to carry out these repairs, and appropriate the sum of $900.00 for the purpose, as there may be some unforeseen extras in connection with the work.\n\nP.G.

The work at that time was done so while the men, their lodgings and materials were on hand. Work of this nature is very expensive in this weather.
