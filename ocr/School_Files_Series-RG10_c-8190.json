Plourde, O.M.I.,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMon R\u00e9v\u00e9rend P\u00e8re,\n\nJe suis all\u00e9 \u00e0 Sept-\u00celes pour les f\u00eates jubilaires du P\u00e8re D\u00e9carie.\n\nJ'en ai profit\u00e9 pour voir les travaux de l'\u00e9cole. Tout va bien et j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9merveill\u00e9 de ce que sera cette \u00e9cole. Je ne saurais trop dire ma reconnaissance au D\u00e9partement des Affaires Indiennes.\n\nSeulement j'ai constat\u00e9 une chose que je voudrais imm\u00e9diatement porter \u00e0 l'attention du d\u00e9partement pour \u00e9viter des ennuis dans l'avenir.\n\n1) Il n'y aura qu'une seule fournaise pour chauffer cette \u00e9cole. C'est suffisant, mais ce n'est pas prudent \u00e0 cette distance. Ne voudrait-il pas mieux en placer une suppl\u00e9mentaire en cas d'accident \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re? C'est ce que j'ai fait ici \u00e0 l'\u00e9v\u00each\u00e9. Une fournaise est suffisante, mais j'en ai une autre en cas d'accident.\n\n2) Le chauffage est pr\u00e9vu pour le charbon. D'apr\u00e8s les renseignements que j'ai pu recueillir, il en co\u00fbtera $40.00 la tonne pour avoir du charbon \u00e0 cet endroit. Ensuite il faudra un expert pour chauffer ces fournaises. Il y a \u00e0 Sept-\u00celes deux compagnies d'huile avec grands r\u00e9servoirs. L'huile serait livr\u00e9e sur demande au cours de l'hiver tout comme l'\u00e9t\u00e9. Il en co\u00fbterait \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s la moiti\u00e9 du prix pour chauffer la maison. Enfin vous supprimez de cette fa\u00e7on les ennuis de l'entreposage du charbon ce qui est toujours un probl\u00e8me. \u00c0 l'h\u00f4pital du Havre St. Pierre, on a d\u00fb abandonner le charbon pour prendre l'huile, parce que le charbon chauffait dans les soutes, ce qui occasionnait de grosses pertes et des ennuis \u00e0 n'en plus finir. Il n'y a pas de d\u00e9p\u00f4ts d'huile au Havre et les religieuses doivent emmagasiner de grosses provisions en barils \u00e0 l'automne et malgr\u00e9 tout elles r\u00e9alisent une \u00e9conomie.\n\n3) L'eau chaude n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la maison sera r\u00e9chauff\u00e9e par les fournaises. C'est tr\u00e8s bien en hiver. Mais en \u00e9t\u00e9 pour avoir de l'eau chaude il faudra chauffer ces grosses fournaises. Il serait beaucoup plus \u00e9conomique et pratique d'installer un chauffe-eau automatique \u00e0 l'huile. C'est ce qui se fait partout dans ces grandes maisons.\n\nSi vous pouvez porter ces observations \u00e0 M. Neary, elles pourraient servir \u00e0 mettre sur pied une organisation plus \u00e9conomique et plus rationnelle.\n\nIl serait bon cependant qu'une d\u00e9cision soit prise le plus t\u00f4t possible avant que les travaux soient trop avanc\u00e9s.\n\n(Over)\nBishopric of the Gulf of St. Lawrence\n\nBaie Comeau,\nSaguenay Co., Quebec.\n\nThe Chancellery\n\nBaie Comeau, September 1, 1950.\n\nRev. Father O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nReverend Father:\n\nI went to Seven Islands for the jubilee celebrations in honour of Father D\u00e9saris.\n\nI took the opportunity to see the school which is under construction. Everything is going well and I was quite taken with what this school promises to be. I am at a loss to adequately express my gratitude to the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nHowever, I notice something that I would like to bring immediately to the notice of the Department, in order to avoid future difficulties.\n\n1) There will be only one furnace to heat this school. It is sufficient; but it is not safe at this distance. Would it not be better to put in an extra one, in case of breakdown to the first one? I did this in the bishop's palace, here. One furnace is enough; but I have another in case of accident.\n\n2) The fuel is to be coal. According to the information I was able to gather, it will cost $40 a ton to obtain coal at that place. They will also need an expert to run the furnaces. There are in Seven Islands two fuel oil companies with large tanks. The oil would be delivered on request in winter as in summer. It could not be more useful to heat the building and you would easily eliminate the difficulty of storing the coal, which is now a problem. The hospital in Havre St. Pierre had to change from coal to oil heating because the coal used to heat in the bins, causing great loss and never-ending trouble. As there are no oil tanks in Havre St. Pierre, the Sisters have to store large supplies in barrels in the fall; but they nevertheless make a saving.\n\n3) The hot water needed in the school will be heated by the furnaces. That goes very well in the winter. But to have hot water in summer they will have to fire those large furnaces. It would be much more economical and practical to install an automatic oil water-heater. That is being done everywhere in such large buildings.\n\nIf you could bring these observations to the attention of Mr. Neary, it might help to set up an organization along more economical and practical lines.\n\nIt would be wise also that a decision be taken as soon as possible, before work on the building is too far advanced.\n\nI know that a \"Stoker\" has already been purchased; but the same company also sells oil burners and would easily make the exchange.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nN.A.

HICK.\n\nRe: Seven Islands Indian Residential School, Que.\n\nMr. Walker telephoned from Quebec City, September 19th, asking about the drains and septic tank for the above building. An explanation could not be given in full over the telephone. He arranged with Mr. Comerford of the Tribe Company, who is the sub-contractor for plumbing, heating and electrical work, to be in Ottawa to discuss this matter on September 20th.\n\nOn the afternoon of September 20th, Mr. Hoffke came over to see Mr. Comerford in the office here. Points discussed were:\n\n(a) 6\" drain leading from heating plant to sump;\n(b) the long runs of drains through the building to the other sump; and\n(c) the drains to the septic tank.\n\nMr. Hoffke decided there should be no change in the arrangement except that the drain under the kitchen bakery and laundry could be moved nearer to the inside wall to give a more direct route, and drains under refrigerators re-routed to be more direct. A record is to be kept of the change so that our plans will be complete. An instruction is to be issued to the operators to flush out these drains once a month, using fire hose for the cleansing.\n\nThis sub-contractor wanted to give his opinion that the runs were too long for the amount of material to be carried, with not enough flushing water to cleanse the pipes. He stated that, from his experience, there might be clogging. He was thinking about his guarantees under the contract.\n\nCont'd......\nMr. Comerford referred to the water supply, on which he has also submitted a tender to Resources and Development. Apparently the plan used does not show changed location of our building, and there is extra piping involved, which rightly should be paid by Mr. Tremblay, General Contractor. He had some further information relative to the source of water supply, and I sent him over to see Mr. Ross to give that information only. I told Mr. Ross that my action should not be misinterpreted, as information is always desirable in regard to any project.\n\nThe contractor's attention was called to the plumbing notes shown on bottom of drawing No. 2, which states foul water from WCs only are to empty into septic tank, remainder to empty to sumps.\n\nAGY:AB\n\nEngineering and Construction Service.\nSeptember 21, 1950.\n\nMEMORANDUM TO MR.

He intimated that their material is on or near the job, but approval has not been given for the use of it. He will call you on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nMr. Noffke advises that this roofing probably will not stand, and he is not in favour of it, and asks you discuss this matter with him.\n\nThe specifications call for 5 ply tar and gravel roof, 20-year guarantee, using 15 pound felt. The Flintkote roofing is aluminum paint, 3 ply, 52 pound felt, with no tar or gravel. See their specification.\n\nMr. Noffke called me this morning to say that Tremblay had asked for permission, in view of the transportation difficulties, to change from the 5 ply tar and gravel roofing to cold process roofing (Flintkote), but this permission was not granted, and he was advised to adhere to the specification in its entirety.\n\nLetters are on Mr. Noffke's file, and he advises that copies have been sent to you for the records.\n\nAGY:AB\n\nEngineering and Construction Service.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This inquiry caused a delay in the preparation of documents, and also in the programme of work. Authority was granted by P.C. 2906 of 13 June, 1950, to enter into a fixed price contract with Mr. Lucien Tremblay of Portneuf, Quebec, for construction of the work.\n\nPrior to the above date, authority was granted by P.C. 2419 of 12 May, 1950, to obtain the services of Mr. Gaston Amyot, M.R.A.I.C., Architect of Quebec, to provide continuous supervision of the construction work on the project on behalf of the Department. As every effort was being made to get the job started in order to take full advantage of the construction season, Mr. Amyot was instructed to obtain the services of a Clerk-of-Works to be resident near the job to provide constant superintendence.\n\nThe agreement with Mr. Amyot provides in part \"Article 5 - Reimbursements: The Minister will reimburse the Architect for (a) the costs of transportation and personal living expenses incurred by the Architect and the Clerk-of-Works while travelling, in discharge of duties solely connected with the work. In case of mileage travelled for which convenient railway or motor bus transportation is not available, an allowance of eight cents ($0.08) per mile may be paid. The mileage allowances paid cover the entire cost to the Government except bridge tolls and ferry charges. (b) the salary of Clerk-of-Works engaged and paid by the Architect provided that the Minister shall have approved of the engagement of such Clerk-of-Works as a necessity, and shall have approved of the salary rate to be paid.\"\n\nMr. Amyot, without prior approval, engaged and sent down a Clerk-of-Works to supervise the concrete work only, at rates and under conditions prevailing in that area; that part of the work is now completed and the duties of this temporary Clerk-of-Works have\nended. The services of Mr. Waller, a qualified engineer, can now be obtained as Clerk-of-Works, and he will remain at Seven Islands until completion of the work, and is willing to accept the same remuneration paid to the temporary Clerk-of-Works, i.e., $250.00 per month with living expenses of $60.00 (room and board), and transportation allowances.\n\nAccounts submitted by Mr. Ayot for reimbursements under the agreement show that air travel has been used, as this is the only convenient means to make the journey to that location, and at very little extra cost.\n\nIn view of the isolated location of this work, and the difficulty of securing technical personnel, our Engineering and Construction Service consider that the interests of the Department will be well served by concurrence in the above arrangements and, therefore, recommend that (a) permission be granted to secure the services of Mr. Waller as Clerk-of-Works at the rates and under the conditions stated above, and (b) that air travel be allowed in place of the provision under the agreement.\n\nFunds for the entire project are available in the Indian Affairs Education Vote 99, Estimates 1950-51.\n\nAGY:AB\n\nDirector.\n\nRecommended\n\nDeputy Minister\n\nApproved\n\nMinister\n\nIndian Affairs.

Des paiements \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 environ quatre-vingt-dix pour cent (90%) de la valeur de l'ouvrage fait, estim\u00e9e approximativement, d'apr\u00e8s des mesurages progressifs, et calcul\u00e9e d'apr\u00e8s le ou les prix convenus ou fix\u00e9s en vertu des dispositions de ce contrat, seront vers\u00e9s mensuellement \u00e0 l'entrepreneur, si la chose est pratique, sur le certificat \u00e9crit de l'ing\u00e9nieur, d\u00e9clarant que l'ouvrage pour lequel ou pour le compte duquel le certificat est \u00e9mis, a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, et mentionnant le valeurs de tel ouvrage compl\u00e9t\u00e9 tel que dit plus haut; et ledit certificat devra \u00eatre une condition pr\u00e9alable au droit de l'entrepreneur d'\u00eatre pay\u00e9 quatre-vingt-dix pour cent (90%) ou de toute partie d'ici celui. Le six pour cent (10%) restant devra \u00eatre retenu jusqu'\u00e0 l'ach\u00e8vement final de tout l'ouvrage, \u00e0 la satisfaction de l'ing\u00e9nieur, et sera pay\u00e9 dans les deux mois qui suivront cet ach\u00e8vement. Le certificat \u00e9crit dudit ing\u00e9nieur attestant l'ach\u00e8vement d\u00e9finitif desdits travaux, \u00e0 sa satisfaction, devra \u00eatre une condition pr\u00e9alable au droit de l'entrepreneur de recevoir ou d'\u00eatre pay\u00e9 du six pour cent (10%) restant ou toute partie d'ici celui.\n\nL'ing\u00e9nieur, en certifiant les valeurs pour paiements progressifs, peut\n\nfaire la liste des prix\n\n53. Il est stipul\u00e9, toutefois, que lorsque, de l'avis de l'ing\u00e9nieur, l'ouvrage fait n'est pas suffisamment fini, ou n'est pas d'une valeur suffisante pour justifier paiement au ou aux prix convenus ou fix\u00e9s en vertu des dispositions de ce contrat, l'ing\u00e9nieur pourra, pour les fins de tel paiement, ne pas tenir compte du ou des prix convenus ou fix\u00e9s, et peut estimer en proportion, la valeur payable par rapport \u00e0 tel ouvrage et mettre un certificat en cons\u00e9quence; en tel cas, l'entrepreneur n'aura le droit de recevoir que quatre-vingt-dix pour cent (90%) de telle valeur estim\u00e9e en proportion, tel que mentionn\u00e9 dans le certificat, et ne devra pas \u00eatre pay\u00e9 du quatre-vingt-dix pour cent (90%) du ou des prix convenus ou d\u00e9termin\u00e9s en vertu des dispositions de ce contrat jusqu'\u00e0 ce que l'ing\u00e9nieur, en raison de l'ex\u00e9cution d'ouvrage suppl\u00e9mentaire, certifie que l'entrepreneur a droit \u00e0 ce pourcentage.\nR\u00e9citations en vertu de certificats progressifs\n\n54. Il est entendu que toute allocation \u00e0 laquelle l'entrepreneur a raisonnablement droit sera comprise dans le certificat mensuel de l'ing\u00e9nieur, mais si l'entrepreneur avait, en quelque temps que ce soit, des r\u00e9clamations de tous genres, lesquelles il jugerait non comprises dans les certificats progressifs, ces r\u00e9clamations devront \u00eatre faites par \u00e9crit \u00e0 l'ing\u00e9nieur dans les trente jours qui suivront la date o\u00f9 on lui a remis le certificat dans lequel, selon lui, les item de celles r\u00e9clama- tions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 omis, mais en aucun cas le d\u00e9lai ne devra d\u00e9passer les soixante jours qui suivront l'ach\u00e8vement d\u00e9finitif de cette partie de l'ouvrage \u00e0 laquelle ces r\u00e9clamations se rapportent.

L'entrepreneur, en pr\u00e9sentant des r\u00e9clamations du genre de celles auxquelles il est r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 dans la derni\u00e8re clause pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, doit les accompagner de preuves satisfaisantes de leur exactitude et donner la raison qui lui fait juger qu'elles devraient \u00eatre accord\u00e9es.\n\nPaiement pour ouvrage suppl\u00e9mentaire\n\n56. Pour tout ouvrage ou tout ouvrage suppl\u00e9mentaire fait, ou pour tous mat\u00e9riaux ou choses fournis, sur les ordres \u00e9crits de l'ing\u00e9nieur, et pour lesquels aucun prix n'est fix\u00e9 et qui n'est pas couvert par le con- trat, Sa Majest\u00e9, pour la consid\u00e9ration et sous les conditions suscit\u00e9es, paiera \u00e0 l'entrepreneur le co\u00fbt r\u00e9el et raisonnable de tel ouvrage, tels mat\u00e9riaux ou choses, tel que d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par l'ing\u00e9nieur, avec un montant additionnel de dix pour cent (10%) de ladite somme pour l'usage des outils, du mat\u00e9riel de l'entrepreneur et pour la surveillance et les profits.\n\nQuantit\u00e9s approximatives\n\n57. Les quantit\u00e9s donn\u00e9es (s'il y en a), ne sont qu'approxima- tives et aucune r\u00e9clamation ne devra \u00eatre faite par l'entrepreneur contre Sa Majest\u00e9 du fait de tout exc\u00e9dent ou insuffisance, d'une mani\u00e8re absolue ou relative, dans les quantit\u00e9s.\n\nLes mesures et les certificats progressifs ne lient pas\n\n58. Les mesures et les certificats progressifs ne devront, en aucune fa\u00e7on, \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme liant l'ing\u00e9nieur, ou comme mesures finales, ou comme fixant les montants finals; ils devront \u00eatre sujets \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision de l'ing\u00e9nieur lorsqu'il pr\u00e9parera son certificat final et ils ne devront, en aucune fa\u00e7on \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme une acceptation de l'ou- vrage ou comme une d\u00e9charge pour l'entrepreneur de toute responsabilit\u00e9 de ce chef.\n\nRectification\n\n59. Si l'on d\u00e9couvrait plus tard que des mat\u00e9riaux ou de la main- d'\u0153uvre inf\u00e9rieurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 incorpor\u00e9s aux travaux, ou que l'on s'est \u00e9cart\u00e9 du contrat de quelque fa\u00e7on, l'entrepreneur devra r\u00e9parer, sans frais pour le Minist\u00e8re, tous manquements, et tous dommages qui ont pu r\u00e9sulter desdits manquements.\n\nPOURVOU QUE, un avis soit donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'entrepreneur au sujet desdits manquements durant la p\u00e9riode d'un (1) an qui suit la date du certificat final du parach\u00e8vement de l'ouvrage.\n\nET POURVOU QU', la p\u00e9riode stipul\u00e9e dans toute garantie donn\u00e9e par l'entrepreneur ne soit pas expir\u00e9e.\nProlongation du d\u00e9lai\n\n60. Toute prolongation de d\u00e9lai qui peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9e \u00e0 l'entrepreneur devra \u00eatre ainsi accord\u00e9e et accept\u00e9e sans pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 quelque droit que ce soit de Sa Majest\u00e9, sous le contrat, et aucun consentement \u00e0 icelle de la part de l'entrepreneur ne devra \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire.\n\nf.

These forms are returned herewith for revision.\n\n(a) Classification of Costs - We are relying on you to provide the attention and checking necessary to safeguard the Department and protect the contractor. Listed below are some of the differences in amounts submitted.\n\n| Amount shown in Tender | Classification of Costs |\n|------------------------|-------------------------|\n| General Conditions     | Insurance, etc. $27,226 |\n| Carpentry Millwork     | $20,000                 |\n| Painting and Glazing   | 10,400                  |\n| Plumbing               | 23,500                  |\n| Heating                | 38,000                  |\n| Electrical             | 19,000                  |\n| Refrigeration          | -- not shown --         |\n\nPlease check the item 'General Conditions' - the amount seems to be in excess of what it should be. Mr. Tremblay should have figures for each subdivision of work or trade, to which should be added his percentage for overhead and profit. Adjustments may have to be made in order that the sum of all trade...\ndivisions is no greater than $12,000.00. When the classification is made as above, you will be reasonably sure that each division bears its own share of the total cost. These suggestions are made because, under all Government contracts, the accounts and books of a contractor are open for inspection and it is advisable to avoid any discrepancies.\n\n(b) Progress Estimates - The amount shown for carpentry would indicate that about 70% of the work was completed as of September 7th. The Progress Estimate should now be based on the revised classification of costs.\n\nKindly discuss this matter with Mr. Tremblay and have the necessary changes made and the forms returned to this office as soon as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nChas.

Noffke is the designing architect for the Seven Islands Indian Residential School, and there is an agreement with him in this connection.\n\nIt was necessary to have an inspection of the school made to see that the design he prepared is being properly carried out. Attached is a statement of the travelling expenses incurred by Mr. Arthur Kavanstein who was instructed to inspect the building to see that Mr. Noffke's design was being followed.\n\nMr. Buck, Chief, engineer has asked me to see that the attached account is paid. Mr. Noffke was not aware of our regulations regarding the securing of receipts and some receipts may not therefore have been furnished. The expenses have, however, been incurred and I would ask you to kindly issue a cheque in favor of Mr. W.E. Noffke, F.R.A.I.C., architect, and send it to him at the address shown on his letter of October 6th, namely 28 Central Chamber, Elgin Street, Ottawa.\n\nWould it be possible to pay these travelling expenses from the administration vote, as I understand that the vote for Indian education allotment for travelling is low.\n\n[Signature]\nFor Director.\n\nAccepted as a proper charge for Engineering costs in connection with the erection of the school.\n\n[Signature]\n19.10.50\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6113, file 352-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMEMORANDUM TO THE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nWhen tenders for construction of the Indian Residential School at Seven Islands Indian Agency, Quebec, were analysed, it was deemed advisable to find out if the lowest tenderer had the experience and the equipment necessary to undertake the work. This inquiry caused a delay in the preparation of documents, and also in the programme of work. Authority was granted by P.C. 2908 of 13 June, 1950, to enter into a fixed price contract with Mr. Lucien Tremblay of Portneuf, Quebec, for construction of the work.\n\nPrior to the above date, authority was granted by P.C. 2419 of 12 May, 1950, to obtain the services of Mr. Gaston Amyot, M.R.A.I.C., Architect of Quebec, to provide continuous supervision of the construction work on the project on behalf of the Department. As every effort was being made to get the job started in order to take full advantage of the construction season, Mr. Amyot was instructed to obtain the services of a Clerk-of-Works to be resident near the job to provide constant superintendence.\n\nThe agreement with Mr. Amyot provides in part \"Article 5 - Reimbursements: The Minister will reimburse the Architect for (a) the costs of transportation and personal living expenses incurred by the Architect and the Clerk-of-Works while travelling, in discharge of duties solely connected with the work. In case of mileage travelled for which convenient railway or motor bus transportation is not available, an allowance of eight cents ($0.08) per mile may be paid. The mileage allowances paid cover the entire cost to the Government except bridge tolls and ferry charges. (b) the salary of Clerk-of-Works engaged and paid by the Architect provided that the Minister shall have approved of the engagement of such Clerk-of-Works as a necessity, and shall have approved of the salary rate to be paid.\"\n\nMr. Amyot, without prior approval, engaged and sent down a Clerk-of-Works to supervise the concrete work only, at rates and under conditions prevailing in that area; that part of the work is now completed and the duties of this temporary Clerk-of-Works have\nended. The services of Mr. Waller, a qualified engineer, can now be obtained as Clerk-of-Works, and he will remain at Seven Islands until completion of the work, and is willing to accept the same remuneration paid to the temporary Clerk-of-Works, i.e., $250.00 per month with living expenses of $60.00 (room and board), and transportation allowances.\n\nAccounts submitted by Mr. Amyot for reimbursements under the agreement show that air travel has been used, as this is the only convenient means to make the journey to that location, and at very little extra cost.\n\nIn view of the isolated location of this work, and the difficulty of securing technical personnel, our Engineering and Construction Service consider that the interests of the Department will be well served by concurrence in the above arrangements and, therefore, recommend that (a) permission be granted to secure the services of Mr. Waller as Clerk-of-Works at the rates and under the conditions stated above, and (b) that air travel be allowed in place of the provision under the agreement.\n\nFunds for the entire project are available in the Indian Affairs Education Vote 59, Estimates 1950-51.\n\nDirector.\n\nRecommended\n\nDeputy Minister\n\nApproved\n\nMinister\n\nIndian Affairs.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nEncl:\nBFN/HM\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nAs I informed you this morning, I have just visited the new Residential School which is being erected by your Department at Sept-Iles, P.Q. As stated during the course of our interview, I found the building of the school progressing rapidly and, from informations given to me by the local and Quebec Supervising Architects, the contractor is following both plans and specifications as required by the contract.\n\nHis Excellency Bishop Labrie, due to the very late season, has taken it upon himself to authorize the construction of a residence for the principal and the staff, at a cost of $13,500.00. His only reason for acting as he did was to benefit by the presence of the school contractor who had part of the building materials on hand and who was able to obtain the balance very quickly as he owns two large freighting boats.\n\nDuring the same visit, I had occasion to meet two Official Agronomists, Mr. Gagnon and Mr. Gauthier and, with them Mr. Pauz\u00e9, your Inspector. Father D\u00e9carie, the new Principal, and I discussed with him the problem of erecting a small farm for the Sept-Iles School. Mr. Pauz\u00e9 will have with him, when he comes to Ottawa at the beginning of the next week, the letter which Mr. Gauthier has written to him on this matter. It is Mr. Gauthier's opinion that a small farm, comprising two or three horses, ten cows, fifteen to twenty pigs, a henhouse capable of housing five hundred laying hens, is necessary to the welfare not only of the school, but of that of the Indians who will be residing on the reserve.\n\nWe were all of the opinion that the school contractor is the logical man to erect the buildings necessary for this farm as he not only has a large equipment, but can also supply all the lumber, hardware and labour necessary for this job.\n\n(Over)\nI therefore hope that you will be able to take up this matter with your Director in the very near future so that these buildings can be built this fall without any delay. I might say that the Department of Agriculture has promised to supply all the plans necessary for the barn, piggery and henhouse free of charge.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nMr. B.F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Oil Heating for the Sept-Iles School\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nI have already mentioned to Mr. Buck the advisability of installing an oil heating system at the above school.\n\nThis conviction has been arrived at after consulting His Excellency Bishop N.A. LaBrie, C.J.M., in whose diocese the school is situated. In a letter dated September 12, 1950, I find the following paragraph:\n\n\"I am informed that the heating will be done with coal. From information received, I am told that coal will cost, when landed at the school, $40.00 per ton. There are at Sept-Iles two oil companies who maintain large oil tanks. Oil would be delivered by them all through the year, summer and winter. I believe that heating with oil would be cheaper than with coal because there would be no necessity to provide storage space for coal, which in that part of the country is always quite a problem. The Havre St. Pierre Hospital, which was using coal up to last year, has given it up for oil. Their main trouble was self combustion in the coal pile. This change is all the more remarkable as there are no oil tanks at Havre St. Pierre and the Sisters in charge of this institution have to buy oil in the fall of the year in barrels, for twelve months ahead.\"\n\nThe Bishop also says that it seems that water will be heated by one of the boilers used for heating the school. This may be all right in winter, but he objects to using large boilers in the summer time only for that purpose. He states that it would be more economical to install a small oil heater for this purpose.\n\nI believe that Mr. Macauley of the Dominion Coal Company mentioned Havre St. Pierre as one of their customers as an argument for the Sept-Iles School to use coal. The above statement of His Excellency shows that this statement of Mr. Macauley is not according to facts.\n\n(Over)\nOne other main reason for having an oil system in this school is that the storing of such a large quantity of coal -- 200 to 250 tons -- according to Mr. Macauley's opinion, will be quite a task. During the winter, and whether we want it or not, the Principal will have to use the boys of the school for handling the coal, which will prevent them occasionally to attend class or deprive them of necessary exercise. Moreover, coal will require a heating engineer and an assistant. For those who know labour conditions at Sept-Iles, this will be considered quite a financial problem and those who will be in charge of the school are certainly anxious to avoid all additional expenses.\n\nAs stated at the beginning of this letter, the Principal in charge of the school must operate it on the per capita grant allowed by the Department. It is therefore quite logical that he should ask that his work be made as easy as it can be done. Heating a school as large as this building is such a task that nothing should be done to complicate it.\n\nHoping that the above remarks will help your Department to adopt the best heating system for this school, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOctober 18, 1950.\n\nMr. A. A. Macaulay,\nDistrict Manager, Coal Sales,\nDominion Coal Company, Limited,\nCanada Cement Building,\nMontreal, P. Q.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIndian Residential School - Seven Islands, Ont.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of August 24, and the points which you have raised have been the subject of several discussions with our Chief Engineer and with the Reverend Father J. O. Plourde, O.M.I., General Superintendent, Indian Welfare and Training Commission, Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate.\n\nThe Oblate Fathers will be in charge of the operation of this school and naturally they are very much concerned over its economical operation. This Department pays a flat per capita grant for each pupil and the school management purchases food, clothing, fuel and other items out of this grant.\n\nFirstly, with regard to the cost of the coal, I would like specific information as to the exact cost of it per ton, f.o.b. wharfside at Seven Islands.\n\nSecondly, as there is no distributor or dealer at Seven Islands, it will naturally be difficult to arrange for storage facilities on the wharf or at Seven Islands and also for its transportation to the school.\n\nThirdly, we are informed that there are no coal users in Seven Islands and that we would probably be the sole\nusers. On the other hand, there are many users of oil and good storage facilities exist. Additional storage facilities are now being provided.\n\nFourthly, there is no definite assurance that a hospital will be built between Seven Islands and Moosie and that it will use coal.\n\nFifthly, we would have to provide a storage shed at the school for the coal and we would further have to face additional labour costs in keeping the stoker filled and in removing the ashes. We naturally run these schools on a narrow cost margin and do not encourage the management to use the labour of the Indian pupils. Therefore, in many of our schools which burn coal, we have had difficulty in ensuring that the management did not use the older pupils on such work when they should have been in the classrooms.\n\nThere are other points and naturally your combustion engineer might be prepared to give further information concerning the above. Our Chief Engineer has discussed this matter with me and is aware that I am writing to you as above.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nCopy to Mr. Buck and Mr. Pauze\nAugust 24th, 1950.\n\nCol. D.F. Neary,\nSuperintendent,\nDepartment of Education,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Residential School, Seven Islands.\n\nWe were informed by the Tribeec Company, Quebec City, that the original plan to install Iron Fireman Stokers in this building has been cancelled and the coal burning equipment will be replaced with an oil burning installation. We were informed that the decision to change the equipment was brought about by the high cost of coal, in this case a figure of $35.00 per ton having been quoted.\n\nWe are selling the Clarke Trading Company Dominion Stoker coal from Sydney and they tell me it can be landed on the Wharf at Seven Islands for around $16.00 per ton. The extra handling to the Residence would not amount to more than another dollar or two at the outside.\n\nIf the Residence is large enough to consume 2/250 tons of coal on your order we believe that considerable saving could be made in the use of Dominion Stoker coal in this Institution as compared against what they would have to pay for oil.\n\nWhen the other project for the proposed hospital between Seven Islands and Moisie materialises that would create another outlet for coal so if the aggregate quantity would run around 450 tons we could get a small steamer to float the coal from Sydney at a lower rate than they charge for a part cargo, so it is quite possible that the figure of $16.00 on the Wharf at Havre St. Pierre could be reduced.\n\nOn a comparative basis using 140 gallons of fuel oil to equal a ton of our Stoker coal and taking oil at 18\u00bd cents per gallon this would be equivalent to coal at $25.90 per ton delivered.\n\n-continued-\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6113, file 352-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nNaturally we want to see the Government install coal burning equipment rather than have them purchase oil burning installations, and I am sure that this policy would find favour with the Minister.\n\nIf there is any further information we can give you that will assist in drawing up your plans for this plant do not hesitate to call on us and if necessary we are prepared to send our Combustion Engineer up to Ottawa to discuss the whole project with yourself or the Department of Public Works.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.A. Macaulay,\nDistrict Manager, Coal Sales.\n\nAAM:JB\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Indian Residential School - Seven Islands, Que.\n\nI acknowledge with thanks the receipt of your letter of October 18th on the above subject.\n\nFor your information the best estimate at the present time on Dominion Stoker Pea coal is $5.00 per net ton ex ships tackle, Government wharf, Seven Islands. The Clarke Trading Co. have a store at Seven Islands, and that Company arranges the delivery of our coal to the hospital at Havre St. Pierre. I am sure they would be pleased to quote you a price on the Dominion coal for delivery to the Institution at Seven Islands. They have a truck that could be used to transport the coal from the wharf to the residence.\n\nAlthough there are no bituminous coal users in Seven Islands, the Gulf Pulp and Paper Co., located right across the Bay at Clark City, have used our coal for a good many years, and we put in a minimum of 1,000 tons a year to them during the season of navigation.\n\nI know it would be difficult to obtain transportation at this late date, but if we could start to develop the matter early in April, arrangements could be made to float the coal from Sydney, N.S. to Havre St. Pierre for the Institution next season.\n\nPersonally, I do not believe it would be necessary to build a storage shed at the school but this is a matter that the people concerned with operating the school will have to take into consideration. An oil burning installation would not eliminate the necessity of a qualified attendant so the problem of filling the stoker and removing the ashes could be performed by the personnel required to operate the plant. In small plants the time required to handle the coal and ashes is not such that it requires the full efforts of an extra man.\n\nIf there is any further information that you would like to have on the subject do not hesitate to communicate with us and, if necessary, I would be pleased to go up to Ottawa and discuss the subject with you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

The Department approves the admission of all these children and we are returning to you the duplicates and triplicates of these applications.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would instruct Father Laurin that in the future he should forward the necessary applications to your office and you should forward them to this office for the necessary consideration. Should any of the applications warrant any special comments you should give them in a letter attached to the applications for admission. When the necessary applications are approved you will be advised accordingly. On receipt of the approval you should then advise the Principal that the children may be admitted to the school as grant-earning pupils.

Indian Agency,\nSeven Islands, P.Q.,\n\nWith reference to the September Quarterly Return for the Seven Islands Indian Residential School, attached I am returning the duplicate copy of this Return as only one copy of the Return is required in this office.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would advise the Principal that we are allowing thirty days for all the pupils who were in residence September 1st or prior to September 1 as the Department has been paying operation costs up to August 31 and if Per Capita Grant was paid for more than thirty days there would be a duplication of payment. This duplication of payment is not approved by the auditors.\n\nFor the column headed \"Total Number of Days Pupil in Residence during the Quarter\", the Principal has used ditto marks to show repetition of the number of days children were in residence. Please advise the Principal that this practice must be discontinued and he must indicate opposite each pupil's name the respective number of days the pupil was in residence.\nYou are advised that we have received the necessary applications for all the children listed on the Return and you may advise the Principal that a cheque for the amount of the grant will be forthcoming within the next week.\n\nYou may advise the Principal that any children's names who are added to the Return must be entered following the last pupils on the present Return. The names of these new admissions should also be included on Form I.A. 411. It is presumed that the Principal has a supply of these. Any discharges should also be entered on Form I.A. 411.\n\nPlease instruct the Principal that he may claim grant only for pupils who are actually in residence. It is noted that in several cases on the September Return the pupils left the residence during September while the Principal has claimed grant for them. We have disallowed the claim and have allowed grant only for the time the pupils were in residence.\n\nYou may advise the Principal that we are asking Treasury officials to make out the cheque for the Per Capita Grant payment as follows:\n\n\"Please make cheque payable to:\nSeven Islands Indian Residential School\nand forward to Rev. L. Laurin, Principal\nSeven Islands Indian Residential School,\nSeven Islands, P.Q.\"\n\nIf there is any other way the Principal wants his cheques sent, it would be appreciated if you would let us know and we will make arrangements.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nMFT/HM\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nSupervisor of Education\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa\nOntario\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nWould you kindly send us forms for admission as we wish to enroll our file here in school.

At that time we wrote Superintendent Pauze regarding this information and asked him to advise whether the school could accommodate the nine children.\n\nOn December 4th Superintendent Pauze replied that these children could be accommodated comfortably and that possibly ten more applications could be considered at a later date as accommodation would be available for them. On December 10, we approved the admission of the nine children.\n\nOn January 9 we received applications for admission of nine more children. The admission of these was approved.\n\nWe have now received applications for eleven more children to be admitted to the Seven Islands Residential School. Before considering these applications it would be appreciated if you would give us your opinion as to whether any more children should be placed in the Seven Islands Residential School.

Phelan.\n\nI have your letter dated January 16, 1953, your file # 352-10 (E6). I just had a telephone conversation with Superintendent Pauze and Father Lambert; both assured me that they could take the additional eleven children with no inconveniences for these and those already in the residential school.\n\nI have not figured how many cubic feet there would be for the children in the dormitories, but the two gentlemen mentioned above tell me that there is sufficient space, air circulation, etc., to keep the conditions very acceptable.\n\nThe Superintendent assures me that the new children being taken in belong to families where the parents are away and that if we did not take them in the residential school they could not attend school at all. As they have received over 200 beds down there and as those beds were ordered by the Branch they feel that it is only logical to fill them if the need arises. Father Lambert is very enthusiastic and he assures me again that everything is running smoothly.\n\nJD/er Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nc.c. Supt Pauze\n\nIndian Affairs.

Although the Department is anxious to give as many as possible children an education, care must be exercised to avoid overcrowding the school to such an extent that the education of all the children suffers. Please advise.\n\nWe are holding the original copies of these applications pending the approval of the admission of these children to the Seven Islands Residential School.

W. Paschene (Bobby)\nFort MacKenzie\n\nThis child was in Park Savard Hospital for about four years. He must be between five and six years old now and on his recent return to Fort Chimo it was obvious that he is completely out of place there. He no longer speaks the Indian language and his mother being dead he is in the care of a none too careful father. Our nurse hoped that it would be possible for this boy to be put into a residential school where he could gain some useful education, which is not possible at Fort MacKenzie.\n\nWould you be good enough to give this case your consideration please.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP.

D'Astous,\nRegional Supervisor of\nIndian Agencies,\n55B St. Joseph St.,\nQuebec, P.Q.,\n\nAttached is a copy of a letter recently received from Dr. Moore regarding the admission of S.W. Paschene (Bobby) to a residential school.\n\nIt will be noted that this boy is between five and six years of age. The only possible school that this boy could be admitted to is the Fort George C.E. Residential School if his father is Anglican or the Fort George R.C. or Seven Islands Residential School if his father is Roman Catholic.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would look into this matter and arrange to have the necessary application for admission completed if you feel that this boy should be placed in a residential school. It is realized that the Principal of a residential school might not be interested in accepting this boy particularly when he has only recently been discharged from a hospital where he has been confined for the past four years as it is often necessary to provide special facilities and food.\n\nR.F.

A roof of genuine Johns-Manville Asbestos Shingles at the lowest price you have ever had to pay. And what a shingle! Combining beauty of color with the tried and time-tested advantages of asbestos, it represents the most outstanding value in all J-M's more than 85 years experience in the manufacture of roofing materials for the home.\n\nBeauty Here is beauty such as you would never have thought possible in a fabricated shingle! The clean-cut shadow lines that make for interest and charm on a roof. The simplicity and dignity of line that are invariably associated with the finest architecture. Truly, it is difficult to believe that a shingle so lovely in appearance can also possess the permanence of stone.\n\nColor But the stylists of J-M Durabestos Shingles were not content with beauty of design alone. They sought\u2014and found\u2014outstanding beauty of color, too. There is a soft green blend, for example, that seems to harmonize perfectly with any surroundings. A blend of rich, warm reds that gives a distinctive touch to any home. A black blend that makes one of the most strikingly handsome roofs you have ever seen. And there is a gray blend too\u2014a color which is particularly suitable for present day homes.\n\nFireproof Like all Johns-Manville Asbestos Shingles, these Durabestos Shingles are fireproof\u2014not just fire-resistant. Even the white heat of a blow torch cannot burn them! Against that ever-present menace which destroys millions of dollars in property each year\u2014the roof communicated fire\u2014they give your home effective protection. This advantage alone may some day mean the difference between security and disaster should sparks or brands from a nearby fire happen to fall on your roof.\n\nRotproof and Weatherproof Made of asbestos and cement, two practically imperishable materials. J-M Durabestos Shingles are immune to rot or decay. Built to defy the ravages of time and weather, a roof of these durable shingles needs no periodic upkeep\u2014no expensive repairs. Applied on your new home or over the old shingles on your present home, it is an investment in protection that will endure as long as your house stands.\nNEW FAST-LAYING DESIGN CUTS APPLICATION COSTS!\n\nThe development of the Durabestos Shingle was the result of years of study and research to produce a fabricated asbestos-cement shingle that would cut application costs to the bone. The answer was found in a strip type shingle which, when applied on the roof, covers in one simple operation as much area as 5 ordinary shingles!\n\nIn actual application tests, the Durabestos Shingle required less time to apply than any other Johns-Manville Rigid Asbestos Roofing Shingle and only slightly more time than the fastest-laying asphalt strip shingle.\n\nHome-owners, builders and architects everywhere have been so enthusiastic in their response to this shingle that J-M has been able to take full advantage of modern mass production economies in its manufacture. As a result of these economies, plus its low application cost, you can now provide your home with the protection of a colorful asbestos-shingle roof at the lowest price in Johns-Manville history!\nBased on over 85 years of manufacturing experience in roofing materials, we recommend J-M Durabestos Roofing Shingles as the most satisfactory and economical shingles over a period of years any home owner can buy. We believe it is one of the most attractive and durable roofing products we have ever manufactured and its reasonable price recommends its selection.\n\nJohns-Manville\nFrom the WORLD'S LARGEST ASBESTOS MINE nature provides your home with modern roofing!\n\nThe ancient Tartars believed Asbestos to be akin to the salamander\u2014fabled beast that lived in fire...\n\nCharlemagne used Asbestos \"magic\" to avert a war with his powerful enemies... Taking a tablecloth of Asbestos, he cleansed it with fire before their eyes... Not knowing of this fireproof mineral that can be woven, such sorcery struck fear into the hearts of the Moslems, and they departed in peace.\n\nAs history marched on, men everywhere came to know this \"magic mineral,\" but only in comparatively recent times has Asbestos been turned to the protection of lives and property\u2014to the creation of new living comfort\u2014and the saving of millions of dollars annually for industry and home owners.\n\nPictured above is the famous Johns-Manville mine at Asbestos, Que. It is the largest Asbestos mine in the world. Out of this huge pit, Johns-Manville mines ton upon ton of the raw Asbestos, hour after hour. Then, in Johns-Manville manufacturing plants, it is fabricated into literally hundreds of building and industrial materials which defy the ravages of fire, weather and time.\n\nDurabestos Roofing Shingles are representative of the many Asbestos products which have come out of Johns-Manville's eighty-five years of research and development. The great J-M Research Laboratories are the largest of their kind in the world... devoted to the discovery of new ways to control man's ancient enemies\u2014fire, weather and wear.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\ncontd.

Larson, a contractor living at Hearst, who was recommended as a competent builder, and as far as I could find about the only person who could take on the job of building the school, with him I went over estimates I had prepared on the train as to the amount of material required for the type of building we had in mind.\n\nMr. Larson had several suggestions to offer regarding the kind of material to use in the light of his experience with the climate of the district, which pretty well tallied with my own experience in Chapleau; one of these was that the roof should have at least a one-third pitch, so that the accumulation of snow would not weigh too heavily on the roof; another that the building ought to be insulated on the sides and ceiling to save fuel and ensure adequate heating at all parts of the building.\n\nI agreed with his idea, as it was just what I had done to my own house in Chapleau, where the weather is pretty much the same as it is in the Galesstock area.\n\nMr. Larson will be willing to consider either a tender for the construction of the building or on a day labour plan as soon as a suitable guide plan can be prepared, I presume it will be possible to have a plan drawn up.\n\nI then proceeded to interview the hardware and building supply dealers to find out what material was available for immediate purchase and secured a list of prices from the George Taylor Hardware, and the Fellow Hardware at Hearst, the prices of the latter were all higher than the former, so I eliminated those, and the prices on the attached requisition are all from The George Taylor Hardware Co., except for the\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6114, file 374-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nfor the Birch Flooring, which is taken from the Halliday Co. of Hamilton catalog, and the paint, which I notice from a purchase order just received can be purchased much cheaper from the representative of the Sherwin Williams Co. in Ottawa.\n\nThe George Taylor people are prepared to invoice the goods at once, and hold to our order in their warehouse without any storage charge, until we are ready to take delivery; there not being any storage facilities in Calstock that we could use if delivery were made at once.\n\nOn the basis of the material available I would recommend that it be built as follows,\n\nFull basement with cement floor\n2 X 10 floor joists, covered with a sub floor 1\" rough Birch,\n2 X 4 wall studding, covered outside with Gyplap sheathing,\nthis is fireproof material, V jointed to prevent drafts, a full half inch thick which will not warp or dry out, I favour this against lumber as all any lumber available is green and is bound to dry out and draw on the studs, with a clapboard finish on the outside of the sheathing.\n\nInside walls, filled with 3\" insulation batts, by using this it will only be necessary to have one layer on the studding, which I recommend to be \u00bd\" Gyproc, this is easily and quickly applied and will leave a good surface to be painted.\n\nThe ceiling to be the same as the inside walls.\n\nRoof, one inch rough lumber on the rafters, covered with tar paper and Asbestos shingles, these are absolutely fireproof and last a lifetime, they are not affected by heat or cold which at times is extreme here, and are not subject to the drying out and curling which so often happens to cedar shingles, I could not get a price on the latter, there not being any in the vicinity, very few being used so far North.\n\nI propose a door at each end of the building, with a small porch and outside doors on the front, with five windows in each side, the size quoted on being two lights, upper 20 X 30\" and the lower 30 X 30\".\n\nWhen in Ottawa no basement was proposed and I got a price of $29.28 on an \"dam Hall Cast box stove, large enough to take a three foot stick, this price F.O.B. Hearst, tax included, however with the basement I think it would be preferable to install a wood furnace, which for the size of the building, and the locality should be rated as having a capacity of 25,000 cubic feet. At least.\nIn your letter of material required it appeared that 2 X 4 for wall studding had been omitted, these I have added to the requisition, with regard to the tar paper, I did not get a price on this, but I question the amount estimated and suggest that you have it checked by Mr. Doucet, according to my estimate we need enough to cover 7,000 square feet.\n\nI have also left open the amount of nails needed for his estimate, which ought to be better than mine, with regard to the ceiling rafters, the longest available here are 16 feet, and I have added enough in number to allow for splicing if necessary by using the 16's.\n\nI did not receive your letter until I had returned to Chapleau, and the quotations I secured were on the basis of the original building 50 X 25', without a basement, so I have had to make the changes required as to the amounts etc.\n\nAlso required will be suitable bell to call the children to school, and a good sized Union Jack, the latter I would like to have before I pay treaty this year, whether the building is finished or not, I am assured that a suitable flag pole will be erected.\n\nWith all this detail I trust that you will be able to go ahead with the purchase of the material, if there is any further information required I will be glad to try to get it for you, I might add that the order if placed should be addressed to The George Taylor Hardware Co., Hearst, Ontario, except for paint and Birch flooring as mentioned previously.\n\nF. Matters\nIndian Agent.\nMr. Doucet,\n\nPlease read letter and discuss with me.\n\nPP\nOttawa,\nMarch 29, 1944.\n\nMr. F. Matters, Indian Agent, Chapleau, Ont.\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, enclosing requisition for materials required for the proposed Constance Lake Indian Day School.\n\nWe have submitted these requisitions to the Purchasing Branch and purchase order is being issued today.\n\nI wish you would get in touch immediately with the George Taylor Hardware Company, Hearst, Ontario, and advise them that the purchase order will reach them shortly. I note from your letter that they are prepared to store the goods until they are required, but as we are paying for the material from the appropriation for the fiscal year 1943-44, it would be absolutely necessary for us to have the account dated not later than March 31, 1944. Please note these instructions particularly. The account should reach us some time previous to the 20th of April, as we are allowed to pay from the old appropriation until that date, but, as just stated, the account must be dated previous to March 31.\n\nWe have reviewed your letter very carefully and enclose a rough sketch of the proposed building. You will notice that this sketch is suggestive, but I believe will be sufficient to convey to you the idea that we have in mind.\n\nYou will notice that we are providing an entrance for wood, material etc. into the basement by means of a ramp. This opening should be wide enough to provide space for the entry of fuel and other material of greater bulk that might be stored in the basement.\nYou will also note that in the sketch four windows are indicated. These might easily be regrouped in pairs, in order to provide more lighting. On one side, however, we believe it would be better if half windows were used high from the floor, in order to prevent any cross light and at the same time provide sufficient lighting for the room. This would also permit blackboard space below these half windows.\n\nThe door might be on the opposite side from that indicated in the sketch, if you think such a position would better suit local conditions. You should provide as much window space as possible in the basement, in order to allow daylight to enter. No windows should be put in the wall opposite the front door.\n\nI note that you suggest 2 x 4 wall studding and, in order that the purchase order might not be complicated and delay us, we have ordered this. However, it is our idea that it would be preferable to use 2 x 6 studding, in order to give better support to the roof. This size of studding is especially necessary, as there will be no sheeting on the interior of the walls. Our suggestion might entail some additional expense, but would, I believe, greatly strengthen the building. As regards the Gyplap sheeting for the outside wall, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that this article has very little bracing power. Personally we prefer diagonal sheeting. This latter sheeting could be covered with asbestos shingles which would make the building more fireproof than it would be if the other method were followed and, besides, would make the building more rigid. It would be appreciated if you would let us have your comments on these suggestions.\n\nIn the event of our suggestions being followed, we would have to change the 2 x 4 studding to 2 x 6 studding. However, do not take this matter up with the George Taylor Hardware Company at the present time, as it can be adjusted later, and, in the case of any additional expense, we can have necessary authority obtained from the Purchasing Branch before the erection of the building commences.\n\nR.A.

Matters\nIndian Agent.\nChapleau Ontario\nMarch 31st, 1944\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Your letter 65-7-1, March 29th.\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter as above, needless to say I was glad that you were able to get the purchase order through in time. I am attaching a copy of my letter to the George Taylor Hardware Co. regarding the invoicing of the material.\n\nThanks for the sketch, it gives me a much more complete picture of the type of building that you have in mind, and when construction begins I will see that your ideas are carried out.\n\nI think that the windows as laid out in the sketch ought to be increased to six, which would give us approximately 18' X 5' of window space on one side, and this with the same number of smaller windows, high up and staggered as to location on the opposite wall should provide enough lighting; these might be covered with blinds during the teaching period if it were found that the cross light was hard on the eyes of the children, also I think that the small windows should be of the transom type, so that they could be opened to give ventilation.\n\nIt might have been as well had you changed the requisition to read 2 X 6 instead of 2 X 4, at the price given for the former size, as I found it necessary to mention the possible change in my letter to the George Taylor Hardware, also about the outside sheeting, as it was quite possible that they would proceed to accumulate the material and then find that they had some that we did not need. I quite agree that the 2 X 6 would be a far better proposition than the lighter material, and feel that I was very lax in my recommending this size, as I should have known from the expanse of walls and roof that a stronger wall would be preferable.\n\nWith regard to the outside walls, as I mentioned, my main objection to lumber for the primary sheathing was on account of it being green, and thus liable to dry out.\ndry out and create draft spots, however if the building is to be insulated and asbestos siding shingles applied with a good lap allowed, then there would be no objection to lumber and no chance of any draft getting through, and the diagonal method of sheeting would be much better.\n\nI trust that you will accept my explanation with regard to the letter to the George Taylor Co., and the last paragraph of your letter, I felt that I had to decide to advise them rather than have any difficulty later.\n\nAs soon as I receive the invoices I will send them forward for payment, and feel quite safe in saying we will have them in ample time.\n\nF.

Matters\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Br., Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of May 29th, file 65-7-1, with attached copy of a letter from the Rev. M. Stanley Elliott, of Nakina, Ont. regarding the advisability of opening a school at Aroland, Ont.\n\nIn reply I wish to say that I have made enquiries every year at Treaty payments at this point, regarding the advisability of opening a temporary school in one of the old Aroland Logging Co. buildings. I have also discussed with the Indians at great length the advisability of sending their children to residential schools. Unfortunately, several years ago three children died at Fort William during the time they were attending residential school. The Indians were very much concerned and refused to send their children to a residential school since that time.\n\nDuring Treaty payments this year, I stayed an extra day to discuss the school question thoroughly with these Indians and I wish to report that after a very careful survey only nine children would actually remain at Aroland, to attend school, if the Department opened one at this point. I have no guarantee that the nine would actually attend as some of the parents stated that they might go trapping.\n\nThese Indians are typical bush Indians, living the Indian mode of life and derive their living by hunting and trapping, and they take their families to their trap lines and move from place to place continually. Under these circumstances I do not think I would be justified in having the Department open a temporary school at this point.\n\nIn conclusion.............(over)\nIn conclusion, may I point out that there are several fairly large Indian settlements, where the Indians do not reside on Indian reserves along the main line of the Can.

Blackburn for the position of teacher at the Constance Lake School.\n\nThe Department does not feel that it is possible to appoint the Reverend Mr. Blackburn immediately. However, as the school will be nearly completed by October first, we are willing to appoint him as teacher from that date, at a salary of $100.00 a teaching month, plus bonus.

Matters\nIndian Agent.\nChapleau Ontario  \nAugust 21st. 1944\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRe. Constance Lake School.\n\nOn my visit to the location of the above school, on the new Constance Lake Reserve, last week, I saw the George Taylor Hardware people who are supplying the material, Mr. E. Larsen the contractor also Mr. De. Wolfe and \"R. Parry of the Arrow Land and Logging Co., besides a number of the Indians.\n\nMr. Larsen had just finished a construction job, and after a day to pick up his tools would be able to go to Calstock to begin work, this would be on August 17th., he was taking one other carpenter and would secure some labourers from among the Indians.\n\nThe George Taylor Hardware had most of the material required on hand, and the balance was on order and would be at the site in good time.\n\nAt Calstock I went over the site with Mr. Perry of the lumber company, and he was to put his tractor and Bulldozer on the job of clearing the amount of land required at once, he estimated that two days work would clear an area about 100 feet square or more, this would be enough for our immediate needs.\n\nSince my return I have been advised by Mr. Brenner, of Phillips and Brenner, Surveyors etc. that they had been engaged to do the survey work on the reserve, and requesting a date for me to meet their man at Hearst, I have given them August 30th. as being most convenient to me, as I will have to go up every two weeks to pay the men engaged in the construction of the building, and will go over the site with him, and plan out the townsite as suggested, using the best location and leave it to him to line up a road according to the land levels to that point.\n\nAny comment or suggestions you may have will be appreciated.\n\nF. Matters, Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nAugust 24, 1944.\n\nMr. F. Matters, Indian Agent, Chapleau, Ont.\n\nI have your letters of the 21st instant, in connection with the erection of the new Constance Lake School.\n\nAs you state there will be no deductions from payments made to Indians for income tax, as they are working on their own reserve.\n\nWith reference to income tax deductions from the white men employed, it will be in order for you to follow the same procedure as the lumber company. At the end of every two weeks you should draw a cheque in favour of the Receiver General for the amount of income tax deducted and you should forward this to the Inspector of Income Tax for the district.\n\nAll the white men employed should have unemployment insurance books which they should turn over to you while they are working on this job and you should buy the necessary stamps and put them in the books, which should be returned to the men when the work is completed.\n\nWhen preparing labour return forms to account for the advance which you have been forwarded two entries should be made on the last two lines. One entry should read \"Amount deducted for income tax\" and should show the total deducted and your cheque number. The other line should read \"Payments for unemployment insurance stamps\" and should show the total expended for this purpose and your cheque number.\nI have also noted your second letter of the 21st instant, in which you state that work on the building began on August 17.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, August 30, 1944.\n\nMr. F. Matters, Indian Agent, Chapleau, Ont.\n\nLast April you were forwarded Purchase Order No. 23322, covering the paint required for the new school at the Constance Lake Reserve. The order was placed with the Sherwin Williams Company on the understanding that you would advise the company when the paint should be shipped. The company's agent made enquiry yesterday regarding this order. It would be appreciated if you would communicate with him and advise him when you want the paint.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nChapleau Ontario,\nJune 22nd, 1944.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRe: File S-65, Pagwa River\n\nSeveral other questions regarding trapping and relief were discussed and explained to their satisfaction.\n\nAfter the meeting was closed I began paying Treaty as I wanted to be all through by noon the following day to catch the train East; to have missed it would have meant another four days at Pagwa River.\n\nMost of the Indians present came for their money, but 26 heads of families or single persons either appeared at the pay table and refused their money or else did not appear at all. George Paris was among those who did not appear at the table, Simeon Taylor #39, Joseph Natawabin #70 and Gaulis Reuben #72 appeared and even after I had explained they they did not have to leave Pagwa River if they did not wish to do so, and that the acceptance of their money would not make any difference to what happened at Constance Lake, that they would still get every consideration from the Department wherever they lived, still refused to accept their money and left it on the table. I had Constable Spencer attest on the roll to this effect.\n\nThey did not know why they would not accept it under the new Band and number, the stock reply being \"We do not want to have anything to do with Calstock\", and unless I listed them under their old Band and numbers they were not interested. I showed them that this could not be done as the Band lists were our only method of keeping account of them. I had the Chief and interpreter show them on my books where Indians had been paid by cheque, so that if it happened that I did not get to Pagwa any other year it could easily be sent to them, but to no avail.\n\nI was very patient with them, and spent the rest of the day and part of the next morning in paying the rest of those present and left for Calstock at 3:30 p.m., feeling satisfied that I had done everything in my power.\n\n(over)\nto convince them that no coercion was being used at all.\n\nRegarding relief I checked and found that several old people were in very poor circumstances and had not been getting the full ration as authorized, and although some were among those who refused their money I advised the manager of the Hudson's Bay Store that I would write him and send a list of the goods to be supplied to them in future, through the interpreter I learned that some of the old people were afraid to accept the money as they had been told by George Faries or his friends not to do so, I would classify him as a pretty much of a local bully.\n\nThis whole situation appears to emanate from one of two sources, either Mr. Ericson, a C.N.R. section man who also runs a store, a pool room and deals in furs, or the manager of the Hudson's Bay Co., I rather think it is the former, as I learn that he had written a letter to Archdeacon Woodall of South Porcupine, complaining that the Rev. N.R. Clarke was trying to force the Indians to go to Calstock, which is not true, he may have advised them but he is not in the position to attempt to force them to go.\n\nNeither of the telegrams you received were drawn up or written by George Faries, who speaks poor English and I am given to understand cannot read at all. I think it would be worth while to get the original messages which will be on file at the C.N.R. Office at Pagwa and to find out by a comparison of handwriting who is creating the unrest, if the matter was handed over the R.C.M.P. they could and I'm sure would find the culprit, as I am perfectly satisfied that it is the work of one of the above, or both, as if the Indians move they will lose their business.\n\nWith regard to the night letter of June 19th, Faries is wrong in his statement that they would not be paid unless they promised to move to Calstock, I stressed the opposite all the time, they could have but would not accept the Treaty money except under their own terms which were impossible, Mr. Arneil can verify that last year the great majority of those present were in favour of Calstock.\nand still are, but not so many of these men were present this year as they waited until I went there/to pay treaty, I expect to go up with Mr. Arneil when he visits the agency about the end of July or early in August.\n\nI think this matter will settle itself as soon as we get the school established at Constance Lake reserve, and when the Indians find that they will be much better off there than at Pagwa River, in the meantime unless there is a very great change in opinion among them I would strongly suggest that no other effort be made to pay them Treaty money this year, they having had the chance but refused to accept it, and that the proposed action by the R.C.M.P. be proceeded with.\n\nF.

J. Blackburn instead of to myself, as, knowing the man and the work he has done for this last few years it is adding insult to injury.\n\nHe holds his B.A. certificate and was qualified and did teach in one of the universities, as is shown on his application, he has worked every summer since going to Constance Lake reserve without any pay from the department at all, and is doing so now, doing general welfare work among the families on the reserve.\n\nHis wife, Mrs. Blackburn, has been holding sewing classes for both the school girls and the older women on the reserve without even thinking of asking for any remuneration.\n\nIt is fair to say that throughout the year that between them they put in as much time doing welfare work as the ordinary teacher puts in in the classroom, as every day or night there is someone around who is sick or in trouble.\n\nThese people left a town where there was every convenience to go into this work, going to an isolated point where there is no convenience at all, neither light, water or other white company, they are two miles from a telephone and whenever anyone is sick on the reserve have to go out to phone the Doctor, in the wintet time this is quite a job.\n\nWhen Mr. Blackburn went to the reserve none of the children understood a word of English, ans since then he has made wonderful progress with them, he is\nable to talk to them in their own language, which is a far greater asset than any teaching certificate, without this progress would have been very slow.\n\nHe did write asking that he be allowed to take up the course by correspondence, but when I last saw him he had not had any reply, actually I think this would be a waste of his time, he only has a few more years to teach before he is 65 and I think we ought to use him to the full whilst he is available and pay him a reasonable salary for the work he is doing.\n\nIt was my understanding that these changes were intended to help such cases as this, and I do hope that not too much weight is given to holding of certain certificates and too little to practical experience.\n\nI suggested in my recommendation that you speak to Mr. Arneil about this case before passing on it, and I would appreciate if you would see him and do whatever you possibly can in view of the circumstances, his appointment as a Welfare teacher Grade 1, would simply give him about the same salary for 12 months work as he now receives for 10.\n\nF.

Neary,\n\nThank you for your letter concerning my application for Grade III Indian Welfare Teacher rating.\n\nI applied for this in the advice of Indian Agent Mr. T. Matters of Chapleau, & because I & my wife have been doing this type of work for the past three years since the start of this Reserve. It is a newly formed Reserve & was 200 miles from the nearest agency. Consequently I have been helping the matters to get things started up, besides the care of the sick & the welfare work in general.\n\nI have taken two Teacher Training Courses in connection with our Church work, also I have many years of Ontario Normal Training School work but I have never actually been to Normal School nor received any certificate for teaching. I also took some Educational Work in Teaching in my University work for my B.A. degree.\n\nFor further information I would refer you to Indian agent Mr. Matters of Chapleau who knew this & letter which you sent on to me.\n\nWith every good wish, Yours respectfully,\n\nJos. Blackburn\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES & RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nOttawa, Ont., August 26, 1947.\n\nTo: Reverend Jos.

Blackburn, has been appointed as a teacher, Indian welfare, Grade I. Effective 1 August, 1947, his salary will be $1,320.00 per calendar year, in accordance with the regulations of our Indian school teachers' salary schedule as approved by Treasury Board.\n\nFor Deputy Minister.\nThe Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa\n\nRe: Teacher grading Constance Lake day school.\n\nWithout making any further recommendation on the above I think it advisable to forward to you a copy of an excerpt from a letter I recently received from Mr. Blackburn, the teacher in question.\n\n\"I had written a letter to Ottawa about the grade of the teacher here, but before I had a chance to mail it I received a second one from Col. Neary saying that I had been classified as a Grade 1 Welfare teacher with a salary of $1,320.00 on a twelve months basis. As you know I was getting $127.00 per month for the school year of 10 months or $1,270.00 for the year. The extra granted means that I get the noble sum of $50.00 for July and August, or in other words a reduction from $127.00 per month to $110.00, the Irishmans rise. Evidently a University degree counts for nothing in the eyes of the Ottawa officials for I am put in the same grade as one who has only taken his Junior Matriculation. I am therefore too disgusted to bother mailing my letter so it remains on my desk unposted.\"\n\nSigned Jos. Blackburn.\n\nF. Matters\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 22, 1947.\n\nMr. F. Matters, Indian Agent,\nChapleau, Ontario.\n\nConstance Lake Indian Day School\n\nReference your letter of September 17\n\nThe policy of all Departments of Education in the various provinces of Canada is to insist upon a teacher holding a proper teacher's certificate before granting such a teacher the various salaries laid out in their salary schedules. Our Department is merely conforming to this general practice in insisting that our teachers hold proper certificates.\n\nWe have several other instances where teachers hold degrees and find themselves in the same position as the Reverend Mr. Blackburn. It is regretted that the Rev. Mr. Blackburn objects to his present classification and we wish to know if he would rather revert to his former classification of day school teacher than his present one of welfare teacher. However, we have no alternative other than to insist upon the holding of proper teaching certificates before granting salary increases.\n\nBernard N.

With your qualifications and experience, you would be entitled to a starting salary of $180.00 a teaching month, effective 1 September, 1948. I believe that we gave you some details concerning the school at Kettle Point last year. Mrs. Orr, who taught there last year, has resigned with the intention of taking a smaller one-room school. Mrs. Clemens, the junior teacher, intends to remain in our service. If you are interested in any further details concerning this school, I would ask you to write directly to Mr. M. W. McCracken, Superintendent, Indian Agency, Sarnia, Ontario (Post Office Building). In fact, I would suggest that when you are attending summer school in Toronto, you take the opportunity of running down to Sarnia one week-end. If you would advise Mr. McCracken in advance, it is possible that arrangements could be made for him to show you the school.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

John Jeffries and his sister Helen. Mr. Ritter, the Public School Inspector had been at that school last Friday.\n\nI think Mr. Jeffries is doing a fine piece of work, and apparently Mr. Ritter was greatly pleased with his work.\n\nJohn and Helen Jeffries and the Luke family gave me a\nmarvellous time. Had I been a favored member of the Royal Family, I could not have received finer treatment.\n\nJohn was telling me about the school at Brunswick House. It will be new, indoor plumbing, hardwood floors. It sounds grand.\n\nMiss Bartlett is the Nurse for the Indians and she is stationed at Chaplean. I met her at Sagana as I was waiting for the train. I had to ask her about Brunswick House.\n\nAs you know, John Jeffries is taking a teachers' training course this Summer and Mrs. Pitts wishes him to take it in Toronto. Incidentally, Mr. Pitts is one of the teachers for this course in Toronto this Summer. I suspect John will be living in my home at Sacred Hill while he's taking this course so we'll go in and out of Toronto on the bus.\n\nThis is getting to be a long letter, but Mr. Arnold suggested I write you.\nThe parent now is, where do you think I should be stationed? I had thought of driving to the little Point School. I like the North Country. To this school, Bemuscook House away from the railroad? It would be interesting to be where Miss Bartlett is the nurse. I know.\n\nIn your letter, you stated that the salary named be effective Sept. 1, 1948. Does school open Sept. the first? I had hoped it named be the seventh. I wanted so to the Tamark Exhibition.\n\nThank you very much for writing me so soon,\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

You will probably have met her during your treaty trip.\n\nI would not be very keen to have her at Constance Lake as I think it would be preferable to have a married couple on this Reserve but think she would fit in very nicely at Mount Batten school which I presume will be running around September. If I were you I would approach her on this matter and recommend to the Department that even if she was living at the Reserve a month or so before school opened it would be to her advantage as she would get to know the people and pupils.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Phelan so that he may understand my idea of what would be best to do.

She is keenly interested in getting into the Indian teaching service, especially at the new reserve to be started this year for the Brunswick House people at Tophet.\n\nIn your letter you mentioned the possibility of her going to Constance Lake. I would suggest that if at all possible a married couple be selected for this position as there is already more work on this reserve than one person can handle, and it is steadily increasing as new families move in. In my conversation with Miss Reesor and from reports concerning her from various people in the community where she lives I believe her to be a very efficient and capable woman and I would recommend that even if it was necessary for her to be on Mountbatten Reserve a month before the school is ready to open, she would be allowed to move in and get acquainted with people and children. According to our plans Mountbatten school should be ready before the end of September. I might say that the recommendation has the approval of Mr. Matters who is familiar with all the details of the case.\n\nI will communicate further with Miss Reesor after I have received your comments on this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

Neary,\nSuperintendent Welfare Dept.,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\n165 Sparks Street,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Col. Neary,\n\nI have just returned from a three months' visit to England and have to take up the administration of the Diocese.\n\nFirst of all I wish to thank you and the department for the very quick action with regard to the clearance of the students' cheques. I suppose it is partly because they had been better instructed than previously. There has been a little complication in the fact that Mr. Ellis and Mr. Higginson at Mistassini have received their cheques direct. Our treasurer did not understand this and he has had correspondence with them on the subject. I am sure that he can explain that we have had to advance them travelling expenses on account, but for next year it might be possible to have all the students paid through the Indian agents, as some of them have been this summer.\n\nThere is one matter which I may have overlooked. The Rev. Joseph Blackburn who has been in charge of the school at Calstock, told me last year that he was afraid that his age would make it impossible for him to remain at the school where he and his wife have done excellent work. I therefore offered him a mission at Foleyet but I was not certain that he would accept it. I believe he has done so and there is a vacancy at Calstock. Perhaps I should have consulted you earlier but I would like to know if you wish me to nominate a man for Calstock? I imagine you would not want him to be an ordained clergyman but someone who could develop along your pattern into a trained teacher and welfare worker. If you wish me to do so I think I can find you a man shortly.\n\nI shall be glad if you would wire me on this subject at once as I am going to Toronto next Wednesday.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRJR/G.\n\nIndian Affairs.

As Bertha Willis I taught in the Sucker Creek school for four years and at the French River Indian school for three years.\n\nI have a permanent second class certificate and eleven years teaching experience. You may consult Chief Abotoway for references of my former services there or the Public School Inspector. Some of the people have desired me to return and I, therefore, have written this application.\n\nHowever, I wish to state that my husband and two children will be with me. The children are four and a half years, one and a half respectively. I would obtain someone to stay with them during school hours but, of course, I wish to feel free to supervise them occasionally. I wish to feel free to supervise them occasionally when necessary. They never have been allowed to destroy property and I can assure you the building would be kept as it now is.\nI would like to return to Canada for a year or more, and this seemed like the opportunity to do it.\n\nI can assure you I will endeavour to perform my duties satisfactorily if my application is accepted. I would greatly appreciate a reply at the earliest convenience, as we would have several matters to settle up before leaving here.\n\nI understand the teacher's quarters are furnished. How many rooms are there? Is the building wired? If the hydro passes there and it has not yet been wired, would it be allowed by the Indian Department? My husband could do the work and I would like to bring some of my appliances if I were to come.\n\nIs the food supplied also? What salary would I receive? From the schedule, I didn't know if it varied with the amount of experience or how it is arranged. How many pupils are enrolled there?\n\nThis seems quite lengthy, but I wished to make clear my position and to gain some further information.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nBertha H. Anderson.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe. file #65-7-1(E) Aug. 24/8\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSince receiving a copy of the above noted letter, I have received no further word concerning a new Teacher for the Constance Lake Reserve. As it is now past the time for opening the School, I would be very pleased to hear what you have been able to do in this regard.\n\nAs I am alone in the Agency Office at the present time, I find it impossible to make any inspection trips to Constance Lake, and I am afraid that conditions on this Reserve will deteriorate very quickly with no one there to supervise and do some welfare work.\n\nJ.

This young man is Mr. H.L. Church, presently teaching at Renfrew, Ontario. In the near future he is marrying a young lady who is a Registered Nurse. Both of them are anxious to try a period of service with the Indians. I have sent him pictures of the Constance Lake School, and I think that he and his wife-to-be will accept. Mr. Church is 22 years of age, has a First Class Teaching Certificate with three years of experience. He is of the United Church belief, and I could ascertain, if you wish, as to the religious conviction of his wife.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Church and his wife, who is a registered nurse for the Constance Lake Indian Day School.\n\nIt may be that this suggestion can be carried out, although Mr. W.H. Thompson seems to be doing a very good job and is taking much interest in the Indians.\n\nI have had it in my mind for some time to suggest to you, that we ought to have a Teacher at Mistassini for a longer period than two or three months. Evans and Higginson did a good job there last summer. Unfortunately, owing to my absence in Lambeth, I was unable to visit the Mission last Summer but it is very much on my mind. As you know, there are about six hundred Indians connected with the Post. The School and the Teachers' Residence should be completed by now.\n\nHow would you like to consider the possibility of putting in somebody like Mr. Church and his wife?\n\nThe time will soon come when modern development will make it necessary to have someone there most of the year, if not, all the time.\n\nIt would be a great challenge for a young man, who is a teacher and a nurse as his wife. It would give them a respectable living.\n\nIf you think well of the idea, would you be kind enough to ask Mr. Church to write to me here.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd) Robert J. Renison.\nDecember 31, 1948.\n\nDear Bishop Renison:\n\nConstance Lake Indian Day School.\n\nI was very pleased to receive your reply of December 16 concerning Mr. and Mrs. Church.\n\nYour plan would be ideal but for the fact that Mr. Church is an Ontario teacher and he is anxious to continue teaching in that province. I had some difficulty in persuading Mr. Church to consider one of our schools. He has an Ontario Provincial Teaching Certificate and is anxious to keep his Superannuation fund in good condition. He can get credit for teaching experience in Ontario Indian Day Schools but not in any other province. He can only get credit for Ontario when he has an annual inspection from a Provincial School Inspector.\n\nHowever, I will keep on the look-out for someone like him for Mistassini but there is still a great shortage of male teachers.\n\nThe other school for which I had him in mind was the one to be erected next year at Mountbatten near Topast. He preferred Constance Lake because he could live in a separate teacherge there.\n\nIn closing may I extend to you on behalf of the Education Division our sincerest wishes for a happy and prosperous New Year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

As these have never been received here, no action has been taken to make payment to you for teaching duties at this school. I am again writing to Mr. Whitney today and have asked him to write directly to you in Toronto concerning this matter.\n\nWith regard to the questions raised in the second paragraph of your letter, we are now endeavouring to secure only the services of certificated teachers for our Indian Day Schools. Due to the shortage of teachers this is sometimes very difficult to do. Nevertheless, we are attempting to adhere to this policy. As a result, the number of qualified teachers in day schools has shown an increase of twenty-five percent in the last year.\n\nOur requirements are that a teacher hold a certificate granted by the Provincial Department of Education. I would suggest that you make further inquiries with regard to Normal School training at the Toronto Normal School. The High School course at the Ontario College of Education presumably qualifies for high school teaching.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr Neary,\n\nRecently I was thinking about the coming summer. Summer school naturally came into my head as I am desirous of having a better classification and rating.\n\nWould it be possible for the department to offer me any financial assistance toward this (such as a bursary etc). The reason for my enquiry in this regard is that unexpected bills have put my financial state in a rocky position for some little time to come.\n\nIf the above is not possible what opportunities are there available for say taking a correspondence course to cover the work?\n\nAnother item is that if I cannot afford summer school, would it be possible for the department to recognize the welfare work that of necessity one must carry on if on the reserve during the summer months with some sort of remuneration.\n\nFurther to the welfare work, since owing to the isolation of this reserve, I am now fulfilling almost all the duties required for the classification of Welfare Teacher (as per Indian School Bulletin June 1948) would it be possible for a change to be made in the near future from straight teacher to welfare teacher with the corresponding adjustment in wages.\n\nMr J. L. Whitney the Indian Superintendent for this agency in Chapleau can supply you with any further information desired regarding the welfare activities (and there possible expansion) here at Constance Lake.\n\nThank you for the time I have taken and with every best wish,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nWilliam H. Thompson\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6114, file 374-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMarch 4, 1949.\n\nMr. W. H. Thompson,\nConstance Lake Indian Day School,\nCalstock, via Hearst, Ontario.\n\nConstance Lake Indian Day School.\n\nDear Mr. Thompson:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of February 11th.\n\nThe funds with which we are provided for tuition grants are for Indians only. It would not, therefore, be possible to offer you financial assistance towards attending a Summer School, as requested.\n\nWith reference to your classification as a Welfare Teacher, it is usual to grant such classification only to teachers who have special qualifications in the social sciences. Exceptions are made where a man and wife are both living on the reserve. In this way we acknowledge the fact that the wife often is able to do a great deal of nursing and welfare activities.\n\nWe have been corresponding with a qualified teacher who has made application for the Constance Lake Indian Day School next September. He has a first class teaching certificate with 3 years of experience and his wife is a nurse.\n\nI gather from your letter that you are now interested in continuing to teach in our Indian schools. You will recall that when I inspected your school at Spanish River last year, you were inclined to feel that you would not remain in teaching. For this reason we presumed that\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6114, file 374-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nyou were only teaching at the Constance Lake School due to the lack of qualified teachers at the present time.\n\nWould you be interested in another school for the academic year 1949-50? I have an isolated school in mind in which we might be able to obtain for you the classification of welfare teacher. I would of course wish you to attend summer schools and attempt to get a teaching certificate if you intend to remain in our day school teaching service. We are constantly reducing the number of unqualified teachers and our policy is definitely to employ only qualified teachers when such are available.\n\nI would like to hear further from you as to your future plans.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMarch 5, 1949.\n\nReverend Eric de Pandleton,\n65 Prince Arthur,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your note of February 25 and realize that you are just as anxious as I to get your missing salary cheque sent. We have searched our files in vain for your Income Tax forms and I am therefore sending you a T.D.I form which I would like to have you complete and return to me. I will then arrange to have you paid for services at the Constance Lake Indian Day School.\n\nI am sorry to have to put you to this trouble but feel that it will be much faster than corresponding with other parties who may or may not have your Income Tax forms.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nRe: Constance Lake Day School.\n\nThe copy of your letter dated February 28th, to Bishop Renison was of interest to me as I had had a verbal report just a few days ago from Mr. Whitney, that he was not very well satisfied with the work Mr. Taylor was doing at Constance Lake.\n\nIt will be very difficult to get a couple who will compare with Rev. and Mrs. Blackburn, but it does require a married teacher who's wife would take an interest in welfare work among the Indian women, and I trust that the projected change can be made.\n\nYours very truly\n\nF.

Matters,\nSupervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nRe: Agent's report on Constance Lake School.\n\nThe academic progress of the children attending this school seems fairly good.\n\nWhile at the school I examined work books, and listened to reading of all grades. I found their writing quite good, and mathematics and reading good, this latter in spite of the fact that these children are exceptionally shy.\n\nClassroom deportment was quite good and the pupils carried out the teachers instructions readily and cheerfully.\n\nThe school building was not clean and it was quite cold. The teacher does not put himself out to do janitor work, which, he feels he \"does not get paid for\". As a result of this the chores are allotted to the older boys and girls and are carried out with little or no supervision. For instance, the fire is allowed to go out at night so that the school is cold until noon hour the next day and the children have to work with their hats and coats on.\n\nIn spite of the fact that I had Mr. Larsen build storm porches on both entrances to the school, the doors are continually left open at night, causing\ndamage to the doors and floors of the school room.\n\nThe teacher is not punctual in attending classes, often sleeping until nine a.m., and as a result the children have no incentive to be punctual themselves.\n\nThe conditions of the toilets are deplorable and, in spite of repeated directions from myself and Miss Jane Bartlett, our nurse, they show no improvement from my last visit in December.\n\nAs you can see from above, the attitude of the teacher toward the property over which he is supposed to have supervision is very careless.\n\nJ.

It is now nearly five months since I left the Reserve. Since I saw you last I have written three times to the Department. On February 23, Col. Seary said that he was taking the matter up with the Indian Agent at Chapleau and that he was to write to me; but up to date nothing has been done.\n\nMy expenses have been running close to $120.00 a week, or nearly $500.00 a month.\nDoctor @ $5.00 per diem .................. $35.00\nNurse @ $6.00 \" \" ...................... $56.00\nGirl @ $2.00 \" \" ......................... $12.00\nMy own expenses ......................... $14.00\n\nBoard for the Nurse & Girl\nPenicillin @ $4.00 an injection,\nDrugs, medicines over and above.\nHowever, I am glad to say that my wife is now recovering, slowly, and surely. She is able to be up each day for a few hours. I don't want to worry Ottawa unduly, but at the same time I think I have adequate reasons for requesting their cheque at the earliest possible moment.\n\nAs far as I know the Historiography examination will be held sometime the first week in May.\n\nBelieve me,\nWith all good wishes,\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This I have done, and they advise me that I can be given a first class deferred interim certificate on the successful completion of Summer Course.\n\nI am therefore sending you the enclosed certificate to be signed by your Department, since this hardly comes under the purview of the Provincial authorities of the Ontario Public Schools.\nI would like to take over the Constance Lake School if there is a vacancy there.\n\nJust what difference in salary does a deferred first class interim certificate make? I mean approximately.\n\nI know a young man who would be interested in teaching Indian children. He has a great deal of practical experience, but I don't think he has much schooling beyond Grade X.

At that time we did not have a suitable vacancy but I believe we may have one at Christmas which might be of interest to you.\n\nThis is a rather isolated reserve and we would prefer a married man with his wife. However, I note that you state in your application form that you have two dependents. Would they be going with you to the school or would you be on your own?\n\nThis school is in Ontario and is in the Chapleau district.\n\nUnfortunately your starting salary would be low, due to the fact you do not hold a teaching certificate. However, I believe that we can make representations for you to attend two summer sessions in Toronto and this would work for your teaching certificate.\n\nIf you are interested in further details please do not hesitate to write me at once.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education.\n\ncc Mr. Whitney\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6114, file 374-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDecember 7, 1949.\n\nMr. J.L.

Marsh whose address is Ladywood, Manitoba. Mr. Marsh formerly taught on the Fisher River Reserve in Northern Manitoba and left Departmental service to teach in a provincial school. Apparently, the living accommodation has been very unsatisfactory, and Mr. Marsh is willing to teach in either Manitoba or Ontario.\n\nTherefore, I would appreciate your writing to him with details of the Constance Lake setup as I believe he would be interested in this school. He is a qualified and experienced teacher and also has a Manual Training Specialist Certificate. He is married and has a small family.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nBFN/AM\nDecember 7, 1949.\n\nMr. G.L. Marsh,\nLadywood, Manitoba.\n\nDear Mr. Marsh:\n\nI have answered your letter of December 3 and am pleased that you wish to return to our teaching service. I have just written today to Mr. J.H. Whitney, our Indian Superintendent at Chapleau, Ontario. He has a teacher at the Constance Lake Indian Day School who may be leaving at Christmas. I have asked Mr. Whitney to write directly to you with any details of the school which he thinks might be of interest to you.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Matters\nIndian Agent.\nChapleau Ontario\nSeptember 18th, 1944\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Constance Lake School.\n\nI have just returned from an inspection and paying trip to the above school building. I found that fairly good progress had been made; the walls are now sheeted, the rafters on for the roof and the sub floor in.\n\nThe carpenters had ran short of material for sheeting the roof, and were going to do another small job for a matter of three days whilst more material was got to the site. I was assured that this would be delivered two days after I left, so expect that further progress is being made.\n\nA start was made with a cottage for the teacher, the cedar posts being in ready for the beams. It will be necessary to complete this, as although the Arrow Land and Logging Co. will provide him with temporary accommodation, they will not be able to do so for all the winter.\n\nI have asked the contractor to let me have a list of the material required for a four roomed bungalow, 24 ft by 24, will it be necessary for me to forward a requisition to get this material, or can an appropriation be made to cover the cost on the same prices and basis as we are paying for the school material, it will be of similar construction.\n\nNow that the roof is being put on all the other material is being shipped, so that we should not have any further delays.\n\nWe will need some means of heating the school, and I would recommend that two wood burning\n\nOver.\nheaters be used for this purpose, I will look up the types best suited and will forward a requisition to cover.\n\nI understand that Mr. Blackburn is bringing all his own furniture except for the kitchen stove and heater; I presume that these will be supplied by the department as was done at Mattagami, and will also requisition these in a day or so.\n\nMr. Blackburn has sent me a further list of supplies needed for the classroom and I am attaching requisition to cover them; he asked for some Manual training outfits, but I think these may be left until the project is under way.\n\nI fully expect that the school will be all finished by the middle of October and if we get the supplies in the classes can start immediately.\n\nF.

School desks are now made in three sizes -- large, medium and small.\n\nYou should also let me know the length and width of the blackboard needed and this will be secured through the Government Stationery Office.\n\nPlease forward a requisition for the material required for the bungalow for the teacher.

Matters, Indian Agent, Chapleau, Ont.\n\nRe: Purchase Order 26896\n\nA copy of the above purchase order was sent to you on October 2 and covered two wood burning heaters for the Constance Lake School. Subsequently it was found that these heaters could not be secured and our Purchasing Branch has located a circulator heater. This is much larger than the other heaters and it is felt may be big enough for the school. However, if you consider a second one is required you should let me know. Purchase order No. 26896 should be considered cancelled and I enclose copy of purchase order No. 27069.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nChapleau Ontario\nOctober 31st. 1944\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRe; Constance Lake School;\n\nI visited this building last on Oct. 26th., and found work progressing steadily, it had been slowed up due to some of the material being late in arriving, but good progress is being made.\n\nRoughly the work to be done yet consists of applying the Asbestos shingles on the outside of both the school and the cottage, also the hardwood floors are to be laid in both places, painting and the building of outside toilets will just about finish the job.\n\nBoth buildings are solidly constructed according to the plans, and Mr. Larsen is doing a very thorough job, and when finished we will have a solid building which will be quite warm.\n\nIn connection with the heating, although the circulator type of heater is better in theory, the practical experience is that the upper part of the rooms are warm, but the floors and lower part cold, for instance the Arrow Land Co. have installed a circulator type heater in their office, it is an oil burner and of a large size, yet when I was there last week the men were complaining of the cold office, when they come in wet they cannot get near the heat, having had some experience with these in the past was the reason I requested the regular wood heater.\n\nI have instructed Mr. Blackburn to install the circulator heater on arrival, but I think it will be necessary to locate another regular camp heater, will you have the Purchasing Branch try the Adam Hall Co., who specialize in this type of material.\n\nOver.\nAt the present time I have about $250.00 left of the sum allocated for the building of the school, to cover the rest of the building and the painting I estimate that another $400.00 will be needed, can you arrange to have this forwarded to me, before November 8th, which will be the next pay day.\n\nI took the liberty of ordering the necessary stove pipes for the school and cottage heaters and stoves, so that they could be installed on arrival, the stove and heater for the cottage arrived the day I was at Calstock, these pipes are to be 28 gauge galvanized iron; the ordinary stove pipes being too flimsy to be safe.\n\nOn the return from my next visit I expect to be able to report that one building is finished and the other almost so.\n\nF.

Matters, Indian Agent, Chapleau, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to the account of the George Taylor Hardware Company. This account has not been paid. At the time it was submitted we thought that we might be able to pay it from the 1943-44 appropriation but, as the goods had not been delivered to the site, the Treasury Branch took exception to our paying the account at that time and insisted that payment could not be made until we could assure them that the items shown on the account had been delivered to the site of the new school. In addition we were under the impression that possibly some of the items on the original account might be shipped later, which might make a very slight variation in the price.\n\nOn receipt of the correspondence I discussed the matter again with the Treasury officials and I am returning the account to you and suggest that, if all the items on this account have been delivered to the school site, you prepare a new voucher and attach the account to it and as soon as it is returned to us arrangements will be made to issue a cheque in payment immediately. Any material that has not been delivered to the site of the school should be struck off the account.\n\nR.A.

Matters\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nNovember 23, 1944.\n\nEX'D.\n\nMr. F. Matters, Indian Agent, Chapleau, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, enclosing photographs of the school and teacher's residence at Constance Lake. The Department was very pleased to receive these and the buildings appear to be very serviceable.\n\nIn looking at the pictures it would appear that to limit the fire hazard it would be desirable to cut down a number of additional trees, in order to leave as open a space as possible around the new buildings. Possibly you could arrange to have this done during the present winter.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nChapleau Ontario\nDecember 7th, 1944\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRe; Constance Lake School;\n\nI visited the above school on December 5th., and found that work has been suspended for the winter, the inside of the school is finished, and the first classes were called for December 6th.\n\nThis last week the children have been in attendance but helping to unpack and prepare the school for teaching.\n\nThe outside is not quite finished, as the Asbestos shingles had not all arrived, and about 11 squares are yet to be applied, this will not affect the heating of the building for this winter, and classes will be able to carry on.\n\nWhilst waiting for these to arrive, and I was definitely advised by the George Taylor Hardware Co. that they had been shipped on November 8th, the carpenters had built the outside toilets (3), and finished off anything else that was to be done with the exception of cupboards.\n\nI find that I will need $38.18 to complete the payment of the carpenters, and unemployment insurance stamps, this will balance the account as to the advances made and the amounts paid out.\n\nI would also recommend that 3 cupboards be procured, or at least 2 cupboards and 1 set of open shelves, the latter and one cupboard for the school supplies, and the other for the storing of medical supplies.\n\nMr. Larsen, who has been the carpenter at the school, offered to build these at a price of $115.00 for material and labour, they will 6 feet high, one six feet wide.\nwide and the others 5 feet 6 inches and four feet six inches wide respectively.\n\nIf this is in order, and some are certainly needed, will you kindly authorise me to have them made.\n\nF.

We feel that a less expensive blind should fill the purposes at this point and, consequently, we will supply six cream coloured blinds. It is impossible to secure these in 32\" width and therefore we will supply 36\" width.

MATTERS\nINDIAN AGENT\nCHIPPEWA ONT\nChapleau Ontario\nJanuary 24th, 1945\n\nThe George Taylor Hardware Co.\nNew Liskeard Ont.\n\nGentlemen;-\n\nWith regard to your invoice of material supplied for Constance Lake School, there are one or two items on which I would like further information before being able to pass it for payment.\n\nWith regard to Cedar Grain Shingles, I see that we are invoiced on #1378 H for 30 squares at $10.25 per square, then on 2226 H for two lots of 11 squares each at $14.50 per square; this appears to be rather a drastic difference in price, also I rather think that only 11 sqs. were required, if the two lots have been shipped I expect it is due to duplication as we had to wait quite a while for these and many enquiries were made regarding them.\n\nWith regard to Caulking guns, we were charged on invoices #2221 H and 2225 H at $7.05 each, then one credit on 2227 H for the same figure, it is possible that one gun has been left on the job for the completion of the application of the cedar grain shingles, but I would like to have it verified, as when the invoice is checked in Ottawa they will need an explanation.\n\nAs mentioned on our purchase order #23309, it is necessary for receipted vouchers to be included with the invoice to cover freight or other transportation, this would apply to the following items;-\n\n| Invoice # | Description | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| 1372 H    |             | 203.50   |            |       |\n| Do.       |             | .80      |            |       |\n| Do.       |             | 16.50    |            |       |\n| Do.       |             | 53.83    |            |       |\n| Do.       |             | 1.57     |            |       |\n| Do.       |             | 35.01    |            |       |\n| Do.       |             | 16.50    |            |       |\n| Do.       |             | 5.99     |            |       |\n\nInvoice #2221 H 1.90\nDo. 2221 H 2.15\nDo. 2221 H 2.96\nDo. 2222 H 1.67\nDo. 2225 H 1.36\nDo. 2226 H 30.00\nDo. 2226 H 28.14\n\nI do not wish to have the above remarks considered as being critical of the preparation of the account.\nbut it is better to have everything in order before presenting it to the Treasury auditors, rather than have them writing back pointing out differences.\n\nAlthough we could not get everything that we wanted just when we wanted it, I must say that your men at Hearst did everything they possibly could to help out in securing the material needed.\n\nAs soon as I can get the items mentioned cleared up I will forward the account for payment.\n\nYours very truly\n\nF. Matters\nIndian Agent.\nChapleau, Ontario.\nThe George Taylor Hardware Ltd. February 20, 1945.\nNew Liskeard Ont.\n\nAs our fiscal year ends on March 31st., we would request your co-operation in having all accounts up to that date rendered as soon as possible.\n\nIf the accounts are not rendered promptly it is impossible for the Department to pay them out of this year's appropriation, and payment cannot be guaranteed if the money has to come out of 1945-46 funds.\n\nThanking you for your assistance in this matter.\n\nYours very truly\n\nF. Matters\nIndian Agent.\nChapleau Ontario\nMarch 12th, 1945\n\nMr. D. H. Miller\nThe George Taylor Hardware Ltd.\nNew Liskeard Ont.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nIn reply to your letter of March 7th., regarding the accounts outstanding.\n\nThe reason for sending you the notice was that I had not received any reply to my letter to you of January 24th., regarding the accounts invoiced and dated January 19th.\n\nI had also returned to your nearest office a small account dated January 10th., #2244 R., this for the purpose of getting the prepaid express slip, I have not had any reply to either.\n\nI will attach a copy of my letter to you of January 24th., and would appreciate if you could give it immediate attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. Matters\nIndian Agent.\nTHE GEORGE TAYLOR HARDWARE LIMITED\n\nIN REPLY PLEASE REFER TO\n\nJ.L. Fulton.\n\nTIMMINS, Ontario.\nMarch 22, 1945.\n\nMr. F. Matters,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAttached you will find all the receipts for transportation that we are able to secure.\n\nOn many occasions other goods than for your account would be shipped to Hearst in the same Express or Freight shipment, and only your portion of express or freight would be charged to you. Therefore the express or freight receipts would not be of use to you as they would not correspond with the amount charged you.\n\nIn regards to transportation by truck from Hearst to Calstock the same also applies, as we hire our delivering done by the month, and charge you only for the actual time it takes to deliver materials.\n\nI am sorry we are unable to give you exactly what you require, but due to Mr. Smiley leaving and a new party taking over, it took some time for Mr. Philbin to become familiar with the details. I believe you will have no trouble with any future invoices. We would appreciate it if you would rush our invoices through for payment as soon as possible.\n\nWe are enclosing Credit Note for one only Caulking Gun, $7.05, as it has since been returned and charged to the Contractor, who is keeping it.\n\nIn regards to difference in price of Cedar Grain Shingles, the ones priced at $14.50 had to be secured from a company in Southern Ontario, and we had to pay them resale price plus L.C.L. Freight. The shingles secured in that way were the only shingles available in Ontario to complete\nyour job. The manufacturer was sold out. One of the 11 square lots is still on hand at our Hearst Warehouse, being held there as your contractor was unable to complete the job before the freeze-up. As they were brought in especially for this job, we felt it only right that we should invoice you and hold them in stock, to be taken by you in the spring.\n\nWe thank you for the reference you make in the second last paragraph of your letter, and appreciate that you realize there were many obstacles which prevented us giving you the service we would have liked, but war makes many things impossible. We consider ourselves fortunate to be able to carry on business as well as we are doing after five years of war.\n\nI am looking forward to meeting you some time soon, and wish to thank you for the consideration given to us.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE GEORGE TAYLOR HARDWARE LTD.\n\nPer:\n\nJLF/RO\n\nEncls.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**RECEIPT FORM**\n\nOrder No. 27133\n\nThis receipt is issued in duplicate on all packages and invoices.\n\nFile No. 60175-19-3\n\nOttawa, October 10, 1944\n\n---\n\n**Supplies mentioned hereunder have been received and found satisfactory with exception of those listed under \"Remarks\"**\n\n---\n\n| QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION | UNIT | TOTAL |\n|----------|-------------|------|-------|\n|          | The following building material for teachers' residence, Constance Lake, Indian Day School - |      |       |\n| 36 pcs. | Lumber 3 x 6 x 10' rough | $43.00 | $1,548.00 |\n| 300 lin. ft. | 1 x 10' pine | $14.00 | $4,200.00 |\n| 150 pcs. | Spruce lumber 3 x 4 x 10' | $1.00 | $150.00 |\n| 50 pcs. | Rough 3 x 4 x 10' | $1.00 | $50.00 |\n| 500 sq. ft. | Sheathing | $6.00 | $3,000.00 |\n| 10 sqs. | Johns Manville Asbestos Roofing Shingles | $11.00 | $110.00 |\n| 2 rolls | Shed roofing for porch | $4.00 | $8.00 |\n| 71 pcs. | Cypress 4 x 6 x 3/8\" | $60.00 | $4,260.00 |\n| 1500 sq. ft. | Insulation batts | $3.00 | $4,500.00 |\n| 500 only | Spikes for chimney | $6.00 | $3,000.00 |\n| 13 ft. | Pipe lining | $1.00 | $13.00 |\n| 250 ft. | Baseboard 1\" x 6\" dressed 48 | $2.00 | $500.00 |\n| 750 lin. ft. | Quarter round | $0.00 | $0.00 |\n| 400 ft. | Window and door casing 1\" x 6\" linal | $0.00 | $0.00 |\n| 100 ft. | Inside door casing 1\" x 6\" linal | $0.00 | $0.00 |\n| 10 rolls | Asphalt sheathing | $3.00 | $30.00 |\n| 11 sqs. | Johns Manville Asbestos Siding Shingles | $14.00 | $154.00 |\n| 3 bags | Nails 2 1/2\" | $4.00 | $12.00 |\n\nTotal: $10,478.00\n\n---\n\n**Prices F.O.B. as per your quotation to Indian Agent**\n\n---\n\n**Shipping Instructions**\n\nFrederic Matton, Sec., Indian Agent, Calstock, Ont.\n\n---\n\n**Vote**\n\nPrimary\n\nDate to be delivered:\n\nImmediately\n\n---\n\n**Encumbrance No.**\n\n---\n\n**Freight or Express charges paid**\n\n---\n\n**Remarks:** (Report shortages, if any)\n\n---\n\n**TO HEAD OF BRANCH**\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.

The total of these two purchase orders was $3,374.71, plus transportation of the goods ordered.\n\nWe are now in receipt of the attached account, certified by Indian Agent Matters, and this amounts to $4,928.61, which includes the transportation costs. Mr. Matters points out that owing to conditions existing at the present time it was necessary to make several changes in the type and quantities of the materials purchased. As a consequence, the items shown on the account do not exactly coincide with the items shown on the purchase orders.\n\nWhen the buildings were nearing completion, it was found that extra work had to be done, and, as labour was available at that time, the Agent secured the materials necessary. As a result, the amount expended for material has exceeded the total of the two purchase orders already issued.\n\nReports received show that we have two good buildings, namely a school and teacher's residence, at this point, and Indian Agent Matters, who has had considerable experience in building, has certified that\n\np.t.o.\nMemorandum\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nRe requisition March 2nd instant for Constance Lake Indian Day School.\n\nOrders for the goods covered by the above requisition have been placed, with the exception of:\n\n10 Coping Saws\n100 Coping Saw blades size 10\n100 Coping Saw Blades size 15\n\nWe can obtain the blades but not the coping saws, which are in very short supply at present.\n\nKindly advise if we may cancel these three items from the requisition, or if you wish us to try to obtain same later on.\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nWMV/HC\nOttawa, April 12, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT,\n\nI have your memorandum of April 10 (File 57316-15-38) with reference to our requisition of March 2 for the Constance Lake School.

The total of these two purchase orders was $3,374.71, plus transportation of the goods ordered.\n\nWe are now in receipt of the attached account, certified by Indian Agent Matters, and this amounts to $4,932.61, which includes the transportation costs. Mr. Matters points out that owing to conditions existing at the present time it was necessary to make several changes in the type and quantities of the materials purchased. As a consequence, the items shown on the account do not exactly coincide with the items shown on the purchase orders.\n\nWhen the buildings were nearing completion, it was found that extra work had to be done, and, as labour was available at that time, the Agent secured the materials necessary. As a result, the amount expended for material has exceeded the total of the two purchase orders already issued.\n\nReports received show that we have two good buildings, namely a school and teacher's residence, at this point, and Indian Agent Matters, who has had considerable experience in building, has certified that\n\nP.t.o.\nall the materials secured were absolutely essential and purchase of them could not be avoided if the buildings were to be properly completed.\n\nUnder the circumstances, it would be appreciated if you would issue an additional purchase order for $1,162.42. I would appreciate also receiving from you a memorandum which we can present to the Representative of the Treasury, permitting payment of the account, even though the items on the accounts are not exactly similar to those appearing on the purchase order.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMEMORANDUM\nOFFICE OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL\n\nApril 20, 1945\n\nMr. McButcheon,\n\nRe Constance Lake School\n\nWithout going into detail I note two accounts namely:\n\nAdvance for day labour Aug 11/44 - $2.00\nFor Taylor Hardware April 18/45 $6.932.61\n\nSec. 36 of the Public Works Act Chap. 166 R.S. 1927 is quite clear that in the above instance an Order in Council should be obtained.\n\nH.

Matters, Indian Agent,\nCHAPLEAU, Ontario.\n\nIn reporting on his inspection of the Constance Lake School on Nov. 6th, Inspector Blanchard writes as follows:\n\n\"The building which is being used as a school seems to be quite adequate. Natural lighting is definitely poor, but this cannot be helped. It is hoped that the new school will be built just as soon as possible.\"\n\nWe realize that the building used for school purposes will at some later date be used for a community hall. However, we thought that the present building was quite adequate. Apparently the Inspector considers the lighting insufficient. We would appreciate having your comments on the Inspector's remarks.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRe: File 65-7-5 (WT-1), Letter Dec. 10/46.\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of the above letter regarding the Constance Lake Day School.\n\nI would say that the building itself is quite adequate. The natural lighting, although not very good according to the present school lighting standards, is still sufficient and ought to be considered as such for some years yet, as it is not projected to build a new school until the Reserve has been much further developed.\n\nDuring the winter time and with snow on the ground the building is quite bright inside, and the inspector did arrive there this year before the snow. The building is recognized as being one of the best in the district as compared with other white schools. I do not think that the Inspector really expects us to proceed with the building of a new school for some time, but is more or less pointing out that some day it will be necessary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. Matters,\nIndian Agent.\nChapleau, Ont.,\nFeb. 11th/47.\n\nCol. B. F. Neary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Col. Neary:\n\nDuring our conversation in Toronto, you requested that I try to procure a picture giving a better view of the Constance Lake Day School. I am enclosing some that I have just secured which I think will give you a better idea of the building, also of the inside showing some of the pupils.\n\nYou also suggested that you would like to get a plan of a one room school with accommodation for the teacher under the one roof. I asked Mr. Larson for some suggestions along this line, as he drew the plans for all the Constance Lake Buildings. I am enclosing three rough plans and if you would like further construction details on any one of them, please return and I will get a more detailed plan for you.\n\nI have received the Special Permit from the Provincial Department for the taking of fur-bearing animals by the children of the Chapleau Residential School under the direction of the Principal, so I expect to have the scheme operating for the muskrat season this year.\n\nI am writing this to you personally so that you will be sure of getting the pictures and if there is anything further with which I could help you, please let me know.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF.

They arrived just as Mr. Indian Agent Lariviere was in the office and discussing plans for the construction of a one-room log school in his agency, so we were able to put your plans to good use immediately.\n\nWe are trying to obtain a few books for use in the trapping course in our Residential Schools. We will send these to you as soon as we hear from the publishers.\n\nI am very pleased to hear about the permit you have received for the taking of fur bearing animals by the children of the Chapleau School.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

He requested me to write to you to ascertain if the department would consider buying his furniture to leave in the teacher's cottage. I believe this would be a very sound idea as it is hardly probable that the new teacher will have furniture of his own.\n\nI have seen this furniture often and assure you that it is all in good repair and well kept. I am enclosing a list of the items marked with their cost when new and the amount which Mr. Blackburn is asking for each piece.\n\nI would recommend that this furniture by purchased and left at the cottage.\n\nI would appreciate your comment on this matter at your earliest convenience.\n\nJ. L. Whitney\nClerk in Charge\nChapleau Indian Agency\nJuly 23, 1948.\n\nMr. J.L. Whitney, Clerk in Charge,\nIndian Agency, Chapleau, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 19th instant\nwith reference to purchasing from Rev. Joseph\nBlackburn the furniture in the teacher's cottage\nat the Constance Lake School.\n\nI enclose for your information the scale\nof issue for a teacher's residence. You will note\nthat we can secure new furniture much cheaper than\nthe prices asked by Mr. Blackburn for second-hand\nfurniture.\n\nUnder these circumstances we would prefer\nto supply new furniture for this residence.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa\n\nAttention: Mr. B. F. Neary\n\nRe: File 65-7-5(El), July 23, 1948\n\nConcerning the information contained in the above noted letter.\n\nSince the Blackburns will be leaving Constance Lake at the end of August it will be necessary that new furnishings for the teacher's cottage be available for the first of September.\n\nDo you wish me to send in a requisition for the scale of issue of furniture which you enclose or will the matter be looked after from Ottawa?\n\nJ.

Then you talked to me about this question of having a summer Indian school.\n\nI have considered this matter and at your request I think I can do something for it. But considering that these Indian children don't understand a word of English, I think it would be convenient to have last summer a teacher who could talk both languages in and English, in order to get a start to the little ones. I hope to be able to find this person.\n\nPlease then, let me know if this question will arise, and what wages of our department intend to give.\n\nI go up at the end of May, or beginning of June.\n\nIf I can do some more part-time opening of this Indian school I will do it with determination.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. Evans, Jr.\nMissionary\nOttawa, March 30, 1807.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nWith reference to Father Ewain's application for a summer school at Abitibi I beg to say that I think that such a school is the only one suitable for these Indians, as they disperse in the fall for their winter hunt.\n\nAccording to the census there should be over thirty children of school age, and if the Priest can secure a teacher and any place to hold the school, I would recommend that the Department should allow a grant of $150 for the summer's work. The school could be kept open for about five months.

A supply of blank forms for this purpose is being sent you.\n\nIf you will be good enough to fill in the blank form for school material, which is also being sent you, the Department will supply a reasonable amount. This includes the necessary books, etc., for the use of the pupils.\n\nThe selection of a teacher will be left with you, but you should advise the Department as soon as you have secured a suitable and competent person for the position.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D.

Simpson, lately Miss Ellen King, who talks both languages, English and Indian. Her husband will come up and help me to fit the local and book over the necessary things of the school. I will give an ashwood room, a part of the church and fit it in a suitable way and as cheap possible. I hope this plan to make over there the tables and press, to remove the black board for the store, because store is necessary, considering the cold days we have over there even in the summer, and other things.\n\nI think it would be easier to buy up the items of the articles, as I told the teacher to mention on the list.\nI expect to be able to take up with me the school material which your department will send here to me by the first navigation at the beginning of May.\n\nPlease kindly answer and tell me if my plan is right and will oblige.\n\nYours truly,\n\nS. Lovain\nmissionary\nNorth Temiskaming 12th of April 1867\n\nTo the Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa,\n\nSir,\n\nAt the invitation of R. P. Evans I address to you my application for the summer school which will be opened at Abitibi. The Department offers $150.00 for the teaching during the summer. Shall I, with this money, be obliged to bear all expenses of the trip and my board which will be necessarily pretty high to reach the mission and reside there for the three months during which the Indians sojourn there, that is to say from the beginning of June to the end of August or beginning of September.\n\nThe R. P. Evans tells me that he will arrange with your Department for the school and its furnishings, which I think will be needed for the summer. Some of the articles could be bought at the Hudson Bay.\npost, as it is so difficult to transport these articles to this far off mission. In any case, I have marked with a cross the objects which I could procure at Abitibi with your consent and your orders through Father Evans.\n\nyou will tell me what you judge to be preferable. Now does the Department take charge of the transport of these articles to the Abitibi post, or shall I myself be obliged to transport them from here? In any case, every thing should be well packed.\n\nAn answer would very much oblige your humble servant\u2014\n\nMrs. John R. Simpson\nOttawa, April 19, 1907.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th inst., with reference to a teacher and supplies for the proposed summer school at Abitibi, and in reply I beg to say that the Department will be pleased to avail itself of the services of Mrs. Simpson as teacher of this school, if it is opened, and she has been so advised.\n\nWith reference to the supplies for the school a requisition will be made on the Government Stationery Office for the necessary stationery, and, when the school is opened you may, if you find them needed, purchase the axe, brooms, chairs, cups, cupboard, pail and stove and pipes asked for in the requisition. The Department considers, however, that it may be possible to do without the stove during the months the school will be in operation. An account, in duplicate, for these articles should be forwarded to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. S.

I have all the other forms required for the salary and the Agent not being at home I cannot get it.\n\nAt the same time I have no reason to say that the salary is not high enough for the expenses to go to Obedee and to live there as to $75 or if not more I do not think it is possible to take the job another year for the same salary.\n\nAs to the School, I think I have done my duty while there and the success permitted me to say has been greater than I expected. Parents have been faithful to send their children while at the door and some of them stayed three months for that purpose only.\nHoping you will find my report satisfactory.\n\nBelieve me, dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.

Sept. 1905.\n\nTo the Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI visited the school of aboriginals this 3rd and 4th of September in company with Mr. F. R. Latimer of Haileybury. We got very pleased and surprised to see the progress of the children, as will tell you also the report Mr. Burwash who visited the school. The parents appreciate very much this favor of a school. But the Indians told me that they make no way, and expend all the money for passage and Board. Still I am myself that it costs very much to go and live there up.\n\nPovesh i will ask your favour to grant an other school but next summer at the H.B.C Post at Long Point, or Living Lake; they are over there about 30 Indians who wants go to school; If you grant me $100.00 dollars i promise to have...\na good school room\u2014fixed for this purpose.\n\nI wrote also to Mr. Hunter about the Hunter Point School; Indians and white people asked me to have the school opened the whole year.

So, the expenses to go up there and come back are very heavy.\n\nLast spring I thought it would be better to go via Matane by railway and steamboat. But owing to the irregularity of the steamboat from Matane to Abitibi it took one six days instead of three, so that the expenses were still greater. Going by clock's road the expenses are $25.00 going up, and the same for coming back, so that it gives a total of $50.00 for travelling only. The least I pay for board at Abitibi is $0.60 a day, so that for 30 days it amounts to $45.00. Then I have only $50.00 left for three months' work. I think it would be only fair for the Department to add at least...\n$50.00 to my salary amounting presently to $150.00 for three months' teaching.\n\nI know that teachers in the same district who receive the same salary than I, and who have not the least expenses to make to reach their school, beside having much less pupils than I have.\n\nThis year 67 children have attended school, and I think a salary of \u00a3200.00 for three months would not be too much for such a number of pupils, even if there were no other reasons for it.\n\nFour months' teaching, as the Department professed it last year, would be useless. The Indians being hardly able to remain three months at the pay. When it comes to the third month, most of them leave, and it would be too cold to begin before June or to stay longer than to the end of May.\n\nOnce more I beg the Department to consider this matter fairly.\n\nTrusting you will understand the justice of my appeal and grant my humble request.\n\nI remain Sir,\n\nYours truly,\nMrs. R. Gibbon\nOttawa, September 22, 1910.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant in which you ask for the sum of $50.00 additional for your work as teacher during the past summer at Abitibi.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in view of the cost of travelling the Department will make you an additional grant of $25.00 to help to cover these expenses, making your salary for the three months $175.00. A cheque for this amount will be sent you. This is all that the Department feels that it would be justified in paying for the three months tuition of Indian children, 65 schooldays in all.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nMrs. R.

Je l'ai constat\u00e9 durant les mois entiers de juin que j'ai pass\u00e9 comme missionnaire \u00e0 Abitibi.\n\nJ'ai v\u00e9cu de passer 10 jours au Chignecto, et j'ai constat\u00e9 la m\u00eame situation du Roi de Honon qui tient ferme sur Bear Island. C'est une mission magnifique en cinq mois, voit n\u00e9cessairement son ann\u00e9e apr\u00e8s.

I have ascertained this during the full month of June which I spent as missionary at Abitibi.\n\nI have just spent 10 days at Timagami, and I found the same earnestness with Miss El. Honam who keeps the school at Bear Island. This person teaches only five months, and has naturally her year spoiled. I recommend therefore the same salary of $100.00 per month for this teacher. In making these recommendations I am only answering to these devoted person's request, who begged me to intercede in their favor, I am doing this with greater pleasure knowing their merit.\n\nYours very humbly\n\nsgd. I. Evalin\nMissionary O.M.I.\nOttawa, July 20, 1920.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant requesting increases in salary for the teachers of the summer schools at Abitibi and Temagami.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, after full consideration of this matter, the Department has decided to allow both these teachers an increase in salary and they will be paid $75.00 per month each during the period the schools are open. Mr. Agent Cockburn will be informed of the increase being granted Miss Honan at Temagami and Mr. Agent McDonald of the increase granted to Mrs. Mohareen, teacher of the Abitibi Summer School. Any balance of salary due at the increased rate will be paid when the next payments of salary are being made these teachers.\n\nThe Department regrets that it cannot agree to the granting of an increase to the extent of your request, as the funds at its disposal are very limited.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

McLaren, who was recently appointed for the position of teacher of the Abitibi Day School, would prefer to teach the Long Point School this summer.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Long Point School last year was in charge of Miss Jane Polson, and Rev. I. Evain, Villa Marie, Que., reported that she was not conducting the school in a satisfactory manner and in his letter of August 27th, last, he suggests that Mrs A. Amesse be engaged as teacher for the present summer. No action, however, was taken on his suggestion of appointing Mrs. Amesse and, at the present time, the Department has no teacher in view for this school. There would, therefore, appear to be no objection to Mrs. McLaren taking charge of the Long Point School for the present summer, but, before authorizing her to do so, the Department would like you to get into touch with Father Evain. No doubt, you will be able to arrange matters with him and the Department will expect to hear from you as to what school Mrs. McLaren will be in charge of during the present summer.\n\nIf Mrs. McLaren takes charge of Long Point you should consult Father Evain with reference to securing a teacher for the Abitibi School and submit any nomination made by him for the Department's approval.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

I have recently learned that Miss M.A. McDonald, who has taught at Abitibi for 2 seasons, could be re-engaged for the coming summer.\n\nIn my opinion she is about the best teacher that ever left this district to teach school at Abitibi, as she is a young lady of about 30 years of age, of good education, and exceptionally well behaved.\n\nI will endeavor to get in touch with the Rev. Father Evain on this matter at once, and will notify the Dept. as soon as I hear from him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.\nAsst.

He is staying over here for a couple of days on his way to Abitibi, and came in to see me today. For Long Point school he recommends that the services of Mrs. Jas. D. McLaren be engaged, and for Abitibi he recommends Miss Alice McBride, who taught at this school during the summer of 1919.\n\nI may say that Mrs. McLaren leaves for Long Point on Tuesday next, the 31st inst., to open school on the 1st of June.

I will be pleased if you will inform Reverend Father Evain accordingly, and arrange with Miss McBride to take up duties at Abitibi as soon as possible.\n\nThe salaries allowed the teachers at both these schools will be at the rate of $75.00 per month, the same as was paid last year, together with the bonus provided to teachers in Indian Day Schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6114, file 375-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, October 6, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have yours of the 5th instant, concerning the Abitibi Indian Day School. I have noted that it would be impossible to use the church for school purposes any longer.\n\nAs this summer school has never been any real success, I am of the opinion that the Department would be well advised to discontinue the sessions. However, we are writing Mr. Agent Lewis to get his opinion before definite action is taken.\n\nI note further that if the summer school is opened at Abitibi again, it will be necessary to erect an inexpensive school and that you would be prepared to supervise this work at a probable cost of Six or Seven Hundred Dollars.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. I. Ewain, O.M.I.,\nVille Marie,\nP. Q.\nOttawa, October 6, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from the Rev. Father Evan, informing us that it will be no longer possible to hold the summer school for Indian children at Abitibi in the church. He intimates that it would be necessary, if we wish to continue the classes, to erect an inexpensive school building. He offers to supervise the construction in that event.\n\nI am of the opinion that we might discontinue our summer school at Abitibi for a year or two, as the work done has not warranted the expense involved. The Indians are too nomadic in their habits for real results. The Department would like your recommendation in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. H. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorth Temiskaming, P. Q.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to official letter No.35-2-1 of the 6th inst., I beg to report that I do not consider the attendance at the Abitibi Summer school would warrant the expenditure that would be incurred by the erection of a school building. My experience is that the Indians stay around the Post during the visit of the missionary in the month of June, and until the distribution of the Treaty nine annuity is made, and as soon as that is over they depart, with few exceptions, and camp along the rivers adjacent to the N.T.C.Rly. until the hunting season commences.\n\nI have found a large attendance at the school during my visits to the Abitibi Post this past two summers, in the month of June, but I know that after my departure, the attendance dwindled down to a very small number.\n\nIn connection with this matter I also beg to report that as none of these Abitibi Indian children are able to speak any English, it is absolutely essential that the teacher be able to talk Indian, and it is a difficult matter to obtain the services of a teacher able to speak the language, that possesses sufficient qualifications to be able to teach the children very much.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nIn connection with this matter I beg to say that I have been notified by the manager of the Hudson's Bay Company store, at Abitibi Post, that they intend to remove their business to LaSarre, on the T.C.Rly., some time this fall.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, October 14th, 1922.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nIn further reference to official letter of the 6th instant regarding the summer school at Abitibi, I beg to say we are informed by our Agent, Mr. W. H. Lewis, North Temiskaming, that he does not consider the attendance at this point would warrant the expenditure that would be incurred by the erection of a school building. He further states that he has been notified by the manager of the Hudson's Bay Company store at Abitibi Post that they intend to remove their business to LaSarre sometime this fall.\n\nAs there would not be a sufficient number of children remaining at Abitibi to warrant the continuing of a summer school, the Department is of the opinion that it would be useless to continue a school at this point. This work will, therefore, be discontinued for a year or two until such time as the Department is assured that there will be sufficient children to warrant the school being re-opened.\n\nWe are informing Mr. Agent Lewis accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. I. Evain, O.M.I.,\nVille Marie,\nP.Q.\nOTTAWA, October 14th, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 10th instant, referring to the Abitibi Summer School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say, in view of your report that you do not consider the attendance would warrant the expenditure that would be incurred by the erection of a school building at this point, the Department is not prepared to have this work done. As the Hudson's Bay Company are removing their stores to another point, it is considered that there would be an insufficient number of Indian children remaining at Abitibi to carry on a summer school. The school work at Abitibi will, therefore, be discontinued for a year or two or until such time as the Department is assured that there will be sufficient children at this point to warrant the re-opening of a summer school.\n\nRev. Father Evain, the R.C. missionary for this district, is being informed accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. H. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorth Temiskaming, Que.\nTo the Superintendent of Indian Affairs\n\nI am receiving an application from Miss Mary Ann Donald who has been in the past a teacher of Abitibi School. I may say the best who has been teaching there. She was engaged some years ago at Haileybury and I could not get her since. But having been put out by the fire of last fall, she says that she is free now.\n\nIt was decided last winter that the Abitibi school should be closed, and one of my best reasons was that the last teacher was not appreciated and having not the sufficient authority to keep the native children correct. Indeed, I was sorry to think that the native children of Abitibi would be without any school; but, knowing that Miss M. Donald, of a reasonable age (36 at least, and more) is willing to teach again, I am taking the liberty of asking the Department to try an other teacher again.\n\nI am your humble servant,\n\nI. Evans\n\nP.S. I am inviting Miss M. Donald to write to you.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We understood that there would not be a sufficient number of children remaining at Abitibi to continue the work this coming summer. However, if you will inform us of the number of children likely to attend, we will then be in a position to decide as to whether we can approve of the re-opening of the school or not.\n\nYour early reply will oblige,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I have reason to believe that for the months of June and July the attendance will be over 25, nevertheless, I would advise you to engage the teacher, Miss A. McDonald on the following condition; she would keep the school open while she had a minimum of 20 pupils for example, and if for three days this number would become less, she should close the school and claim salary only for the period while engaged in teaching. If she is willing to accept your conditions I am still disposed to offer the church for school purposes at the same rent as last year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) I. Evans, O.I.I.,\nMissionary.\nOttawa, May 1st, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nRev. Father I. Evain requests that the summer school at Abitibi be re-opened this coming summer. Last Fall he was under the impression that there would not be sufficient children to warrant its re-opening, and you were informed in official letter of October 14th, 1922, that the work at this point would be discontinued. The Reverend Father now states that he has reason to believe that for the months of June and July there will be an attendance of at least 25 children, and has nominated the services of Miss A. McDonald, who formerly taught this school. She has lately been teaching at Haileybury, but her services are now available for Abitibi.\n\nWe are informing the Rev. Father that we will approve of the appointment of Miss McDonald, to begin duties on or about the 1st of June, next, and that she is to keep the school open while she has a minimum attendance of 20 pupils. If the attendance goes below that number, she is to close the school. The salary allowed her will depend upon the attendance and success achieved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

McDonald as teacher, to begin duties on or about June 1st, next. This school is to remain open on condition that there is a minimum attendance of at least 20 children. The salary allowed Miss McDonald will depend upon the attendance and success achieved. If there is a sufficient attendance, we will be prepared to pay the same salary as was allowed last year, viz: $75 per month, plus any bonus provided by law.\n\nYou may inform Miss McDonald of her appointment, and arrange with her to proceed to Abitibi in time to commence duties about the 1st of June.\n\nWe note that you will allow the church to be used for school purposes, at the same rental as was charged last year.\n\nWe are informing Mr. Agent Lewis, of Temiskaming, of permission having been granted to re-open the school, and of the appointment of Miss McDonald.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

She wrote to me after the school was closed and sent back the school register, and informed me that she was going to work in LaSalle for a month, and then she would be down and make her report.\n\nUp till the present she has not arrived which is the reason why her salary has not yet been paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.F.

If you consider that there are sufficient Indian children at this point to warrant the re-opening of the school and that it would meet with success, you may arrange with Miss McDonald to take up duties during the months of June, July and August, next. If you agree to re-opening the school the Department will allow Miss McDonald salary at the same rate as was paid last year, viz.: $75 per month supplemented by any bonus that may be provided by law.

Her reply was in the affirmative on the condition that she be furnished a small dwelling, this I hope to be able to find, and a bonus from your Department to pay her travelling and other expenses in connection with her displacement; this I believe would be reasonable.

She has the same qualifications as any of the previous teachers at Abitibi or Long Point Summer Schools. She has a good education and speaks Indian fluently, which is very near essential in such a place as Abitibi where the children do not speak much English. The term of 2 months is so short that it is doubtful whether the services of a qualified teacher could be obtained for that period as the expenses of transportation and board would use up the greater part of the salary.\n\nThe teachers for Abitibi and Long Point Summer Schools have always been sent from this vicinity, and at the present time this is the most eligible applicant available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D.

We are writing him today, informing him of the application which you forwarded from Miss McBride, and requesting him to state definitely which of the two applicants he prefers for the position.

Father Evain has requested Mrs. McLaren to teach at this school this coming summer. This woman was a fairly good teacher some years ago, but now has a family of 6 children and I fail to see how a woman with a family that size can devote all her time to teaching school.\n\nAs the Rev. Father is the missionary to these Indians it is essential that he should approve of the teachers that are appointed for these schools, but he really knows very little about the qualifications of any of those who are able to teach school in this vicinity as he has been away from here for a number of years, and very rarely visits here. Also some of the younger ones are far more competent than were the teachers of these summer schools some years ago, as the educational facilities have been much better in recent years in this district. I would like to see some results achieved in these schools as both the Abitibi and Long Point countries are fast becoming settled with white people, and it is necessary that these Indian children should learn something more than their catechism.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D.

For this reason I am of the opinion that it would be better to have Miss McLaren than a qualified teacher who would be able to speak to the Indians in their own language.\n\nI have seen Miss McLaren a few times and I may say she is an intelligent looking girl.\n\nThe Abitibi Indian Summer School generally opens the first day of June. I may that Miss McLaren is the daughter of Mrs. J.D. McLaren who has been teaching school in Abitibi a few years, and at Long Point the last two years.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.D. McLaren Esq.\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, April 19, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, relative to the experience possessed by Miss Katherine McLaren, who has been nominated by Rev. Father Evain and yourself for the position as teacher of the Abitibi Indian Summer School for the coming summer.\n\nIn this connection I beg to say that, in view of your report, it is considered that the services of Miss McLaren would be satisfactory. The Department will approve of her appointment to begin duties on or about June 1st next. The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $90 per teaching month. Please inform Miss McLaren accordingly and arrange with her to reopen the school when considered timely by you to have her do so. It is noted that the school will not likely be in operation more than two months, as the Indians are only at the post during that time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

Father Evain that he was not able to find a teacher for the Abitibi Summer School, he wants a teacher who is able to speak the Indian language.\n\nThe Rev. Father would like to get Miss Katherine McLaren who was teaching there last summer and is at present the teacher of the Woolf Lake Indian Day School, she would have to close the Woolf Lake School at the end of this month and go immediately to Abitibi in the first days of next month. It is not necessary to go sooner because the Indians are not there.\n\nThe Abitibi Indians were very pleased with Miss McLaren and their children attended school a month longer than the previous years.\n\nI would be pleased if the proposition of Rev. Father Evain will meet the approval of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, May 20, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, relative to the reopening of the Abitibi Indian Summer School during the coming summer months.\n\nIn this connection it is noted that Rev. Father Evain and yourself recommend that Miss Katherine McLaren, who is at present teaching at Wolf Lake, be transferred as teacher at the Abitibi School from the 1st of June, next. Please inform the Department what arrangements will be made for the teaching services at Wolf Lake if Miss McLaren is transferred to Abitibi. Is it the intention that the Wolf Lake School will remain closed during the three months' period that Miss McLaren would be teaching at Abitibi, or is it the intention to engage the services of a teacher to succeed her at Wolf Lake? The Department would have no objection to the arrangement proposed by yourself and Father Evain, but, before authorizing same, would like to be informed regarding the carrying on of the work at Wolf Lake if Miss McLaren is transferred to the summer school at Abitibi. Please furnish full information as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. S. Williams,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nZ. Caza, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNotre Dame du Nord,\nP. Q.\nNotre Dame du Nord Que, May 22, 1930\n\nSir-\n\nIn reply to official letter no 35-2-1 of the 20th inst., I beg to inform the Department that it is the wish of Rev. Father Evain that the Woolf Lake Indian Day School be closed at the end of May instead than at the end of June in order to permit Miss McLaren to go and take charge of the Abitibi Indian Summer School the last of June. The Abitibi School is generally open for 3 months so that Miss McLaren could go back to take charge of the Woolf Lake School the last of September. Miss McLaren has met with success in both places because she is able to speak the Indian language and it is for this reason that Rev. Father Evain is very anxious to have her for both schools. Please let me know as soon as possible if this proposition has the approval of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, May 27, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, regarding the recommendation of Rev. Father Evain and yourself that Miss Katherine McLaren be transferred from her position as teacher at the Wolf Lake Indian Day School to teach the Abitibi Summer School for a three months' period from June 1st, next, and that the Wolf Lake School is to remain closed during that period.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department will approve of this arrangement, and Miss McLaren may close the Wolf Lake School at the end of the present month and take charge as teacher at the Abitibi School during June, July and August. The salary allowed her during the period she is teaching at Abitibi will be at the rate of $90 per teaching month. You should advise Miss McLaren of the approval granted for her to teach at Abitibi during the three summer months and arrange with her to begin duties as early in June, next, as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

July 3, 1931\n\nSir-\n\nI beg to inform the Department that Miss Catherine McLaren returned from Woolf Lake two weeks ago and she was ready to start for Abitibi. I told her to wait till I was back (I was going there to pay treaty money) because, according to the informations I was getting from there I did not believe there would be no advantage in opening this school this summer, in fact only half of the Indians went to the Post and I do not believe they will be there very long, at least a certain number of them, so that I can not recommend the opening of the Abitibi Summer School for this summer. I believe it would be well to let these Indians know that if they wish to have their school opened next summer, they should make it their duty to be all at the Post for the 1st of June.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA.F.

He states that he has personal knowledge as to the qualifications of both Mrs. McLaren and Miss McBride and that he has no hesitation in recommending that Mrs. McLaren receive the appointment.\n\nThe Department, therefore, approves of the appointment of Mrs. McLaren for the coming summer, to teach a period of two months. The total salary allowed her will be at the rate of $90 per month. Please inform her accordingly, and arrange with her to begin duties at a time when it is considered advisable by you to re-open the school. When the period of her services is completed, you should see that she prepares and forwards the usual returns showing the attendance, days taught, etc., in order that payment of salary due can be made. Please ascertain definitely from Mrs. McLaren whether she accepts, and the date upon which it is intended that she will re-open the school. We are informing Rev. Father Evain of the approval granted for her appointment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLaren,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. H.

Mistassini and Waswanipi, both are considered as Protestant schools, last fall we received adequate supplies on text books, etc., complete standard, shipment was held at Agency and will be forwarded early this spring.\n\nDuring annual visit it is the intention to check all supplies at all schools and bring to-date and inline.\n\nH.

I am just arriving from this post, where I have resided for a month. I left here with the teacher, Mr. Simpson, on the 23rd May; we had a hard time to go up: snow, ice, and rain. The school has been opened this 5th of June.\n\nWhen I left, a week ago, over 60 Indians children were attending at school. The Indians are pleased and proud about this school and the teacher who is succeeding very well. But I tell you she will not make very big wages, because the expenses have been very high.\n\nI am now following the expenses myself according your agreement, for supplying the school. I give myself the word, keep it clean as my own expense. Remember the lumber is very dear, so try to save every thing the cheapest way possible.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6114, file 375-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI observe that our little church at Abitibi is so much in request that I am under necessity of rebuilding a new one. The Indians are prepared to assist me in building at the same place, where they will still come for many years. As you are aware, this church is used for the summer school for the Indian children, who number this morning 55, and there are still 12 families to come. I am prepared to furnish again the new church and to set up seats and desks for the school; but I am in need of assistance from the Department for that purpose. I should, therefore, ask for the sum of $300 from the Department, and should make an agreement with it to furnish the school-room while it remains, which will be much less expensive than the one at Timagami that the Department has built and which is much smaller than the one required by the number of children at Abitibi. The church that I am going to build, 60 X 26, will cost me at least $1500. Please, therefore, reply to me immediately, because I shall have to do special work in view of the school.\n\nVery respectfully\n\nYour servant,\n\nIs.Evain,O.M.I.\nOttawa, June 13, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant in which you advise the Department that you are building a new Church for the Abitibi Indians and ask for a grant of $300.00 from the Department to furnish it for use as a school-room.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department desires to know in the first place the exact location of the proposed new school building. I may say that it would appear preferable to allow you a reasonable rental for the Church during the three months or four months that it is in occupation by the children during the summer, you to provide the necessary equipment. This application should be forwarded through the office of the Indian Agent and you should ask him to make any recommendation in connection therewith that he may see fit.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

The present price paid per month is $6.00 and the Reverend Father, in view of the expenses made in connection with the construction of the building and appropriation of same and surroundings for school purposes would like to be remunerated in a fitting way.\n\nCould you kindly consider the advisability of granting that request for the next year and even, if possible, pay for the current year at the rent of $15.00 per month.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Original on File 371950.\n\nC.E. School at Albany.\n\nThe Church Missionary Society School at Albany is not what could be termed a substantial building, it is old and the foundation is considerably decayed. Its dimensions are 26 x 16 ft. 6 in. x 14 ft. high, with gabled and shingled roof. Gable 8 ft. high and side ridge of rafters 11 feet, which gives 429 square feet of floor space and 6632 cubic feet of air space.\n\nThe equipment of this school in the matter of desks and seats is very inadequate. There is no ventilation, excepting that caused by the stove which heats the building. There is no drainage in connection with it. The water supply for this institution, as is also the case in regard to the hospital and school at the Roman Catholic Mission here, is procured from the Albany river, and is admitted to be quite healthy.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nSgd. W.J. McLean\nPaying Officer Treaty No.9\nOttawa, January 31, 1912.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nThe teachers in charge of the Church of England schools at Albany and Rupert's House, James Bay, have requested to be supplied with modern desks. It is most difficult for these people to make desks as they have no mill and all work has to be done by hand. Desks \"knocked-down\" may be sent in at a reasonable rate by Revillion Bros.' steamer and in view of the conditions it would appear advisable to supply these furnishings. An order should be placed with a firm in Montreal, who could hand the goods over for shipment to Revillion Bros., when their steamer leaves for Hudson's Bay in July, next.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Goodwins Limited,\nMontreal, Que.\nTHE SNIDER SCHOOL DESK\nWith Roller-Bearing Seat Hinge\n\nNOICELESS! AUTOMATIC! STRONG!\n\nThe latest, the best, the most durable, the most comfortable, the handsomest, the one easiest put together, and one that will last as long as the school house; never break or get out of order and always be clean, neat, firm, noiseless, healthful and automatic.\n\nMade in six sizes of Single, Double, and Double Separate Desks. Rears and Fronts to correspond to each size.\n\nMANUFACTURED BY\nJOHN B. SNIDER, Waterloo, Ont.\nThe Snider School Desk\n\nWe fully warrant the Snider Desk and replace any broken parts at any time without charge and without asking questions as to how the breakage occurred.\n\nTHE INTERLOCKING METHOD\n\nof fastening the wood to the Cast Standards has the merits of the dovetail fastening without any of its disadvantages. It is the most perfect fastening for combining wood and iron that has yet been discovered. Holds the wood firmly from one end to the other without the aid of bolts, keys or wedges. Desk cannot get loose or work out of form. Easy to set up.\n\nWOOD\u2014Selected Birch, Finish Natural; all thoroughly Air Seasoned and Kiln Dried.\n\nPerfect curves for seat and back, planed and sanded into perfect form, finished in the best grade hard oil finish. Sycamore tops, stained dark, supplied when so ordered.\n\nTHE ROLLER-BEARING HINGE\n\nis the most ingenious contrivance yet produced. The seat is so hinged that the least pressure of the body in rising will cause it to fold back, and in sitting down the least touch will cause it to fold down. Not necessary to step out in the aisle in rising or sitting down.\n\nSolid Hub. Trunnion Joint. A part of the main casting.\n\nLARGE BEARINGS.\n\nNo strain on the bolt whatever. It is not necessary in getting up or sitting down to touch the seat with the hands, as it works perfectly automatic.\n\nNO RUBBER BUFFERS\n\nto make it noiseless as is the case in most seats. It is absolutely noiseless without same, and will remain so.\n\nCASTINGS\u2014Best grade of Pig Iron used.\n\nDesigned to give the greatest strength by a uniform distribution of the iron, so there is no undue strain which causes so many castings to crack. THIS POINT SHOULD NOT BE OVERLOOKED.\n\nThe Castings are artistically designed. Best grade Baking Japan finish. Flush top, air tight ink-wells in all sizes of desks.\nDouble Entire Desk\nFor two pupils. Made in six sizes.\n\nDouble Separate Desk\nAllowing one pupil to stand at desk without disturbing companion. Made in six sizes.\nRears and fronts to match all sizes.\nIn Ordering School Desks\n\nSpecify plainly the number of each size desk wanted, and whether single or double. If double, state whether entire or individual seats are wanted. Give address of party to whom you wish the goods shipped, distinctly stating name of R.R.

They will be of assistance in determining just how many seats a house will hold, and the sizes required.\n\nIf necessary, desks can be put closer together by one or two inches without affecting the comfort of the pupil.\nOur Roller-Bearing Seat Hinge.\n\nFigure 4 shows inner side of right-hand seat bracket, giving view of hub, also showing socket into which fits ball or trunnion shown in Figure 5, making a ball-and-socket joint, the only true principle for a school desk hinge. The problem of making the hinge noiseless has been overcome in a very ingenious manner.\n\nIn Figure 5, which represents a portion of main standard, will be noticed two rollers or cylinders. These are made of case-hardened steel and set into recesses in the side of standard. Now notice that the opening for bolt in Figure 4 is placed above the centre. The result is that the hub operates as an eccentric, that is, does not describe a true circle and when the arm is at either of the two extreme positions (seat folded or open) this hub engages with the rollers or cylinders referred to, arresting the motion of the seat and bringing it to a gradual stop. Figure 5 also shows brass bushing over trunnion partially cut away for purpose of illustration. The purpose of this is to eliminate the friction between the two iron surfaces. The whole construction of the hinge is such as to cause it to work smoothly and noiselessly.\n\nFigure 6 shows complete hinge with cap, bolt and nut in place, as in use, with seat folded, the dotted lines showing inner parts.\n\nNo. 8 CHAIR.

The size of the school house is 27' x 17' feet. The Department will see at once that a building of that size is not sufficiently large enough for an average attendance of 30 children which I had last year. During the\ngreater part of last Summer, I had of necessity to have two schools, which of course taxed me, and even then I could not retain the children long in school, as it was detrimental to their health in such a close room.\n\nEnclose particulars which I think will be useful to the Dept in giving their kind attention to my appeal for a larger School.\n\nI shall be very pleased to give the Dept any further particulars which they may require.\n\nI remain\n\nYours truly,\n\nJohn Thomas Griffin\n## St Paul's Church of England Mission Day School\n\n### Attendance for Girls during each Quarter\n\n#### 1913\n\n| Name          | 1st Quarter | 2nd Quarter | 3rd Quarter | Total |\n|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------|\n| Wesley Helen  | 33          | 15          | 12          |       |\n| Jane          | 48          | 45          | 21          |       |\n| Clara         | 45          | 23          |             |       |\n| Mary          | 26          | 14          | 41          |       |\n| Lizzie        | 8           | 12          | 9           |       |\n| Kitty         | 50          | 37          | 43          |       |\n| Mary          | 29          | 22          | 16          |       |\n| Maggie        | 26          | 16          | 6           |       |\n| Caroline      | 34          | 32          | 17          |       |\n| Lotte         | 49          | 45          | 19          |       |\n| Mary          | 51          | 39          | 19          |       |\n| Emily         | 51          | 47          | 26          |       |\n| Rachel        | 43          | 5           | 19          |       |\n| Ellen         | 15          | 44          | 19          |       |\n| Kitty         | 23          | 32          | 17          |       |\n| Cecile        | 49          | 35          | 10          |       |\n| Mary          | 15          | 14          | 11          |       |\n| Minnie        | 29          | 30          | 16          |       |\n| Annie         | 23          | 23          | 11          |       |\n| Alice         | 43          | 27          | 12          |       |\n| Josephine     | 22          | 11          |             |       |\n| Hannah        | 13          |             |             |       |\n| Lizzie        | 24          | 14          |             |       |\n| Maggie        | 32          | 10          |             |       |\n| Laura         | 28          | 16          | 3           |       |\n| Mary          | 14          |             |             |       |\n| Bob           | 12          |             |             |       |\n| Kitty         | 14          |             |             |       |\n| Louise        | 24          | 29          | 5           |       |\n| Florrie       | 20          | 34          |             |       |\n| Annie         | 22          | 34          |             |       |\n| Minnie        | 22          | 34          |             |       |\n| Sarah         | 5           |             |             |       |\n| Maggie        | 14          | 9           |             |       |\n| Emma          | 20          | 27          | 2           |       |\n\n**Total number of girls attending each quarter:** 112\n\n**Average Attendance Boys and Girls**\n\n- 1st Quarter: 30\n- 2nd Quarter: 37\n- 3rd Quarter: 36\n- 4th Quarter: 16\n| Name          | 51 | 50 | 30 | 56 |\n|---------------|----|----|----|----|\n| Wesley        |    |    |    |    |\n| Gains         | 50 | 49 | 26 | 4  |\n| Willie (a)    | 29 | 26 | 4  |    |\n| Wynne         | John| 49 | 47 | 27 |\n| Jacob         | 49 | 47 | 28 | 56 |\n| Loutette      | Barry| 50 | 37 | 24 |\n| Jonnie        | 49 | 38 | 22 | 55 |\n| Stanley       | Sam | 20 | 19 | 16 |\n| Wesley        | Sam | 49 | 44 | 25 |\n| Wynne         | Angus| 22 | 20 | 3  |\n| Arias         | 23 | 20 | 3  |    |\n| Peter         | 24 | 14 | 1  |    |\n| Jimmie        | 24 | 13 | 3  |    |\n| Archibald     | George| 17 | 4  | 20 |\n| Wesley        | Willie (b)| 7 | 41 | 49 |\n| Wynne         | Noah| 22 | 2  |    |\n| Napine        | George| 20 | 24 | 12 |\n| Hughley       | Ethel| 24 | 21 | 2  |\n| Goodwin       | Alice| 6 |    |    |\n| Archibald     | Noah| 27 | 12 | 6  |\n| Lazarus       | Matthew| 26 | 10 | 4  |\n| Sutherland    | George| 41 | 5  | 8  |\n| Joel          |     |    |    |    |\n| Solomon       | George (c)| 50 | 34 | 19 |\n| Willie        |     |    |    |    |\n| Goodwin       | Mark| 48 | 23 | 19 |\n| Ruben         | David| 10 | 16 | 27 |\n| Solomon       | Fred| 7  | 12 |    |\n| Sutherland    | David| 10 | 8  |    |\n| George (b)    |     |    |    |    |\n\nTotal number of boys attending each quarter: 22, 42, 46, 26\n\nTotal number of boys on roll during year: 574\nSt Paul's Church of England Mission Day School\n\nChildren not on Roll for 1913\nSchool age 6 & upwards\n\n1.

For the past year I have had of necessity to hold two Schools one in the morning & another in the afternoon so that we may have room to move about. I drew attention to this state of affairs & at the beginning of the\nlate War the Department took up the matter with me and asked for particulars of our requirements; this was sent & is now in the Dept. His Lordship Bishop Anderson took up the matter also with the Dept & if I do not mistake, the Dept promised to do something after the war was over. I have been faithful to the Dept as a School Teacher since 1906 & ask for a more encouraging letter from the Dept. I wish also to state regarding the present state of our school that it requires a new roof, door or new foundation, the building is only a frame structure & is not suitable now for the number of children attending.

The building is forty feet long and twenty feet wide, with a height of thirteen feet to the eaves. The foundation is built of logs squared ten inches and covered with a heavy coating of Stockholm Tar. The studding is 2\" x 6\" scantling placed two feet apart. The sheeting is B.C. Fir. The wall plates and corner posts are of lumber 6\" by 6\". The doors, windows, and sidings as well as the roofing material - 13 cases of Eastlake Galvanized shingles - are on the ground.

P.A. Norton, an missionary at Albany, James Bay, stating that Mr. Avery, Agent Department, when at Albany this summer for the Treaty Payments, promised that he would recommend Agent Department on his arrival here a first payment or installment of $500 after seeing the material on the ground for the New Day School here. I may say that Mr. Norton states that the roof is on the building.\n\nI enclose receipted statement of account paid to Messrs. Neville Bros. for freight on material to date.\n\nI shall be glad to have your cheque in due course.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJohn G. Moosonee\nOttawa, September 18th, 1926.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nReferring to Your Lordship's letter of the 15th September and previous correspondence regarding the new Day School at Albany, I beg to say that when Mr. H. M. Awrey, of this Department, returned from the Treaty 9 trip he made a strong recommendation to the effect that an advance of five hundred ($500.00) dollars be made towards building operations. Up to the present the Department has not found it possible to have the matter given attention, but it is proposed to make the advance within a short time.\n\nI may say that Mr. Awrey has stated that he wrote the Reverend P. A. Northam in regard to this matter. It would seem that the letter did not reach its destination.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean.\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRt. Rev. J. G. Anderson, D.D.,\nBishop of Moose Cree,\nCochrane,\nOntario.\nEXTRACT FROM ANNUAL REPORT OF P. A. NORTHAM,\nTEACHER OF THE ALBANY MISSION DAY SCHOOL, FOR\nFISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31st, 1926.\n\nThe present school building has become too small for our needs. The foundation of a new school has been built, 20 ft. by 40 ft., and during the summer a school house will be erected on this foundation. The Indians of this Mission have promised to contribute at least $500.00 towards the building, which in itself is an indication of the interest of the Indians in the education of their children. The new school house, when complete, will cost between $2500.00 and $3000.00, and all the necessary material for it has been ordered.\nSaint Paul's Mission,\nAlbany, James Bay,\nvia ISLAND FALLS P.O.,\nOntario.\n\nDecr.1926\n\nTo\nThe Secretary,\nThe Dept.of Indian Affairs,Ottawa,Ont.\n\nSir:-\n\nYour Department very kindly consented to make a Grant of money towards the cost of a new school house at this Mission for the use of the Indians of the Albany Band. I beg therefore to enclose the financial statement of monies expended to date on the erection of the new school building.\n\nThe schoolhouse is forty feet in length,and twenty feet wide.These measurements do not include the porch which is eight feet by six feet. The whole is built on a solid foundation of heavy logs,squared to a thickness of ten inches,and standing two feet six inches above the ground. The foundation logs and floor sleepers are covered with a heavy coating of Stockholm tar. This particular style of foundation is at present the only possible kind at Fort Albany owing to the nature of the land which is wet and marshy. The building here is subject to continual heaving caused by the severity of the frost in the winter,and a very gradual thawing out in the warmer months of the year. Cement is much too costly for it would have to be freighted in by the river transport,which freight is very expensive. The wall of the school,from the top of the foundation to the eaves,are eleven feet. The frame of the building is of 2 in.by6 in.scantling spaced two feet apart.The walls outside are sheeted with inch lumber,B.C.Fir,and the joints between the boards are caulked. This is covered with a ply of heavy tar paper,over which is a ply of good quality spruce Cove Siding,tongue and groove. The roof is half pitch,the rafters and sheathing being of B.C.Fir,which is covered with Eastlake Galvanized Shingles. There is a fire proof chimney.The flooring is of 1/2 inch spruce lumber,tongued and grooved.The inside walls are covered with a good quality spruce V joint lumber,as is also the ceiling. The schoolroom is nine feet in height from floor to ceiling.The windows are on the south side and are three triple windows,each separate window having 3 upper and 3 lower sash,or nine upper and nine lower sash in all,with a total of 189 glass lights. The ventilation is good as all the lower sash can be raised and all the upper sash lowered. There is a small teachers room for school supplies,also containing a window. The porch is lighted by a window.The schoolroom is furnished with a large Carron stove and has accommodation for sixty pupils.\n\nIn addition there is an upper story above the main room,lituated four feet below,while portion is not finished but when extra accommodation is needed it will be possible to make out of it a room forty feet in length,and about 14 feet wide,with walls four feet at the sides and rising to a height of eight feet in the centre.\n\nThe outside of the building has been painted with two coats of white paint,and the usual trimmings black.The galvanized shingles are painted a ferric red.The inside ceiling is painted with two coats of white paint,and the inside walls will be painted with two coats of paint as soon as the weather becomes a little milder.\n\nA drain has been dug on two sides of the school lot over which culverts have been placed. Two outside lavatories are in the course of construction.\n\nI would particularly draw your attention to the fact that over Six hundred dollars of the total cost of the building to date has been paid in river freight alone to the two Trading\nCompanies for the necessary building materials which had to be brought in by the river route from Pagwa River Stn. to Albany, distance of 300 miles. The extra river freight has added to the cost of the building to that extent.\n\nThe amount which we ventured to ask your Department for in the first place was a Thousand Dollars. The Paying Officer of Treaty No.9 told me that not all that amount was granted. As this school has been built and will be maintained solely for the use of the Indians of the Albany Band I venture to trust that your Department will deals as generously as possible in the assistance you give us financially.\n\nMay I ask that when the Grant is paid the cheque may be made out and sent to The Rt.Rev.J.G.Anderson,D.D., Bishopthorpe, Cochrane, Ont. His Lordship very kindly advanced the necessary monies expended in the building.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour's v.truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMissionary-in-Charge.\nDiocese of Moosonee\n\nJOHN G.

P. A. Northam, is almost completed with the exception of doors and benches and interior painting. The material to finish the school is all in the hands and will be completed in the early spring.\n\nI enclose a letter with statement of account attached to date. I am sorry that Rev. Northam has omitted his signature to the report, though he was in at the end of this letter. He may have thought this sufficient. I have certified the statement and trust that you will be satisfied with the report as it is together with the enclosed statement. I have already sent you the money back and hope that you will send me your cheque in due course and for the full amount as first promised by Rev. Curry.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I wish also to call your attention to the fact that the seats and desks, the painting of the interior walls we has yet to done, so that the total cost will likely be $1000, if not more, before the building is completed.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nJames Finlayson\nJohn G.

This building is now completed. The building is on a heavy foundation. It is forty feet long and twenty feet wide. The height from the ground to the eaves is thirteen feet and from the ground to the middle of the roof is eighteen feet.\n\nThe outside of the building is covered with cove siding and the roof is covered with Eastlake galvanized shingles. In my estimation, the building is a boon to the Indians. It is capable of desk accommodation for about sixty pupils. The building has cost in the neighbourhood of $3500.00. The Indians themselves raised about $500.00 towards helping to pay for the cost. Last year I asked that a grant of $1000.00 be given. You kindly allowed $800.00. I really think that the sum allowed is entirely too small and I now most earnestly ask that the grant be increased to $1200.00 and I feel sure that any request will be most favourably considered by you. I have pleasure in enclosing a picture of the school.\n\nH. N.

At that time, the Bishop forwarded a certified statement, showing that the cost had already amounted to $2682.53.\n\nMr. Awrey reports that a much better building than was originally intended has been erected and that the cost has amounted to approximately $3500. The Indians themselves raised $500 for the purpose, but the Church has had to meet the balance. His Lordship has again urged that we consider increasing our grant, and Mr. Awrey recommends that a further $400 be allowed. In view of the circumstances, I wish to recommend that a supplementary grant be made.\n\nW. R.

I appreciate very much the cheque of $400 which has been duly received. At the same time I cannot agree with your last statement \"that in future no rental payments will be allowed at this school.\" If the Department had paid the full cost of the school that would be just and fair. I sent you a statement in Feb. last certified by our missionary Rev. P. A. Northam showing that up to that time about $700 had been expended on the school, and a number of seats and the painting of the interior had still to be done, which will raise the cost to fully $1000. So that it appears to me that at least half its rental formerly paid should be allowed for the upkeep of the building. If the Department pay the full cost of school buildings in Ontario, Western Reserve and have salaries ranging about $800 or $900 why should we be treated differently in Ontario especially in places like Albany so far removed from railways? I trust that you will re-consider your decision and allow us some consideration for rent etc.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJohn G. Anderson\n\nDiocese of Moosonee\n\nIndian Affairs.

I will see them when I pass through Cochrane on June 7th.\n\nThe sanitation of the school is much improved but the condition of the whole building is very bad, of course this is a very old building and unless this school is replaced in a very few years it will have to be closed, the foundations have all gone and the building is beginning to slant at a noticeable angle.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.L.Tyrer M.B.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nCLOSED FILE\n\nFILE NUMBER 376-13 VOLUME 1\n\nSUBJECT ALBANY RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nC.

This was done owing to the fact that Rev. Mr. Wilding's salary had been sent in this manner.

I beg to say that at present the well on the Mission Property adjoining the school yard is dry and has been for a long time and the well at the mission house is nearly dry at present so that the children are at times much in need of drinking water. Heretofore there has always been enough water in the mission well to supply the school when the other well was dry. The well will cost $1.50 per foot for the first 20 feet and $1.60 per foot after up to 40 feet I think that plenty of water will be reached at 40 feet. In stating costs I mean digging well draining stones etc and finding everything. A platform will cost three or four dollars and a pump about $16.00. What shall be done in the matter? I am sure that the Indians residing in the centre of the village will make use of the said well and pump and of course use up the pump much quicker that it otherwise would be used.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nD.

I could have got a wood pump for less money than the one I bought, but at a general meeting of the male members of the Band held on the 29th ultimo I asked the Indians what kind of a pump they wanted, when a vote was taken and nearly every member voted that the superior pump be purchased; and there was a large number present. I therefore got the pump they wanted, and I am sure that they made a good choice.\n\nIt only cost a trifle more than a wood pump would have done, and I think that it is worth nearly twice as much. I told you when I wrote you that the well would cost $1.50 per foot for the first 20 feet $1.60 per foot for the second 20 feet etc., but owing to the late season and the strong competition we got it dug for $71.66 at my estimate the well would have cost $87.65 so that on the whole the well and pump cost much less than the estimate.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nD.

We will want say 24 seats (single) which I think will be ample at all times for this school but in case there should be a rush at any time one or two of the old seats might be used for a short time by not putting too many seats in the school room there would be more room on the floor.

Your letter of January 9th requested a quotation of 12 Preston Ball Bearing Combination Adjustable Desks, size 1, and you will appreciate it seems somewhat surprising that anyone else could have given a lower price than ourselves on this particular Desk. We are inclined to think that you are not getting Preston Desks at all, and if such is the case it is to be regretted because you are missing the best and most serviceable \"fixed\" Desk made in Canada today. There is no doubt at all that you can buy much cheaper seats for the Preston Factory have never attempted to produce anything but a first class article.

The other firms furnishing quotations did not quote on the Preston Ball Bearing Combination Adjustable Desks supplied by you. The order was placed for a desk of the single type, which was considered satisfactory for the purpose, and at a lower price than that quoted by you.\n\nUnder the requirements of the Purchasing Commission of Canada we are obliged to obtain prices from a number of dealers before placing orders, and the firm quoting the lowest price, having in view the supplying of a serviceable desk, receives the order.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.

There is a good stone foundation well under building. There are 3 chimneys on building from foundation.\n\nI would respectfully suggest that a pipeless furnace be put in for next winter. The approximate cost (including installations) would be $175. The building is good for another forty or fifty years. Wood is becoming scarce in this locality.

Coyle, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nROSENEATH,\nOnt.\nMemorandum,\n\nMr. McLean.\n\nWhile at the Alnwick Reserve I had occasion to visit the school and my attention was drawn by the teacher to the condition of the blackboard. This board is made of 3\" boards with, of course, a series of cracks and it makes it very difficult indeed to work upon.\n\nI would recommend that a new hylo-plate be supplied, one 16'x3', and two 10'6\" x3'.\n\nThe interior of the school is in very bad condition and should be repainted. The floors should also be ciled. The front porch is in bad shape, decaying at one side, and should be repaired. The rain has also washed out quite a large whole on one side of the building and will, I fear, undermine the foundation. Five or six loads of gravel should be dumped into this whole. The shields of the closets, both boys' and girls', are partly broken down and should be renewed.\n\nI beg to recommend that the Agent be authorized to have this work done.\n\nR. H. Abraham\n\nAgricultural Representative.\nOTTAWA, April 10th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. R. H. Abraham, Agricultural Representative of this Department, who recently visited the Alnwick Indian Day School, reports that the interior of the school is in bad condition and should be repainted, also that the floors should be oiled, and the front porch repaired, as it is decaying at one side. He also states that the rain has washed out quite a large hole in one side of the foundation and, as a result, the foundation is in danger of being undermined, and recommends that 5 or 6 loads of gravel be dropped into this hole. The shields in both the boys' and girls' closets are broken and should be renewed.\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough to forward an estimate of the cost of painting the interior of the school and oiling the floor, also the repairing of the front porch.\n\nYou may arrange to have the hole in the side of the building repaired by dropping in the amount of gravel required to fill up the excavation. You should also arrange to have the shields in both the boys' and girls' closets repaired or renewed.\n\nThe Department will expect that you will attend to the filling in of the excavation in the side of the building and to the repairs to the closets as soon as possible, and properly certified vouchers should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred. The cost should be kept down to the lowest possible point.\n\nYou should also forward as soon as possible an estimate of the cost of the other repairs mentioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

I have, therefore, to request that you will make the necessary arrangements to have the repairs required to the closets carried out. No undue expenditure should be incurred. When the work is completed you should forward properly certified vouchers covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nIn connection with the repairs to the school building, referred to in official letter to you of the 10th of April, last, I have to request that you will state what action you have taken to comply with the instructions contained in that letter.

LIMITED GUELPH\nHere Are a Few of the Outstanding Features of The Gilson Pipeless Furnace\n\nThe Gilson is an all cast iron furnace.\n\nExtra large tight fitting feed door admits chunks of wood without difficulty. Special grate is provided for burning wood.\n\nFeed section cast in one piece. Cup joints insure accurate fit with other sections.\n\nAll doors have beaded edges, ground to insure their fitting close and tight all round.\n\nThis Furnace has solved the heating problem for hundreds of householders and landlords and greatly reduced the heating costs. It will do the same for you.\n\nPERFECT BALANCE SAVES FUEL\n\nFor every pound of fuel burned, a certain volume of air must circulate around your furnace to carry the heat up into your rooms. If the casings are undersize, there is not the proper balance of air circulation to fuel burned.\n\nThe casings of the Gilson Pipeless Furnace are the largest of any pipeless furnace. The generous outer casing draws the air quickly, yet without drafts, from your floors. The large inner casing warms, but does not overheat, the air and returns it to your living rooms, fresh and with just the right humidity.\n\nPerfect Balance\n\nPerfect balance prevails among all parts of the Gilson. The straight side firepot, made in two sections, presents the greatest possible surface for heating the circulating air. The radiator is extra large to match the firepot. Its long runway absorbs the fullest measure of heat from the smoke and gases before discharging them up the chimney.\n\nNote the ground joint doors of the Gilson,\u2014how well they fit. Examine the cup joints, the care with which they are finished so that all sections go together smoke and gas-tight. Every part is made of generous proportions, to stand unusual knocks and strains.\n\nPerfect Satisfaction\n\nThrough and through quality is assured in the Gilson because only the finest grey iron is used for the castings, combined with the know-how that a quarter of a century of furnace making brings.\n\nWe back up this furnace to the limit. Thousands are in use, and every one is saving money and giving its owner solid heating comfort. A Gilson in your home will make you happy every winter your whole life long.\nRoseneath, Ont.

Turner Co of Peterborough respectively.\n\nWhen I wrote the Department the 30th ultimo, in the matter I was not aware that Mr. Mason was dealing in furnaces. He casually heard we were wanting one for the Alderville School so had the Head Agent of his firm inspect the School. Although he does not guarantee his furnace it seems to me his tender is worth consideration. Mr. Mason himself is a contractor and could lay the foundation for the furnace. Mr. R. Turner Co of Peterborough also inspected the building but were very definitely against it.\n\nJuly 27, 1922\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

After the furnace has been installed it will be necessary to complete any painting, and you will kindly see that this is done.\n\nIt is noted you recommend that the front gable of the school outside as well as the woodwork underneath the eaves be painted. You may have the painter who does the work in the interior of the school paint the gable and eaves.\n\nAll this painting should be done in a satisfactory manner and at the lowest possible cost. When completed, properly certified vouchers in duplicate should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred. You will be good enough to obtain a price from the painter for the painting of the gable and the woodwork around the eaves.

(RG 10, Volume 6115, file 377-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nA Pipeless Wood Furnace!\n\nFOR THOSE WHO LIVE IN DISTRICTS WHERE WOOD IS STILL THE FUEL ordinarily used, there has, until now, not been a PIPELESS furnace really suited to their requirements. Furnaces advertised to burn either coal or wood are really coal furnaces with a loose wood grate, for which the wood must be cut in small pieces, and in which it is hard to keep a fire over night.\n\nThe \"HILBORN\" PIPELESS FURNACE, on the other hand, HAS A REGULAR WOOD FIRE-BOX WHICH WILL TAKE A STICK FROM TWO TO FOUR AND A HALF FEET LONG, and the fire-box door is big enough to take chunks that otherwise could not be used. THERE IS NO TROUBLE ABOUT KEEPING A FIRE ALL NIGHT IN THE \"HILBORN\".\n\nTHE PRINCIPLE OF THE HILBORN PIPELESS WOOD FURNACE is the same as that of our famous HECLA PIPELESS FURNACE, based on the fact that warm air rises and cold air falls. The cold air is drawn down from the house, through the outer case, into the furnace where it is warmed and goes up into the house again through the centre of the register. With the doors between the rooms left open, this results in a circulation of air throughout the house that warms it in a surprisingly short space of time and keeps it at an even and comfortable temperature.\n\nFor particulars as to size etc. see next page.\n\nThe Hilborn Pipeless Wood Furnace\n\nMADE BY CLARE BROS. & CO., Limited PRESTON Ont.\nThe Hilborn Pipeless Wood Furnace.\n\nThe illustrations on this page show the furnace itself, without the casing. Note the firebox\u2014very heavy, for DURABILITY\u2014and deeply corrugated, to give LARGE RADIATING SURFACE. The door is big\u2014to admit tough wood, knots, etc.\n\nThe HILBORN IS BUILT WITH EITHER THREE OR FIVE DRUMS TO SUIT INDIVIDUAL REQUIREMENTS. These drums are so arranged that the fire travels several times the length of the firebox before reaching the smoke pipe. This long fire travel, combined with the large surface of the drums, and the additional radiating surface of the corrugated firebox, make the HILBORN PIPELESS FURNACE a most POWERFUL AND ECONOMICAL HEATER.\n\nTHE CASING is doubly insulated. Inside the Galvanized Iron Casing is a lining of asbestos, and inside that a lining of tin\u2014an added expense that is an economy, because it prevents loss of heat into the cellar.\n\nTHE REGISTER, which can be supplied in either oxidized copper or black japanned finish, is of the proper size to give best results. The proportions of both register and casings have been carefully worked out, and are RIGHT.\n\nTHERE IS NO RUSH OF HOT, DRY AIR FROM THE HILBORN PIPELESS. The casing and register have been carefully proportioned to give just an easy, steady flow of air at summer heat\u2014and the water pan in the HILBORN is big enough so that in passing through the furnace the air absorbs just the right quantity of moisture to insure a healthy atmosphere in the house.\n\nA COOL CELLAR: The Casing on the HILBORN PIPELESS FURNACE prevents any heat from radiating into the cellar, which as a result is always cool, so that fruit and vegetables may be stored within a few feet of the furnace.\n\nMADE IN EIGHT DIFFERENT SIZES\u2014A SIZE TO SUIT ANY HOUSE, AS FOLLOWS:\n\n| No. | No. of Drums | Length of Wood | Extreme length of Furnace | Size of Smoke Pipe | Capacity in Cubic Feet | Size of Grating |\n|-----|--------------|----------------|--------------------------|-------------------|------------------------|----------------|\n| 23  | 3            | 37 inches      | 42 inches                | 7\u00bd\"               | Up to 15,000           | 30 x 30        |\n| 25  | 5            | 37 \"           | 42 \"                     | 7\u00bd\"               | 20,000                 | 30 x 30        |\n| 33  | 3            | 43 \"           | 54 \"                     | 8\"                | 25,000                 | 35 x 35        |\n| 35  | 5            | 43 \"           | 54 \"                     | 8\"                | 30,000                 | 35 x 35        |\n| 43  | 3            | 56 \"           | 64\u00bd\"                     | 9\"                | 35,000                 | 40 x 40        |\n| 45  | 5            | 56 \"           | 64\u00bd\"                     | 9\"                | 50,000                 | 40 x 40        |\n| 53  | 3            | 56 \"           | 64\u00bd\"                     | 9\"                | 50,000                 | 45 x 45        |\n| 55  | 5            | 56 \"           | 64\u00bd\"                     | 9\"                | 60,000                 | 45 x 45        |\n\nIndian Affairs.

M. Roblin, Brighton, Ont., who is to do the work. He informs us that no arrangements have been made for the excavating of the cellar of the building to the desired depth to allow for the setting up of the furnace.\n\nThis furnace cannot be installed until the necessary excavation has been made. The tenders do not call for the contractor to do this work. It will, therefore, be necessary for you to arrange for having an opening cut through the foundation of the building and the cellar excavated to the desired size and depth. A window should be put in where the cellar foundation is cut, in order to provide light in the cellar. A doorway, of sufficient size, should also be cut in the floor of the ante-room of the school room and a door and stairway installed, for the purpose of carrying down the fuel required.\n\nThis work should be undertaken by you at once and rushed to completion, in order that the contractor may proceed with the installation of the furnace. You will be good enough to inform the contractor when the excavating is completed, so that he can start work on his contract. You will please see that this work is done with the least possible expenditure and, when completed, properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded.\n\nThe contract for the installation of the furnace includes the providing of a suitable concrete foundation on which the furnace shall rest. A copy of the specifications for the installation of the heating system has already been sent you.\n\nWe shall expect to hear at an early date that the work which you are now authorized to do, in excavating the cellar and the installation of the heating system has been completed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Agent.\nOttawa, 23rd January, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, with which you submitted a voucher for $25.29 in favour of Mr George Ingham, covering the cost of supplies which he furnished from the 2nd December 1927 to the 14th September 1928 for use in connection with the church, council room and school on the Alnwick Reserve, and in reply I have to point out that this account should have been rendered monthly or at least quarterly. You should not allow account to run for more than three months. Some of the charges in this account were properly payable before the 1st of April 1928.\n\nAccounts for expenditure in connection with school are charged to the School Vote, while expenditure incurred for the Council Hall and Church is chargeable to Band Funds, and therefore I return the voucher herewith. Kindly indicate on the face thereof the amount spent for School, and show separately the expenditure incurred at the Church and Council Hall.\n\nThe Department will expect you to submit vouchers regularly in future. It seems advisable for you to render a separate voucher for expense incurred in connection with the school. It will not be necessary, however, to do so in the present case.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.J. Slade Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFenella,\nOnt.\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. 109\n\nAgent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Agent,\nOttawa, October 28th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on my visit of inspection to the Alnwick Agency on the 8th and 9th instant.\n\nA teacher's chair is needed (at the Indian day school); the old one is worn out.\n\nThe ceiling of the little store room has fallen in places; it requires new plaster.\n\nThe two closets are in very poor condition and past repairing; two new ones are needed very badly.\n\nThos. McGookin,\n\nInspector.\nOttawa, November 7, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector McGookin, who recently visited the Alnwick Agency, states that a teacher's chair is required for the Alnwick Indian Day School, as the old one is worn out. He also states that the ceiling of the little storeroom has fallen in places and requires new plaster. He further states that the two closets are in very poor condition and past repairing and that two new closets are badly needed.\n\nI have to request that you will arrange for the purchase and delivery of a suitable chair for the teacher's use. No unnecessary expense should be incurred in the purchase of same. You should also arrange to have the repairs required to the plaster of the ceiling of the storeroom carried out, and you should forward certified accounts, in duplicate, covering the above authorized expenditure.\n\nRelative to the erection of new closets, I have to request that you will furnish a report stating the approximate cost of building same and whether you could arrange to have this work carried out before the extreme cold weather sets in. In estimating the cost, you should consider the erection of separate toilets, with proper screened approaches. When we have particulars as to the cost, etc., consideration will then be given to authorizing having the work carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. J. Slade, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFenella, Ont.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the new closets, I have received an estimate on the cost of same. Chas Jones, of Centretown, a good carpenter has agreed to build new ones and put in cement foundations for $10.00 each, out of all new material. The material including hauling the gravel would cost around $55.00.\n\nHe says he could build them this fall if you wish.\n\nWe could use some lumber of the old ones but believe we can sell them for more as they are than it would save to wreck them. I have arranged to have the plaster repaired, and have ordered the new chair.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.\nAsst. Deputy and Sec.\nDept. of Ind Affairs.\n\n[Signature]\n\nInd. Agent.\nOttawa, November 19, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, relative to the erection of two new closets at the Alnwick Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that you may arrange to have two new closets erected on a cement foundation, using all new material. It is noted that the material, including the hauling of the gravel required, will cost approximately $55. You should see that these closets are erected on a suitable site at a convenient distance from the school building. You should also see that a satisfactory job is completed and that screened approaches are provided. There should be a good lock placed on each door, the key of which should be kept under the teacher's charge. The Department will expect you to see that a satisfactory job is completed in erecting these closets, which should be carried out at the lowest possible cost. After the work of building the new closets is completed, which it is noted can be carried out this Fall, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYou may use your own discretion as to whether any of the lumber from the old closets is used to erect the new ones, or you can arrange for the sale of the old closets. If so, you should forward the amount received to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. J.

Will I hire a man to do this work or is it the duty of the Sexton? Kindly advise me along these lines.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. O. Grievs\nAgt.\nOttawa, July 21, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, regarding the cleaning of the interior of the school and closets at the Alnwick Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the janitor should be responsible for the scrubbing and ordinary cleaning of the classroom. Should, however, the woodwork require washing, you may engage the services of an Indian woman to do the work, and you should see that the job is satisfactorily completed.\n\nIf there is any extra work in the cleaning of the closets and placing them in a good, sanitary condition, the Department will approve of you arranging with a competent Indian to do the work. It is considered, however, that the ordinary work in keeping the closets clean should be carried out by the janitor as part of his regular duties.\n\nIf any extra cleaning is required to either the classroom or closets, you should forward itemized accounts, in duplicate, covering the cost. These accounts should give full particulars as to the time employed by the person who does the work and the rate paid per hour or per day. No unnecessary expense should be incurred, and you should see that the work is completed before the school reopens after the present summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. O. Grieve, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRoseneath, Ont.\nOttawa, August 25, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nI visited the Alnwick Agency on the 18th and 19th instant for the purpose of making a general inspection of the agency work and to instruct and assist Mr. Grieve, recently appointed Agent, as found necessary.\n\nThe school buildings are in very fair condition. The metal roof is beginning to show signs of rusting. If this is not checked at once it will deteriorate rapidly. There is a special preparation to be had to prevent rusting. The cost is not great and adds years to the life of the metal. I would recommend that the roof be treated this season if possible. The front porch needs a new post and the archway over the entrance should be pointed and a few bricks replaced.\n\nThos. McGookin,\nInspector.\nOttawa, August 29, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nIn a recent report on the Alnwick Indian Day School, Inspector McGookin states that the metal roofing is beginning to show signs of rusting. He also advises that this can be checked by the use of a special preparation. Please let me know what it would cost to have this roof treated with the preparation mentioned by the Inspector.\n\nIt is also reported that the front porch needs a new post and that the archway over the entrance should be pointed and a few bricks replaced. You may have these minor repairs attended to as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. O.

That is putting a new post in the porch which has rotted off, and new brick in the archway over the main door, and a portion of caving which has given way, and putting the preparation on the roof which will be quite a difficult job owing to the height of the building. Personally I think his estimates are very reasonable.\n\nThat includes material and all.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ. O. Grieve\n\nIndian Affairs.

I may add that in addition to the work done on the Hall, we noticed some quite bad places at the base of the spire on the Church and as we had a little of the preparation left I had it put on those places which will protect it for some time yet. It may appear as though 50 cents per hour for laborers was middling high for these times, but owing to the height of the building, it was comparatively dangerous work and he could not get any one to go up for any less, but he done a firstclass job, and guarantees the roof for ten years.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is lined inside leaving an inch of air space which enables the water to remain cool for a longer period.

G. Griffith, the well-known designer of Chemical Toilet Systems, has this year designed his greatest product and brings this to you at a price that now makes it possible for every school board to have a proper\u2014decent\u2014sanitary system installed in their school.\n\nYou will find patented improvements in the new \"T-G\" Toilet that cannot be found or produced in any other toilet\u2014improvements which are the result of twenty years in building toilet equipment for schools. The result\u2014a perfect system\u2014one that you may well be proud of when installed and one that will protect your pupils through the years to come.\n\nCost of equipment\u2014cost of installation\u2014cost of upkeep\u2014all these have kept many school boards from installing sanitation in their schools. Now you need no longer hesitate\u2014your opportunity has arrived to give the pupils of your school this long needed necessity and improvement. You cannot afford to wait longer.\n\nLarger Capacity\u2014Easily Installed Absolutely Sanitary and Odorless\n\nThe \"T-G\" De Luxe Chemical Toilet is so designed and perfected that it may be installed inside any school building the same as a regular water flush system. The principles of this system are worked out on engineering ideas of ventilation and sterilization. The tank is easily placed beneath the floor line. Immediately above this is placed the bowl. The sewage drops directly into the tank, where it comes in contact with the chemical. The chemical dissolves all sewage wastes into liquid form. All odors are drawn off by the system of ventilation pipes.\n\nNote the beautiful vitreous china bowl and fittings. Ventilation pipes may be nickel plated or enamelled as desired. The patented agitator may be withdrawn from the tank very easily\u2014large drainage facilities. The galvanized and ribbed construction embodied in the tank gives guaranteed satisfaction and protects against corrosion and wearing out.\n\nREMEMBER THIS SYSTEM MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF ALL HEALTH AUTHORITIES AND LEADING EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS.\n\nWherever our new designs have been shown to engineers and health authorities and school inspectors, the improvements shown over other types of toilets on the market have been loudly praised and recommended.\n\nWe guarantee our Galvanized \"T-G\" De Luxe Chemical Toilet Equipment for a period of twenty-five years. This is a completely Made in Canada Product.\n\nMAIL THE ENCLOSED POST-PAID RETURN CARD\n\nThe \"T-G\" ENGINEERING SALES COMPANY\n\nWater Supply and Sewage Disposal Equipment\n\nFOY BLDG.\u201432 FRONT STREET WEST \u2022 TORONTO\nBacked by Twenty Years' Experience\n\nThe \"T-G\" Engineering Sales Company has been organized by Mr. T. G. Griffith, who has marketed his different sewage disposal equipments to school boards for the past twenty years. Associated with Mr. Griffith are his engineers who have made this particular work their special study, and therefore it is only natural that they should be able to build into the new \"T-G\" De Luxe Chemical Toilet equipment improvements that will overcome many troubles that have been experienced in the past. These engineers are at your service and we offer you our fullest support in trying to solve your problem\u2014and this, of course, without any expense to your board whatever.\n\nDo You Know how little it will cost to install modern SANITARY CONVENIENCES in Your School?\nDecember 6, 1932\n\nSuperintendent Department of Indian Affairs,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe have just completed two contracts at Roseneath, Ontario, which we believe will be of interest to your Department in view of the fact that it is connected with the installation of our \"T-G\" Chemical Toilet equipment at that point.\n\nYour Department also has an Indian school at Roseneath which is under the inspection of Mr. J.W. O'Dell of Cobourg, Ontario. Mr. O'Dell is very pleased indeed with the work that we have done at Roseneath and is quite in sympathy with the installation of these toilets in the Indian School and we are therefore taking the liberty of writing you in this connection.\n\nEnclosed you will find one of our folders describing this particular equipment and if your Department would be interested, we would be very glad indeed to have one of our representatives go down to Ottawa to describe complete details to you.\n\nAt the present time, we have a winter campaign on with the schools of Ontario where these schools are within reasonable distance of Toronto. This proposition embodies the complete installation of two equipments in any rural school for the sum of Two Hundred Dollars. This may be of interest to your Department, as the regular governing the installation of this same material generally averages around $275 to $300.\n\nWe sincerely trust that our information will be of interest to you and that you will make inquiries through Inspector O'Dell at Cobourg in regard to our work.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I daresay there will be a little more wood used this winter than usual, owing to the cold weather that prevailed so early in the season, making it a long winter, and will naturally take more fuel, but the furnace is giving good satisfaction, and in my opinion, would be a very foolish move, to discard it for a stove.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa,\n\nIndian Affairs.
