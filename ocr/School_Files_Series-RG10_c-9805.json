However, in such cases principals are expected to advise the Indian Agent what amount they consider could be required to cover travelling expenses and the Agent in turn applies to the Department. We can then decide the amount that we can allow.\n\nWe are only allowed a limited amount for the transportation of pupils to and from residential schools and consequently we try to deal fairly with all schools by keeping the expenditure to the lowest possible point.\n\n......2\nYou will note in the circular letter issued this week regarding Christmas holidays that the Department is not assuming any of the travelling expenses of the pupils.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(sgd) Bernard F.

If you will review that letter again, you will note that the Principal of a residential school is expected to advise the Indian Superintendent regarding the amount that will be required, and he in turn will apply to this Department. We will then be in a position to decide what amount we can allow.\n\nIn view of the above, I suggest that the Principal of the St. Albin's School confer with Superintendent Jones.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nPP/ST\nSupt. of Indian Education\n19th May, 1949.\n\nMr. E.S. Jones,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nPrince Albert, Saskatchewan.\n\nWe have recently received a request from Canon Cook, Superintendent of the M.S.C.C., for an amount of $375.00, the estimated cost of transporting children from St. Alban's Residential School to their homes at the end of the present term. Canon Cook does not state whether the above amount covers their transportation home and also the return of the pupils to school after the summer holidays.\n\nIn requesting the above amount Canon Cook refers to a letter from the Department dated October 30th, 1947, a copy of which is attached for your information. In replying to Canon Cook we have suggested to him that the Principal of St. Alban's follow the procedure outlined in the fourth paragraph of official letter of October 30th, 1947, by consulting you.\n\nMay I direct your attention to the fact that the amount provided for travelling expenses is limited, and as we try to deal fairly with all residential schools, we must be very careful deciding what amount we can allow to each one of them.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6323, file 658-10, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIt has always been understood that the Principal should communicate with the Superintendent concerned before sending children home for holidays, with a view to determining if home conditions are suitable. If not, the children have to remain at the school during the holiday period. In the case of those going home, it is also expected that both the Principal of the school and the Indian Superintendent will encourage the parents to show sufficient interest in their children to arrange for their transportation home and also their transportation back to the school in September, without cost to the Department.\n\nWhen the Principal confers with you, please write to us again.\n\nBernard E.

Both parents although they would like to have the child at home requested that she be admitted to Residential School.\n\nThe Bear children do not belong to this Agency, but live at The Pas and both parents are very shiftless, the father being more or less of a drunkard and the mother moving from house to house wherever she can obtain shelter. Dr. Yule claimed that both these children were under-nourished due to home conditions and recommended that I have them admitted to Residential School where they would have institutional care.\n\nWould you kindly advise if these applications will now be approved by the Department.\n\nE.

Would you like the date of admission (and of discharge also) included on future copies of the Quarterly Returns?

Most of these are girls and so will go to St. Albans which are still short in numbers. It is very difficult to get children for St. Albans when they are limited by sex and grade. Also many parents and agents request that families be kept together if at all possible. A number of new children from Punnichy were grade 5 so only four of the 17 went to St. Albans. There are still new children at Montcalm Lake and Battleford Reserves which could be brought in. If all the children from Red Earth come in St. Albans should have their quota.\"\n\nThe 17 children noted above as from Punnichy are NOT from Gordon's Reserve but from Moscow, Poormans, Day Star and Fishing Lake who were sent to Prince Albert after consultation with you on 13th September, 1950.\n\nThe points raised about the difficulty in allocating children to St. Albans' (Onion Lake) by sex and age when Agents and parents wish families to be kept together seem to warrant consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry G.

Davis, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of\nIndian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nRe: Application; Admission\nIndian Residential Schools\n\nWith reference to the above subject. Some time ago I was informed that children had been admitted to All Saints Indian Residential School at Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, from this Agency, without the necessary authority having been received from Ottawa.\n\nUpon writing the Principal, Rev. A.J. Serase (copy of letter attached) I received a reply (copy also attached) enclosing three application for admission forms covering the three unauthorized admissions.\n\nIn view of the fact that the children are now at the school and it would not be to the benefit of the children concerned, to move them in the middle of a term, I have signed the application forms. The forms are enclosed and I am leaving it to your decision whether to forward them to Ottawa, or not.\n\nAs you are no doubt aware the practice of admitting the children first and applying for authority after, has been rampant at various schools in the past even though it is against Department Regulations.\n\nMay I suggest a circular letter be sent to all Principals of Residential Schools pointing out the practice is against Regulations.\n\nJ.H. Stanton,\nSupt. Indian Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Application; Admission\nIndian Residential Schools\n\nCopy of a letter dated February 8th, 1951 received from Superintendent J.H. Staunton of Dauphin which is self-explanatory is being attached hereto. It is noted that the children are already in the school and under the circumstances, it is considered advisable not to have them transferred at this time.\n\nI am in agreement with Superintendent Staunton's suggestion to remind all principals that it is contrary to regulations to accept these children without first submitting an application to the Department for approval.\n\nR.

Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDecember 2, 1926.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nMr. Indian Agent Turner has forwarded to Mr. Commissioner Graham a request from the Principal of the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School. It is represented that 15 milch cows are required. It appears that the 8 they have on hand should be slaughtered as they are too old for milking purposes.\n\nMr. Commissioner Graham recommends that none be supplied. But we have helped nearly all the other Indian residential schools in the Prairies in the matter of stock. I wish to suggest that we supply five (5) head, on condition that the school management secure an equal number.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, December 3, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 309-11A C. E. of the 17th ultimo, with reference to a request that we supply the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School with milch cows. The Department will grant five suitable animals, provided that the school management purchase a like number. It is understood that replacements will have to be made by the school. Please make the necessary arrangements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMr. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, December 3, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nMr. Commissioner Graham reports that the Rev. Principal of the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School has requested the Department to supply some milch cows. It appears that the eight animals which the school at present possesses are too old for satisfactory service as milch cows. Mr. Commissioner Graham has been authorized to purchase five suitable animals, provided that the school management or the church authorities secure a like number.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

I have just received a letter from the Reverend T.B.R. Westgate stating that the Society's expenditures have been very heavy and asking if the Department would come to their assistance and undertake to buy eight milk cows without imposing any conditions on the Church authorities.\n\nWill you please advise me so that the children of the School may be assured of an adequate supply of milk.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 21st, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 309-11A C.E. of the 14th instant, relative to the purchase of a number of milch cows for use at the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School. In this connection it is noted that the Church authorities will be unable to supply any milch cows owing to lack of funds, and request that this Department purchase 5 cows for the use of the school.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase and delivery at the school of 5 milch cows of a type considered by you to be suitable for the purpose for which they are required. You should see that they are free from tuberculosis and are satisfactory in all respects. This matter will be left in your hands to make the purchase as advantageously as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nInspector Murison also enquired as to whether we could purchase suitable Holsteins and I understand that suitable/grade Holstein cows can be bought for about $100.00 each, probably less. I am writing to the Agent to tell him that he may buy eight at a price not exceeding $800.00. I may say that Inspector Murison saw one or two animals belonging to a small herd which is for sale, comprising ten females and one pure-bred bull, at a price of $775.00. As Inspector Murison thinks this would be a good purchase, I have told the Agent that if, after he has inspected the whole herd, he is of the opinion that it would be advisable to make the purchase, he may do so.

(RG 10, Volume 6324, file 658-14, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI would particularly draw your attention to that portion of the report in which it is pointed out that the milk supply is inadequate. I would say that it is very inadequate. I do not think this matter should be passed over lightly.\n\nThe Inspector points out that they have 30 head of cattle and that the stable only contains 21 stalls. This is true, but if they had the right kind of cattle, as it was intended they should have when the buildings were erected, 21 stalls would have provided ample for the cows. The trouble here is that they have the wrong type of cattle, probably not milking strain.\n\nTheir stock consists of 15 milk cows, 1 bull and 11 young stock. There are only 5 cows milking during the winter. In February, according to the record, these cows produced 2,810 lbs., which is equal to 221 gals. This is a very inadequate supply and it can readily be seen that they cannot provide the children with milk to drink. With the Principal's family and staff, there is an average of 115 persons to provide for.\n\nIf the stock are to be increased at this school, it will be necessary to increase the housing accommodation for cattle. They now have 30 head of cattle and there are 21 stalls in the barn.\nbinder for use at Onion Lake. However, there this year, I saw for them seemed urgent difficulty in borrowing a crop they might have. Subsequently placing orders for other binders, or difficulties Agencies, an order for one for this school was placed. It has transpired, however, that prior to my advising the Indian Agent that delivery should be taken of it at Livelyminister, the Principal of the school bought one, stating that they did their best to borrow an implement, but could not get one, and as their wheat was shelling out, they were obliged to buy one. They hope the Department will approve and pay the account. The binder which I had ordered for them was from the Massey-Harris Co. at a price of $250.91. The one the school authorities purchased was from a local dealer, at a price of $279.00.\n\nUnder the circumstances, perhaps the Department will agree to pay the account, although I strongly deprecate Principals of schools making purchases without authority and then requesting the Department to meet the payments. This is a practice which is not uncommon and yet seems difficult to check.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nW. M.

In this connection I have to say that all replacements to stock and agricultural machinery at Indian residential schools should be provided by the school authorities from per capita earnings or other receipts. The Department therefore regrets that it will be unable to provide any part of the cost in the exchanging of the old cows for younger stock at the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School.

The only thing to be regretted is that the Boarding School is not to be for a larger number of children.\n\nYou can see by our Quarterly Reports that our school is regularly attended by from 40 to 45 pupils: Out of this number 20 are admitted.\nadmitted to the Boarding school: What is to become of the others if no steps are taken to attract them to the school? With this end in view, we are convinced that you will not refuse to do as you did last year, and as has been promised by Mr Reed; --- continue the ration as for all the children we can admit as Boarders, over and above the 20 authorized for the Boarding School; and also furnish dinner to those who attend the Day School. In this way, it seems, that we could secure from all the children of the Reserve, the inestimable advantage of regular attendance at the school.\n\nI am quite confident you will take our request into your favourable consideration without delay.\n\nIn this pleasant expectation,\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nMr Commissioner\n\nYour very humble and very grateful\n\nSister Saint Ignace\n\nSuperioress\nThe East Indian Agent\nRegina\n\nJuly 21st 1894\n\nSir,\n\nI have to ack the receipt of a copy of a translation of a letter from the Superintendent of the Mission of the Assumption Church Lake and am obliged to say that the Department will in addition to the grant for 30 pupils allow teachers for any additional boarders in attendance at the Boarding School Onondaga for the winter term but cannot make any promise to be given in accordance with the scale already agreed upon for other institutions. Would advise what it is as the Deputy has said.\n\nN.M.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Departmental letter of the 21st instant stating that for all pupils of the Onion Lake Boarding School, in excess of 20 authorized earners of the $72 grant, rations will be given up to 20 pupils in accordance with a scale, said to have been sent here.\n\nWhat the Department's mention of a scale has reference to, is not understood, unless it be the instructions given in the second paragraph of a memorandum sent under cover of its letter of the 3rd April last (on 212) reading as follows:\n\n\"Apart from which (that is a money grant for a certain number of children at the North Blackfoot, South Blackfoot, Blood, Sarcee and Piegan Boarding schools) the ordinary rations of beef and flour, and possibly tea and rice will be given, if at all possible, for the extra number of children up to which the building will accommodate.\"\n\nThe ration to which the Sister Superior had reference\n\nThe Deputy of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\nreference and which she desired to be continued to the boarders who are non-earners of the $72 grant, was one authorized on the 1st April 1893 (on 61) being a per capita allowance per diem of 1 lb flour, 3 to 4 ozs. beef, 1 lb biscuit and a little soap, besides an annual allowance per pupil of 10 lbs rice; biscuit and rice only being given to any day pupils, that is those not clothed or lodged at the school, but come for tuition and go home after school hours.\n\nWill the department kindly say which of these two allowances should be followed.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst Commissioner\nAugust 6th 1894\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 3rd ultimo with reference to the matter to be allowed to the pupils at the Owen Lake Boarding School who are in excess of the number for whom the new Cap Grant of $72 was allowed and respectfully beg to say that the statement given in the last paragraph of your letter is the one which these pupils should be allowed.\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6324, file 659-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nTo Mr. Hayter Reid\n\nThe late letters of Union Lake boarding school having arrived I am obliged to forward to your inspection to the effect of raising the number of children entitled to receive a special grant of twenty-two dollars a year, increased from twenty to forty. I hope the study of adding to their petition, the following remarks which I hope will not be unworthy of your generous attention.\n\nWhile we fully appreciate the generous efforts made by the Indian Department and fully realize the spirit of liberality which animates the government and the head of the said department in order to secure for the Indian children the benefit of a sound education, we at the same time feel the obligation of representing to your consideration the necessity of increasing the number of the children on the list of boarders, and the hope of the Indian Department in establishing boarding schools may not be purchased.\n\nHere at Ossipee Lake twenty-three children attend the school & quarters and out of this number twenty only receive a special grant of twenty-two dollars from the government, while fifteen, even in all, receive only the meager though they are careful by the Board Letters as the other boarders. The latter are willing to do as much, but cannot do more. However, if an attempt is made that had the proper means at their disposal, they could have from twenty to twenty-five children beside those already mentioned on the list. However, but on account of their financial inability, they are bound to remain the inmates of children, and therefore many are deprived of this only avenue of getting educated and to receive a good education.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6324, file 659-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe gentlemen at the head of the Indian Department are well aware of the fact that one of the most successful factors in bringing about the civilization of the Indians is the school well conducted and well attended. With this fact in view, many efforts have been made by those in charge of the Indian affairs in order to secure for the children the benefit of a good education. Day schools have been established throughout the reserves to aid the purpose, a peak around every corner, and many have been put in by those who are more or less interested in the solution of the great problem of the civilization of the Indians. But unfortunately difficulties unforeseen have proved the day schools to be a dismal failure.\n\nTo the honor, let it be said, of those gentlemen who preside at the management of Indian affairs, a new plan which seems to justify the most sanguine hopes of the educated parties has been devised and already put in execution. Boarding schools entrusted to the intelligent and generous care of those well qualified for the purpose have taken the place of day schools, and I may say, so far as I am able to judge, the boarding schools do concern, having my impression in what I have seen and on the unprejudiced reports, boarding schools have been a success so far. Through the new system difficulties which hitherto have baffled the intelligence of the Indian Department and teachers alike have been overcome. The natural aptitude of the Indians (speaking of Ojibwa reserve) for the education of their children has been awakened to a certain extent, and a strong desire of having their children brought up under the civilized care of the sisters has been raised, so much that at the present time the Red Sisters are confronted with the task necessity of requiring a great number of children as boarders on account of their lack of resources, and consequently we are unable to favor the development of this new spirit amongst the Indians and thereby depriving many of the benefits of a good education.\n\nOne who is not fully cognizant with the real facts might make this observation, namely: That the children...\nThe children who cannot be taken as boarders may attend day-school and thereby receive a certain education.\n\nTo this, allow me to say further the same reasons which have caused the day-schools to be a failure in some cases. Moreover, experience compels me to state that the idea of having boarding schools attended by dayschool children is pretty near next to the impossible. Dayschool children, most of whom poorly clad and poorly fed, are not able to sustain the difference existing between them and those of the boarding school better clad and carpeted, and the perception of their inferiority causes them to be more than ever against their attending the school. While they would get happy to attend the school as boarders, they show the idea of attending the school as dayschool children. Therefore, unless the Indians take these children under their personal expense, they would remain ignorant, that is, savage as ever.\n\nBut, as I say in the beginning of my letter, the Board dealers are utterly incapable to take care of these children and treat them as boarders, unless the Indian Department extending the measure of its liberality, grant their petition and allow them to take forty instead of twenty.\n\nWe occupy the number 47, because we are obliged to do so; but we could get more than that if we were in a position to do so.\n\nI am sincerely convinced that you are also well aware of our strong desire to secure the education of the Indians' children and that we are ready to expend upon no personal sacrifice in time and money to a great extent, but presently it is impossible for the Board Dealers to do more unless the government come to their assistance.\n\nYou are also well aware of the position of Orono Lake, the difficulties of communication, the cost of transport &c., and for all the reasons above mentioned, and encouraged by our Agent Mr.\nMr. Mann whose untiring efforts for the promotion of the temporal welfare of the Indians cannot be too much appreciated. I take the liberty in behalf of the Red Sisters to ask a favorable answer to their petition, assuring you before hand of any heartfelt gratitude.\n\nI remain\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Not only from you but from others of all denominations throughout British Columbia and the North West Territories are we in receipt of similar applications; and the Department fears it will be unable to meet many of the demands; but the application of the good and Rev. Sisters will be seriously considered during the making up of the coming Estimates.

I may, however, state that the Chippewa Day School on account of its inefficiency has been closed for an indefinite period, at least until next July, and as these Indians are quite open to civilizing methods, and as it would be injudicious to discourage them when seeking to hand over their children to the School authorities at Onion Lake, I beg to ask that the appropriation for the Day School be utilized by allowing the Boarding School to receive five additional boarders.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nCommissioner.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, 27/8/1896\n\nI do not see that the 1st provide for Chipewyan Day School - no such school was established for Onion Lake Agency.\n\nJWP\n\nMEMO\n\nMr. Pallet,\n\nIs there any objection to the money saved by closing the Chipewyan day being applied to the maintenance of five children from Beaver River at the Dubre Labre R.C.

McLean\n\nSecretary\n\nA.H. Forget, Esq.\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, in regard to attributing the grant of the Beaver River Day School towards increasing the number of boarders at the Roman Catholic Boarding School at Onion Lake.\n\nPursuant to the Department's letter of the 16th October, 1895, No. 132896, the Estimates for 1897-98 did not provide for a day School but contained a sum for increasing the number of boarders at Onion Lake instead. The parties concerned were not however, informed of this fact, and the day school was kept open up to the end of last fiscal year, and the grant was presumably paid by the Department. In making this year's Estimates the increased number of boarders at Onion Lake was not provided for in the belief that the School would not be able to receive more than 40 pupils, but I was under the impression till the receipt of your letter that provision had been made for the Chippewyan Day School. This is unfortunate, and something requires to be done, and with this end in view, I would recommend that the appropriation for the Day School at Meadow Lake, which has also been closed for the year, be applied to the maintenance of additional boarders taken from the Chippewyan Indians in the Onion Lake Boarding School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Affairs.

At present the per capita grant at the boarding school in question provides for 50 pupils, and according to the last return received there are only 45 on the roll. The Department thought proper to cut down the grant for the present year from 60 to 50 pupils, and it does not see sufficient reason why it should now provide for a greater number.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Forget, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nMemorandum respectfully submitted to the Indian Department by Bishop Legal, Conductor of St. Albert\u2014Alberta, N.W.T.\n\nThe following grants are recommended for insertion in the Estimates:\n\n1) A grant of $1200.00 for additional buildings at Onion Lake's Boarding School. There is not sufficient accommodation there for the number of pupils admitted.\n\n2) A grant of $1200.00 to help covering the expenses of the building at Blackfoot Crossing. \u2014 Another grant of $2160.00 to support 30 more additional pupils. There are only 10 authorized, which is much too small a number for this large Reserve. \u2014 As to the actual cost of the buildings, it is as follows:\n\n   \"Amount of Vouchers sent to the Ind. Dep. $2519.37\n   \"Paid by me $811.94\n   \"Still due on the buildings $1205.11\n\nAnd we will here to buy what is necessary to furnish the house.\n\n3) A grant of $1200.00 to help covering the expenses of the buildings at the Blood Reserve. This amount is still due.\n\n4) A grant of $1440.00 for 20 more additional pupils at the Sagen Reserve Cattle Boarding School. This was admitted last year 25 pupils, during the whole year, with the consent of the Department, which however, refused to pay Canada forward $7200.\nfor more than 20 pupils. We were made to understand then that 40 would likely be the number of children approved for this year; and instead, the former number of 20 has been left to stand. By treaty the Government has assumed the duty to provide instruction for all the Indian children.\n\n5) A grant of $250.00 for a Boarding school at Cold Lake. Children of this place cannot be taken at Onion Lake. Total $700.00\n\nThe missionary on the Blood Reserve has some complaints on various subjects connected with the schools:\n\n1) The written promise of Parents for the admission of their children in our school, has been disregarded in some instances.\n\n2) The same rule is not observed by the Indian agent regarding to the half-breed children actually at the charge of the Indian Department.\n\n3) The rule about school age should not be too strictly enforced, when parents are consenting to give away children only 4 or 5 years old.\n\nIt would be advisable to ascertain the well founded of these complaints.\n\nRespectfully submitted to the Consideration of the General Superintendent of Indian Affairs.\n\n+ Emile J.

Having not then the opportunity to see you there personally, as, at the time, you were absent in the West, I propose to you briefly the various points to which I wanted to draw your particular attention.\n\nThere are, amongst the rest, two items on which I want to give some special explanation. I have asked for a grant of $1,200.00 to help covering the expenses of building the Boarding School at the Blood Reserve, and for another sum of $1,200.00 to help also covering the expenses of the building for a Boarding school at the Blackfoot Reserve.\n\nIf we had limited ourselves to the sum allowed, at first, by the Department, for both places, we would have put up only insignificant buildings, altogether unsuitable for the purpose in view, & we would have had to ask from year to year, for additional sums in order to make the necessary enlargements. You would have cost a great deal without making even then a decent building. By completing the whole building, in its main component parts at least, I am sure that we have made a very substantial saving, for the Department.\nWe have gone into large expenses, besides over the Government grant, that we have paid already; but there still about $1200.00 due on each building for lumber taken at Peter McLennan MacLeod, for the Blood School, & at the Canclaire Co., Calgary, for the Blackfoot Crossing School, & these companies, of course, are anxious to be paid, as soon as possible, for the material supplied.\n\nI hope that your Department will be willing to pay this debt of $1200.00 on each of these buildings, & in such case we would put no application for the purpose of securing back the other sums paid by us.\n\nWithout prejudice to the other items contained in my memo, I am confident that these, & for the reasons & have just exposed, will be satisfactorily settled.\n\nI have the honour to remain,\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nYour very respectful & obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCounty of St Albert\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mission for diphtheria, and had wired the department reporting the outbreak and asking for antitoxine.\n\nIt appears that on the 12th instant Dr. Matheson's services were called by a settler named Huntly, who lives with his family on his farm abutting the south boundary of the reserve, and there, she reports, she found a case of diphtheria, and on the 13th quarantined the place. On the 14th she visited the Indian houses in the neighbourhood but found no symptoms of the disease. On her return home that evening she found that one of the settlers, who had two children at the R.C. Boarding School, wanted her to go to the school, as one of his children had died and the other one was sick. On going to the school, she reports, she found two cases of diphtheria which she treated, and the next day quarantined the whole Mission. On the 17th, the Rev. Principal wired to Dr. Amos of Lloydminster \"Diphtheria reported in our school can you come\" and Dr. Amos arrived the following evening. On the 18th, I returned to the agency with the Inspector, and, on hearing of the reported outbreak, was disappointed to find that Dr. Matheson had not communicated with Mr. Turner, agency clerk, whom\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6324, file 659-1, part 1)\nwhom I had left in charge and who is perfectly capable of attending to agency work.\n\nDr. Amos remained here until this morning, when he returned to Lloydminster, taking with him swab specimens from the throats of the patients, which he will send to be examined by the Provincial Government bacteriologist.\n\nI would point out that the Rev. Principal wired to Dr. Amos without consulting with the agency, at the same time I must remind you that Dr. Amos is the physician who has medical charge of the school.\n\nWith regard to the afflicted children\u2014\nI may say that Dr. Amos does not think that the disease is diphtheria, I therefore thought it better to wire the department today as follows.\n\n\"Reference Dr. Matheson's telegram, Dr. Amos here two days, cases uncertain. Everything necessary being done, writing.\"\n\nIf it is found necessary Dr. Amos will return on the 22nd or 23rd, and if any more antitoxin is required he will bring it with him.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nContract for this School forwarded to Rt. Rev. E.J. Legal and D.D. for signature on March 17, 1911.\n\nSee File 118153.\n\n[Signature]\nDear Sir,\n\nI am glad to hear that the outbreak in Philadelphia, about which I telegraphed you during the absence of your Agent, has so far been confined to the two houses in which it first appeared... That is a matter near the North East corner of the Reserve but in Alberta, and in the Roman Catholic School. It was looked by the Health Commissioner in each Province to maximize or possible prevent any spread of the disease.\n\nI did so at once to have had every assistance from the Mounted Police. The children attacked in the School were treated, and was specially requested by the parents to attend them. The\nSisters did not wish me to see any of the other children in the school except those whose parents had called me in. I told Dr. Davis was their house doctor. A few days later a couple of Indians came with sick children who were sent for by the Priest. He came and went into the quarantine without a word to me. I took swabs from the throats of my patients to send down for examination saying that if it was Diphtheria it was very mild. He did not see my patients until they were over the worst but as one patient had died before I was notified another was very seriously ill. I thought it severe enough to insist on maintaining the quarantine. He also disinfected the Priest's house & church all inside my quarantine & left it with the Priest to ask me to release them from quarantine when sickness & about this by your effect he (Dr. Davis) admitted that he had gone.\nSo far but made no apology to me and returned to Cordovalet. I allowed his conduct & was surprised he was, as the Indians gave him a residence and asked by your Department to attend their school in cases of sickness. But I did not see how he could do this while the school was quarantined unless he became a resident in it. Puzzled what to do and anxious to know how to proceed in the matter and whom you wished to attend the Indian children I telegraphed your Department. I knew Indians attended the Indians on the Reserve but thought you might have appointed Dr. Reeves for that school\u2014let your answer from simply authorized me to procure authority if required so I inferred I was also to attend the children\u2014Since his return your Agent informed me that Dr. Reeves had not been appointed & I was very glad for it.\nI am not sure what the text says, but it appears to be a handwritten note or letter. It seems to contain paragraphs of text, possibly discussing a topic in detail. The handwriting is quite faded and difficult to read, but there are some visible words and phrases that might give context to the content.\nI am going to hold the quarantine in the school as ordered but I would be glad to hear from you and to know just what you expect of me and also what work it was supposed to do in the reserve or in the school. I don't mind hard work indeed I enjoy it but I do not like working in the dark.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nE.B. [signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6324, file 659-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to refer to my letter of even number dated 20th Feb., and to report that an examination of the swabs proved that diphtheria existed.\n\nThe sickness was of a very mild type and the children have all recovered.\n\nThere were four cases viz. Hazel Reinhart, Rose Marie Tremblay, Alice Nolin and Nancy House. The first two are white children and the last two half-breed children for which four no grant is allowed by the Department. George Beaudry and Pierre Horse pupils Nos. 54 and 64 for whom department grant is allowed were suspects but diphtheria did not develop.\n\nDr. made four trips from Lloydminster and will probably have to make another to see that quarantine can be safely raised.\n\nOn March 14th, quarantine was raised on the principal parts of the school buildings, after being disinfected, and one suspect was kept in a separate building under quarantine but the child has not developed diphtheria.\n\nDr. Matheson has been visiting the school as well as Dr. Amos having been asked to do so by the father of one of the white children.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, March 29, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased to learn that the outbreak of diphtheria at the Onion Lake (R.C.)

Sibbald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI regret to inform you that one of the pupils at the R.C. School is laid up with typhoid fever. It was reported to me by the principal on 11th instant that one of the girls was sick, with a request that the doctor be sent for. I went to the mission and with the reverend father saw the child; her temperature was 103 and she seemed seriously ill. We both thought it advisable to wire to Lloydminster for the doctor, and next morning Dr. Amos' partner, Dr. Graham arrived, saw the child twice and prescribed and the next morning she was much better. The doctor mentioned that some of the symptoms pointed to typhoid but he could not decide positively; he left instructions with the reverend sisters, and submitted a specimen of the blood to Edmonton for examination. Today I received a message from Dr. Amos stating that the report is \"Typhoid positive\" and that he will be out to arrange protection of other children.\n\nThe patient is Veronique Blackman, No.060, for whom a government grant is allowed, but she is non-treaty and is a halfbreed; it is the first case of typhoid fever I have ever heard of on an Indian reserve.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 25, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department regrets to learn of the presence of a case of typhoid at the Onion Lake (R.C.)

Boarding School at this agency, informing me that Agnes and Marie Peche, pupils Nos. 094 and 096 respectively, paid on ticket No. 64 of Chipewyan band No. 149, were very sick, and asking when the doctor was expected to pay a visit.\n\nAs the quarterly medical visit by Dr. Hill was due I wrote telling him of the school children's sickness and asking him to arrange his visit at as early a date as possible. However, on 22nd instant, before allowing time for a reply to my letter from Dr. Hill, I received another letter from the school, stating that the sisters there were becoming alarmed at the illness of the two children and asking me to telegraph for Dr. Hill, which I did.\n\nIn answer to my telegram Dr. Hill arrived on the evening of yesterday the 23rd instant, and left again for Lloydminster this morning. He pronounced the eldest girl, Agnes, to be suffering from heart trouble, and the youngest one to be in rather an advanced stage of tuberculosis. He prescribed treatment for each of the children, which, in the case of the tubercular one, included isolation from the other children.\n\nI have not yet received the doctor's report on this visit.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nAllow me to ask the sanction of the Indian Department for the appointment of Rev.

Boarding School,\nOnion Lake, May 26, 1926.\n\nTo the Secretary of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nHon. Sir:\n\nI beg to draw your attention to the arduous problem we are confronted with in the successful management of our Boarding School namely:\n\nThe ever increasing cost of living, and as a result; the inefficiency of the actual per Capita school grant as an adequate means to give our children committed to our care, the rational and healthy comfort they are entitled to.\n\nI will learn you nothing when I make you aware of the fact that the high cost of living is becoming a very serious proposition for such an institution as ours.\n\nA return to the pre-war state of things is not to be dreamed of, as prices for everything are still soaring and the top has not been reached yet.\n\nTherefore I feel it my duty bound to apprise you of the strenuous difficulties we are against in carrying out the Department's regulations concerning the boarding and the clothing of the children under our care.\n\nHitherto it has been a matter of great concern to us, to supply our children with what was considered the best in matter of food and clothing, as directed by the Dept., so much so, that both the local authority and the Indians were wont to make us known their entire satisfaction with the manner we were taking care of our wards.\n\nBut under the awful stress we have to carry on the work, I feel bound to inform you that henceforth, it would be impossible to keep up to our standard, unless...\nan increase in the per capita grant is allotted to us by\nthe Department, substantial enough to enable us to run\nour school without incurring an annual deficit.\n\nFor a long time we have been contemplating the idea of\nimproving the buildings so that our Boarding School\nmight share in the maximum grant given out to certain us\nto date schools under the supervision of the Department.\n\nBut unfortunately, the high cost for everything pertaining\nto the good maintenance of our school, our being at\na great distance from the nearest station, the scarcity\nof material in our surroundings and our financial string-\nency owing to an inadequate per capita grant, makes it\nimperative for us to postpone the intended improvements\ntill the situation comes back to its normal if it ever\ncomes.\n\nHowever, I may say, although, we have not all the up to\ndate conveniences and improvements existing in some other\ninstitutions better favored than ours, our school, never-\ntheless, offers our children all the necessary requisites required for their welfare.\n\nGood spacious rooms, well heated and well lighted and\na system of ventilation which affords fresh and pure air\nwhenever necessary, so much so, that in the long winter we\nare just coming through, we had no sickness to report, and\nright now our children are the very picture of health.\n\nOf course it would be a matter of great satisfaction\nto us, were we in a position to go through with the improve-\nments heretofore contemplated, but it is impossible under\nthe present circumstances, unless the Department sees its\nway through to give us a substantial bonus to begin with.\n\nSo far as the additional grant asked for, is concerned,\nI would kindly suggest and demand that a monthly per\ncapita grant of fifteen dollars instead of ten be gran-\nted. That additional grant being allowed to us, we feel\nAssure that we shall be in a position to give satisfaction as in the past, to all concerned.\n\nHoping that this request will receive your earliest attention and hearty approbation.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nYour obedient,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6324, file 659-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a letter received from The Rev: Father Therien, principal of the Onion Lake (R.C.) Boarding School, in which he makes application for an increased per capita allowance for the pupils.\n\nIt would be a great relief to both the Boarding Schools here, if the Department could increase the per capita allowance. Many instances come under my notice of difficulties experienced by these Schools in making ends meet with the present allowance, as instanced by the request of Mr H.Ellis, principal of the Onion Lake (C.of R.) School, for an advance of $300.00 on his quarterly per capita allowance; which request was transmitted to the Department in letter from this office dated 17th.instant, cf even number.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Boarding School, in which he applies for an increase in the per capita grant.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, owing to the appropriation for Indian Education being limited, the Department has no funds to increase the per capita grants. If any increase in grants were made, it would have to be general, as it would not be possible to make an increase in the case of the boarding schools at Onion Lake unless similar increases were made to the other residential schools.\n\nThe difficulties the residential schools have in meeting the demands, owing to the increased cost of supplies, etc., are fully understood, and the strictest economy should be exercised by the Principals in order to meet their obligations, as it is not possible, as stated above, to make any increase in the per capita allowance during the present fiscal year.\n\nIf it would be of any assistance to the Principal of the Roman Catholic Boarding School, the Department would be prepared to make an advance on the grant each quarter, upon receipt of a request from the Principal to that effect. You will be good enough to inform him accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Indian Residential School, I have to inform you that there appears to be no record of any request from the principal in this connection. Please advise him that the Department will give consideration to an increased pupilage, if he will arrange for the agent to forward us his recommendation. The three dimensions of each dormitory and classroom should be given.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Jos. Guy, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nOttawa, Ont.\nJanuary 10, 1927.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nIn an effort to determine the amount of accommodation which should be provided in the new Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School, I have studied the census returns for the reserves which can be considered in this institution's regular recruiting district. There are a total of approximately 154 Roman Catholic children of school age in the area in question. 126 of these children are on the Onion Lake, Keeheesin, Frog Lake and Iseland Lake reserves. Approximately 20 percent of these would be found physically unfit for residential school life. I, therefore, conclude that 100 children can be secured from these 4 reserves if a campaign is carried on with success. I might point out that over 50 of the 60 children at present enrolled in the school come from these reserves.\n\nThere is another group of Indians that must be considered in connection with the Onion Lake R. C. Indian School, - the Chipewyans, Gold Lake, etc., with a Roman Catholic school population of 37 - 30 of whom would likely be fit. The school, however, has not been popular with the Chipewyans, as there are but 2 enrolled at present, yet there is a potential population of about 25.\n\nThere are 20 Catholic children of school age belonging to the Meadow Lake Band, and the Onion Lake School is closest for them, but I find that they are all enrolled at Thunderchild.\n\nI consider that a pupilage of not more than 110 should be allowed. Mr. Orr states that the plans can be altered slightly to care for this number and that the estimate already prepared will not need any change.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\n\nIndian Affairs.

You can appreciate how painful it was for me to receive a telegram couched in this language. This is ample proof that Father Lacombe is quite out of place. The idea that the destruction of the Beauval school could ever be forgotten by me is an insinuation that really distresses me. I know that Rev. Father Boys has said that this Father Lacombe is only a locum-tenens. Why then does he sign these telegrams as \"Principal of St. Anthony's Residential School\"? I cannot think that Father Boys who has been so considerate in all our dealings together could fail to take a very serious view of these telegrams. I know what your opinion will be. As for the question regarding conduits, the contention is perfectly absurd. Flexible conduits are used in thousands of buildings in this city and elsewhere. If rigid conduits were placed in the Anglican School, it was only because the contractor wished to use them.

Harrier\nSupt. of Indian Education\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nIt was with very grave concern that we learned of the Department's refusal to pay the per capita allowance for the 110 pupils that this school was equipt for, or even the lesser number whose admission was authorized, and which we accepted in the belief that since the school was equipt for more, a formal application was unnecessary.\n\nWe therefore make application herewith, for the authorization of the number of pupils we have room for, namely, 110, and we ask that this number will be arranged for when the budget for this year is drawn up.\n\nIn addition, we ask that the per capita grant be raised to $170.00 per annum, as the distance from the railroad as well as other inconveniences here, it is very expensive for us, and in spite of the generous help we have had from the Dept., it is impossible for us to live within our income.\n\nWe are certainly appreciative of the co-operation of your Dept., and do not wish to seem otherwise through making these further requests. We simply deem it necessary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, March 26, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, with reference to the pupilage and the per capita grant at the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School. When our Estimates were made up, in December, the Department made provision for an appropriation for 90 pupils at your school at $165 per capita. I am pleased to inform you that arrangements have been made to make this effective from the first of January, and grant will be allowed for this quarter at the increased rate. I regret that it will not be possible to allow a pupilage of more than 90 at the present time. If you find that you are in a position to earn more than this number next Fall, you should write the Department, so that they will arrange for an increased appropriation for the fiscal year commencing April 1, 1930.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Therien, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nOnion Lake R. C. Residential School,\nLloydminster, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nThe Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School was recently inspected by Provincial School Inspector, Mr. D. L. Hicks, and he has this to say regarding Sister St. Aldegonde, who is one of the teachers on the staff at that institution,\n\n\"Sister St. Aldegonde in my opinion will never make a success of the teaching profession until her command of English improves. I can see very little improvement in the last year. I asked her three times for her register, and finally had to look for it myself as she could not understand my request. The following are a few of the expressions she used in my hearing:\u2014 \"How many years you have\", \"What is de word\". Her accent is so poor that even when she reads to the class I cannot always understand her. I fear that the pupils are making very little progress under her direction. I asked her what Saskatchewan certificate she held, and she said that she only had a certificate from Nicolet, Que. I feel that in the interests of this school some step should be taken to place a more capable teacher in this room.\"\n\nThe above is an extract from Inspector Hicks' report to the Dept. of Education, copy of which has been sent to me for the information of our Dept. You have his general report on the school, which was forwarded under cover of my letter dated Nov. 2nd.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M.

C. Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that upon receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant enclosing the inspector's report, the department immediately took up with the Principal the question of a change of teacher. In a report from the Principal dated the 17th instant he states that arrangements have been made to improve conditions with regard to the junior room and that Sister Stebbins, who is a qualified teacher, has been appointed to succeed Sister St. Aldegonde.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Duncan Scott,\nDeputy Minister Of the Dept. Of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nIn a letter dated March 25th, 1929, No. II5-8-I written by the Department to Father Balter the then Principal of this school in reference to an increase in the pupilage and per capita grant, the last part of it reads as follows:\n\n\"Is it possible you are in a position to earn more than this number (90) next fall? You should write the Department, so that they will arrange for an increase appropriation for the fiscal year commencing April 1, 1930.\"\n\nActing on that suggestion, I beg the Department to increase the pupilage up to 110 children. Actually we have in our school 105 children and we receive the grant for 90 only.\n\nWe do not afford to take 110 children without any over crowding and can give them all the accommodation required. The fact that we have 13 un-paid children is an over charge which we cannot afford to carry any longer and I beg to ask you to see that we are paid for their maintenance.\n\nWould it be too much to ask the Department to classify our school so that we may be entitled to get the maximum of the per capita grant (170 dollars) as it is allotted to some more favored one? I am not sure that our school is less efficient and is not up to the standard required to get the maximum of the per capita grant.\n\nYou know just as well as I do the many drawbacks we have to contend with. Owing to the distance from the nearest railway station our expenses are considerably increased and the fact that our crop this year was almost a failure is far from improving our financial situation.\n\nTo be candid about it, I must say, that we shall not be able to meet both ends unless the Department come to our help by increasing the pupilage up to 110 children and a per capita grant of 170 dollars per head.\n\nHoping that my request will received a favorable answer from the Department,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Apparently there is ample room for all, and should the Department decide the building is large enough to justify this request, I would be pleased to recommend it, as all the children in residence should be in school somewhere.\n\nRe grant for freighting. Both schools are at a great disadvantage as they have to freight their supplies from Lloydminster, a distance of 35 miles.

Principal de faire plus ais\u00e9ment honneur \u00e0 ses affaires qui n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 toujours tr\u00e8s brillantes tant \u00e0 cause de circonstances incontournables que du fait des lourdes d\u00e9penses extraordinaires occasionn\u00e9es par l'\u00e9loignement du chemin de fer et des centres de distribution.\n\n2o.- Cet \u00e9loignement \u00e9tant cause de frais de transport consid\u00e9rables, je demande au D\u00e9partement de vouloir bien consid\u00e9rer ce fait avec sympathie et de venir en aide \u00e0 cette \u00c9cole par quelques secours particuliers, soit par une l\u00e9g\u00e8re augmentation du \"per capita Grant\" pour chaque enfant, soit par une allocation subsidiaire destin\u00e9e \u00e0 couvrir les frais de transport auxquels l'\u00e9cole est forc\u00e9ment oblig\u00e9e de faire face.\n\nJ'esp\u00e8re, cher M. le Dr., que vous recevrez ces demandes favorablement, afin que notre collaboration en commun au succ\u00e8s de cette \u00c9cole soit encore plus effective que le pass\u00e9.\n\nVeuillez agr\u00e9er l'assurance de mes sentiments les plus distingu\u00e9s,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mc Gill,\nSuperintendent General\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Mc Gill,\n\nPermit me first to renew the expression of my best wishes of good, happy and prosperous year for 1935 to yourself and your staff.\n\nVery glad that the Department has at last recognized the School of Grand Island Lake, which will be officially opened on the 1st January next. It is no doubt to your personal attention that we owe it and I wish to offer you my thanks as well as for the day school of Long Lake.\n\nDuring your rapid visit of last Summer you went to the boarding school of St. Anthony of Onion Lake. There are two things I would like to draw your attention about that school:\n\n1. That school can easily accommodate 120 children; in fact it has been since the beginning of the year and it will be greatly easier to get that number of recruits from the children of the reserves it is taking care of.\n\nI would therefore, ask you that the number of authorized children for that school be raised from 110 to 120 in future. This increase of annual grant surplus which should normally be allowed would help its financial situation and permit the Rev. Father Principal to do honour to his affairs which were always new brilliant, so much on account of the controllable circumstances than from the fact that extraordinary heavy expenses have to be incurred from on account of distance from the railroads and the centers of distribution.\n\n2. This remoteness being the cause of consider-\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6524, file 659-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\ncost of transportation, I would ask the department to kindly consider this fact in a sympathetic way and come to the help of that school. With some particular grant, such as for instance a slight increase \"per capita Grant\" for each child, or by a grant to cover the transportation which the school has to pay for.\n\nI hope, dear doctor, that you will favorably consider this request so that our common collaboration for the success of that school will be more effective in the future.\n\nKindly accept the assurance of my most distinguished sentiments,\n\n[Signature]\nV. Langlois,\nProvincial\nJanuary 7, 1935.\n\nDear Father Langlois:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd ultimo, requesting that provision be made for an increase of 10 in the pupilage at the Onion Lake Roman Catholic Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I am pleased to inform you that the Department will allow an increase of 10 in the pupilage at this school, making a total of 120 pupils, as from April first, next, the beginning of the new fiscal year. The local Indian Agent will be informed and requested to advise the Reverend Principal of the School.\n\nIt will not be possible to provide a grant towards the cost of transportation expenses in the hauling of supplies from Lloydminster to the school. With the grant allowed for an increased pupilage, the Reverend Principal should be able to finance the cost of hauling supplies.\n\nThanking you for the kind expression of your good wishes for the New Year,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nVery Rev. U. Langlois, O.M.I.,\nOblate Fathers' Prov. House,\n9916 - 110th Street,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nOttawa, January 7, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th ultimo, relative to the request of Rev. Father Langlois, Provincial of the Oblate Order, Edmonton, for a grant for an increased pupilage at the Onion Lake Roman Catholic Indian Residential School. I have to inform you that the Department will approve of a grant for an increase of 10 pupils as from April first, the beginning of the new fiscal year. This will make the grant allowed from that date for a total of 120 pupils. I would request that you inform the Rev. Principal of the school accordingly, and he can arrange to recruit up to that number, forwarding applications and certificates of health for the approval of the Department.\n\nRegarding the request for a grant towards the cost of freighting supplies from Lloydminster to the school, I have to say that the Department will be unable to favourably consider this request. It is considered that, with a grant for an increased pupilage, the Principal should be in a position to finance the cost of hauling supplies.\n\nI may add that Father Langlois also forwarded a request and has been informed in accordance with the contents of this letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Harold Schill,\nSurintendant G\u00e9n\u00e9ral des Affaires Indiennes,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nCher Dr. McGill,\n\nJ'accuse r\u00e9ception de votre lettre du 7 courant et vous prie de croire que je vous suis tr\u00e8s reconnaissant d'avoir accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole du Lac d'Oignon, dont le P. Pratt est Principal, une augmentation d'inscription de 10 enfants de plus. Esp\u00e9rons que l'allocation sup\u00e9rieure qu'elle recevra, \u00e0 partir du 1er avril prochain, lui permettra de faire plus facilement honneur aux esp\u00e9rances que vous fondez sur la collaboration intelligente et d\u00e9vou\u00e9e de tout le personnel.\n\nVous vous rappelez peut-\u00eatre, cher Dr. McGill, qu'\u00e0 votre passage de l'\u00e9t\u00e9 dernier \u00e0 Edmonton nous nous \u00e9tions entretenus de la question d'approvisionnement d'eau aux \u00e9coles de Delmas et du Lac d'Oignon. \u00c0 cette derni\u00e8re \u00e9cole on travaille actuellement \u00e0 l'installation pour usage courant du gros moteur \u00e0 incendie qui jusqu'ici \u00e9tait rest\u00e9 inutilis\u00e9; ce n'est pas une petite entreprise en hiver. Aussi afin que l'\u00e9cole ne soit plus expos\u00e9e \u00e0 manquer de lumi\u00e8re et d'eau et afin que les travaux de r\u00e9parations urgentes soient plus ais\u00e9ment ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s, il serait n\u00e9cessaire de remplacer et d'agrandir un peu la construction qui abrite le moteur \u00e0 incendie. J'ai l'intention de vous en \u00e9crire sous peu. Quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole de Delmas, je sais que vous vous occupez en ce moment du creusement d'un puits ou de ce qui serait, \u00e0 mon avis, bien pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable, de la canalisation de la source si belle et si riche situ\u00e9e \u00e0 quelque distance de l'\u00e9cole. Je fais des v\u0153ux pour que ce dernier projet soit mis \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution le plus t\u00f4t possible.\n\nAvec l'assurance de mon entier d\u00e9vouement,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Harold McCall\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. McCall,\n\nI acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th inst., and I pray you to believe that I am very grateful to you for having granted to Oliver Lake School, of which Father Hall is principal, an increase of 10 in the number of children registered. We hope that the increase in the grant they will receive from the 1st of April next will permit the institution to honour their obligations and carry the expectations founded on the intellectual collaboration of the devoted staff.\n\nYou evidently remember, dear Mr. McCall, that at the time of your visit at Edmonton last Summer, we spoke of the water supply at the schools of Oliver and Oliver Lake. At this last school we are now proceeding with the installation for current use of the large motor for fire protection which was not utilized so far; and this is not a small undertaking during Winter. So that the school be not threatened by a lack of light and water and in manner to do the urgent repairs more easily, it would be necessary to replace and enlarge a little the construction containing the fire protection motor. I intend to write you about it soon. Concerning the Oliver school, I know that you are at present looking over the matter of digging a well or of what would be better; in my mind, the canalization of the water from the spring, so plentiful and rich, situated at a small distance from the school. I pray that this last project be carried out as soon as possible. With the assurance of my entire devotion,\n\n[Signature] C. M. S.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6324, file 659-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFebruary 8, 1935.\n\nDear Father Langlois:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, expressing thanks for the providing of a grant for an increase of ten pupils at the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School as from April first, next, the beginning of the new fiscal year, and also with reference to water supply at that school and at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School, Delmas, Sask.\n\nRegarding the Onion Lake R. C. School, the Department, in October, last, authorized the local Indian Agent to have the 15 h. p. engine, used in the school building, overhauled and repaired. We also authorized that the 25 h. p. engine, which was installed in the small detached building and used for fire protection purposes, be traded for a 20 h. p. gasoline engine, to be placed in the new structure adjoining the engine room of the main building; and that a 40-60 acre well be dug adjoining the engine room in the main building, in which to place this engine. The Agent was authorized to expend the sum of $850 for the above purposes. The Department understands that this work is being carried out.\n\nWith reference to the water supply system for the Thunderchild School at Delmas, the Department is in receipt of a report regarding the obtaining of water from the spring and piping same to the school. The matter will receive consideration. I would point out that the sum of approximately $6,500 was expended last year in drilling a well and installing water tanks in the basement of the school building. It will cost approximately $10,000 to install the system from the spring.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nVery Rev. U. Langlois, O.M.I.,\nOblate Fathers' Prov. House,\n9916 - 110th Street,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nDear Sir:\n\nFor causes unknown to me, \"The Return Form for the Principal's Fiscal Year Report has reached me only yesterday because I called for my mail at Lloydminster P.O.\n\nUnfortunately I was not able to send it to you before today.\n\nAs you will see, the Principal's Salary, Sisters' Salaries and the Engineer who is a member of our religious Order have not been paid in full or even half. This is due to the fact that I had to renew many things as House Equipment, Repairs. The building being built for nearly 9 years requires many repairs and also all the material supplied by the Indian Dept. when the school opened has been worn out. Therefore a great portion of the allowance goes in that direction.\n\nThis year the farm brought in $1232.30 and beside 6535 lbs of beef and 1450 lbs of pork was supplied by the farm as Food supplies for the school. By increasing and improving the farm I expect to be able to meet all my obligations.\n\nTransportation is another heavy item being so far away from town or Railway.\n\nThe pasture on the school ground is absolutely ruined and needs to be ploughed entirely and is not large enough for our live stock. Every year I experience trouble with the Indians and also I loose some heads. Lately I asked with our local Indian Agent the Indians to let me have a little pasture on the Reserve and they refused. Perhaps if the Indian Dept. takes up this question with the Indians we will have a better success. Dr. J.T. Hill Indian Agent was supposed to report this matter to the Dept.\n\nI am very sorry to see that you are on the impression that I deal with your Dept without passing through the Local Indian Agency Office as per stated in your April 28th --115-2-114\n\nMay I state that before writing to the Dept. I always discuss every subject with the Indian Agent and upon his suggestion I then write to the Dept. I will be pleased always to act according to the Dept. Regulations as it is my greater desire to do everything right and honestly.\n\nHoping Dear Mr. MacKenzie, that this letter will be well received and the details contained useful to the Dept.\n\nyours truly\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in quarter for all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: March 31, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended December 31 st., 1941.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Dec. 31, 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated this January 16, 1942.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 30th, 1942.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated at [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony School for the Quarter ended September 30 st., 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 30, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated October 6, 1942\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony School for the Quarter ended September 31 st., 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 30, 1942.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this October 6, 1942.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFrom No. J.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Dec. 31, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated January 14, 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFormat No. I.A.403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Dec. 31, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Union Lake Resk.\n\nthis January 10, 1943.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony School for the Quarter ended 31st March 1943.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: March 31, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony School for the Quarter ended 31st March 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated: March 31, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Union Lake, Sask., this April 1, 1943.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1943.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated June 30, 1943.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated this 2nd January, 1943.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1943.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated September 30th 1943.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Division Office, Saskatoon, this Oct. 16th 1943.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony School for the Quarter ended September 1943.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated Sept. 30 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated Oct. 6 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1943.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated Dec. 31, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated Jan. 3, 1944\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return, the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: June 29, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

grant due for Quarter:** $\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony School for the Quarter ended December 30th, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: ___________________________\n\nDated: ___________________________\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: ___________________________\n\nDated at: ___________________________\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 26, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated April 2, 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for whose grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 26, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated April 2, 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

(RG 10, Volume 6524, file 659-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Signature]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. L.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

(RG 10, Volume C324, file 659-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony School for the Quarter ended December 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: R.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1946.\n\nActing Principal\n\nDated September 28, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated October 2, 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1946.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated September 28th 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated this Oct. 5th 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30th, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated this June 30th, 1946.\n\nNOTE:\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1946.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated June 26th 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this June 30th 1946.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony School for the Quarter ended March 30th 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: March 30th 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Onion Lake, April 1st 1946.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFonx No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony School for the Quarter ended March 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated March 30, 1946.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at this April 1, 1946.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony's School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30th 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Division Office\n\nJune 30th 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS       | AGE | BOY GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTERING TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|----------------------|-----|----------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0356            | Henriette Moyah       | 14\u00bd | 1        | Grade 1        | 1                  | Frog Lake               | 11-10-18                 | 91         |                                                                                                  |\n| 0356            | Emma Moyah            | 13  | 1        | Grade 1        | 1                  | \"                       | 1                        | 91         |                                                                                                  |\n| 0357            | M.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony\u2019s School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30th 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated June 30th 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAME OF PUPILS          | AGE | BOY GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|-----|----------|----------------|-------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0288            | Marie Rose Mercier      | 175 | 1        | Saulteux       |                   |                        |                             | 3030       | Manual training -

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in quarter of all pupils entered in the Return and is ascertainable by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days present for all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony's School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 30, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Heaters Hall\n\nthis 3 July 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony Residential School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1948.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: December 21, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at Meadow Lake this JAN 3 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony Residential School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated December 31, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Meadow Lake\n\nthis JAN 3 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFonds No. I.A. 403\nR. 3608\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony Residential School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1948.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: December 31, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Meadow Lake\n\nthis JAN. 3, 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. LA. 403\nR. 3608\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the columns under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 31, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nMeadow Lake\n\nDated this APR 6 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1949.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: June 30, 1949.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at this date, 19 .\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nR. 3608\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | BAND OR RESERVE | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF TRANSFER TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|-----|-----|----------------|---------------|------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 0396            | Dora Lewis     | 9\u00bd | 1   | 0   | Union Lake     | 1             |                  |                          | 12-1-46                   | 91/48      |\n| 0397            | Aldina Choak   | 9\u00bd | 1   | 0   |                |               |                  |                          | 12-6-46                   | 91/48      |\n| 0398            | M.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\u201d\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter.\u201d\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated September 30, 1949.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this date, 1949.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

(RG 10, Volume 6324, file 659-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated September 30, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony Residential School for the Quarter ended...Dated...31...1949.\n\nPrincipal...Dated...31...1949.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at...this...19...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupil during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony's Residential School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated December 31, 1949.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this ........................................... 19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nR. 3908\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Meadow Lake Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the St. Anthony Residential School at Onion Lake on Onion Lake Reserve for Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1947**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY/GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|----------|----------------|-------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0582            | Anna F.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: December 31, 1947.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nthis: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in quarter multiplied by the number of pupils (Reg. 9) and is inserted in adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 31, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nMEADOW LAKE\n\nDated at this APRIL 4, 1950\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: March 31, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403 R. 3608\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS       | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|----------------|----------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0383           | Annie Waskewitch     | 10\u00bd |     |      | 27             | 9 12 17 11 3 2 1    |                        |                           | 9 -

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 31, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nR. 3608\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0430            | Isabelle Baptiste | 11  |     |      | 1 Red Pheasant | 1                  |                       |                           | 3 - 1 - 49   | 90 63\u00bd                                                                                     |\n| 0431            | Verna Baptiste    | 9   |     |      | 1 Red Pheasant | 1                  |                       |                           | \"           | 90 63\u00bd                                                                                     |\n| 0432            | Lillian Bugler    | 16\u00bd |     |      | 1 Red Pheasant | 1                  |                       |                           | \"           | 90 27                                                                                      |\n| 0435            | Florence Muskego  | 7\u00bd  |     |      | 1 Onion Lake   | 1                  |                       |                           | 15 - 2 - 49 | 90 63\u00bd                                                                                     |\n| 0436            | Alma Jimmy        | 7\u00bd  |     |      | 1 Thunderchild | 1                  |                       |                           | 1 - 9 - 49  | 90 63\u00bd                                                                                     |\n| 0437            | Irene Shirt       | 7\u00bd  |     |      | 1 Saddle Lake  | 1                  |                       |                           | \"           | 90 63\u00bd                                                                                     |\n| 0438            | M.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in which all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony R.C. Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated June 30, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Meadow Lake Agency this JUL 3 1950\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony R.C. Res. School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Meadow Lake Agency JUL 3 1950\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance-in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony R.C.

(RG 10, Volume 6324, file 659-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony's R.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...St. Anthony R.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony R.C. Indian Res. School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated September 30, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nMEADOW LAKE\n\nDated at OCT 1, 1950\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Sept. 30, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at MEADOW LAKE\n\nOCT 11, 1950\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. If, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils named on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony Re. Co. Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated December 31, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at MEADOW LAKE INDIAN AGENCY\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST. ANTHONY R.C. INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated December 31, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at JAN 2, 1951\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403 R. 3608\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**REPORT OF THE ST.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony R.C. Indian Res. School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at MEADOW LAKE INDIAN AGENCY JAN 2 1951\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony R.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included in the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding together the number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the total number of days pupils in residence during quarter by the \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the average attendance of pupils during quarter by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. Care must be taken that the names of the boys and girls must be arranged consecutively according to their ages.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Anthony R.C.

G. Harris\nIndian Agent\nOnion Lake,\nNov. 18th 1895\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have been very disappointed by your letter of the 19th Oct. Being convinced that we were authorized to take thirty boarders, not only did we admit such a number, but so as to more fully meet the wishes of the Department, and remedy to a want felt by all those who are interested, we moreover have admitted ten boarders for whom we receive no grant.\n\nOur object was to give to the larger number of our Indian children in the same degree the benefit of an unbroken course of instruction.\n\nYou are aware that children attending the Day School and returning to their homes in the evening, do not, or nearly so, profit by the School, for the reason that the children do not attend the greatest part of the year owing to their fickleness and the carelessness of parents. To remedy this inconvenience, we have taken upon ourselves to admit ten children above the number allowed, relying upon the fact that we were authorized to take thirty boarders.\n\nYou can see how we are fixed. We receive the grant for only 25, and have 15 more which we\n\nA. Forget Esqr,\nRegina.\nwe receive no grant. We do not forget that we receive rations for the latter and $1.00. ahead a month, but this is as nothing compared to the expenses for their clothing, and food, especially when we are obliged to erect an expensive and comfortable building for these children. If we had resources upon which we could rely, but such is not the case. We must absolutely rely on the Department's grant and in a locality remote from large centres where we must pay high rates for everything in the way of food or clothing for the children. You can see the trouble we are in.\n\nI leave it to your spirit of justice to see the means to remedy this awkward situation which has been brought upon us by some kind of a misapprehension. However I beg the Department to consider our request to have a larger amount of children as earners of the grant. Considering the number of children of school age, the distance between here and large towns where everything costs less, we ask anew an increase of the grant for ten children above the 25 we are already allowed as boarders. It must not be forgotten that 50 children of school age could be had here. We have built a house which can offer comfort and accommodation for such a number. I request you, dear Sir, to strongly urge the justice of this demand upon\nupon the Department of which you are one of the more appreciated Officers.\n\nWe are well disposed to do everything in our power to keep the Department in reaching the goal it looks for in the matter of the education of the Indian children; we appreciate their true values the sacrifices made by the Government in order to solve the problem of the education and civilization of the Indians, and I take this opportunity to thank him, whoever he is, for the grant which has been allowed us for the 25 boarders of our school; but considering the urgency of giving to a large number of those children who are of school age, the benefit of a solid training, and also that our financial resources are insufficient to do more than we are doing at present, we beg the Department to do justice to our demand.\n\nHoping that our request will be taken into favourable consideration,\n\nI etc,\n\n(signed) J. A. Therien Ft. O. M. I.\nOnion Lake,\nDec. 3rd 1895.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn November 1894, the School house having been burnt down here, we began the erection of a boarding School. To meet the wants which were felt and the desire of the Department, we resolved upon building a spacious house wherein all the necessary comfort could be found for the children, who might be taken as boarders. This house, 35' by 45' three stories, begun in November 1894 was terminated in November 1895. Today there are forty children residing in the same. The ground floor divided in two rooms is intended for the class room, and for the girls workroom; the 2nd story is also divided in two, one for the boys dormitory, the other for the girls; the top story is not yet finished.\n\nFor this building, 50,000 feet of lumber have been used, the Department has contributed 12,000 as against the school house which had been burnt down, so that we have provided 38,143 feet to erect this building. I enclose the details of the expenses in connection with it, amounting to $2165.88.\n\nWe are thankful to the Department\n\nA. E. Forget Esqr,\nRegina.\nfor the 12,000 feet of lumber we have received, but considering that this house is a School for the Indian children only, we beg to take leave to ask the Department to be kind enough to help us to pay the expenses that we were obliged to go to erect it.\n\nWe see that the Department goes to a large output for the education of Indian children, and we cannot but praise it for the same; at the same time we beg the Department to consider that it is impossible for us to answer to its desire in giving to the children all the necessary comfort and adequate room if we are obliged to clothe, feed and shelter them out of the grant received from the Government.\n\nWe therefore pray the Government to aid us in defraying the expenses we have gone to in this building. We beg that the number of the children we keep as boarders, without the grant usually allowed them as such, be considered.\n\nWe beg the Department also to consider that, considering the promise received of a grant for 30 pupils when ultimately the grant was only for 25, we have been induced to take a larger number of pupils. This disappointment has put us to great financial embarrassment, specially for having to pay the cost of house, expensive, it is true, but at the same time necessary and occupied exclusively by Indian children.\n\nI am etc.\n\n(sd) J.

The school-room being now too small on account of the increasing number of children, we are obliged to use the dining room as a second class-room.\n\nThe boys' dormitory is also a little too crowded. This state of things has been found unsatisfactory by the Inspector, as being subjected to a great many inconveniences.\n\nTo remedy this, we intend to build an addition connecting the school house with the Sisters' house. This addition would be about 40x30 feet, 2 stories high, with French roof.\n\nIt is impossible to get lumber here. We would be obliged to get it from Edmonton.\n\nIt could be taken down by the river at\nat small expense. We deem it necessary to put up the proposed addition as it would greatly benefit the health of the children.\n\nWe therefore ask for an appropriation to enable us to make this building.\n\nI have the honour As. &c.,\nW. Jamieson, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nIndian Agent's Office,\nOnion Lake Agency,\n4th Apr 1898.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to herewith enclose three (3) requisitions from the Principal of the R.C. Boarding School here. The same were submitted to me to be forwarded.\n\nThe additional building for which an appropriation is asked, is required owing to the present school being overcrowded as stated in the enclosed letter.\n\nThe improvements by painting and sealing will certainly add to the comfort and appearance of the school.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeo. G. Mann.\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to forward three requisitions from the Principal of the Onion Lake Boarding School, received under cover of a letter from the Indian Agent.\n\nIn regard to the first I may say that I have gathered from a private conversation with the Coadjutor Bishop of St. Albert that $1500 would cover the expenditure in connection with the addition mentioned and I would recommend departmental aid to the extent of $750. The work done at this school is unquestionably meritorious.\n\nIn regard to the second, I think the two blackboards on rollers should be sent without delay.\n\nThe third is for minor repairs at a cost of less than $200, and I also recommend this to the favourable consideration of the Department.\n\nShould there be no money available out of the current year's General School Vote, items for the amounts and purposes mentioned might perhaps be added to the Supplementary Estimates for next fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nCommissioner.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, 27th April, 1898.\n\nTHE SECRETARY,\n\nI beg to submit herewith an application from the Principal of the Roman Catholic Boarding School at Onion Lake for a grant to build an addition to that school.\n\nThe Principal does not mention the amount required, but the Commissioner states that in a private conversation with the Coadjutor Bishop of St. Albert he learned that $1500 would cover the expenditure, and he recommends that the Department grant aid to the extent of $750.\n\nIn view of the Minister's decision not to make any grants at present for new buildings for industrial or boarding schools, I do not suppose anything will be done in this case, particularly in consideration of the fact that the Onion Lake Boarding School building belongs to the Roman Catholic Church, and it has been the practice of the Department to decline to make grants to buildings not owned by it.\n\nH.C. Ross.\nOttawa, 29th April, 1898.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, No. 122/69, enclosing an application from the Principal of the Roman Catholic boarding school at Onion Lake for a grant to erect an addition to the school building.\n\nIn connection with this request you state that in a private conversation with the Conductor Bishop of St. Albert you have learned that $1500 would be the probable cost of the addition, and you recommend that the Department contribute $750.\n\nIn reply I may say that in view of the Minister's decision not to make grants at present for new buildings for industrial or boarding schools, and particularly in consideration of the fact that the Opeongo Anishnag boarding school building is not the property of the Department, nothing can be done this year in the direction above indicated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Father Comire regarding the expenditure of the R.C. School building, and in list of vouchers you show already paid, two accounts forwarded you some time ago, are omitted, as mentioned in the attached letter from the Rev. Principal with a receipt for amount of $21.53, carpenter work performed by B. Vermette.

Frazer, lumber - $82.50, and H.W. McKenny -$114.40, were forwarded in my letter of the 13th of March last. There is however an apparent error as to the first one which was mentioned as F.A. Osborne - $82.00. Both these vouchers are not in the list given in the department's letter above mentioned. I beg to recommend that a cheque be sent to the Principal for this amount, viz: $193.40. Another voucher for the balance of the appropriation has also been sent but had to be returned on account of its incompleteness. It will be forwarded by the Agent direct to the department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nCommissioner\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 30th May, 1896.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 11th instant, No. 122/03, I beg to inform you that the list of accounts given in Departmental letter of the 24th March is quite correct. There is no account in favour of F.A. Fraser, for lumber amounting to $82.50, but there is an account in favour of F.A. Osburn for windows amounting to $82.50, and it is included in the list. As regards H.W. McKenny's account for hardware, I should say that the total amount of same is $151.30, as given in the list, and that $114.40 referred to by you is only a portion of the account. You will therefore observe that both the amounts of the above mentioned accounts ($82.50 and $114.40) are included in the cheque forwarded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary,\n\nA.B.

The estimate comes to $3357.30 but the item for wages could, the Inspector states, be much reduced by utilizing the labor of the senior boys under the instruction of a competent and skilled carpenter. The Indian Commissioner, in a marginal note, says that the Inspector has exceeded his duty in approving of the estimate and plan, and that such provision has been made in the estimates as was considered reasonable. The Department informed the Commissioner that it concurred.\nconcurred in his opinion, as expressed in the note above referred to and that the Inspector should be so informed, as such action on his part was likely to compromise the Department.\n\nA new building was completed for this school about three years ago, towards which the Department contributed $129 about $2000.00 and it was supposed to furnish accommodation for the same number of pupils as are now provided for.\n\nIf the Department contributes anything towards the enlargement of the buildings a grant for an increased number of pupils is sure to be asked for.\n\nThe Church of England has a boarding school on this reserve with provision for only 15 pupils and there has always been considerable jealousy between the two schools, and my experience is that when a concession is made to a boarding school a similar one has to be made to its neighbor of a different denomination.\n\nI may add that the Department's contribution covered almost the total cost of the Roman Catholic school building. The accompanying photographs will give you a good idea of the each of these school buildings.\n\nFather Comire's letter addressed to Mr Davis M.P., is returned herewith.\n\nMartin Buxton\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Chippewas of Cold Lake seem desirous to place their children at school, so do not ask them as we see we have not the necessary accommodation.\n\nI would beg you then to be kind enough to reckon in your estimate the approximate sum of five thousand dollars which would enable us to enlarge the house and to have the old building finished, it has as yet no stone foundation, ceiling or paint on the inside.\n\nHoping that my petition will meet with more success than the first, I remain,\n\nYours humble servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTo the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Acknowledging the help given by the Department in helping to build the first addition and sincerely grateful for it yet we dare say that as much and far more has been given for several other Indian Schools under its control.\n\nWe are so far from all communication and commerce that it is impossible to think of building without the Department's help or authority. And at the same time it is hard to be obliged to refuse...\nadmittance to pupils on account of want of space and thus force their parents to place them in schools contrary to their creed as has been done lately.\n\nI know we importunate you with our situated demand, but I feel sure, Sir, that Sir, were you to see our actual necessity you would plead in our favour for a reasonable amount which would allow us to put up an addition and finish the first one.\n\nTruly hoping that you will interest yourself in our favour.\n\nI remain,\nSir,\n\nYour humble and grateful servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 16th October, 1901.\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nWith regard to the application of the Principal of the Roman Catholic boarding school at Onion Lake for a grant to enable them to enlarge the building and to finish the addition already made, I beg to say that what the Department is paying for 50 pupils at this school which had an enrollment of 58 and an average attendance of 52 for last year. Any more pupils admitted to this school would only over-tax the accommodation and it is a question whether the Department should be called upon to furnish room for any new pupils they may wish to take in. I think the Department is doing enough in giving the full grant for the number they can accommodate.\n\nThe Church of England has a boarding school at Onion Lake in close proximity to this school, which is only receiving a grant for 16 pupils although there are many in excess of that number on the roll.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am afraid that any exceptions which have been made to this rule are going to lead to a good deal of trouble and I think, in the meantime at all events, the rule should be adopted that no boarding schools are to be given grants for building purposes.\n\nIn view of the report of Mr. Benson regarding the Roman Catholic Boarding School at Onion Lake, in which he states that only 52 pupils were in attendance last year, I think no increase should be given this year.\n\nDeputy Supt-General.\nOTTAWA, 21st October, 1901\n\nRev.

They are double desks and are supplemented by rough wooden forms in the junior room; the senior room has a sufficiency of desks. The children who use the forms are the smallest children in the school, and the desks required are of the smallest size.\n\nI would be glad if the Department can furnish the school with the equipment asked for; it would be greatly appreciated by both the principal and teachers.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, May 26th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, in which you request on behalf of the sisters in charge of the Onion Lake R.C.

The name of the manufacturer will, no doubt, be stamped on the desks. I will also be pleased if you will give full shipping directions. We prefer to supply single desks, and will order 10 of these, size #6 which are suitable for children 5 to 7 years. The next largest size is the one for children 7 to 9 years. In order to prevent any error, you should state which of these sizes would be required, or if a certain number of each size be supplied.\n\nRegarding the hyloplate blackboard, I beg to say that we shall place an order with the Government Stationery Office for a supply of hyloplate blackboards of the dimensions mentioned above, with the necessary moulding and chalk trough, as soon as we are informed as to the address to which this should be shipped.

New joists and flooring have been put under the old building, and a first class job in every respect has been made. I would be glad if the Department can see its way to re-insure the school for this outlay, as the work was very badly needed and had to be done. In fact, the flooring was in such a bad condition that visitors to the building had to be conducted away from the weak spots to prevent them from breaking through.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, August 28th, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Onion Lake R. C. Boarding School, together with receipts showing an expenditure to the amount of $1551.85 for labour and material in excavating a large cellar and putting new foundations and floors in the school, and requesting that same be paid.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this school is the property of the Roman Catholic Church authorities. These repairs appear to have been undertaken by the Principal without reference to the Department or any request previous to the work being commenced that a grant for same be made. Our appropriation for Indian Education during the present fiscal year is limited, and has been entirely assigned. We have no funds available for the payment of these accounts. The Principal, before undertaking any expenditure which he desires the Department to pay, should first receive permission to undertake the work, and also instructions regarding the purchase of any material required. Judging from the accounts which you forwarded, no competitive prices were received in the purchase of the material used as is necessary in order to meet the requirements of the Purchasing Commission of Canada.\n\nAs this is church-owned property, payment of these accounts should be undertaken by the church authorities.\n\nThe receipts and accounts which you forwarded are returned herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake,\nSask.\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6324, file 659-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAfter laying the case before Mr. Turner we decided to go on at once with the work we had in mind to postpone till next year, after having referred the matter to the Department.\n\nThus what we thought could be attended to next year, had to be carried through right away.\n\nWe were taken unaware and could not ascertain before beginning the work the necessity of pushing it through to a finish.\n\nTo wait and communicate with the Department was out of the question as we had to hurry the work before the reopening of the school in August.\n\nWe had no other alternative than to go on and to communicate with the Department once the work would be done, although we had the approval of our Agent Mr. Turner as to the urgency of going in such outlay.\n\nAs to the fact that our school is the church's property, I would simply say, that considering that the annual grant allotted for the maintenance of the school is barely sufficient, it would seem that the Indians through the Department, could help covering such expenses.\n\nI beg also to draw your attention to the fact that being far away from any center, the nearest town being Lloydminster 40 miles, we had to rely on the only man staying here to do the work.\n\nUnder the circumstances it was impossible to meet the requirements of the Purchasing Commission of Canada.\n\nIn view of the facts as stated above which I beg to submit to your kindly considerations, I take the liberty to press our claim for at least a part of the expenses incurred, if it be at all possible for the Department to give us a grant that would cover the whole expenses.\n\nI may also state that this excavation forms a part of a plan for a\nComplete improvement to our school, which improvement we hope to make in the near future and for which we intend asking a proper appropriation from the Department.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nprincipal\nOttawa, October 2, 1922.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have to inform you that Rev. Father Therien, of the Onion Lake R. C. Boarding School, has appealed to the Department again in connection with the expenses incurred at the school this summer.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General is prepared to give favourable consideration to some of these accounts, and I am asking you to return them to the Department, properly certified. If competitive prices were secured for the material, a memo should be attached showing the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted. The bill for labour should be supported by receipts signed by the men employed.\n\nThis Department will endeavour to select vouchers that are in order and will give serious consideration to their payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

Boarding School. The work was badly needed, and although it was done by the Church authorities without the consent of the Department, I trust that this will be overlooked and the voucher honoured.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMr. Scott:\n\nSome time ago the Principal of the Onion Lake R. C. Boarding School asked the Department to reimburse him for his expense in connection with building proper foundations and digging a large cellar under the school. Both the Agent and the Principal have stated that the work was absolutely necessary and, although we had turned down the initial request, you suggested that we have the vouchers sent in to the Department, with a view to paying part of the amount involved.\n\nVouchers are now to hand, properly certified and supported by the necessary receipts for labour, cement and freight\u2014a total of $1780.15. The Principal has paid the accounts, and I am afraid has endangered the finances of the school.\n\nThe accounts for cement and freight amount to $769.15, and I would recommend that they be paid. Funds can be provided from the Vote for Indian Education.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, Nov. 13, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge your No. 99-10 of the 31st ultimo, enclosing voucher No. 184 relative to alterations at the Onion Lake R.

Turner\nIndian Agent\nOnion Lake Agency\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs you have observed in your last visit to our school, it is imperative that we build a new chimney. The old one is out-of-order and is beyond repairing. It has been condemned by a man who is a specialist in chimney building, so that a new one has to be made.\n\nThe cost would be approximately, comprising the materials, freight and labor, $200 dollars. Will you be kind enough to recommend an appropriation from the Department to defray the expenses.\n\nWith best regards,\n\n[Signature]\nJ. A. [Name]\nprincipal.\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a letter received from Rev. J.A. Therien, principal of the Onion Lake R.C. Boarding School, in which he asks me to make a recommendation to the Department for an appropriation of about $200.00 for the purpose of building a new chimney at the school.\n\nA new and larger chimney is absolutely necessary at this school. One of the old chimneys, a small one, only 8\" square inside, which rested on a bracket in the kitchen and which was fed by six stoves, caught fire a few weeks ago and for a short time it was feared that the whole building would take fire; as it was some of the interior woodwork was badly scorched.\n\nFather Therien and I have gone into this matter with Mr. G.T. Hunter, builder, of Onion Lake, who recommended Father Therien to build a chimney with an inside measurement of 17\"x21\u00be\" and 40' high, and also to have the small one built up from the basement, and the bracket in the kitchen done away with.\n\nThe large chimney would relieve the present congestion in the small chimneys, of which there are five in the main building and would add greatly to the safety of the buildings.\n\nI do not think the cost will be quite as much as Father Therien has asked for. The following is my estimate:\n\n| Item       | Quantity | Unit Price | Total   |\n|------------|----------|------------|---------|\n| Bricks     | 2500     | @ .3\u00a2      | $75.00  |\n| Freight    | 6000 lbs.| @ .65\u00a2 per 100 | $52.00  |\n| Labour     |          |            | $53.00  |\n\n$180.00\n\nIf the Department can properly authorize this expenditure I would be glad for it to do so, as the present condition with respect to chimneys at this school is bad and, as I have already pointed out to Father Therien, should be remedied.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMay 8th, 1923.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Scott:\n\nA request has been received from the Principal of the Onion Lake R.C. Boarding School, forwarded through the office of the Indian Agent, for a grant of $200 for the purpose of building a new chimney at the school. It is stated that this large chimney would relieve the present congestion in the small chimneys of which there are five in the main building, and would greatly add to the safety of the buildings. I would point out that this school is the property of the Church authorities.\n\nLast year we paid accounts to the amount of $769.15 for material and labour in putting in a new foundation and digging a large cellar under the school. This work was carried out by the Principal without referring the matter to the Department, and he subsequently asked that payment be made, which was done on your authority.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your recommendation as to whether authority should be granted for the expenditure of $200 for the purpose of building a new chimney.\nOttawa, May 17, 1923.\n\nDear sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 30th ult., with reference to the building of a new and larger chimney at the Onion Lake R.C. Boarding School, I beg to inform you that you are authorized to have a new chimney built as outlined in your letter.\n\nIt is noted that the cost will not exceed $200.00.\n\nIn the purchasing of all materials, competitive prices must be obtained, and in the employment of labour, time sheets should be kept.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J.

Boarding School,\nUnion Lake, Sask. Jan. 7, 1924.\n\nThe Honourable Duncan Scott,\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nDesiring to comply with the wishes of the Indian Department and to co-operate with it in its endeavour to promote the interest of education among the Indians, I take the liberty to draw your attention to the fact that here in this Union Lake Agency, notwithstanding the efforts of both the Agent and missionaries, the problem of educating the Indian children is still in abeyance.\n\nDue to the lack of accommodation in our boarding school many children are therefrom deprived of the benefit of adequate education. And we, the Roman Catholic missionaries feel it all the more, that most of the Indians under the management of this agency belong to our Church. Here at Union Lake out of forty or forty-five Indian families, thirty-six belong to our church.\n\nFrog Lake, out of twenty-five, more or less, fifteen are Roman Catholics at Kiyewin, or Long Lake, every family, twenty-five more or less, belongs to our Church, the same for Cold Lake Reserve.\n\nSuch so, that the Boarding School under the management of the Church in England, must get its pupils from the other surrounding agencies, Le Lacle or Thunderchild. So that most of the problem rest on ourselves and we are well aware that we cannot cope with it under the present circumstances.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6324, file 659-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nPre: Only we have fifty-five children in our boarding school and owing to lack of room, we cannot take more, so that there are many children who should be in the school and who are not.\n\nTrue, there are two day schools in operation in this agency, at Long Lake and Cold Lake. But, you are well aware, that notwithstanding the efforts made to have them effectives, it is utterly impossible owing to the inability of the parents to send their children regularly to school. The consequences are that many children do not receive the proper education such as the department and the missionaries alike, would like to give them.\n\nUnder the circumstances I think that steps should be taken to remedy the situation, the only way, is to have a larger school. Up to now, the Indians were satisfied with the way the education was given to their children, but for a certain time they show a great deal more of interest in the education of their children and desire to put their children in the boarding school when to our sorrow we have to refuse the admission of the children from lack of room.\n\nAs an example of this new tendency, I may say that hitherto it was almost impossible to get children from Long Lake Reserve, and now we have twenty-one who belong to that reserve; and more could be taken had we the room to accommodate them. So, according to the missionaries and those who are interested in the education of the Indian, a larger school should be built, and built as soon as possible.\n\nA building that could accommodate one hundred children, the number of children belonging to the reserve under the management of this agency warrants this number. Had we the place right now, we could get easily this number.\n\nIt is out of question to put an addition to our old building. This should be discarded altogether and a new one built in an up-to-date fashion, so that we may have all the accommodations required by the Department.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6324, file 659-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nYou are well aware, Sir, that we have the staff, well trained and well qualified to do the work, all that we need, is a larger building, built up in this agency to accommodate all the children who could be taken in, right now, if we had the means to do so. We, the missionaries of the Roman Catholic Church, are anxious that the department find its way through to comply with our demand as I said already, most of the children belong to our church, and we consider it as one of our most sacred duty to lay the matter before the proper authority expecting a favourable answer as soon as possible.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

A.

Indian Residential School at Onion Lake. The reasons set forth for such request are the following:\n\nThe School is too small for the number of children that could receive accommodation. The Principal has requested for nearly 100 children and can receive only 60. Moreover, the School is deprived of all comfort and improvements required by the Department. To put it in the words of the Principal: \"We still have to use camp stoves, coal oil lamps and carry water in barrels. The School is rather in an inferior position.\"\n\nMoreover, the Agent, after thoroughly visiting the School, told Reverend Father Th\u00e9rien, that a request for immediate construction should be made, as in his opinion the School is the most backward in accommodation that exists in the Western Provinces. The Agent also noticed that part of the School is far from being solid and in fact may be a source of danger for the children.\n\nPerhaps you would require a more fully detailed report from the Agent, but I am positive that this report would simply give greater strength to the present request. Therefore, if possible, kindly consider the advisability of constructing a new R.C. Indian Residential School at Onion Lake to accommodate 100 children.\n\nJoseph [signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

There is no point in the three prairie provinces that I know of where a school is more urgently needed than here. It is absolutely impossible to carry on work in a building such as we have at this point. This building is cold and unhealthy, and is nothing less than a fire-trap. The new school should be of the same capacity as that erected for the Anglican Church on this reserve. I cannot recommend this too strongly to the Department.\n\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF AGENT TURNER, to Comm. Graham, dated October 6, 1925.\n\nResidential Schools: New floors are badly needed at the Roman Catholic Residential School.

(RG 10, Volume 6324, file 659-5, part 2)\nArguments in favour of the reconstruction of Onion Lake Residential School have been brought up before the Department in last year's list of requests in view of the Estimates. Those arguments are stronger than ever, and moreover, the construction of the Anglican Residential School calls for the same policy in favour of the Catholic Residential School.\n\nThe question of the site is not yet decided but I understand that Inspector Morrison and Rev. Fr. Th\u00e9rien, O.M.I., Principal, have examined a few spots and will probably agree for a favourable place.\n\n$70,000 is the approximate amount required for the construction and equipment of a school building along the lines of the Anglican School, and at the request of Very Rev.

This floor should have been replaced two years ago but in view of the prospects for a new building, the expenditure was not asked for. As this was a matter of extreme urgency, I have authorized the Indian Agent to secure sufficient spruce lumber to make the necessary repairs and to employ Indian labour to put it down.\n\nThe cost will not exceed $75.00 and I trust that my action may be approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ont.\nOttawa, September 27, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 309-11A R.C. of the 21st instant, relative to the condition of the floor in the boys' dormitory at the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the action taken by you in authorizing the Indian Agent to obtain the spruce lumber required in making the necessary repairs to this floor is approved. We note that the cost will be approximately $75.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nI visited this school on the 9th inst. The children had just returned from their holidays a few days previously. I found the building scrupulously clean throughout. This building has been reported on before; it has surely fulfilled its purpose and a new school is badly required. I may say that it has not been considered wise to incur any great expenditure in repairing this building in view of the prospects of a new school. However, as I have already reported to you, some repairs will have to be made to the floors in order to render them safe.\n\nThere is no farming carried on in connection with this school. They have a large garden which provides an ample supply of vegetables for their use. They keep ten milch cows, seven of which were giving milk at the time. The Sister in charge informed me that they were poor milkers and they should have at least four more cows to provide for their requirements. They have a nice flock of poultry and they also raise pigs.\n\nWhen in the sewing room the Sister pointed out that the Sewing Machine for tailoring work was over thirty years old and was pretty well worn out. I was asked to place before the Department their request for a new machine. There are 57 pupils in attendance at this school at the present time.\nRegina, Sask., Sept. 22nd, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the schools in the Onion Lake Agency, which was made by Mr. Inspector Murison.\n\nWith regard to the condition of the floors in the R.C. Boarding school at Onion Lake. Apparently it would be impossible for them to carry on the work even for another year without some repairs and I have authorized an expenditure of about $75.00 to put down some cheap flooring for the time being.\n\nW.M. Graham.\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, September 30, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Murison, in a report on his recent inspection of the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Day School, states that he was requested by the Reverend Sisters to place before the Department their request to be supplied with a sewing machine for tailoring work. He states that the machine at present in use is over thirty years old and nearly worn out.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your recommendation as to whether you would advise that a new tailor's sewing machine be supplied for this school or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nSir,\u2014\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, No. 115-8-5, and, in reply to inform you that I would strongly recommend that a new tailor's sewing machine be supplied the Onion Lake Roman Catholic Residential School. The Reverend Sisters feel the need of this machine badly, as most of the boy's clothing is made in the institution.\n\nI would estimate the cost of this machine to be about $65.00.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 18th, 1926.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have to request that you will arrange to supply for the use of the Onion Lake R.

If the children of those Indians were admitted to the school we would have a great number of children because they are quite numerous at those points, but if we take of that amount only the areas of Onion, Frog and Long lakes, it would be easy to have 100 to 120 children.\n\nI leave the matter to your kind attention and ask you to discuss same with the Deputy Minister and give orders to the Architect about the size of the building.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Minister of Labour may at any time and from time to time determine for the purposes of this contract, what are the current or fair and reasonable rates of wages, and the current or fair and reasonable hours, and may from time to time rescind, revoke, amend or vary any such decision, provided that his determination and any amendment or variation shall not be operative prior to the period of three months immediately preceding the date thereof. Where there are special circumstances which in the judgment of the Minister of Labour make it expedient that he should do so, he may, in the manner and subject to the provisions hereinabove set forth, decide what are the current or fair and reasonable rates of wages for overtime, and what is the proper classification of any work for the purposes of wages and hours. Immediately upon receipt of notice of any decision of the Minister of Labour hereunder the contractor shall adjust the wages and hours and classification of work so as to give effect to such decision. In case the contractor shall fail so to do, or to pay to any employee or employees for any services performed or for any hours of labour, wages according to the rates fixed therefor by the Minister of Labour, the Minister of Labour may authorize and direct the Minister to pay any such wages at the rates so fixed and to deduct the amount thereof from any moneys owing by the Government to the contractor and any such payment shall for all purposes as between the contractor and the Government be deemed and taken to be payment to the contractor, and the contractor shall be bound in every particular by any such authority, direction and payment as aforesaid. The powers of the Minister of Labour hereunder shall not be exercised as to any employee or employees where it is established to his satisfaction that an agreement in writing exists and is in effect between the contractor and the class of employees to which such employee or employees belong or the authorized representatives of such class of employees fixing rates of wages, overtime conditions and hours of labour.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6324, file 659-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOnion Lake April 7th, 1926.\n\nR. Guerney Orr,\nArchitect for the Indian Department,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am sending you as requested in your letter one blue print copy of a sketch plan for our school, and I may say, that if the plan is entirely carried out, the building will be a credit to the Department and to the architect.\n\nAs to the interior of the building, very few suggestions are needed beside those previously made and which have been acted upon in the drawing of the sketch which at the present time is returning to you. However, you will find attached to this sheet a list containing old suggestions and some new ones.\n\nI beg to submit that on the Ground and first floor, doors be put up at both ends of the corridors at the place I have marked. I consider this suggestion very important as its adoption will, in a great measure, do away with many inconveniences complained against in such institutions as ours. It will go a long way in dulling the noise which some time is almost unbearable and establish a sane and very desirable privacy between the visitors, the staffs and the children. Permit me, Sir, to lay stress on that point and draw your attention to it.\n\nFurthermore I beg to call your attention to the fact that in the Boys' Girls Dormitories there is no provisions for Toilet and guardian's rooms. We consider that these accommodations are as much needed there as they are for the other dormitories provided with such utilities. The boys and the girls, sleeping there, will need as much watching, if not more, than those occupying the second floor dormitories. So for the sake of morality and greater efficiency, allow me, dear Sir, to insist on that point.\n\nIn order to give the Boy's dormitory on the first floor its full capacity, I take the liberty to suggest that the bed room adjacent to the dormitory be converted into a toilet room. As for the girl's, I really do not see how it could be done as there is no space around vacant.\n\nYou will remark that the corridor on the first floor gives a free and easy access to the two dormitories, so that it would be easy for the boys and the girls to arrange secret meetings. This corridor should be shut up by doors to preclude such eventualities.\n\nA Sun room is very desirable in such institutions, and I expect to get one. But where to locate it? Of course it ought to face the south and\nand as our building will be facing the south, how will it do to build two sun rooms one each side of the front balcony, provide, of course these two rooms do not in any way disparage the outlook of the building. I leave to your artistic sense the solution of this problem.\n\nI have shown this plan to my Superior and to the Indian Agent, and both of them are greatly elogious in their appreciations. But both of them also concur with me in the idea that it is too bad that the building be not a little larger, that is: instead of being 140 feet long, it is met 155. Then it will be nearer as possible to perfection. As it is now it will be almost impossible to accommodate more than 85 or 90 children in the dormitories. However I suppose you have your instructions and have to carry them out. Any way, if that last suggestion could be acted upon the Department would have built a school that could be considered as a model in that line.\n\nYour's truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nJune 15, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nPlans and specifications are being prepared for a new Indian Residential School to be built on the Onion Lake Indian Reserve, in the Province of Saskatchewan, and I would ask you to please furnish me with a Schedule of Rates for this work.\n\nI would point out, however, that the building will be located at some considerable distance from any large centre, and it might be better to use the General Classes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Scott,\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nIn the last interview I had the honor to have with you in company of Father Guy, you gave me to understand that the Department intends to build a Residential school at Onion lake in the course of the next summer.\n\nAssuming that such would be the case, I take the liberty to humbly submit to your consideration the advisability of erecting a school large enough to accommodate 120 children or more. I think that I am not asking too much and I believe that the following facts warrant my demand.\n\nThe Onion lake reserve is in the center of a large district extending seventy miles to the west and eighty miles to the east. In that district there are many Indian Reserves such as Long lake, Frog lake, and Onion lake in the west and the Little and Big Island lakes, Thunder Child, Meadow lake, Water Hen, Jack Fish lake, Sweet Grass, Roundmaker, Little Pine and Eagle Hills in the east.\n\nIn these Reserves there are only three Residential schools. Two of these schools are under the management of the Catholic church, one at Delmas and the other at Onion lake, the other being under the care of the Church of England. It is therefore obvious that unless the buildings be of a fairly large size they would not meet the requirements of the situation.\n\nIn these Reserves a very large percentage of the Indians belong to the Catholic Church and we the missionaries who attend to their spiritual welfare are utterly satisfied that unless our two schools can accommodate each 120 children or more, a certain number each year would be deprived of the benefits derived from the Residential schools.\n\nI may state also that the Indian agent, Mr. Turner and Doctor Hill share my contention in this matter. It is imperative that the matter be given immediate at-\nAttention as the plan such as it is, renders any addition to the building in the future impossible.\n\nFurthermore I would say that the building of a Residential school at Cold lake would in any way change the situation as the Cree will not send their children in a school where the majority of the children is Chipewyan. Our experience bears me out in this contention.\n\nHoping that my request will receive a favorable answer,\n\nI am, Honorable Sir,\n\nYour's faithfully,\n\n(Signed) Principal\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6324, file 659-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nJanuary 10, 1927.\n\nIn an effort to determine the amount of accommodation which should be provided in the new Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School, I have studied the census returns for the reserves which can be considered in this institution's regular recruiting district. There are a total of approximately 184 Roman Catholic children of school age in the area in question. 126 of these children are on the Onion Lake, Kesewewin, Frog Lake and Island Lake Reserves. Approximately 20 percent of these would be found physically unfit for residential school life. I therefore conclude that 100 children can be educated from these reserves if a campaign is carried on with success. I might point out that over 50 of the 60 children at present enrolled in the school come from these reserves.\n\nThere is another group of Indians that must be considered in connection with the Onion Lake R. C. Indian School, - the Chipewyans, Cold Lake, etc., with a Roman Catholic school population of 37 - 30 of whom would likely be fit. The school, however, has not been popular with the Chipewyans, as there are but 2 enrolled at present, yet there is a potential pupilage of about 25.\n\nThere are 20 Catholic children of school age belonging to the Meadow Lake Band, and the Onion Lake School is closest for them, but I find that they are all enrolled at Thunderchild.\n\nI consider that a pupilage of not more than 110 should be allowed. Mr. Orr states that the plans can be altered slightly to care for this number and that the estimate already prepared will not need any change.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Brown and Hudson, Winnipeg, $79,891.00\nWyndels Construction Co., St Boniface, $64,000.00\nR. N. Wyatt, Winnipeg, Man., $64,902.00\nJ. H.

General,\nOttawa.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of our proposed school's plan and specifications. Truly if the specifications are carried out to the letter the building will give entire satisfaction to all concerned. But will they be carried out? Undoubtedly it is the intention of the Department that the contractor complies with the specifications laid down. But you are well aware that they are not all reliable. Some are honest, some are not. Who will get the contract? Nobody knows yet. But who-ever gets it, I hope he will be reliable.\n\nIt is to be most desirable against any contract that the Dept. will have a good honest and experienced inspector to supervise the work at the very outset. I was told by Father Guy that His Lordship Bishop Charlebois and Father Buellet were both satisfied with their inspectors. And that either one or the other would give us entire satisfaction. We hope that the Dept. will see to it and appoint one of them as it is imperative that we should be protected.\n\nIt is a well known fact that green lumber has been used in the building of the School in the Church of England century, I am sure, to the specifications laid to the prejudice of the school. And I am well aware that the same man who sold green lumber to the contractor expects to do the same this year with our school. The agent or the inspector should I think be instructed by the Dept. to not allow any thing of the kind.\n\nThis winter and right now, the principal of the church of England's school has much trouble with the drainage system as the pipes are frozen and cannot locate the places that they have to carry water in barrels. The trenches as far I was told are only six or seven feet deep. Now in this country where there is not much snow the ground is liable to freeze eight or nine feet deep, so that the trenches ought to be not less than ten feet deep. I think that in Edmonton it is about the average depth of the trenches in the streets, if not more. I have not seen the specifications about the drainage but I hope that this fact is not overlooked. I must submit that the situation is serious. It is that point that it is of a paramount importance. Imagine the predicament we should be in were the pipes getting frozen specially in a place like ours where experienced men are scarce and hard to get.\n\nI understand that Mr. Graham has wired the Dept. about the location of our school. It is a good place for cultivation and beside a good spring which well utilized would give a good supply of water. But I submit that an expert man ought to be charged with the boring of the spring so that all the water it can give shall be secured.\n\nI thought dear Sir, that these informations might be of any interest to you and might help making a first class work of this building.\n\nYour very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6324, file 659-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:-\n\nOn the 19th of April I wired you that the Contractors stated there were no basement plans of steam mains, drain or radiation and I asked for a reply. Not having received a reply on the 23rd, I wired again. Today I received a reply stating:\n\n\"Radiation in basement shown on basement plan Onion Lake School\"\n\nI at once called up the Contractor, who made the statement that there were no plans, to bring over the plans, which he did, and the set that he had does not show any basement plan. It then occurred to me that the other set of plans, which was cut at the time I sent the first telegram, might contain the drainage and I find that it does. This was my reason for wiring you. There is only one set of basement heating and drains for the two sets of plans.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

H. CLARK & COMPANY LIMITED,\nPer\n\nEdward Allie\nSales.\nDear Sir,\n\nI presume that it is the intention of the Department to build a stable and poultry house for our new school right this summer as a matter of great necessity. Where the school is located there is no building of any kind that could be used for the purpose. In fact there is none whatever and it is imperative that the stable be built before we move in the new school. Very likely the work will be done and through in the middle of next winter and then if we have to move as we shall have to imagine the predicament we shall be in, having no building of any kind to stable our cattle and horses. As I said before it is of the utmost necessity that the stable and poultry house be built this summer so that next winter we shall have to move then we shall have the building to stable our stock.\n\nRe.- Building for the Principal.\n\nI have been told that the Department is willing to build a house for the principal only for the asking. I for one exceedingly desire of having a home for myself and my assistant. The prospect of having to live in the school with the children is to say the least, exceedingly contrary to my liking and inclination. And I think that only for the sake of safeguarding his influence over the children it is greatly desirable that the principal should live apart of the school in his own house. And since the Department is not contrary to the idea, I do ask the same to build a house for the Principal right this summer.\n\nThe building will be about the same as was built for Mr. Ellis, only a little larger as we intend to have Lay-Brothers to run our farm and machineries and naturally the principal's house will be theirs also, therefore necessitating a larger building. If the Hon. Deputy Supt. desires it I would be glad to forward him a sketch of the building I would like to get.\n\nI greatly wish that the house be built this summer in the same time as the school so that it would be easy then to arrange for the water system while the working men would be there on the spot working at the school.\n\nDear Sir, I would be exceedingly pleased were the Dept. in a position to gratify my demand which by the way is endorsed entirely by my Provincial, Father Boys, and you would do me a great favor which I will not easily forget were you using your influence in my behalf.\n\nThanking you for the anticipated favor, I remain, Your's truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Architect.\n\nWith reference to the Laundry Room in the proposed Indian School to be erected at Onion Lake, will you kindly advise us if this is the same size as the Laundry Room at the Indian School which was recently erected at Pelican Reserve.\n\nMessrs Brown and Hudson of this City have the contract for the Onion Lake School and we are figuring on the Laundry equipment and we also wish to figure the Transmission which includes Belting, Pulleys, etc.\n\nWe believe that same Transmission would be necessary for this as the last two Schools which were built in Alberta.\n\nThanking you for advising us in this connection, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWHB/T\n\nSTANLEY BROCK LIMITED.\nYesterday the inspector, Mr. Hamilton and myself in looking over the plan for our new residential school agreed that some minor alterations were advisable, namely:\n\n1. One outdoor for the boys and one for the girls recreation rooms. You will kindly notice that the children have access to their respective recreation room by passing through a corridor therefore increasing the burden of watching them when they go out and come in. The guardian would have to be in the corridor most of the time to watch them. An outdoor will do away with that inconvenience.\n\n2. There is no provision for a sitting room for the Indians when they come to see the principal on private business. They have to stay in the corridor or get in his office five or ten at a time. I would suggest that the principal's office be made a sitting room for the Indians and the present bed room for the principal be made his office and the next bed room be his own bed room. This alteration would be made by simply putting a door in the wall separating the principal's bed room and the next bed room.\n\n3. For the sake of privacy for the visitors, the principal and his assistant and also to dull the noise and escape the dust that comes from the class room and recreation room down below I strongly recommend that the corridor on the ground floor be closed at both ends by putting doors. I have heard many principal emphasizing the necessity of it and I strongly recommend it.\n\n4. I would suggest also to extend the verandah in order to give more room.\n\n5. To close the corridor leading to the girls dormitory by putting a door. Very important to prevent any undue access to the dormitory.\n\n6. A concrete reservoir for rain water.\n\n7. A 20 H.P. Engine at least.\n\nTotal: 6 doors 2 outside doors and 4 inside doors.\nExtension of verandah\nReservoir for rain water\n20 h.p. engine\n\nThese are the extras I beg to strongly recommend hoping that you would be kind enough to grant my demand entirely endorsed by the Inspector, Mr. Hamilton. Expecting a favorable answer,\n\nYours Truly,\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6324, file 659-5, part 2)\nDear Sir,\n\nIn looking over the plans of the R C Mission School here I note that there is no mention of where the pressure tanks for the water system are to be located, if it is the same system as the one installed in the Anglican Mission here which was placed underneath the floor of the machinery room and had to be excavated to receive them after the walls were built I would suggest that the place be prepared for them while the other excavating is being done, and would be done far cheaper now than to leave it till after the basement walls were in place. If it is your wish that the above mentioned work be done I would ask you to wire me to that effect as the Contractors are working in that locality doing their excavating.\n\nRegarding the water system and the Sewage disposal plant I would be pleased to receive your instructions as soon as possible so that the necessary arrangements can be attended to.\n\nUp to the present I have not received the Plans and Specifications, but as soon as I receive them I will look them over and any other information I may require I will take the matter up with you.\n\nAwaiting your instructions re the above, I remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department is prepared to give consideration to all of the items contained in this letter with the exception of the first and the fourth.

In looking over the amount of outlets we find the following: Basement 70, Ground Floor 50, First Floor 35, Second Floor 14, making a total of 169 outlets. Further note that reading the specifications each outlet is to be built to carry a maximum of 120 watts, per pendant outlet and 60 watts, per bracket outlet, also that there will be a 36\" x 54\" Rotary Laundry Tub and also a 26\" Extractor driven from the engine supplying electricity.\n\nWe would figure a safe capacity for the generator to be 60 watts, per outlet, making a total of 10.14 K.W. We would recommend for this service one 12\u00bd K.W. 110 volt direct current two wire Fairbanks Morse generator and one 20 H.P. Fairbanks Morse kerosene oil engine, one 12\u00bd K.W. Switchboard containing volt and ammeter, main switches and fuses, together with rheostat and board wiring also.\n\nWe would connect up this complete outfit as enumerated above, sending our mechanic for the work to Onion Lake, paying freight to the nearest railway point, you to arrange transportation of the equipment from the railway station to the hospital and place upon your foundations at that point. Foundation bolts will be supplied by us.\n\nWe would connect up the engine and generator, supplying necessary belt for same, to be of best quality special Spartan Dynamo.\n\nWe would wire the generator and switchboard ready and connect the mains from the switchboard, which we understand will be run to the board by the contractor putting in the electric fixtures and wiring.\n\nWe would supply this complete outfit as enumerated above for Two Thousand One Hundred Dollars ($2100.00)\n\nThanking you for the opportunity of quoting and hoping to be favored with your order, which will receive our best attention, we are\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE CANADIAN FAIRBANKS MORSE CO., LTD.\n\nPer (Sgd.)

I am\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction\nOnion Lake Aug 13th/27\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont\n\nAttention Mr A F MacKenzie\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn answer to your letter of Aug 4th re Water Supply System and Sewage Disposal Plant for the R C Indian School being erected here.\n\nReferring to the Water System I do not think that the system as installed in the Church of England here could be improved on as they tell me it is giving good satisfaction. You mentioned in your letter about an elevated water tank being suggested, but in my opinion it would not be satisfactory.\n\nRegarding the Disposal Plant, I would suggest the same design as the system installed at the Church of England School here. The lay of the land here is about the same as the other but the piping from the disposal tank would not be quite so far in this one, and I should judge that the tank might be made a little larger. I have written to the Provincial Department of Health for pamphlets explaining the requirements for a school of this size when I could forward you a sketch.\n\nThe water system as installed at the C of E School requires a well at the spring and a pump house with a gasoline engine and a pump, with a pipe line about 650 ft long of 2\u00bd\" pipe to storage tank near machinery room and also connected to two pneumatic pressure tanks about 4' x 12' with an automatic electric pump also a booster pump to supply air to tanks when required.\n\nIf the above system is to be installed, the pressure tanks should be put in at once if they are to be put under the machinery room floor which would have to be excavated to receive them as per my letter of July 4th.

Today I am sending a telegram to draw again your attention to this matter. I hope that the Department will see to it that our demand will be granted and that instruction will be given at once to go ahead with the building of the barn.\n\nIt will be almost impossible to move this winter in our new school if we have no barn to stable our stock, as there is no building of any kind around that could be used for that purpose. It is of the utmost importance that the building be put up this year while the building of our school is going on.\n\nI take also the liberty to ask the department to build a house for our farmer who is a married man with a family. We shall need the service of that man as soon as we take possession of the school and a building should be provided for him and his family right this summer. Will you kindly take this matter into serious consideration and give instruction to that effect. The present contractor could do the work of the barn and the farmer's house in the same time he is building the school.\n\nI beg to insist upon the urgency of these matters, and I hope that my suggestions will be acted upon as a failure to do so will put us in a very awkward situation.\n\nWith my best regard and wishes for your welfare,\n\nI am, Your's truly,\n\nS.

MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. Brown, Esq.,\nGeneral Contractor,\n791 Preston Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDear Sirs,\n\nAs Inspector of Construction at the new R C Indian Residential School being erected here I wish to submit to you the following Report on the progress made at the building since I arrived at the Site.\n\nI arrived at the site June 24th and found the Contractor at work at the excavating and building the temporary buildings for offices and storehouses and quarters for the men employed.\n\nThe work is progressing very slowly, being partly due to wet weather, delays on material and shortage of labor. The cement work for the walls of main building and footings for columns and partitions are in place. The outside studding is also in place for basement and ground floor and sheeted with shiplap up to the ground floor joists.\n\nThey are pouring concrete for walls of rear building under chapel, and they should have them completed this week if not held up for gravel which has been the cause of considerable of the delay in the past.\n\nPractically all the dimension lumber, shiplap, com boards flooring, siding and v joints are at the site. The flooring and siding though both is not according to the specifications, the flooring is a good grade but is 3/4\" face that it calls for and wider than 2 1/2\" face and on taking the matter up with the contractor he sent after the shippers and they said that it was a mistake in their office billing out the order, the siding is not up to the grade called for and I have refused to accept it unless it is culled out and the inferior material taken away from the job, the dimensions and shiplap is a good quality and the cement work is up to the standard.\n\nRegarding the flooring referred to above I would be pleased to have you send me some that will be acceptable as good a grade as can be procured and it being dried here a distance of over 30 miles it puts the contractors in a bad box for he could not sell it around here in ten years there is so much of it.\n\nI would be pleased hear from you as to the date the contract is supposed to be completed as they do not seem to be trying to push the job the way I think they should.\n\nThere are none of the subcontractors arrived at the job yet, but they expect the plumbing and heating men this week. The steel columns have all arrived at the site and the ones for the basement and ground floor are in place.\n\nThe above report is respectfully submitted for your consideration. I am\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction\nAugust 24, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 13th instant regarding certain changes in the layout at the new Onion Lake School, I beg to say that the Department approves of the changes as asked for by the Rev. Principal providing you can make arrangements with the contractor to make these changes without adding to the cost of the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F. MacKensie,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW.A. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Construction,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nAugust 24, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant I note that 3\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" face flooring has been delivered in place of 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" as specified. This will be satisfactory to the Department under the circumstances and by allowing the contractors to use this flooring it will probably be of assistance to you in settling other matters which may arise during the course of the construction. The contract calls for the completion of the building by the 8th day of December and I would ask you to advise the contractors that the Department expects and will insist on the building being completed by this date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F.

Mr Brown of Brown & Hudson has arrived on the 14th and has promised to let me have an estimate at once on the above mentioned work and will be forwarded to us as soon as I receive it from them.\n\nThere has been several changes which Father Lacombe the new principal at the school wishes and he tells me that he has taken the matter up with you direct.\n\nIn my letter of July 26th I referred to the corridors in the school being very dark and suggested obscure glass in the top panel but have not had your decision on the matter yet.\n\nThe above is respectfully submitted, I am\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction\nSept. 21st, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your report of the 13th instant, with reference to the progress of the work on the new N. C. Indian Residential School, and I note that the progress is slow. You should advise the Reverend Principal that if there are any changes he desires he should forward a list of them to the Department through you, and they should be accompanied by a price from the contractors and your recommendation.\n\nWith reference to providing glass in the door panels opening into the corridors you may authorize this change providing the contractor quotes you a satisfactory price.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a letter which has been received today from Brown and Hudson with reference to some changes, and I would be glad if you would send me your comments on same as to prices, also some details should be given by the contractors as to how the prices are arrived at. I would ask you to advise Brown and Hudson that in future all correspondence from them should pass through your hands.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. H.

(RG 10, Volume 6324, file 659-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 13th July, to Reverend Father Th\u00e9riaux, my predecessor, I respectfully beg to discuss over again with you the question of the verandah to be built on our new school.\n\nThe Reverend Sisters are sorely disappointed at your refusal to have the side verandah extended to at least 40 ft. long x 8 full feet wide. This verandah is for them practically the only place where they can have together a little bit of recreation and fresh air. There will be 14 or 15 Sisters in the new school; how can you expect them to enjoy their verandah when they will be so crowded inside that 20 ft. x 7 ft. bit of a space? The size of the verandah as shown on the plan is at least half too small to answer its real purpose.\n\nTherefore, in the name of our devoted Sisters, I respectfully beg that you reconsider your decision, and that you issue orders immediately to have this change made.\n\nFloors in the Basement.\n\nAnother matter, which we wish to ask you to reconsider, is the floors in the Basement.\n\nMost of the Principals of our new Residential Schools, in the West, are dissatisfied with the cement floors. I am aware that in some of these schools, they had to do away with said floors. The objection is that these floors are about impossible to keep clean, free from dust, unsanitary, etc. We fail to understand why your Architect is so persistent in having that kind of floors put in our schools. In some of our own private Institutions, we had made the same and experiment, and had to change that kind of floors.\n\nWould it not be a wise thing to try and avoid mistakes made in some other schools?\n\nMay I ask you to be so kind as to give this matter your most careful consideration, and to give orders accordingly?\n\nThe flooring material that the Contractors have on hand is not the kind called for in their contract, but it has been accepted by the Architect. Part of this cheaper flooring could be put in the basement, and real good flooring should be bought for the Ground Floor.\n\nI would like this new school to be a credit to your Department, and beyond criticism. Listening to criticism against Indian Department is about as insulting to me as if it were addressed to me personally.\n\nTrusting you will give this my first official letter your kindest consideration,\n\nI remain, Dear Sir, your most devoted\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs  \nOttawa Ont  \nattention Mr A F MacKenzie  \nFile # II5-8-15\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn answer to your letter of the 10th re Progress Estimate #2 in favor of Brown & Hudson on Contract for the R C Indian Residential School here, if you will look up Progress Estimate # One you will find that I have taken off 10% as per Contract, then in Progress Estimate # Two which includes all Labor and Material used at Building, including the material as specified in Progress Estimate # One.\n\nThe total amount of material and labor to date of Progress Estimate # Two being $21434.82 from which I deducted 10% namely $2143.48, leaving a balance after deducting the amount of Progress Estimate # One of $11068.20 which makes up Estimate # Two as my Certificate in favor of the Contractors show.\n\nHoping that the above explanation will be satisfactory to you and that an adjustment will be made to the satisfaction of all concerned, I remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction\nREGINA SASK SEPT 29 1109A\n\nTHE SECTY\n\nINDIAN DEPT OTTAWA ONT\n\nKINDLY SEND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR BARN ONIONLAKE ROMAN CATHOLIC SCHOOL\n\nW M GRAHAM\nSt Anthony's Indian Residential School,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nSeptember 29th 1927.\n\nD.G. Scott,\nDeputy Minister,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nAlthough you have been informed that the work on the new School here does not progress as fast as it might be expected nevertheless I am glad to say that the Department is not slow in attending to the out-buildings.\n\nMr. Mayo sent here by the Indian Commissioner, is now on the grounds and has started the building of the Barn, the only building for which he has any instructions so far. While Mr. Mayo is here, and has his men available, it seems to me that it would be most opportune to have him erect the other out-buildings.\n\nThere is required an Implement Shed, which should be 60ft. X 24ft.-At the other new Schools the Implement Shed has proved to be inadequate, and the size suggested is not out of proportion for all Machinery.\n\nA Hen-House, 32ft.X16ft., is also required, without having to add any further comment.\n\nAnother building, which is absolutely necessary, is the house for the Farm-Instructor who is a married man with family. And it seems to me that this house should be built this Fall without delay, as we are expected to move into the new School in the beginning of the coming year or very early in the Spring. Now would be the proper time to have this house built. Mr. Mayo has already built such houses on different Reserves. In our case, I would suggest the Bungalow Style; 18ft.X34ft., giving an accommodation of five rooms.-I may add that if the new School building there is no accommodation available for the Farm-Instructor and his family, Please do take this particular item into serious consideration.\n\nMr. Mayo informs me that he will complete the building of the Barn in two or three weeks. Therefore if your Department decides to have the other buildings erected, be good enough to send your instructions to Mr. Mayo, as soon as possible. The erection of these buildings at the present time and conditions would certainly prove to be a great economy to the Department.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We would point out that should it be necessary to install rigid conduits throughout the joists would have to be notched to allow of the installation, as the construction is of shiplap covered with metal ceiling.\n\nWe mention this as an added reason for permitting the use of flexible conduits, but speaking frankly, our main reason is that we estimated the job on this basis; have purchased material and have paid cartage on same to Onion Lake.\n\nWe would esteem it a favor if you would telegraph us your decision in the matter, so as to make as little delay as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMcDonald Willson Electric Limited\n\nSec.

Gen. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs Procurator for the Oblate Fathers, I have been visiting the R.C.Mission on the Onion Lake Reserve. And while here for the past three weeks, I had the occasion of seeing several times the new School now under construction.\n\nYour Inspector for the works must have reported that this construction is progressing very slowly. Indeed the Contractor has lost a month, if not two months of very favorable weather during which he could have rushed the outside work, if he had employed a sufficient number of men, or paid the ordinary wages. The fact is that at the present only the boards have been put on the main part of the roof, and so far no pitch or gravel has been laid on same in order to have the inside of the building dry and fit to work inside. Even today very few men are on the job, and not very competent at that. I think something has to be done to compel the Contractor to move a little faster, if it is expected that the building will be ready for occupation in the spring.\n\nMoreover it seems as if the Contractor is trying to evade many details of the Specifications and curtail the work. Fortunately the Inspector, Mr. Hamilton, a capable man, is constantly on the job and on the look out; in fact he scarcely dares to absent himself.\n\nIt appears even that the Contractor, wanting to pass over the head of the Inspector, claims to command influence with some Officials at Ottawa. So it might be advisable to follow up more closely.\n\nI thought it my duty, Dear Sir, to call your attention to this matter, for the better interests of the Department, and for the sake of the School building itself which we are to occupy and manage.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nA. Haussman, O.M.I\nProcurator.\nOct. 21, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has been advised by the Church authorities that very poor progress is being made in the erection of the new Onion Lake Indian Residential School, and I would draw your attention to the fact that your contract calls for the completion of this building by the 8th day of December. It was on this understanding that your tender was accepted and a contract let, and you are hereby notified that the Department expects you to complete the building by the above mentioned date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

They did not include in their tender the following material, the glazed tile for sewer, the fittings for the septic tank and the manhole covers as they could not get quotations here. On inquiry here I have been given to understand that the above would cost in the neighbourhood of $650.00\n\nThe Water supply machinery as quoted in Brown & Hudsons Tender was from the sub-contractor for the plumbing and heating at the school here and could be used for either tenders but which I consider is high too, and would suggest that prices be secured from Saskatoon and Regina re this work.\n\nYou will notice in Brown & Hudsons estimate they suggest that the work be done on a basis of Labor and Material plus 10% for supervision.\n\nIn my estimation the price given by Mr M Rhinhart & T Rivard is about the price the work should be done for.\n\nI have written to Faulin & Swayze of Regina for a quotation as they installed the water supply system in the other school, but up to the present I have not received their quotation, and as the weather is not to be depended on this time of the year I thought it advisable to forward the inclosed estimates, and would ask your consideration of same and if you thought it advisable the excavating could be started & the rest could be arranged for later.\n\nAwaiting your decision in the matter I remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction\nDear Mr. Scott:-\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Rev. Father Lacombe, Principal of the new R.C. Indian Residential School at Onion Lake, enclosing a copy of one addressed to you regarding outbuildings at that institution.\n\nIt would be impossible to put up additional buildings at this late date. By the time Mr. Maych finishes his work on the agency house and the school barn the season will be well advanced. Carrying on building operations in the winter season is not at all satisfactory and I am of the opinion that the matter of erecting these additional buildings should be left in abeyance until the early spring, which is the proper time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. H. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOctober 10, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 309-11A of the 5th instant, with reference to the request of Reverend Father Lacombe that additional outbuildings be provided this year at the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School. I may say that the Department is not recognizing Father Lacombe as the Principal of this institution and the Provincial of the Oblate Order has agreed to the retention of Father Therien after a short sick leave. I am not directing any answer to Father Lacombe's letter of the 29th ultimo, as on September 2nd I wrote Father Therien that the farmer's residence could not be erected this year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

I advised them to that effect but they do not seem to worry about it; they have not got half the number of men they should have, and when I objected to the delay they claimed they could not get suitable men for the work, and they promised to procure some men from outside of the district.\n\nThe main part of the building is closed in and the storm sash are mostly fitted, the rest of the building is not closed in yet owing to the delay of the heating boilers not being on the job and which has held up the cement work of boiler room. The heating boilers are now in place and the cement walls are about completed. The siding is being put on the main building and the painters are following up with their work. The plumbing work is being carried on as fast as can be expected under the circumstances. The weather during the past month has been very unfavorable for outside work as we have had some very cold weather and snow and there has been a lot of wind and rain. It will be some time yet before the lathing and plastering can be started, and as the weather may turn cold at any time now the heating plant should be in operation in case the weather should turn cold when the plastering is being done.\n\nThe sub contractor for the electric wiring shipped material here for their work and instead of sending rigid conduit they sent the flexible conduit. I objected to the change and took the matter up with the underwriter's association, and they wired me that rigid was the best and carried a better rate of insurance, so I notified the contractors to that effect and they are getting after the sub contractors re same.\n\nThe felt and gravel roofing contractors have not arrived yet but their material is all here, they are expected here next week. The material for the metal work has arrived and is being delivered to the site. The grading of the earth around the building is being done and should be completed in a couple of weeks.\n\nThe above report is respectfully submitted.\n\nI remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector\n\nP.S.

We supplied nine cars of material, the last being supplied on Sept 28th.\n\nMr. Brown was in our office today, and disputes the balance of the account which is \u00a31,924.49.

At the present time they have only three carpenters and three helpers on the work at the present time when they should have at least fifteen. They have increased the rate for carpenters lately or they would not have any working now. Mr Hudson the junior member of the firm that has charge of the work, and I have had more trouble making them comply with the plans and specifications than I had in the last five years. I think the most of the trouble in trying to get out of work required by the specifications is caused by Mr Brown who seems to think that it is not necessary to consider them when it suits their own ends.

The specifications distinctly state that all conduit where occurring in masonry is to be of the rigid type. The contractor is therefore left the option of installing the balance of the conduit in rigid or flexible type. I may say, with reference to the Church of England School that the same specification was used, but the contractors chose to use the rigid type.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Electricians say only one grade.\n\nThe B X Armoured Cable includes the wire complete and if anything goes wrong with it at any time it would be necessary to remove the plaster and ceiling to get at it.\n\nThe specifications call for conduit installation and that the wires are not to be inserted till after the plastering is completed & the conduit must be arranged that the wires may at any time be inserted or withdrawn, and on the strength of this I objected to the material that was shipped here and notified the contractor at once to that effect.\n\nHoping that the above will explain why I took the stand I did in the matter.

Dir.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nNov. 9, 1927.\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nDetailed estimates have been obtained by Mr. W. A. Hamilton, Inspector of the new Onion Lake School, for the construction of a water supply and sewerage system in accordance with a brief specification prepared by him. One tender only has been furnished the Department, that is from the contractors for the building, Messrs. Brown and Hudson, amounting to $12,591.00, which price is considered by both the Inspector and myself to be unreasonable. It is suggested by the contractors that the work be carried out on a cost plus percentage basis, which course I do not recommend under the present circumstances.\n\nIt is not expected that this building will be ready for occupation before the spring, and in view of the advanced season I would strongly recommend that the Dominion Water Power Branch of Calgary be requested to prepare the necessary plans and specifications and obtain tenders for all work in connection with the above mentioned systems. I have already the assurance of their head office that they will consent to undertake this work at once, owing to the fact that they are not pressed with work of this kind at the present time.\n\nI would suggest that alternative prices be obtained, that is a price for the execution of the work as soon as the tender is awarded, and one for its performance as soon as weather conditions permit next spring. This would enable the Department to proceed with the undertaking should the difference between the two contract prices justify this course.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In reply if the Church Authorities could understand the difficulties of doing work in almost continued wet weather they would probably make no complaint.\n\nFor your information, material had to be conveyed thirty miles. On several occasions roads were impassable two weeks at a time and the men could only get in two to three days a week owing to rain. You can see for yourself the difficulties in making progress under these conditions. However the building outside is finished and the plumbing contractor informs me he can turn on heat as soon as he gets a water supply. If there is no delay on the latter account good progress can now be made.\n\nIt is also reported to me you have a letter from P.T. Roberts to withhold his claim for lumber. The above firm was paid in accordance with their contract but their material was off-grade to 40% which had to be replaced. Balance of Four or Five Hundred Dollars is coming to them when adjustments are made and is available for them any time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBROWN & HUDSON\n\nIndian Affairs.

Specifications, briefly outlining the nature of the work, have been prepared by Mr. W. A. Hamilton, Inspector of Construction on this work, and prices were obtained in accordance with these specifications from local contractors for the entire proposed work. The quotations received, after being examined by the Departmental Engineer, were found to be excessive. In view of the importance of the work I would like to know whether it would be convenient for your Department to undertake the preparation of the necessary plans and specifications, and obtain competitive prices in the regular manner, in order that the work might be proceeded with as early as possible. It is suggested that alternative prices be obtained, that is a price for the execution of the work as soon as a tender is awarded, and one for its performance as early in the spring as weather conditions will permit.\n\nI am enclosing herewith for your information a copy of a tender submitted by the contractor for the building in connection with the above mentioned work.

We regret to advise you that we are unable to do this.\n\nWe wired your Mr. Hudson at Onion Lake, asking how much shiplap he had on hand which he would not require, and he wired as follows:\n\n\"Hard to say so scattered perhaps two or three thousand feet.\"\n\nIn our letter under date of July 30th, we advised you that there was 7,297 over shipped, and that you were at liberty to dispose of the same at the local lumber yard, and we would allow any difference. We will take the two or three thousand feet or whatever you have cut out there, and will accept $25.00 per thousand feet for the shiplap which ran over the amount ordered, but which you have used in the construction of the building. We make this offer without prejudice.\n\nThere seems to be a very small difference between us, and we are anxious to get the matter settled up. We handled this order on a very small margin, and so we require to be paid for whatever lumber you may have used. Thanking you for prompt attention to this matter, we are,\n\nYours truly,\n\nP.T.

I remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nI have done all in my power to get the contractors to have the building completed in the time specified in the contract and I took the matter up with Mr Brown and informed him that you insisted in having it completed by December 8th, and the only answer I could get was that there was no penalty mentioned in the contract but that they would complete the work as soon as they possibly could.\n\nI received a telegram from you some time ago about having an engineer sent here from Calgary to lay out the Sewer and Water System and prepare plans for same but up to the present time there has been no one came yet. As the weather is very cold here just now it would be advisable to have the work started as soon as possible if it is to be done this winter. The rain water tank and sewer will need to be completed before the thaw and rain in the spring as the rain water down pipes from roof are connected and if the rain came it would flood the basement. In my estimation it would be better to have the excavating done now than in the spring as there is only about two feet of frost in the ground now but in the spring there will be over six feet. Hoping to hear of your decision in the matter at your earliest convenience, I remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter of the 14th received re information you received from Mr Brown, informing you that the outside of the school building is finished, which I may say is not correct and I would refer you to my report to you of the 16th which is the correct. At the present time the carpenters are putting the siding on the chapel and which will not be completed till late next week.\n\nThe heating plant for the building is about ready for operation as soon as the contractors get the chimney completed which will be some time next week. In reference to the water for the heating system I referred Mr Brown to the same clause in the specifications as you mentioned and I am very sorry that he still persists in writing to you about those matters after being notified by me of your instructions given in your letter to me dated Sept 21st.\n\nIn connection with the Laundry Machinery referred to in your letter, Mr Brown took the matter up with me last September and I told him that the specifications were plain in the matter and that it was not necessary to have Canadian Laundry Machinery Co machines as long as the other makes were equal in quality and size as mentioned in the specifications, the trouble with him was that he wanted to put in a smaller sized washer than the one specified as someone told him that it would be big enough for the school.\n\nThe work on the school is away behind where it should be,\nDec. 8, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to confirm the telegram sent you today as follows:\n\n\"Cheque payment certificate No. 4 sent you thirty-sixth ultimo.\"\n\nI would point out that your contract calls for the completion of this building on the eighth day of December.

I would like to know if they got permission from you for the change when they took the matter up about the wiring as they never mentioned it to me till I asked them where the switch board was, they seem to take a lot of things for granted.\n\nI would be pleased to hear from you re Electric Lighting Plant and if you would wish me to get Quotations on same.\n\nThe Principal of the School asks to have a high pressure boiler installed to be used for laundry purposes the same as installed in the other schools. I have asked the heating contractor for an estimate on same and also a pump in the laundry room for the rainwater tank and as soon as I receive the price I will forward same to you.\n\nAwaiting your reply re the above, I remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction\nDear Sirs,\n\nI hereby wish to submit to you the following report on the construction of the Roman Catholic Indian Residential School here.\n\nThe weather has been very cold since the beginning of the month which has delayed the outside work considerably. The siding is all on with the exception of the rear end and the west side of the chapel. The siding which is in place has all received the first coat of paint and some of it has been seconded coated. There has not been anything done to the front and side verandahs yet except the cement piers. The inside work is going slowly, the first and second floors are about ready for plastering and the plasterer has started work at the first floor. The heating plant has been in operation since Dec 3rd. The plumbing is well advanced, the electrical work is keeping ahead of the lathers. The several subcontractors are doing their best to keep from holding up any of the work.\n\nAt the present time there are six carpenters and three helpers, three laborers, one electrician, two lathers, two steam fitters, one plumber and helper, two plasterers and three laborers.\n\nThe heating boilers should be washed out by this time but as the sewer has not been put in yet it is almost impossible to have it done under present conditions. In connection with the sewer it is very necessary to have it put in at the earliest possible time as I understand from the residents that there is generally a thaw about the middle of January, and if it comes this year and the rainwater pipes connected the water from the roofs will all go into the basement and will have a tendency to injure the foundation.\n\nThere has been nothing heard of the engineer who you notified me was coming in connection with the sewer and water system at the school.\n\nThe above report is respectfully submitted from\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction\nDec. 22, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 15th instant, I beg to say that no permission has been given to the electrical contractor to make any changes in the switch board, as specified for the Onion Lake School, and you should advise them that the work must be carried out in accordance with the specifications, otherwise it will not be accepted. You might submit a price and recommendation for an electric lighting plant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. A.

Rand, School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. dated\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 1\nMr Duncan C Scott Esq  \nDeputy Supt General  \nDept of Indian Affairs  \nOttawa Ont\n\nDear Sir  \nI hereby take the liberty of writing you asking to have the following matters taken up with the parties in charge of that branch of the work.\n\nThere are a number of changes and extras referred to your Department for consideration in connection with the Roman Catholic Residential School here, and which if any of them are to be carried out it would be necessary to have your instructions so that the work could be done while the tradesmen are at the job, as the prices were quoted on that understanding.\n\nThe items which I refer to are as follows, and as for the price and details of same you will find on file.\n\nThe Rain Water Tank to receive the water from the roof, and the way it is now there is no place for the water to go but in the basement. The Sewer from the boiler room which will be necessary to take care of the overflow from the rainwater tank and also to take the water from the heating boilers when same are being cleaned out which should have been done before this, but there is no place for the water to go but into the basement which would not do as it would be impossible to keep a certain amount of the water from soaking in around the footings which would be injurious and might cause a settlement of the building at that point.\n\nThe Principal and Sisters are very anxious to have wood floors in the dining rooms, recreation rooms, kitchen and serving rooms.\n\nThe Screen Windows are specified as half screens and they ask for full screens as the top part of the window requires to be opened about as often as the bottom, and in that case it would make the half screens not of much effect.\n\nThey also ask for partitions at each end of the corridors on ground and first floors to separate the class rooms and dormitories from the executive and staff quarters with a door in each partition.\n\nIn the specifications it does not call for paper under metal roof or ceilings which have a tendency of making the top floors very hot in summer and cold in winter, and the principal asks for one ply of paper and a ply of thin lumber between the shiplap and metal ceilings which come directly under the roofs in top floors and the chapel also the one story parts.\n\nThere are some changes asked for in the plumbing but the price for same I considered was too high and asked the contractor to reconsider it but up to the present time I have not received his decision.\n\nYou will greatly oblige by having the above looked into and for particulars you will find on file # II5-8-15 and let me know by\nwire your decision in the matter as all the work mentioned above should be in hand now if it is decided to have it carried out, the weather has been very mild here lately and they are having a big job disposing of the water from the roof.\n\nYour interest in the above will be greatly appreciated. I am\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction\nSend the following Night Letter, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nW. A. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Construction,\nOnion Lake Residential School,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nMay authorize the following additional work Onion Lake School:\nPartitions in corridors. One ply heavy building paper on ceilings under roof. Can you suggest temporary arrangements for keeping building free from water until Water Power Engineers have prepared plans.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\n\nChg. DIA.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs  \nOttawa ont\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nI hereby submit the following report as Inspector of Construction at the Roman Catholic Indian Residential School here.\n\nThe first two days of the month was very cold, registering 54 below zero on Sunday and 42 below Monday, then turning milder on Tuesday and continued so till the 12th then turning colder with no change up to the present time.\n\nThe plastering is well advanced, the second floor is finished plastering, the first floor is completed with the exception of the two dormitories which is not quite in shape for the finish coat. The chapel is ready for the carpenters to put the finish on, the ground floor is receiving the finish coat of plaster where the first coat is in shape to receive it, the basement has not been first coated yet but they expect to start the beginning of the week.\n\nThere are no cement floors put in yet, the electrical contractor is well advanced with their work also the plumbing and heating contractor.\n\nSince the mild weather set in the carpenters have been erecting the front verandah and which is well advanced.\n\nAt the present time there are six carpenters, two plasterers and a helper, one metal worker, one electrician, one plumber and helper four laborers, one truck driver and the general foreman.\n\nAlthough the contractors are away behind the time that they were supposed to have the building completed they are going ahead as fast as they can at the present time under the circumstances.\n\nThe Sister Superior in charge of the mission school here made a request to the department some time ago for an extension to the verandah at the east end of the school, the request being turned down they have taken the matter up with the contractors who gave an estimate on the work, so they have asked the contractor to proceed with the work and for which they are paying for themselves and which is hoped will meet with your approval.\n\nThe above report is respectfully submitted by\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction\n\nP.S. You will oblige by forwarding some stationery to me as I have none on hand.\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| January 27 | To freight on the following, from Lloydminster to Onion Lake, for new R.

At the present time the ceiling is in place at the ground, first and second floors, also the chapel ceiling and they are well advanced at basement ceiling.\n\nThe woodwork is also well advanced, the interior finish and doors is nearing completion and the painters have most of the work stained. Some of the tradesmen are working overtime.\n\nThe contractor is making arrangements to have the cement floors put in the basement, the main stairs are being erected also the finish floor is being laid in second floor.\n\nThe heating men are at work putting radiators in their permanent position wherever the work is advanced enough to allow them.\n\nThe plumbers have all their material prepared and in readiness to be installed when the carpenters and painters are advanced enough to allow them.\n\nThere is considerable outside work to be done yet but on account of the cold weather lately they have not been able to advance very fast.\n\nThe old Roman Catholic Mission School Buildings at Onion Lake were burnt to the ground Friday night Feb 10th, their church was also burnt and they are now without a school.\n\nThere has been no word received yet of the Engineer who is supposed to come here to lay out the sewer and water system and prepare plans for same, if possible this work should be rushed as the Mission is very anxious to get moved into the school and they ask that immediate steps be taken re the sewer and water system as they want this work done before they move in.\n\nThey ask for shelving in store rooms, kitchen, bakery & laundry also lockers in dormitories, seating in chapel also seats in the recreation rooms, there is no mention of this work in the specifications but if it is the intention of the department to have this work done for the mission I could have a list of the material for their requirements and get quotations on the material so that the work may be attended to as soon as the contractors had their work completed.\n\nThe above report is respectfully submitted and I await your further instructions. I remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction\nJanuary 30th, 1928.\n\nMr. W. A. Hamilton,\nInspector of Construction,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nDear Sirs\u2014\n\nWith further reference to our letter of January 19th with reference to an electric lighting plant for the new Roman Catholic Indian Residential School being erected at Onion Lake, we have had our electrical man look over the plan for this building and we feel sure that 15 H.P. engine with a 10 K.W. generator will furnish you with sufficient current for your requirements. We note that you ask that we should quote you on this plant installed ready to turn on the lights, but there are so many conditions involved, of which we have no knowledge, that it is not possible for us to quote you in this way. For instance we have no means of arriving at how much it would cost us to have the plant transported from the freight sheds at Onion Lake to the School, or do we know what facilities there might be for getting the necessary gravel, sand and cement for foundation work, and we are sure that you will realise that it would be impossible to quote you a price without having sufficient information upon which to base our figures. We are therefore offering you the complete equipment, f.o.b., the cars at Onion Lake. If you have a contract on this building he will no doubt be able to give you a price on the transportation of the plant to the school, and also on the necessary foundation work. Our price does include the services of our expert to check over the installation, and start the engine, and we have assumed that you can make some arrangement for board and lodging for him while he is at Onion Lake.\n\nOur quotation is attached herewith, and we are offering you our type \"T\" style \"H\" horizontal modified Diesel Fuel Oil Engine, in the special electric modification, which we have found to be a most\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is simple in construction, and extremely economical in operation and in maintenance. As an instance we might mention that three years ago last July we sold a 15 Hp engine and 10 K.W. generator to Mr. W. H. Bagot at Muenz, Sask., and he reported to us this summer that after three years of operation, he had not missed one nights run and his total cost for repairs on his engine was less than $2400, while he had not found it necessary to touch the generator at all. There are many other installations in Western Canada giving just as good service, and if you wish we should be pleased to give you the names of a number of users.\n\nWe trust that you will find our quotation satisfactory and hope that we may have the privilege of furnishing this equipment for you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTHE CANADIAN FAIRBANKS MORSE CO.

The switchboard for control would be the standard equipment used with this plant.

Those children whose homes are on the Onion Lake reserve have already been taken away by their parents.\n\nWith regard to the origin of the fire, nothing seems to be known. A strange circumstance is that earlier in the same day a fire was discovered in another part of the building, quite remote from where the fire later in the day broke out. It appears that about noon the girl's dormitory was seen to be full of smoke, and the Sisters investigating this, one of the beds was discovered to be on fire. The only possible cause can account for this fire is that perhaps a spark had flown from the stove to the bed earlier in the morning when the fire was lighted; and then when the bed had been made up, had been covered up, and had smouldered and later broken out in flame. The bed found afire was not far from the stove. This small fire was completely put out and I do not think can have any connection with the main one. It is possible that one or more of the school boys could have smoked up into the attic, where the fire came out, and perhaps have smoked there, but I cannot find that any did so. I do not think the fire can have originated from a spark from the chimney, which, although an old one, appeared sound. Most of the best clothing belonging to the institution was kept in the attic, and was a total loss.\n\nAfter the children are taken away by their parents, I do not suppose there will be more than twenty left for the Sisters to look after; these will be quite comfortable in the old Anglican buildings, and can stay there until the new school is ready for occupation, when they can remove into it; and the other children can be brought back from their homes.\n\nAs the old Anglican buildings are the property of the Anglican Diocese, after placing the children and staff in them I wired for Bishop Lloyd's approval of this action, and received the following reply:\n\n\"Bishop says certainly. Only ordinary Christian courtesy.\"\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Children and staff all safe. Children are being housed temporarily in old Anglican school. An writing.\"\n\nand to report that at about 6 o'clock last evening an Indian passing the school noticed smoke rising from the roof of the building and at once informed the Sisters in charge, who immediately alarmed the whole neighbourhood. I hurried to the building, summoning all the help I could find. We found the fire burning in the attic over the boy's dormitory close to the chimney. At first it seemed possible that the building could be saved, but it was so difficult to get water to where it was needed, it having to be carried by hand up four flights of stairs inside, and up a long ladder on the outside, that the flames gained upon us, and the attempt to save the building had to be given up, and the energy of the workers directed to saving as much of the contents as possible; and by this means we managed to save a lot of the bedding and clothing, and most of the lighter articles of value. In the meantime the flames had spread rapidly, and we soon had to beat a hasty retreat from the main building. Our efforts were then directed to trying to save the church, about 50 feet west of the school, and the laundry and store buildings, about 50 feet north of the school. As the flames were driving westward the attempt to save the church had to be abandoned and the building was soon ablaze, but we were successful in saving the laundry and store buildings to the north; the Principal's residence was also saved.\n\nI then spoke to the Rev. Father Balter, the principal, and the Sister Superior, with respect to how we should arrange to house the children and staff, and offered them the use of the old Anglican School buildings for the time being, which they gratefully accepted, and we have since removed all the bedding and other belongings saved, to that place.\n\nAs it appeared that the situation would be relieved considerably if the children could be taken to their homes, at the request of the Principal I have sent word to the outlying reserves for the parents to come to Onion Lake for their children and take them home for the present.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The high standard of excellence which characterizes these engines assures buyers that the Marshall Engine represents all that wide investigation and experience deem best to attain economic and reliable operation. At the same time they present that pleasing symmetry of design which has long been a notable characteristic of Marshall Engines.\n\nMarshall Oil Engines are widely and successfully employed as prime movers in all parts of the world for industrial and agricultural duties of all kinds, including driving machinery in factories, sawmills, brickyards, flour mills, elevators, laundries, creameries, and other places where space, cleanliness and economy are considerations. The engines are also particularly suitable for electric lighting work, irrigation and drainage pumping, sewage disposal work, refrigerator plants, etc.\n\nThe engines are constructed in various sizes from 16 b.h.p. to 300 b.h.p. The sizes up to 25 b.h.p. are of horizontal design, and can if desired be mounted on trucks to form portable units. The models of 30 b.h.p. and upwards are all of vertical design, being constructed with one, two or four cylinders according to the horsepower.\n\nAny of the following fuels can be successfully used with these engines: American, Argentine, Peruvian and Texan Crude Petroleums, Russian Naphtha, Gasoleum, Diesoleum, Resoleum, Admiralty Fuel Oil, Anglo-Mexican Fuel Oil, Scotch Shale Oil, Lucigan, Solar, Russian Vaporizing Oil, Russian and American Refined Petroleums, Mazoot, Astatki, Gas Oil, Palm Oil, etc.\nMARSHALL OIL ENGINES\nTYPE \"S\"\n\nHORIZONTAL STATIONARY MODEL\n\nAmong marked advantages obtainable with a Marshall Stationary Engine for permanent installation, is the small ground space required compared with that necessitated for a steam plant of corresponding power, and only inexpensive foundations are necessary. Brief instruction to any man of average intelligence suffices to enable him to run the engine and give it the small attention it needs; and owing to ease of starting, it can be worked intermittently as required. This model is arranged to run with the fly-wheels rotating away from the cylinder, but special engines with reversed rotation can be supplied if specially ordered.\n\nPORTABLE MODEL\n\nThe construction of the portable model follows generally the specifications given on pages 9 and 10. The engine is mounted on a steel frame truck of rigid design, with strong axles, undergear and wrought iron travelling wheels. Shafts or pole for horse draught can be supplied at customer's option. Suitable chocks for holding the engine in proper working position are supplied in the standard equipment.\n\nWater and fuel tanks of ample capacity are fixed to the frame. A belt-driven centrifugal pump ensures circulation of water for cooling the engine cylinder. An atmospheric cooler is provided, the circulating water being kept at a suitable temperature by meeting cold air currents drawn through the cooler by the action of the engine exhaust. Portable engines are arranged to run with the fly-wheels rotating towards the cylinder.\nMARSHALL OIL ENGINES\nTYPE \"SV\"\n\nVERTICAL MODELS\n\nThe illustration shows a standard Marshall Vertical Oil Engine which can be supplied in a range of powers from 30 to 300 brake horsepower, in models with one, two or four cylinders, according to the power required. These engines are particularly suited for heavy industrial power purposes for factories, mills, pumping stations, electricity stations, etc. They operate on any of the crude oils mentioned on page 1, and are capable of making continuous runs of long duration. No gases, fumes or products of combustion can escape into the engine room, which can thus be kept clean, hygienic and business-like. They provide economy of floor space, running costs and labor.\n\nMARSHALL OIL ENGINES\nTYPE \"SV\"\n\nVERTICAL TWO CYLINDER MODEL\n\nSTANDARD DIMENSIONS\n\n| Horse Power | Rev.

Just before the termination of the power stroke the piston \"D\" uncovers the exhaust ports \"E\" at the lower end of the cylinder, and the air ports \"F\" on the opposite side of the cylinder. Air under pressure from the crankcase rushes through the ports \"F\" and sweeps out the products of combustion through the exhaust ports and leaves the cylinder full of pure air.\n\nThe top of the piston is shaped to distribute the air to all parts of the cylinder, and this ensures efficient scavenging.\n\nThe piston then commences the compression stroke. At about the end of this stroke, the fuel is injected into the vaporizer \"G\" through the sprayer \"H\" in a fine spray which mixes thoroughly with the compressed air. A combustible mixture is thus formed and it is fired by the heat of the vaporizer and the compression pressure.\n\nThe Two Cycle Operation enables a regular turning effort to be obtained. The Flywheel receives an impulse every revolution which is given without shock, consequently very smooth working results and an even torque are obtained. This combination of ideal conditions in the MARSHALL ENGINE ensures remarkable smoothness of running, reliability, and capacity for making steady runs of long duration, with little attention.\n\nThe combustion is so complete that practically no deposit is formed; therefore the vaporizer and cylinder interior need very little cleaning.\n\nThe engine is so designed that water injection to the cylinder is not necessary under any conditions of working. The governor accurately times the moment of ignition as well as proportions the quantity of fuel injected. The vaporizer will remain sufficiently heated to ensure perfect ignition without the aid of the lamp even when the engine is running on light loads and no adjustment is required.\n\nNo air or exhaust valves are required in the cylinder head or the cylinder of the Marshall Oil Engine. By the elimination of such valves and their intricate operating gear, the chief trouble experienced with oil engines has been avoided. Moreover the number of working parts has been reduced to a minimum, with a consequent reduction in the wear and tear on the engine.\n\nThe cylinder is fitted with easily removable liners, which can be renewed if necessity should arise without the large expenses that would be incurred in replacing the complete cylinder.\nMARSHALL OIL ENGINES\n\nSYSTEM OF WORKING\n\nMARSHALL OIL ENGINES operate on the successful and well-established two-stroke cycle, which is fully explained on page 6. To start the engine the vaporizer cap at the top of the cylinder must be heated for a few minutes with the lamp provided\u2014a sufficiently high temperature for starting is quickly obtained. As soon as the engine is running at normal speed the lamp is no longer required. The vaporizer is correctly proportioned so that the combustion temperature is maintained at all loads.\n\nA charge of air is compressed in the cylinder at a pressure of approximately 150 lbs. per square inch. This is sufficiently high to ensure maximum economy in working, but is not great enough to make starting a difficult operation. Self-starting apparatus is supplied with all the larger models.\n\nAt the correct moment oil fuel is injected in the form of a finely atomized spray. The temperature of the vaporizer, due to the heating lamp, or to previous explosions, suffices to fire the mixture. This simple method is so automatic in action that complicated ignition gear and continuous lamp heating are unnecessary.\n\nThe design of the Marshall Engine on the two-stroke principle successfully obtains the economy of the high compression oil engine, and with other advantages peculiar to the reduced pressures of the low compression engine it possesses a marked superiority over both types as regards simplicity in mechanical detail and operation. In the Marshall Engine there is no complicated ignition system and there are no valves\u2014two sources of great trouble with many engines of other design.\n\nThe Marshall Engines will work on most mineral oils up to .92 specific gravity, but the best results are obtained from fuels with specific gravity of from .85 to .9 and a calorific value of not less than 19,000 B.T.U.'s per lb. With good crude oil, fuel consumption at full load is less than a half-pint per brake horsepower per hour, the consumption varying slightly according to the size of the engine, i.e., the larger the engine the greater the economy. (On three-quarter load the consumption would be increased about 6% and by about 20% on half-load.)\n\nMARSHALL OIL ENGINES\n\nGENERAL SPECIFICATIONS\n\nTHE MARSHALL OIL ENGINE is of massive proportions, all the working parts and bearing surfaces are of liberal dimensions, all components are readily accessible, and the engine is specially designed for heavy duty and for making long continuous runs. The engine is of totally enclosed design, and is capable of developing its rated load when running at the standard speed, and suitable crude or refined oil. The engine will also carry an overload of 10% for short periods.\n\nThe ENGINE BED is a massive and well supported casting with an oil channel at its base. The top facing is machined to take the cylinder trunk which forms the upper part of the crankcase and cylinder jacket. Also the bed is accurately bored to receive the main bearings.\n\nThe MAIN BEARINGS are of the split type, provided with adjustable steps of the finest grade anti-friction bearing metal, and are of most liberal dimensions. They are specially designed to ensure accessibility and perfect lubrication and to prevent leakage of oil.\n\nThe CRANKSHAFT is of substantial proportions, machined from mild steel forging and accurately balanced.\n\nThe CONNECTING ROD is a solid mild steel forging carefully machined and fitted with adjustable bearings at both ends.\n\nThe PISTON is made of close grained cast iron, of ample strength, provided with five \"Ramsbottom\" rings; it is fitted with a specially hardened steel pin to receive the connecting rod.\nThe CYLINDER is fitted with a detachable liner, formed of a separate casting of special close-grained metal, accurately bored and finished. This liner is easily removable, and is fitted into the cylinder casing in such a way as to make it watertight, and at the same time allow freedom for expansion and contraction as its temperature changes. The ports are arranged so that the piston correctly controls the periods of air admission and exhaust.\n\nThe bed and cylinder trunk together form an air-tight chamber and our own special air inlet valves are fitted at front and back of the trunk. No other valves are needed in the engine.\n\nThe VAPORIZER is of special design, carefully proportioned to ensure complete combustion, and the engine can be worked continuously for long periods without cleaning. The cylinder head is of simple construction. No air or exhaust valves are required and the stresses due to unequal expansion are thus avoided. Ample facilities are provided for cleaning the water-jacketed spaces.\n\nThe SHAFT GOVERNOR is of the centrifugal spring-loaded type, and highly sensitive. It operates by altering the length of the fuel pump stroke and the time that the fuel is injected; thus giving an explosion in the cylinder every revolution. The speed can be varied about 10% when the engine is running, i.e., about 6% below and 15% above normal.\n\nThe FUEL PUMP is of our own design, simple in construction, positive in action and adjusted to deliver the correct supply of fuel to the vaporizer on what is known as the solid injection principle; thereby dispensing with the use of compressed air for fuel injection. A distinct feature of the Marshall engines is that the governor and fuel pump are completely encased and work in an oil bath.\n\nThe LUBRICATING ARRANGEMENTS are exceptionally efficient, economical and complete in every respect. The system comprises: Oil rings to give automatic continuous lubrication to the main bearings; forced lubrication for the piston and pin; combined forced and centrifugal lubrication for the crank pin. All working parts not specially mentioned are provided with suitable means of lubrication.\n\nThe BALANCED FLY-WHEEL is of cast iron, of sufficient weight to ensure steady running, machined on face and edges of rim, and securely fixed on the crankshaft. The standard rotation is clockwise when viewing the engine from the governor end.\n\nThe PULLEY has sufficient width to drive on to fast and loose pulleys for the smaller sizes and on to a friction clutch pulley on the larger sizes, and is keyed to the crankshaft, which is provided with an authorised bearing and sole plate.\n\nThe FUEL TANK is of mild steel and fitted with cover and fine gauze strainer. It has a capacity for about six hours run on full load. It is arranged in two compartments so that when very heavy and thick fuel is used, the engine can be started up and shut down on a lighter grade of oil which flows readily through the suction pipes to the fuel pump.\n\nAn exhaust heated chamber is provided for heating the oil to accelerate its flow to the fuel pump. The chamber can be arranged so that it is cut out of circuit in warm climates, or when using light fuel oil.\n\nSTARTING APPARATUS\u2014A reliable lamp is supplied for heating the vaporizer until the engine has started, after which the heat from the vaporizer is sufficient to ignite the fuel charge. A combined starting and charging valve with the necessary piping, pressure gauge, etc., is fitted, enabling the engine to be started by compressed air, stored at a pressure of 150 lbs. per square inch in a suitable air receiver, which is recharged by the engine when running.\n\nAdequate COOLING is assured by means of a centrifugal pump belt-driven from the crankshaft circulating the water through the cylinder jackets.\n\nA cast iron EXHAUST SILENCER is supplied to reduce to a minimum the noise of the exhaust. A short length of exhaust piping, suited to the standard arrangement of the engine, is supplied.\n\nACCESSORIES AND SPARES include a Starting Lamp, Oil Can, complete set of Wrenches, two Piston Rings, Nipple for Starting Lamp Burner, Ignition Tube, set of Joints and Packing Washers, two Air Valves for Crankcase, and set of Springs. An Instruction Book giving full information for the erection, working and management of the engine is supplied.\n\nAll materials are the best of their respective kinds; the engine is thoroughly painted and finished in first-class style; and the workmanship throughout is of the highest standard.\nLISTER GASOLINE ENGINES\n\nMODELS 2 H. P. TO 16 H. P.\n\nThe Lister Engine is manufactured in our own works at Dursley, England, which is recognized as one of the best and most up-to-date small engine works in the British Empire. It is essentially a high quality engine, but is nevertheless produced at a price very little higher than many of the engines of vastly inferior design and workmanship. The principal features of the Lister Engine are Efficiency, Reliability with freedom from trouble and a long life of service, and Economy in running costs.\n\nThe engine is of the vertical type designed on the four-cycle principle, with automatic lubrication and sensitive throttle governing. Every part is machined to very great accuracy, cylinders, pistons, crankshafts, etc., being ground to a perfect finish. All wearing parts are of special selected metal, case hardened to resist wear. The bearings, which are adjustable, are of special white metal ground to perfect accuracy, and are readily interchangeable.\n\nAll Lister Engines are fitted with a high tension magneto, of the same make as that standardized by the British Air Force during the Great War. The fuel consumption can be guaranteed not to exceed \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) pint of gasolene per brake horsepower per hour when running on full load under normal conditions, and on the larger models the consumption is usually well under this figure.\n\nLister Engines have been found by thousands of satisfied users to be the ideal small power unit for industrial or agricultural work, as they will work under any conditions and require no skilled attention. They are guaranteed to develop their full rated horsepower for long continuous periods, and the slow speed at which they run reduces wear to a minimum.\n\nModels Available\n\n| h.p. | Cylinder Type |\n|------|--------------|\n| 2    | Single       |\n| 3    | Single       |\n| 4    | Single       |\n| 6    | Single       |\n| 8    | Twin         |\n| 12   | Twin         |\n| 16   | Twin         |\n\nWrite for special catalogue on Lister Engines.\nQUOTATION TO W.A.

On the other hand, should there be a rainy spring season we will greatly be embarrassed to drain the water falling on the roof, which will certainly cause a great damage to the new building.\n\nThe water used at present is far from being pure; it leaves a deposit in the boilers. These boilers have to be cleaned out, and on this account too, the water system could not be differed any longer.\n\nOther works also need to be completed such as the building of the farmer's house. The farm work will begin with the early spring, and at present there is no house wherein to lodge this hired man and family. Consequently this building should now be commenced so as to be completed in time.\n\nHoping that this request will meet with your kind approval, and that you will soon take the necessary step to have the work completed to the great satisfaction of the whole staff who is now so anxious to take possession of the new school.

MacKenzie.\nSir,\n\nRe painting Onion Lake Agency House and R.C. School barn.\n\nI beg to refer to my letter of February 27th in which I informed you that the painter had undertaken to do the above mentioned work for $215.00 and $110.00 respectively and asked for an advance of $150.00 to pay for work already completed. As the balance of the painting cannot be completed before the end of March I should like instructions regarding this matter. If the payment is to be made from the past year's appropriation would it be in order to have the balance of $175.00 sent to me to be paid to the contractor as early in April as he is able to complete the work? The painter has done some work on both house and barn and has received $150.00 on account, but I do not know how much of this should be applied on each building, and it would probably take more than three weeks to get the necessary information from the Indian Agent. It would be much more satisfactory if a further advance of $175.00 could be made as suggested above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 29th, 1928.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 26th instant, number 309-4A and 11 A R.C., re painting Onion Lake Agency, I beg to say that a further advance of $175.00 will be sent you early next week when funds are available.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.

Brown & Hudson, who were\nthe Contractors for the School recently put\nup at Onion Lake, got some Fire Brick from\nmy stock of materials at the Reserve, which\nhad been lying there since I completed my\ncontract.\n\nThe bill for same was only a matter\nof about $13.00, but I can get no acknowledg-\nment of any kind from Brown & Hudson.\n\nWill you kindly advise me if they\nhave been paid up in full for their work, if this\nis not a breach of confidence.\n\nFailing that, I shall be much obliged\nif you will advise me where I can get in touch\nwith them by mail.\n\nYours truly,\n(Sign) James Priei.\n\nPer.\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward copy of a letter which I have today received from Mr. James Priel, which speaks for itself. Will the Department please reply direct to Mr. Priel.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nS. BROWN\nGENERAL CONTRACTOR\n\n791 PRESTON AVENUE\nWINNIPEG March 21st, 1928.\n\nMr. F. H. Murray,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nGovernment.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour telegram of March 21st, received, but it throws no light on the question involved.\n\nI am sorry to bother you directly and would prefer to deal through your inspector but owing to slow mail service up time will not permit. Our trouble is the Plumbing Contractor disputes the work of metal covering as he claims only slop sinks are specified in his specifications. It don't appear as covered under Galvanized Iron specifications.\n\nWe allowed for the carpentry of these tables as we realized no other tradesmen would have carpenters employed, but we did not make any allowance for metal covering as we naturally expected when same was not included in our portion of the specifications; it would be specified under the Plumbers or the Gal. Iron specifications.\n\nIf this was only a question of a few dollars we would not bother you, but owing to the high price of Copper the best estimate is $300.00 providing it is done immediately before the tradesmen get away. If a special trip had to be made it would cost considerable more.\n\nHowever, I will make it clear to you we are not soliciting extras. If you can verify the fact this work is covered under Plumbers or Gal. Iron specifications we will have same executed and charge against their contract.\n\nWire immediately on receipt of this letter as any extra expense can be avoided.\n\nYours truly,\n\nS. Brown\nOnion Lake March 16th/28\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nAs per your request of Feb 23rd re Sewage and Water System I wrote to Mr Attwood District Engineer of Winnipeg, and he forwarded my letter to Mr J S Tempest Commissioner of Irrigation, Calgary who wrote me March 9th to say that he would have an Engineer come here as soon as he received word from me, so I answered his letter March 15th the day I received it.\n\nIt is to be hoped that as soon as he gets the particulars that he will rush the plans and specifications so that the work can be got under way at the earliest possible moment as the school principal is very anxious to get moved as they are practically without a home.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nInspector of Construction\nDear Sirs\n\nI hereby wish to submit the following report on the progress made by the contractors in connection with the erection of the Roman Catholic Indian Residential School here.\n\nThe work has been progressing fairly well lately, the carpenterwork at the second floor rooms is completed with the exception of the window stops which have just arrived from the factory, the painter has the floors oiled first coat and other woodwork stained and one coat of varnish, the ceilings are completed.\n\nThe first floor carpenterwork is completed with the exception of the window stops, the hanging of the sun room sash and the steps from corridor and toilet rooms to dormitories.

There is nothing done yet at cement floors in the machinery room, boiler room, fuel room, laundry room and pupils dining room, other rooms are ready to receive the finish coat, the cement base work is well advanced, the majority of the woodwork is to be done yet in the basement.\n\nThere is considerable carpenterwork to be done on the outside, and about two thirds of the painting to be done which cannot be done till the weather turns warmer, there is also some cement work and plastering to be done on the outside which cannot be done till the frost is out of the walls.\n\nThe plumbing fixtures are being put in place and at the present time are all in place on ground, first and second floors, & heating radiators are put in their permanent positions on above floors.\n\nThe above report is respectfully submitted by\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction\nMarch 26, 1928.\n\nS.

MacKenzie,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOnion Lake, April 12th, 1928.\n\nTo the Honorable Duncan Scott,\n\nDeputy minister of Indians Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,- Allow me to refer you to a letter I wrote to you last year concerning the advisability of providing a house for the Principal of our Residential School at Onion Lake.\n\nTo the reasons brought forth in my previous letter in favor of this project, I will take the liberty to add some others which I consider worthy of your attention. The Principal should have a residence of his own, on the ground that being a missionary in charge of the Indians on the Reserve, his activities therefore are not exclusively limited to the administration of the school, but also to the spiritual welfare of the Indians on the Reserve on which the school is located. This fact necessitates on his part almost daily relations with the Indians in matters out of his concern as Principal.\n\nThis situation emerging from this double ministry is inherent to the system in vogue in every school built on every Reserve. In the Indian Reserves where the school is erected, and it is the case for almost all the Residential schools, If I am well informed, the situation is the same for the clergymen of every denomination. Besides being the Principal of the school the clergyman is more-over in charge of the spiritual care of the Indians.\n\nAs I said this double charge imposes upon the Principal duties which have nothing to do with the govern of the school. You will readily understand that in such a situation the Principal would far better had he a house of his own in order to attend to matters quite irrelevant to his duties as Principal. It would certainly do away with all kinds of inconveniences and render his position more suitable to his calling as minister of the Gospel.\n\nFurthermore I will take this opportunity to point out to you another consideration which cannot too easily be discarded, that is, that the Father in charge of the School is living under the same roof as the Sisters. Needless for me to stress this point except to make you aware of the wishes of the Episcopate, that the Fathers should live in a separate building. The fact that this point has not been heretofore strongly emphasized by the Bishops, does not in the least alter its importance.\n\nFor these reasons added to those in my previous letter, I take the liberty to renew my demand for an appropriation for the building of a residence for the Principal of Onion Lake's Residential School.\n\nTwo thousand dollars would cover the expenses and we ourselves could attend to the plan and construction of this residence, if the Department consent.\n\nHoping that you will consider our demand favorably and thanking you for this and past favors,\n\nI am, Your's truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6324, file 659-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nApril 16, 1926.\n\nDear Father Therien,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to the advisability of providing a house for the Principal at the Onion Lake Indian Residential School, I beg to say that I cannot alter the decision made last year, to the effect that a separate residence cannot be provided for the Principal.\n\nSuitable accommodation is provided in the new building for the Principal, and it is thought that, particularly on account of discipline, it is necessary for the Principal to reside in the building.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. I. A. Therien, O.M.I.,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nONION LAKE R. C. RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nAs you are aware, the old school building was burnt down completely, together with their church on February the 10th. The cause of the fire, which started about six o'clock in the evening in the attic, is unknown. The Sisters and seven of the pupils are now occupying the building formerly used by the boys at the old Anglican School. They were busily engaged while I was there preparing clothing and bedding material to replace that which was burnt. I looked over the new school building and noted that a great deal of work will have to be done before it will be ready for occupancy. Nothing had been done towards installing water or sewerage. There was a great deal of finishing to do to the interior of the building and more than half of the cement floor in the basement had to be laid. I examined the new barn and found that it is very well built, proper ventilation provided and stanchions are properly installed. It is a real good building. This is the only outbuilding, so far, which has been erected.\n\nThe foregoing report is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant.\n\nW.

As the location of the school is lower than some of the surrounding land there is bound to be some water lay around the building till the drains are laid and the earth is properly graded up to the walls, some parts of it being left low to take care of the earth to be taken from the excavation of the storage and rainwater tanks.\n\nHoping that the above explanation will be satisfactory to you and that you may sanction the liberty I took in procuring the soil pipe mentioned above without first receiving your authority, but my reason for doing so was that I was afraid of a heavy rain which might do some damage to the building.

Indian School,\nOnion Lake Indian Reserve\nnear Lloydminster, Sask.\n\nPrepared for The Department of\nIndian Affairs.\n\nby\nR.H.Goodchild,\nDominion Water Power and\nReclamation Service,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nGENERAL\n\nThe new Onion Lake R.C.School, now nearing completion, is situated about thirty miles north and five miles west of the Town of Lloydminster, Sask., on the Onion Lake Reserve, some eight miles north of the North Saskatchewan river.\n\nIt is a frame building, designed to accommodate 80 pupils, and when completed will have a value of approximately $80,000.\n\nThe builder's contract does not call for a water supply nor sewage disposal system and it is the purpose of this report to outline such systems and to estimate the cost of the completed works.\n\nAs intimated, the School has been designed to accommodate eighty pupils, and it is therefore considered\ndesirable to design a plant capable of serving one hundred persons.\n\nWATER SUPPLY SYSTEM.\n\nWater Requirements for domestic purposes.\n\nThe amount of water required per day on a basis of 40 U.S.gallons per capita per day will be\n\n\\[ 40 \\times 100 = 4,000 \\text{ U.S.gals. per day.} \\]\n\nIt is considered that a supply of 30 gals. per minute will supply the maximum demand.\n\nWater Requirements for Fire Protection Purposes.\n\nOn account of the value of this building, its purpose, and its construction a very adequate system of fire protection should be installed.\n\nTo successfully cope with a fire in the building it is considered that at least four streams of about eighty gallons per minute each at a pressure of not less than 50 lbs. playing simultaneously would be necessary, and that it should be possible to maintain this flow for an hour.\n\nIt is considered that if the fire could not be conquered in one hour that the building could not be saved.\n\nWater Requirements for Laundry Purposes.\n\nIt is proposed to conserve the rain water from the roof by means of a concrete tank fed from the roof drain and to use this rainwater in the laundry. The amount of water required will be large and the tank has been designed accordingly.\nSOURCE OF SUPPLY.\n\nFor domestic and fire fighting purposes the only possible supply is a small spring situated in a draw about four hundred feet south of the School. This spring has a flow of about fifteen gallons per minute.\n\nThe water is clear and cold and not too hard for ordinary washing purposes.\n\nA lake about half a mile in diameter lies about three hundred yards from the School to the South west, but on account of its low elevation and distance the cost of using this lake as a source of water for fire fighting purposes would be prohibitive.\n\nThe cost of the pumping plant necessary would be nearly seven thousand dollars.\n\nProposed Works Water Supply System.\n\nDomestic Supply.\n\nAs the flow of the spring is so small and, as it is the only sure supply of usable water for all purposes, it is considered necessary to construct a sizable well or tank at the spring from which well to pump to a reservoir at the School.\n\nThis well will be of reinforced concrete and will measure - at the bottom 16'x10', and it will be 12' deep. A manhole will be placed in the top and over the north end of this structure, a pumphouse 8'x13' and 8' high will be erected to house the pumping machinery necessary to raise the water to the upper reservoir.\n\nThe details of construction are shown on the\nplans, and the details of all machinery are shown in the estimates appended hereto. This building is to be provided with a stove for winter use. The upper reservoir will also be of reinforced concrete construction, and it will be located 12' east of the building, opposite the engine room.\n\nFrom this reservoir, by means of a small pump electrically driven, water will be pumped to two pressure tanks - placed in series - situated inside the building and this plant will have an automatic control, which will keep the pressure between 20 and 40 lbs. at all times.\n\nThese pressure tanks will be coupled to the plumbing system already installed.\n\nThe combined capacity of these two tanks is about 1700 U.S.gals.\n\nFIRE PROTECTION SYSTEM.\n\nTo adequately protect the building from fire an independent pumping plant will have to be installed and coupled to the standpipe system, already in place.\n\nIt is, as has been stated, considered desirable to have at least four effective fire streams available for use simultaneously, each throwing a stream of about 80 gals. per minute.\n\nIn order to ensure safe operation of the pumping plant required, it will be necessary to house it outside the School building, and it is proposed to erect the necessary pumphouse just south of the upper reservoir from which the supply will be drawn.\n\nThe plant recommended will have a capacity of 336 U.S.gals. per minute and to maintain this flow for an hour, a\nsupply of 336 x 60 or 20,160 U.S.gals. will be required.\n\nThe tank designed by the writer has a capacity of 21,500 U.S.gals.\n\nIt may be added that the actual supply for fighting a fire will be augmented by the amount which the pump at the spring can deliver to the reservoir in one hour, i.e., about 2,500 U.S.gals. making a total of 24,000 U.S.gals. available for immediate use.\n\nIt is also proposed to couple the pressure tanks to the stand-pipe system, and so make the contents of these tanks available for instant use to quench an incipient blaze and so preventing loss of time pending the starting of the outside plant.\n\nAs a further safeguard, it is recommended that three soda and acid fire extinguishers be placed, one in the boiler or engine room, one in the laundry and one in the kitchen, as these are the three places in which fire is most likely to break out, and the number suggested might well be doubled.\n\nRAINWATER SYSTEM\n\nTo conserve the rainwater from the roof and to create a supply which would carry over the dry season it is proposed to construct a reinforced concrete tank reservoir, of the same design and size as the well at the spring.\n\nThis tank will have to be set 5' below the surface to prevent freezing during the cold weather. The roof drain will, of course, drain directly into this tank and the overflow from the tank will flow into the sewer from the boiler room.\n\nThe equipment to serve the laundry from this tank will\nconsist of a small pumping plant, electrically operated, so designed that the turning of a faucet will automatically start the motor and pump, causing an almost instantaneous flow.\n\nIt is considered that the system outlined above will meet all the requirements and it is recommended that it be adopted.\n\n(sgd) R.H.GOODCHILD.\n\nA.M.E.I.C.\nREPORT\non\nSEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEM,\nOnion Lake Indian (R.C.) School.\n\nGENERAL:\nThis school is situated on high ground which slopes rapidly away from the School on three sides, and the design of a suitable sewage disposal system is therefore comparatively simple.\n\nPlans and profiles of the proposed works together with estimates of cost accompany this report.\n\nTo the west of the School the land slopes to a short but steep draw and it is considered that this draw presents an excellent site for the sewage disposal bed and the system is designed with that point in view.\n\nThis School when completed will house some 100 persons, and the plant has been so designed as to care for that number of persons.\n\nGENERAL DESIGN:\nAs shown on the general plan the 2 sewers from the school come together at the upper side of the disposal beds at a point 350' from the school.\n\nThe sewage from the toilets, baths, etc., passes through a septic tank, some 160' west of the School before being passed out to the disposal bed.\n\nPipe Lines:\nThe piping proposed for the sewer lines is 6\"\nglazed tile and that for the disposal bed 4\" open tile drain pipe.\n\n**SEPTIC TANK.**\n\nThe septic tank proposed is made up of two chambers, the settling chamber or septic tank proper and the syphon chamber. To render the structure as nearly permanent as possible it is of reinforced concrete throughout.\n\nThe affluent enters the septic tank a foot below the surface in order to prevent disturbance of the scum.\n\nFrom the septic tank the sewage flows first through a set of grids, placed so as to intercept any sizable solid, and then over the dividing wall between the two chambers; two baffle boards are carried below the surface thus preventing undue disturbance.\n\nTwo three inch Anthes syphons designed to operate under an 18\" head take care of the effluent from the chamber and deliver it to the discharge pipe.\n\nIt is estimated that this syphon chamber will carry about 450 imperial gallons before discharging.\n\n**DISPOSAL BED.**\n\nA manhole is proposed at the end of the two sewers where they lie side by side in the same trench, and from each side of this manhole to lay a line of 4\" open tile drain to a distance of 30 feet.\n\nThese branches will be so located as to have a\ngood fall. It is proposed to lay this pipe on a 3' deep trench, leaving the trench open.\n\nFrom this upper line of drain it is proposed to open up four straight trenches running obliquely down the slope for a distance of 50 ft. and to lay 4\" open tile drain in these trenches. It is proposed to leave these trenches also open.\n\nAll the points of these tile drains will be covered with gravel to protect them from debris, etc.\n\nThe advantage in leaving these drains open is that when they become no longer serviceable they may be easily filled in and new ones opened up.\n\nMANHOLES.\n\nOne manhole only will be required and this will be small and inexpensive.\n\nIt will be of concrete and will be provided with a cast iron cover.\n\nIt is recommended that the system outlined above be adopted as being the most suitable.\n\n(signed) R.H. GOODCHILD.\nINFORMATION FOR BIDDERS\n\n(1) GENERAL:-\n\nTenders will be received until 10:00 a.m. on April 23rd at the office of the Commissioner of Irrigation at Calgary, Alberta, for providing all labor, material, and equipment required in connection with a water supply system and a sewage disposal system at the Onion Lake Indian School and which is located on the Onion Lake Indian Reserve.\n\n(2) TENDERS:-\n\nTenders must be made out by filling in the blank spaces in the tender form.

Excavate and lay a 6\" tile pipe from the soft water reservoir to the water lines from boiler room and laundry. When completed the reservoir and all trenches connecting with the reservoir to be backfilled to the natural ground surface.\n\nSUPPLY OF MATERIAL AND EQUIPMENT -\n\nThe contractor will supply all material and equipment which enter into and form part of the finished structures, and all material required for the construction and maintenance of forms and the like.\n\nTransport: The contractor will transport all material and equipment from the Railway station to the site of the work. The cost of transport will be included in the contract price for \"Material Supplied\" and \"Equipment Supplied\".\n\nCare of Material: All material must be properly stored and cared for at all times. It will be subject to inspection before being used and if any is found to be damaged or in any way rendered useless or unsuitable it will be condemned and must immediately be removed from the work and replaced by suitable material by the Contractor at his sole expense.\n\nSNOW, ICE AND DEBRIS -\n\nSnow, Ice and Debris and foreign matter must be removed from the work whenever ordered by The Engineer, such removal being at the Contractor's expense.\n\nFORMS -\n\nForms, where necessary, will be furnished and built by the Contractor and included in the contract price per cu.yd. of concrete.\n\nMaterials in forms may be used repeatedly but if so used shall be thoroughly cleaned after each time used and before setting up again. Before any concrete is poured\nagainst them the moulding surface must be smeared with mineral oil or grease, or soap, in order to prevent the concrete from adhering to the forms.\n\nForms must be left in place until the concrete has set sufficiently to be safe from damage, either in process of removal, or from lack of support or from any other cause. The method employed in removal of forms must be such as to offer the minimum possibility of damaging the soft concrete; using soft concrete as a fulcrum for prying forms loose is specially forbidden.\n\nREINFORCEMENT-\n\nThe contractor will provide, fabricate and fix in place all reinforcement shown on the drawings or required by reason of the methods of construction adopted by him. He must take whatever precautions are necessary, or are ordered by the Engineer, to maintain such reinforcement in its proper position while pouring concrete and afterward until the concrete is set.\n\nMaterials: Unless otherwise shown on the drawing or permitted by the District Engineer all reinforcement will be round steel bars meeting the requirements of the Standard Specifications of the American Society for Testing Materials for \"Billet Steel Concrete Re-inforcement Bars (Serial designation A-19)\" as adopted 1911 with all subsequent revisions.\n\nFabrication: The Contractor will do all work necessary in connection with cutting, bending, erection, tying, splicing and anchoring.\n\nBending: Wherever bars are shown on the drawing as bent to any shape, such bars will be bent cold (except anchors), using a suitable tool or appliance for the purpose.\n\nMaintenance: All reinforcement must be so supported that it cannot be displaced before during or after the operation of pouring the concrete.\n\nCONCRETE-\n\nMaterials, plant, labour, tools and appliances for proportioning, mixing, transporting, placing and finishing concrete will be supplied by the Contractor.\n\nMaterials: All material supplied will be tested and if defective must be immediately removed from the work and made good at the contractor's expense. Rejected material, if not removed within four days, may be destroyed or rendered useless by the Engineer.\n\nAggregate: The aggregate for concrete will consist of sound particles of silicious or calcareous rock.\nparticles must be free from hard adhering films or coatings of deleterious matter, such as clay, salts or vegetable acids.\n\nCement: All cement must comply with the requirements of the \"Specification for Portland Cement\" of the American Society for Testing Materials, as adopted September 1st, 1916, and all subsequent amendments or the Standards of the Engineering Institute of Canada. Cement may be shipped in bags or barrels at the option of the Contractor.\n\nTransport and Storage: Cement must be protected from the weather during transport and at all times. It must be stored as directed by the engineer in charge and be subject to inspection at any time. If found defective the whole or such part as the engineer may direct must be immediately removed from the work and replaced with new cement at the contractor's expense.\n\nReinforced concrete (which for this purpose is defined as all concrete members in which steel is employed, to take certain definite stresses which the concrete itself is incapable of taking) will be mixed in the proportion of one part of cement to two parts of fine aggregate and four parts of coarse aggregate, measured dry. Each bag of cement will be considered as one cubic foot and each barrel as four cubic feet and the volume of aggregate adjusted accordingly.\n\nMass concrete (which for this purpose is defined as all concrete members in which all direct stresses are borne by the concrete unaided although steel may be employed for temperature, shrinkage or other reasons) will be mixed in the proportion of one part of cement, two and one half parts fine aggregate and five parts of coarse aggregate. Packages of cement will count for volume as above specified.\n\nMaximum sizes of aggregate in reinforced work will not exceed one and one half inches in greatest dimension. For mass concrete no particle may be used greater in longest dimension than two tenths (2/10) of the least dimension of the member for which the concrete is intended.\n\nConsistency: Sufficient water will be used in mixing concrete to give a mixture which will flow (not slide) readily on a plank surface inclined at 25 degrees to the horizontal. For reinforced work, especially in vertical members such as walls, slabs, counterforts, and columns, the concrete must be mixed sufficiently fluid to flow readily into corners and angles and about the reinforcing steel and to fill all voids.\n\nFinish: After removal of forms, the surface will be carefully examined for exposed reinforcement. All holes, open voids, or pockets will be filled with stiff mortar mixed one to one and rammed in hard. Tie wires will be clipped off neatly flush with the surface. Bolt holes will be carefully cleaned out by a jet of water, air or steam under pressure, and filled with stiff mortar. The whole surface of all members, except floors, will be painted with neat grout.\nExcavation of Trenches: The trenches in which the pipes are to be laid shall be excavated on the lines shown on the plan. There shall be no bends or undulations made other than those shown on plan or permitted by the Engineer.\n\nAll trenches shall be of sufficient width to permit proper jointing of the pipes. Bell holes at joints shall be excavated below the bottom of the trench, of sufficient size to allow ample room for the proper caulking of the joints, and so that the body of the pipe shall rest on solid ground throughout its length.\n\nAll necessary shoring and bracing shall be done by the Contractor to prevent movement in the sides of the excavation and all timber required as well as all necessary labour in connection with it shall be furnished by the Contractor as part of the Contract.\n\nAll water shall be removed by the Contractor from the trenches by pumping or other means, and the trench must be kept perfectly free from water when the jointing of the pipe is being done.\n\nBackfilling Trenches: No backfilling shall be done until the pipes laid and jointed have been inspected and approved of by the Engineer.\n\nAfter permission has been given, the trench shall be filled with selected earth free from stones and rubbish to a depth of at least two feet above the top of the pipe, thoroughly consolidated and compacted by ramming with suitable tools.\n\nAfter the pipes have been covered with two feet of filling as specified, the remainder of the trench may be filled by hand, team or machinery. No large stones shall be allowed to be placed in the trench.\n\nCoating Pipes: All galvanized pipes will have a heavy coating of hot coal tar or pitch applied before being jointed.\n\nJoints: All vitrified tile drain pipes are to be laid from lower end up and the contractor will see that each length of pipe is clean before being laid. A gasket of hemp or jute of sufficient size will be inserted between the hub and spigot and properly rammed so that a space 1\" in depth shall remain for cement mortar, to be inserted. The space between the spigot and hub shall be completely filled with mortar thoroughly pressed in all around and every precaution taken to secure a water-tight joint. The mortar shall be applied with a rubber trowel, a rammer, or compacted with a wooden caulking tool. Joints shall be finished all around with a neat level. The interior of each pipe joint shall be scraped clean of all projecting material.\nFORM OF TENDER ONION LAKE INDIAN SCHOOL\n\nThe Commissioner of Irrigation,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nSir,-\n\nThe undersigned\n\nhereinafter called \"The Bidder\" hereby declares that the Plans and Specifications for the proposed \"Onion Lake Indian School\" Water Supply and Sewage Disposal systems are hereto attached.

Bennett (Sgd)...\n(Signature of Bidder)\n\nDATE: April 24th, 1928.\nCalgary, Alberta.\nApril 27, 1928.\n\nMemorandum re Tenders - Onion Lake School\n\nTenders for water supply and sewage disposal systems received from the following bona fide contractors on dates specified:\n\nBrown and Hudson, Winnipeg - $12,591.00 on October 8, 1927.\nBennett & White Co., Calgary - $18,250.00 \" April 25, 1928.\nJohn Towers, Calgary - $15,452.10 \" \" 24, 1928.\nSubsequent tender for alternative plan from John Towers - $14,386.01 \" \" 25, 1928.\n\nThe first tender; i.e., that of Brown and Hudson, was not based on plans and specifications used by the two Calgary firms and the chief differences are listed below:\n\n1. No pumping plant nor pump-house to house such plant for fire fighting purposes called for in original specifications.\n\n2. Size of storage tank in first specifications was 12' x 12' x 12' (inside), and in recent plan, 19' - 10\" x 12' - 10\" x 12' - 0\".\n\n3. Disposal bed in first scheme was single trench, in later scheme a system of trenches designed to spread the effluent from the sewers.\n\n4. The construction of the reinforced concrete walls and slabs in the tanks in the later design, is superior to that of the first.\n\n5. No man-holes specifically mentioned in first scheme. To compare Brown and Hudson's figures and tender with the later ones, additions to cover the foregoing items must be made and these would approximately be as follows:\n\n| Item | Description                                      | Cost   |\n|------|--------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| #1   | Pumping plant, freight, etc.                     | $3,282.00 |\n| #2   | Larger reservoir                                 | 700.00 |\n| #3   | Disposal beds                                     | 65.00  |\n| #4   | Superior design and construction of all concrete structures | 500.00 |\n| #5   | Man-hole                                         |        |\n\nTotal .................. $4,547.00\n\nOriginal tender of Brown and Hudson ............ $12,591.00\n\n$17,138.00\nA fair comparison would therefore be obtained by showing these figures:\n\nBrown and Hudson ............ $17,138.00\nBennett and White ............ $18,250.00\nJohn Towers .................. $15,452.00\n\nAs an alternative design the well at the spring and the rain-water tank were reduced in size and a second tender was received for the alternative scheme from John Towers for $14,386.01.\n\nThis would effect a saving of $1,066.09.\n\n(Sgd) R. H. Goodchild.\nSir:\n\nIn further reference to the plans and specifications prepared in this office in connection with the water supply and sewerage disposal scheme for the Roman Catholic Indian Residential School at Onion Lake, Alberta.\n\nWe wired you on the 25th instant that tenders had been received from Messrs. Bennett and White and from Mr. John Towers, both of this city, giving you the figures submitted. We have since revised the plans submitted and are now submitting an alternative scheme which includes a revision of the original plans in that the capacity of the tanks has been considerably reduced. The storage reservoir at the springs was revised in capacity from 15,700 U.S. gallons to 5,000 U.S. gallons. The rainwater tank originally shown on the plans previously submitted, having a capacity of 15,700 U.S. gallons has been altered to show a capacity of 10,600 U.S. gallons. These changes, if carried out, will mean a saving on the estimated figures of the lowest bidder; i.e., Mr. John Towers, of some $1,066.09.\n\nI am also submitting for your information a memorandum which has been prepared by Mr. Goodchild and which analyzes the tenders submitted by Messrs. Brown and Hudson of Winnipeg and those submitted by the Calgary firm. From this analysis it will be noted that certain essentials were omitted from the original specifications and therefore from the tender submitted by Messrs. Brown and Hudson. These omissions have been estimated for and a new figure prepared, which brings the bid of Messrs. Brown and Hudson to $17,138, which very closely approximates the average of the other bids received. The lowest tender is still that of Mr. John Towers of Calgary.\n\nWe are also forwarding two copies of the tenders submitted by Mr. John Towers and Messrs. Bennett and White; also one copy of the \"Specifications\" and \"Information for Bidders\", which were omitted from our letter of the 26th inst. An independent estimate prepared by Mr. Goodchild in duplicate which was asked for in your telegram of the 25th instant, is also enclosed.\n\nAn alternative bid has also been received from Mr. John Towers, which covers the proposed reduction in capacity of the tanks referred to in the first part of this letter. Copy of this bid is likewise attached.\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Reclamation,\nDepartment of Interior,\nOttawa.\nIn our wire to you of the 25th instant we stated the amount of Mr. Towers' second tender was $14,326.00. This should have read $14,386.00.\n\nFor your information we might say that, from our personal knowledge and from inquiries made, Mr. John Towers is the more experienced bidder of the two Calgary firms having had considerable experience with this particular class of installation. Mr. John Haddin, a local consulting engineer, has had considerable experience with Mr. Towers on small contracts of this nature and very highly recommends him for a job of this kind. We have no knowledge of the experience or suitability of Messrs. Brown and Hudson for this work; neither do we know whether they are still on the ground and in a position to submit a bid.\n\nTwo blue-prints of the alternative scheme are also enclosed; likewise a further blue-print of the detailed plan of the water supply and sewerage systems, showing an amendment in the pumping plant at the well. The capacity originally given in error as 1,000 gallons per hour is now changed to 2,500 gallons per hour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) P.J. Jennings,\nActing Commissioner of Irrigation.\nSir,\n\nYour file number: 115-8-15.\n\nIn further reference to my letter of January 4 with regard to the proposed construction of a water supply and sewerage system at the new Onion Lake residential school, I enclose herewith a report on the scheme received from Mr. Tempest, Commissioner of Irrigation at Calgary, with plans of the proposed work and an estimate of cost totalling \u00a316,000.40. There is also enclosed a copy of Mr. Tempest's letter of April 27 which describes the project and the tenders which have been received, together with the following material mentioned in Mr. Tempest's letter:\n\nMemorandum re tenders by Mr. Goodchild, who prepared the report herewith:\nTender by the Bennett and White Construction Company, amounting to \u00a318,250.;\nTender by Mr. John Towers of Calgary, amounting to \u00a315,452.10; and\nAmended tender by Mr. Towers, amounting to \u00a314,356.01.\n\nThe blue prints of the alternative scheme referred to in the last paragraph of Mr. Tempest's letter are enclosed with the plans attached to the report.\n\nWe have received only copies of the tenders submitted, the originals having been retained by Mr. Tempest, but these of course can be obtained if you so desire; and I shall be glad to have your instructions with regard to those submitted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

According to the report recently submitted by the Dominion Water Power Branch, the Department will be justified in accepting the amended tender of Mr. Towers of Calgary, which amounts to $14,386.01. In view of the explanation given in the accompanying reports I would recommend that the tender of Mr. Towers be accepted, and that the work be proceeded with as early as convenient under the immediate supervision of an officer of the Dominion Water Power Branch.\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nMay 21, 1928.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nWith reference to the Dominion Water Power Branch proposal for the water supply and sewage disposal at the new Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School, I have to report that, after discussion with both Mr. Chene and Mr. Orr, there is nothing unnecessary recommended. The reason the estimate of the cost amounts to such a large sum is that all necessary work of this character is lumped in the one proposal.\n\nWhereas the school should be finished at the earliest possible date, so that it could be occupied, I wish to recommend that immediate steps be taken to accept a tender for the work.\n\nRossall James\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nMay 22, 1928.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHONOURABLE CHARLES STEWART,\n\nThe new building for the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School is practically completed. It was necessary to wait for the spring to secure a recommendation of the Dominion Water Power and Reclamation Service in connection with a water supply and sewerage system. The Director has now forwarded a recommendation, which involves a well, reservoirs, rain water tank, engine, pumps, pressure tanks and all necessary piping; and septic tank with the necessary sewers and disposal beds. The cost is approximately $14,400 and funds are available in the Vote for Indian Education.\n\nAs this new building cannot be occupied until the water supply and sewerage systems are ready, I should be pleased to have your authority to ask the Dominion Water Power Branch to accept without delay the lowest tender they have received for this work. The activity will be under the supervision of one of their officers.\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Sirs,\n\nI hereby submit the following report re the construction of the Roman Catholic Indian Residential School here.\n\nThe plumbing and heating work is completed with the exception of the testing of the plant, the men has left for home but will return for the test as soon as the sewer is in.\n\nThe painting is going very slow owing to a dispute between the general contractor and the sub-contractor re the painting contract and at the present time the sub-contractor is in Winnipeg trying to arrange a settlement.\n\nMr Hudson arrived here from Winnipeg May the 3rd & brought a plasterer and cement worker to have some work done over which was unsatisfactory.\n\nThe plans of base for the electric lighting plant arrived and I am having the excavations made and the concrete put in. The plant is expected in Lloydminster any day now and have made arrangements to have it hauled to the school.\n\nThe staff of the Roman Catholic Mission have moved in to part of the building as they have a lot of work to do which cannot be attended to as their temporary quarters are so far away from here.\n\nI am doing all that is possible to have the contract completed and from what I can see there is only about ten days work to do to complete the work if the contractor would see that the sub-contractors got their work cleaned up.\n\nThe electrician is here installing the fixtures which will be completed early next week providing there is no delay in the arrival of the balance of the material.\n\nThere has been no word lately in reference to the sewer and water system and the mission folks are very anxious to know what is being done, so if you could give any information re the above it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThe above report is respectfully submitted by\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction\nHONOURABLE CHARLES STEWART.\n\nThe new building for the Onion Lake R.

I have also had the excavation made and concrete footings put in for the electric lighting plant. I have had the plant brought out from Lloydminster and expect to have it set in place by Monday the 28th.\n\nI am also having figured glass panels put in 8 doors opening into the corridors to give light when doors are closed as authorized by your re your letter of September 21st/27.\n\nAs requested by you in your letter of May 4th re estimate of cost of labour for the above mentioned work I judge it will run about $1200.00 but if it is suitable to you I would suggest that say $600.00 be forwarded which would cover the cost of labour to the end of the month and when completed I could send you a full statement of the work.\n\nThe men at work will be expecting to receive their wages about the first of the month so I would be pleased to have you make the necessary arrangements at the earliest possible date.

J. Skinner, 584 Spence Street, Winnipeg, in which it is stated that this man was employed as a painter for a sub-contractor on the Onion Lake Indian School and that an amount of $334.14 is owing him for wages. You will observe from his letter that Mr. Skinner requests the assistance of the Government in collecting this amount.\n\nOn behalf of the Minister of Labour I would ask that you be good enough to have enquiry made into this matter in order that a settlement may be made of Mr. Skinner's claim if the same is found to be in order. You will observe from the labour conditions of the contract that authority is given to the Government to pay wages to workmen in default of payment by a contractor. Ordinarily, however, it is not necessary to resort to this course and the matter is usually adjusted by bringing it to the attention of the contracting firm concerned.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H.

I am a painter and worked for Mr. A. Cloughton who sub-contracted the painting of the school. He has broken his contract and Brown and Hudson are finishing his work. But where do I get my money from? I worked hard all winter and now, according to Mr. Brown of Brown and Hudson, I am just out the sum due me for wages. Cloughton says he will pay me when he gets a settlement from the job. Brown says he hasn't anything coming to him. According to the specifications Clause D, page 13 and Clause F, page 13, I figured I had no need to worry at all but now it looks different. I need the money bad and must get it at once if at all possible. My wife is in the hospital and I am financially sunk unless I get this. Cloughton admits the correctness of this amount, $384.14. So I will leave this matter in your hands, trusting you to see it through or to advise me at your earliest convenience what other course I have to follow if this one is not correct.\n\nMr. Cloughton's address is 125 Kennedy Street, Winnipeg, Man.; Mr. Brown's of Brown and Hudsons is 791 Preston Ave., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

I wired to Mr Tempest of Calgary the Commissioner of Irrigation to find out if he knew what the delay was but up to the present time I have received no reply from him.\n\nThe above report is respectfully submitted by\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction\nS. BROWN\nGENERAL CONTRACTOR\n\n791 PRESTON AVENUE\nWINNIPEG June 21/26\n\nHowever following my wire today put on your own protection as we want to do what is fair in the matter, but I feel satisfied under the above circumstances you will not expect us to keep building insured for reasons of delay we have no control of. There were also other reasons which caused delay not herein stated which we had no control of. Please forward me copy of contract which I wrote you for before and oblige.\n\nYours truly,\n\nS. Brown\nS. BROWN\nGENERAL CONTRACTOR\n\n791 PRESTON AVENUE\nWINNIPEG June 21/28.\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your wire June 20th, the policy expiring April 15th was renewed for two months which was considered ample time to finish painting. Unfortunately the Inspector issued certificates to the Painting Contractor to the extent of $3000.00 when only $1800.00 worth of work was done. I had no alternative but pay subcontractors the amount of Inspector's certificate less ten per cent. The painting contractor took advantage and quit the job. We were compelled to send painters from here to finish up at double the cost including loss in time.\n\nFrom yesterday's report everything should be finished now. I might also point out that the Inspector will not pass Heating plant until boilers are tested which cannot be done until water pressure is established which is not part of our contract although boilers have functioned all Winter. It would appear very unfair for us to keep building insured until such times as boilers are tested also several carpentors have been working in the building for six weeks or more while the building was covered by our policy.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I may say that I received a letter from Mr Skinner some time ago and took the matter up with Brown & Hudson, notifying them that the matter would have to be adjusted before they could get their final estimate.\n\nThe sub-contractor on painting quit the job owing to a misunderstanding about some extras he claimed from the contractor as they gave him the quantities to figure on and which he claims is not anything near the amount that is in the building, so they could not come to any settlement and he quit the job.\n\nBrown and Hudson sent up men from Winnipeg to complete the job and which they have completed and the men have gone back to Winnipeg.\n\nI expect that all the work will be completed on the school contract by the end of this week and if you wish I could arrange to go up and make the final inspection and issue the final estimate when they have complied with the requirements of the specifications.\n\nAwaiting your decision in the matter I remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\n2259 Lorne Street\nUnder the circumstances, it would appear to be the only choice we have.\n\nWith reference to the rain-water tank, it now develops that the original intention was to place this tank on the east side of the building (not on the west as laid out by the writer) and, in accordance with this idea, both the supply pipe from the roof drain and an overflow pipe (the latter connected under the boiler room floor with the boiler room sewer) to handle the overflow from this tank, were carried through the foundation and now project some four feet on the east side of the north wing of the building, some 6' underground.\n\nThis, of course, necessitates a change in location of the rain-water tank, and the writer authorized (in writing) the contractor to locate the soft water tank to the east of the building, and staked out its position.\n\nThis change involves no additional expense.\n\nThe writer is now on his way to Prince Albert to obtain a flood measurement of the N. Saskatchewan river now at a very high stage, also Carrot and Melfort creeks, and he proposes to revisit the school about June 28th.\n\nThe heavy rains made it necessary to leave car #76 at Lloydminster, and to travel by rail.\n\nThe trip from Onion Lake to Lloydminster this morning; i.e., thirty-five miles, took the writer four hours.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) R. H. Goodchild.\nSaskatoon, Saskatchewan.\nJune 19, 1928.\n\nThe Commissioner of Irrigation,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nSir:\n\nRe: Onion Lake School Sewer.\n\nI wired you today to the effect that it is very desirable to extend the sewage disposal system a distance of one hundred and fifty feet, so that the disposal beds will be at \"the foot of the slope.\"\n\nMr. Towers agree with me that this should be done and you may remember\u2014or Mr. Jennings will, I think, that the layout originally proposed by me called for such a location for the disposal beds.\n\nI may say that Mr. Towers, as soon as he saw the proposed location, expressed the opinion that the system would work far better at the bottom of the steep slope, at a place where the fall is comparatively gentle, and the writer has always felt that this was so.\n\nIn order that this work may be done without delay I wired you setting Monday morning as a time limit, as Mr. Towers will be ready to begin the work at this point at that time.\n\nI discussed the question with Mr. Hamilton, the Superintendent of Construction, and he expressed the opinion that one hundred dollars was a very reasonable figure for the extra work; i.e., 150' of trench (covered) and 150' 4\" weeping tile drain pipe.\n\nWith reference to the grades of the sewer lines, it has been found necessary to alter them very materially due to the fact that the information supplied previously to the writer was not correct; and there are no plans in existence which show the elevations of piping, sewer outlets, etc., according to Mr. Hamilton.\n\nThe boiler room sewer with which the new sewer must be connected is eleven feet underground and this will mean much heavier work than was expected and calculated for.\n\nMr. Towers, of course, cannot take this extra cut out for the contract price, and the sewer must of necessity be placed at the depth mentioned.\n\nTowers has generously offered to excavate up to a depth of seven feet at contract price and to take out the additional cut in excess of that figure on a cost + 15 per cent basis.\n\nI may say that the excess over seven feet is for a distance of 175' only, so the extra cost will be small.\n\nWill you kindly take the necessary steps to have this arrangement approved and advise both Mr. Towers and myself if you approve and can so arrange it.\nSir,\n\nYour file number: 115-8-15.\nAttention: Departmental Engineer.\n\nIn further reference to my letter of the 26th instant regarding the sewerage system now under construction at the Onion Lake Indian school, I enclose here-with copy of a report received from Mr. Goodchild, the Resident Engineer on this work, with reference to the extension of the disposal system for a distance of one hundred and fifty feet, and some other matters mentioned in the report. Amongst these you will notice that some extra expense will be incurred due to the depth of the boiler room sewer with which the new sewer must be connected. The former is stated to be eleven feet underground and this will mean much heavier work than was expected and tendered for.\n\nI trust that you will approve the slight additional expense that will be incurred by these necessary changes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

MacInnes,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJuly 6, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to confirm the verbal instructions given by Mr. Chene, Departmental Engineer, authorising the extension of the disposal bed to the bottom of the slope in connection with the sewage system now being constructed at the Onion Lake Indian Residential School, also the changes which will be required in the installation of the drain from the boiler room referred to in your letter of the 30th ultimo, which work I trust will be carried out as economically as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

We were also informed it was available at no greater distance than one mile also that it was right on the job. The building erected is approximately six miles from Onion Lake.

Excavate and lay a 6\" tile pipe from the soft water reservoir to the sewer line from boiler room and laundry. When completed the reservoir and all trenches connecting with the reservoir to be backfilled to the natural ground surface.\n\nSUPPLY OF MATERIAL AND EQUIPMENT -\n\n4.0 The contractor will supply all material and equipment which enter into and form part of the finished structures, and all material required for the construction and maintenance of forms and the like.\n\n4.1 Transport: The contractor will transport all material and equipment from the Railway station to the site of the work. The cost of transport will be included in the contract price for \"Material Supplied\" and \"Equipment Supplied\".\n\n4.2 Care of Material: All material must be properly stored and cared for at all times. It will be subject to inspection before being used and if any is found to be damaged or in any way rendered useless or unsuitable it will be condemned and must immediately be removed from the work and replaced by suitable material by the Contractor at his sole expense.\n\nSNOW, ICE AND DEBRIS -\n\n5.0 Snow, Ice and Debris and foreign matter must be removed from the work whenever ordered by the Engineer, such removal being at the Contractor's expense.\n\nFORMS -\n\n6.0 Forms, where necessary, will be furnished and built by the Contractor and included in the contract price per cu. yd. of concrete.\n\n6.1 Materials in forms may be used repeatedly but if so used shall be thoroughly cleaned after each time used and before setting up again. Before any concrete is poured against them the moulding surface must be speared with mineral oil or grease, or soap, in order to prevent the concrete from adhering to the forms.\n6.2 Forms must be left in place until the concrete has set sufficiently to be safe from damage, either in process of removal or from lack of support or from any other cause. The method of supporting and removing forms must be such as to offer the minimum possibility of damaging the soft concrete; using soft concrete as a fulcrum for prying forms loose is specially forbidden.\n\nREINFORCEMENT -\n\n7.0 The contractor will provide, fabricate and fix in place all reinforcement shown on the drawings or required by reason of the methods of construction adopted by him. He must take whatever precautions are necessary, or are ordered by the Engineer, to maintain such reinforcement in its proper position while pouring concrete and afterward until the concrete is set.\n\n7.1 Material: Unless otherwise shown on the drawing or permitted by the District Engineer all reinforcement will be round steel bars meeting the requirements of the Standards Specification of the American Society for Testing Materials for \"Billet Steel Concrete Reinforcement Bars (Serial designation A-15)\" as adopted 1911 with all subsequent revisions.\n\n7.2 Fabrication: The Contractor will do all work necessary in connection with cutting, bending, erection, tying, splicing and anchoring.\n\n7.3 Bending: Wherever bars are shown on the drawing as bent to any shape, such bars will be bent cold (except anchors) using a suitable tool or appliance for the purpose.\n\n7.4 Maintenance: All reinforcement must be so supported that it cannot be displaced before during or after the operation of pouring the concrete.\n\nCONCRETE -\n\n8.0 Materials, plant, labour, tools and appliances for proportioning, mixing, transporting, placing and finishing concrete will be supplied by the Contractor.\n\n8.1 Materials: All material supplied will be tested and if defective must be immediately moved from the work and made good at the contractor's expense. Rejected material, if not removed within four days, may be destroyed or rendered useless by the Engineer.\n\n8.2 Aggregate: The aggregate for concrete will consist of sound particles of silicious or calcareous rock. The particles must be free from hard adhering films or coatings of deleterious matter, such as clay, salts or vegetable acids.\n\n8.3 Cement: All cement must comply with the requirements of the \"Specification for Portland Cement\" of the American Society for Testing Materials, as adopted September 1st, 1916, and all subsequent amendments or the Standards of the Engineering Institute of Canada. Cement may be shipped in bags or barrels at the option of the Contractor.\n8.4 Transport and Storage: Cement must be protected from the weather during transport and at all times. It must be stored as directed by the engineer in charge and be subject to inspection at any time. If found defective the whole or such part as the engineer may direct must be immediately removed from the work and replaced with new cement at the contractor's expense.\n\n8.5 Reinforced concrete (which for this purpose is defined as all concrete members in which steel is employed, to take certain definite stresses which the concrete itself is incapable of taking) will be mixed in the proportion of one part of cement to two parts of fine aggregate and four parts of coarse aggregate, measured dry. Each bag of cement will be considered as one cubic foot and each barrel as four cubic feet and the volume of aggregate adjusted accordingly.\n\n8.6 Mass concrete (which for this purpose is defined as all concrete members in which all direct stresses are borne by the concrete unaided although steel may be employed for temperature, shrinkage or other reasons) will be mixed in the proportion of one part of cement, two and one half parts fine aggregate and five parts of coarse aggregate. Packages of cement will count for volume as above specified.\n\n8.7 Maximum sizes of aggregate in reinforced work will not exceed one and one half inches in greatest dimension. For mass concrete no particle may be used greater in longest dimension than two tenths (2/10) of the least dimension of the member for which the concrete is intended.\n\n8.8 Consistency: Sufficient water will be used in mixing concrete to give a mixture which will flow (not slide) readily on a plank surface inclined at 25 degrees to the horizontal. For reinforced work, especially in vertical members such as walls, slabs, counterforts, and columns, the concrete must be mixed sufficiently fluid to flow readily into corners and angles and about the reinforcing steel and to fill all voids.\n\n8.9 Finish: After removal of forms, the surface will be carefully examined for exposed reinforcement. All holes, open voids, or pockets will be filled with stiff mortar mixed one to one and rammed in hard. The wires will be clipped off neatly flush with the surface. Bolt holes will be carefully cleaned out by a jet of water, air or steam under pressure, and filled with stiff mortar. The visible surface of all members, except floors, will be painted with neat grout.\n\n9.0 Excavation of Trenches: The trenches in which the pipes are to be laid shall be excavated on the lines shown on the plan. There shall be no bends or undulations made other than those shown on plan or permitted by the Engineer.\n\nAll trenches shall be of sufficient width to permit of proper jointing of the pipes. Bell holes at joints shall\nbe excavated below the bottom of the trench, of sufficient size to allow ample room for the proper caulking of the joints, and so that the body of the pipe shall rest on solid ground throughout its length.\n\nAll necessary shoring and bracing shall be done by the Contractor to prevent movement in the sides of the excavation and all timber required as well as all necessary labour in connection with it shall be furnished by the Contractor as part of the Contract.\n\nAll water shall be removed by the Contractor from the trenches by pumping or other means, and the trench must be kept perfectly free from water when the jointing of the pipe is being done.\n\n10.0 Backfilling Trenches: No backfilling shall be done until the pipes laid and jointed have been inspected and approved of by the Engineer.\n\nAfter permission has been given, the trench shall be filled with selected earth free from stones and rubbish to a depth of at least two feet above the top of the pipe, thoroughly consolidated and compacted by ramming with suitable tools.\n\nAfter the pipes have been covered with two feet of filling as specified, the remainder of the trench may be filled by hand, team or machinery. No large stones shall be allowed to be placed in the trench.\n\n11.0 Coating Pipes: All galvanized pipes will have a heavy coating of hot coal tar or pitch applied before being jointed.\n\n12.0 Joints: All vitrified tile drain pipes are to be laid from lower end up and the contractor will see that each length of pipe is clean before being laid. A gasket of hemp or jute of sufficient size will be inserted between the hub and spigot and properly rammed so that a space 1\" in depth shall remain for cement mortar, to be inserted. The space between the spigot and hub shall be completely filled with mortar thoroughly pressed in all around and very promptly sealed to secure a tight joint. The mortar shall be applied with a rubber mitten and rammed or compacted with a wooden caulking tool. Joints shall be finished all around with a neat level. The interior of each pipe joint shall be scraped clean of all projecting material.\n\n13.0 Payments: Payments will be made at the time and in the manner following:\n\nThe Contractor shall be entitled to eighty per centum (80%) of the value of the finished work at the end of every month after its commencement on the certified estimate of the engineer, approved by the Commissioner.\n\nAll the permanent equipment to be installed in accordance with the plans and specifications approved and forming part of this contract is to be\npaid for on an eighty per centum (80%) basis when laid down on the property on the certificate of the engineer.\n\nThe remainder of the amount of the contract price with the exception of any deductions required to be made in accordance with this contract, shall, on the completion of the work, be paid to the Contractor, on the certificate of the Engineer, approved by the Commissioner, that the work has been satisfactorily completed in accordance with the terms of the contract.\n\n14.0 In the event of solid rock being encountered in any of the excavations the same will be paid for on a cost basis plus fifteen per centum (15%).\n\n15.0 The works specified herein are to be completed ready for use within a period of ninety (90) days of the signing of the contract.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nThe Commissioner of Irrigation,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nSirs-\n\nIn accordance with your instructions I visited the work being undertaken under contract to Mr. John Towers at the Onion Lake Indian Residential School on the 27th and 28th instants and beg to report as follows:\n\nSewerage Disposal Plant:\n\nGood progress has been made on the sewerage system, the trench having been excavated and a 6\" drain pipe laid for some 100' above and 90' below the septic tank. The septic tank is well advanced, concrete for the floor and some 3 to 4 feet of wall having been poured. Excellent sand and gravel has been found for this work at a distance of some three miles from it.\n\nThe extension of the sewerage disposal line which was recommended in our letter of the 26th instant was investigated and it was found that the proposed extension was desirable for the following reasons:\n\n(1) It places the disposal beds at a more suitable and desirable distance from the school buildings.\n\n(2) The extension places the beds on an area more suited topographically for efficient distribution.\n\nIn addition to the cost mentioned in our letter of the 26th instant there will also be a small extra for the construction of a concrete chamber at the point where the boiler room sewer line intersects the septic tank line.\n\nExcavation for the boiler room sewer line revealed the fact that the outlet elevation at the concrete wall of the building was 11 feet below the ground level. This is considerably deeper than originally estimated and entails a deeper trench, which will be partly in solid rock. Arrangements were therefore made with the contractor to take out the difference between estimated depth and actual depth required on a cost plus 15% basis. When the outlet pipe at this point was uncovered it was also found to be obstructed with concrete and debris. An examination of the sump in the boiler room revealed further obstruction which should be cleared out by the contractor for the building. The possibility of obstruction of this pipe within the building indicated the necessity of an inspection chamber at a point outside the building, as shown in red on attached plan. An inspection chamber at this point will enable the plant engineer to determine whether any future obstructions lie within or without the building.\n\nOn the sewerage line which takes care of the toilet, baths, etc., a similar inspection chamber should be constructed. On this line obstructions are even more likely to occur than on the line from the boiler room and laundry due to the open flush type of toilets installed for the children and the tendency to dispose of undesirable refuse through the toilets. The necessity of this inspection chamber was so apparent that instructions were left with the contractor to install same on...\nthe cost plus 15% basis. As only some 2 cubic yards of concrete are required for each chamber and a simple wooden cover will be quite sufficient, the added expense will not be a very serious matter.\n\nWater Supply:\n\nAn inspection of the trenches excavated for the sewerage disposal plant revealed the fact that frost penetrated the ground to a depth of 9 feet. In preparing the original cost estimates it was presumed that 8 feet of cover would be sufficient protection for this line. This depth of cover was based upon the assumption that some protection would be afforded by the winter snowfall. It is now realised that this cannot be depended upon in this locality as it is being experienced that in some years only a very light snowfall is received. In view of this information and the serious consequences which would result from a frozen water supply main, it was decided to place this main approximately 1 foot deeper than was originally estimated. An adjustment will be made with the contractor for the added depth.\n\nFire Protection Plant:\n\nIn Mr. Goodchild's original report he stressed the desirability for an adequate system of fire protection, particularly so in view of the value of the building and its equipment. It was considered that provision should be made for at least four streams of 80 gallons per minute each at a pressure of 50 pounds playing simultaneously. From an examination of the fire fighting equipment which has been installed, I do not think it would be possible to use the full capacity of the big fire pump directly into this system. My reason for this statement is that it is most unlikely that a fire would break out on two or more floors at the same time and to endeavor to concentrate the full discharge through the 2\u00bd\" or even the 2\" fire appliances on the various floors of the building would be dangerous to the whole system.\n\nI therefore recommend that provision be made for installing at the discharge end of the pump a 3\" piece with valve and short length of 5\" pipe to the reservoir. This will permit operator to adjust his pressure on the discharge line and return balance of the flow to the reservoir.\n\nThe present location of the fire fighting pump house is far too close to the main building and as it is merely a frame structure, it might easily be endangered by a fire in the main building and rendered useless for the purpose for which it was installed. I therefore propose changing the location of the reservoir and pump house and placing them some 40 feet to the east of the main building, as shown on attached amended plan of the layout.\n\nIt is also considered desirable that a length of some 150 feet of 2\u00bd\" fire hose be on hand at the pump house for immediate use. With a direct service from the pump an incipient fire in or around the buildings could be very effectively dealt with. The additional cost for extra equipment in this case is being obtained, and will consist of:\n\n- 1 hose hanger\n- 150' - 2\u00bd\" canvas hose\n- 1 - 5' 3\"pm piece\n- 1 - 5\" value\n\nIn order to utilize all of the storage water in case of fire a slight change has been found desirable in the plan of the...\nreservoir. This entails provision for a 2-foot sump for the 5-inch suction line as shown on the attached blue-print of the changes recommended in this report.\n\nRain-water Tank:\n\nThe position of the rain-water tank originally shown on the west side of the building will now be constructed on the east side and will adjoin the fire protection reservoir. This change will entail no additional cost and was necessitated by the fact that the outlet point provided by the contractors to connect with the rain-water tank was presumed to be on the other side of the building.\n\nRemark:\n\nIt is rather unfortunate that our engineer was not provided with a plan of the building at the time the original survey was made. Had he been furnished with a plan of the general layout, showing the position of fire protection pipelines, sewer outlet points and elevations, much time and a great deal of the changes now found necessary could have been avoided.\n\nI am attaching a blue-print of the changes recommended in this report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nReclamation Engineer.\nCERTIFICATE.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nLloydminster, June 30, 1928.\n\nCertificate No. 1.\n\n$1,776.70\n\nI hereby certify that John Powers,\n\nhas supplied material and performed labour on Onion Lake\n\nR.C.

We know of no reason why it should not be taken over and if there are reasons we feel we are entitled to know.\n\nWe have Inspectors letter dated June 27th accepting work as satisfactory excepting boiler testing, which cannot be done until water pressure is established but we have the Plumbing Contractor's guarantee that he will complete anything in his line as soon as notification is given when same can be done.\n\nWe cannot surmise why we should be expected to carry insurance and wait settlement for minor things we have no control of. We are also informed no precautions whatever are now being taken against fire, such as preventing smoking and so forth in the building. This coupled with the fact no water supply is available to quench a fire, we now urge you to place your own insurance on the building immediately as we take no further responsibility through loss by fire. But we are willing to contribute any just share of Premiums.\n\nPlease advise when we can expect settlement and if delay is through any fault of ours.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

S. Tempest, Commissioner of Irrigation:\n\n\"Re Onion Lake Roman Catholic Indian School Contract. Stop Main rain water outlet pipe from roof placed by contractors for building is three feet below sewer outlet. Stop This greatly complicates the situation as sewage system as now constructed cannot be utilized for surplus rain water. Stop Only possible solution is to utilize trench new excavated for the three inch water main and install a separate four inch vitrified tile drain from rain water reservoir total length approximately five hundred feet.

I notified him that the matter had been taken up with their firm and that they informed you that the L 2 switch board was in every way suitable for the plant using batteries.\n\nThey quoted me the cost of an expert to connect up the plant would be $50.00 and any material required in the work would be extra, so I would ask you to either take the matter up with them direct or if you wish I could take the matter up personally with them here in Regina.\n\nAwaiting your decision in the matter I remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nYou will find herewith enclosed the time sheets for the balance of the labour on the fittings at the R C Indian Residential School Onion Lake, and a statement showing the total amounts paid out by me.\n\nWages for the week ending May 19th $123.50\n\" \" \" \" 26th 223.70\n\" \" \" \" June 2nd 230.70\n\" \" \" \" 9th 255.50\n\" \" \" \" 16th 175.50\n\" \" \" \" 23rd 195.50\n\" \" \" \" 30th 96.00\n\" \" \" \" July 7th 92.65\n\nBy Cheque received $600.00\nAmount paid out by me over the amount of cheques $724.00\n\nMr Daniels claims in his letter to me that he worked ten hours more than the time sheet shows so I have written to Mr McRea whom I asked to keep the time the men worked after I left for Regina, and as soon as I hear from him I will let you know.\n\nThere were twenty four benches the men made for the Dining Room, two for each of the twelve tables for the Dining Room which partly accounts for the cost of labour going over what I had estimated.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction\nApril 19th, 1938.\n\nMr. W.A.

Mr Hudson of the firm of Brown & Hudson claimed to have a receipt in full from P T Roberts about the beginning of the year and I asked him to turn it over to me which he refused to do, and three months after that I received a letter from P Roberts dated April 15th stating that they had not received a settlement so far which will show where I stand in the matter.\n\nI think that the best thing for Brown & Hudson to do is to get busy and get the sub-contracts cleaned up and get their own part of the work done and there will be no trouble in getting a settlement as the government is as anxious as they are to get a settlement as the contract was given to Brown & Hudson on the understanding that it would be completed by Dec 8th/27 which leaves them seven months behind the 8th of this month.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n259 Lorne Street\nJune 30th 1926.\n\nW.

According to his contract he had to honor and pay the certificate and it now appears that certain parties are making claim for not having been paid by the sub-contractor who received the $3000.00. It would further appear that at the time this certificate was given anywhere near $3000.00 worth of painting had not been done. We have advised Messrs. Brown & Hudson that you are personally liable with respect to this matter and before taking the matter up with the authorities at Ottawa, we are writing you this letter so as to give you an opportunity to arrange matters and issue final certificate.\n\nWe are informed that with respect to the account of Roberts, our client's presented to you a receipt in full signed by Roberts.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBONNAR HOLLANDS & PHILP\n\nPer, Ward Hollands.\n\nWH/KK\nEnc.\nRegina July 17th/28\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nI received a letter from Brown and Hudson Solicitors demanding a final estimate on contract for the Roman Catholic Indian Residential School.

I remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector\nNote\n\nRe: Rain-water and sewerage outlet pipe\n\nAll rain-water pipes are concreted in place and any changes in position at this time would entail great expense and much inconvenience for the staff.\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI wired you on the 14th instant in regard to some proposed changes which are required in connection with the work of the water supply and sewage disposal system at the Onion Lake Catholic Indian Residential School.\n\nMr. John Towers, the contractor, made a special visit to Calgary on the 14th instant, as he was greatly worried when he found the conditions which existed in connection with the outlet elevation for the rain-water system. As I pointed out to you in my wire, the contractor for the building placed the outlet for the rain-water system some 3.1' lower than the downward outlet pipe. It is therefore impossible to connect the two systems. The solution of the problem was outlined to you in my telegram and this method of dealing with the overflow from the roof will be more clearly brought to your attention by a perusal of the attached blue-print, whereon we have shown the proposed changes. Mr. Towers, who realized the importance of taking some immediate action in order to safeguard the department's interests, at once instructed his men to begin to clear the trench of the 6\" service water supply line so that the overflow from the rain-water reservoir could be taken to a suitable point near the spring and the line carried in the same trench. It is considered that a 4\" vitrified tile pipe some 500' in length will be required and in order to save expense and not hold up the contractor, instructions have been issued for this work to be undertaken. It is hoped that our action in this regard, which appears to us to be the only alternative in a very unsatisfactory situation, will meet with the support of the Indian Department.\n\nMr. Towers advised us that on July 5th last they experienced an exceptionally heavy rainfall lasting over four hours\u2014in fact, practically a cloud-burst. This downpour flooded the boiler-house and caused a great deal of inconvenience generally. Fortunately, however, by getting his men to work late that night, he was able to relieve the situation by sawing a hole through the wall of the boiler-house and connecting with the sewer line, which had already been constructed. He also reported that the roof of the building caused considerable trouble and inconvenience due to leakage.\n\nWe are advised that it is the intention of the Indian Department to install a small steam heater and tank in the boiler-house to be used in connection with the laundry. This has not yet been installed and we should be glad to be informed as to whether or not it is the intention to install this plant, as there is no method at present by which the soft water from the rain-water tank can be heated. It could, however, be connected with such a heating plant and thereby render a double service.\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Reclamation,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOTTAWA.\nThe work generally is progressing satisfactorily and the septic tank is to be in use in the very near future, Mr. Towers wishing to give the concrete walls and floor a few more days to set before connecting up with the building.\n\nIn order to save expense, we instructed the contractor on the 14th instant to include in his earload of equipment being shipped from Winnipeg on Wednesday, the 18th, the additional items of fire fighting equipment which were referred to you in my letter dated the 7th instant. We trust this action will duly receive your approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd) J.S.Tempest\n\nCommissioner of Irrigation.\nSir,\n\nRe Onion Lake Indian Residential School - Your file: 115-8-15.\n\nWith further reference to my letter of July 16th, I am attaching herewith a copy of a letter from our Commissioner of Irrigation giving further details of the necessity for the change in plans, at an additional expenditure of $800, to provide a separate drain from the rain water reservoir. I should be glad to have your approval of the Commissioner's action in authorizing the contractor to proceed with this construction.\n\nEnc.\n\nI should also be pleased to have your instructions in regard to the fourth paragraph of the Commissioner's letter, in which he wishes to be advised if it is the intention to install a steam heater and tank in the boiler-house in connection with the laundry, in order that provision may be made to connect such a heater with the rain-water tank.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Indian Residential School during July. There are two or three matters that should be brought to your attention before the final certificate is issued. The roofing is leaking very badly in several places. I am satisfied there was a very poor job done in this connection. In the boiler room the cement floor is lower in two or three places than at the drain, and the management has considerable difficulty getting rid of the water. The Principal understands that final balanced iron stairs are to be supplied for the fire escapes. These are not in place.\n\nThen, there is a matter that should be attended to immediately, if you consider it should be allowed. The Principal would like a water connection for the barn. This can be made from the outside stand pipe at the school, a \u00bd inch pipe to a cement cistern which is in the barn. This pipe line can be drained by a valve in the cellar of the main building. The total cost, if Mr. Agent Turner is authorized to do the work, will be in the neighbourhood of $250.\n\nI may say that on the -12 file I am authorizing the Agent to engage a carpenter to brace the dining room tables and benches. These were very poorly done and can be wrenched apart by hand.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In connection with this matter of tools, may I quote from a letter now at hand from a member of our staff who will have among other duties, the repair of all boots and shoes of the staff and student body\u2014\"A complete set of shoe repair tools including a foot power sewing machine, lasts, Etc., recently purchased by the Gov't. for a returned soldier at a cost of $126.00 is now for sale in Edmonton for $125.00. The outfit is good and serviceable in every way, and is what is needed at the school for the maintenance of the footwear.\"\n\nMay I ask that you consider it made up this an expensive item for us, and consider our application for this, or a similar outfit, that our cobbler may keep in repair the good supply of shoes we have provided for the students here, as well as providing us with the means of teaching interested students something of this trade.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nL. Balter, O. M. I.\nPrincipal.\nOnion Lake Agency\n\nOnion Lake, Saskatchewan\nAugust 20th, 1928\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a letter received from Rev. L. Balter, principal at the Onion Lake Roman Catholic Indian Residential School; asking the Department to expend a further sum of $40.00 for tools, etc., for the water and lighting plants. The articles now asked for are extra valves, unions, packing and welding compound. As will be seen from his letter, the Reverend Principal is also asking for a complete set of shoe repair tools.\n\nI have also been requested to ask the Department to supply strong iron screens for the windows in both the boys' and girls' recreation rooms, and also a screen door for each of these rooms. I estimate that this work will cost, approximately, $60.00. The iron screens for the windows were spoken of at the time of Mr. Ferrier's visit to the school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMr. Lang Turner, Agent,\nOnion Lake Indian Agency.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nCalling to your attention the matters discussed by Mr. Ferrier at the time of his inspection of the R. C. Residential School here, I take the liberty of enumerating them in what to us seems the order of their importance, although their proper order is hard to determine, as we consider the following additions to the establishment all necessary.\n\nForemost possibly in importance, is the talked of storage quarters for the food supply. We have nothing in the way of frost-proof storage for the vegetables etc., which form an important part of our food.\n\nAn additional root cellar is possible to construct quickly, but is not accessible during cold weather, and the scheme outlined by Mr. Ferrier seems to be the logical solution of this important feature, consequently, we ask for its construction.\n\nThe matter of the cement floors seems next in importance, not only as a matter of economy to the Dept., by making the floors give much longer service, or the very considerable difference in the amount of labor required to keep them in the condition necessary to a clean house, but the matter of the health of the entire student body may easily be affected by dusty, crumbly cement floors during the long winter months when so much time must be spent by all the occupants indoors.\n\nWe ask, therefor, that this matter be given due consideration.\n\nNext, the water supply to the stable. This, I will submit, is a reasonable addition to the water supply which the Dept. is installing at the present time.\n\nThe stable contains a water trough for the stock, and the pipes extend outside of the stable walls, so that the trench from the main building to the stable, with the connecting pipe line is all that is required to complete the installation.\n\nIf this request is granted, might I request that arrangements be made as soon as possible, as the contractor installing the water system here at the present time is in a position to complete the line to the barn probably quicker and cheaper than if another man has to bring in his outfit just for this job.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. L. Balter, Principal\nR. C. Indian Residential School\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6325, file 659-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nWith reference to the recent visit of Mr. Ferrier to the residential schools at this Agency, I have the honour to enclose herewith a letter received from the Principal of the R.C. School.\n\nWith respect to the frost-proof storage for vegetables etc., I believe an excavation could be made adjoining the stores quarters in the basement at this school and a room built in the excavation made entirely of concrete and fitted with bins etc. for the sum of approximately $525.00.\n\nWith respect to the painting of the concrete floors, I have obtained a tender from Mr. G. Blower, a painter in this neighbourhood, for this work. Mr. Blower to supply the material and do the work for the sum of $275.50.\n\nWith respect to the water supply to the barn, I have already received authority from the Department to proceed with this work.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient Servant.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 28, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 99-13 of the 20th instant, with reference to tools and screens for the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School. In reply I have to authorize you to expend the sum of $40 for valves, unions, etc. You may also have iron screens placed in the recreation rooms at an approximate cost of $60. If the Reverend Principal needs a shoe repair outfit, it should be purchased from the per capita grant or other receipts.\n\nI have also your second letter of the same date, enclosing a communication from the Rev. Principal, concerning the cold storage beside the laundry door on the south side. There are no funds available for this improvement at the present time; but a note has been taken for next year's estimates.\n\nI note that you have secured a price for painting the concrete floors. I may say that the building specifications call for one coat of an approved brand of concrete hardener. Please let me know if this was applied. You should also inform me if an additional coat of hardener is required before the floor is painted. I may add that the ordinary paint is not at all suitable for concrete work. There an approved substitute should be used. When you have determined just what is required, you might let me have a further estimate of the cost. If you report that one coat of hardener was not applied, it will be necessary for me to take the matter up with the contractors.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

Ferris, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nA very unfortunate situation has developed here in connection with our sewerage system. A kitchen drain, which was found stopped up, upon being cleaned disclosed the fact that the main sewer drain has parted, evidently from settling, and that sewage water from the kitchens, wash basins etc., is being deposited under the floors of the basement rooms, between the foundation walls, and is not being carried outside of the building at all.\n\nActing on the report of our engineer here, we took the matter up with the contractors in Winnipeg, and they have a man on the job here now, who is not, however a plumber, and is simply wired in his report to the contractor, and is awaiting instructions.\n\nThe excavation for parts of this building was made too deep, and filled in again. This filled dirt has settled, leaving portions of the floor unsupported underneath, and the boilers are endangered as well. Water from recent rain storms has washed completely under the building, from which fact you may judge of the condition underneath.\n\nThis sewer repair, if left to the devices of an unscrupulous plumber, might be made utterly futile by simply joining the ends of the broken pipe together with an additional length, thus forcing the sewerage out through its proper outlet, but forming a sump in the sunken pipe which would be a constant source of trouble and expense, as well as a menace to the health of all occupants of the building. This sort of a repair, even under the adverse conditions prevailing here, could not be made successfully while the job of putting it back in the position specified by your architect would undoubtedly cost several times that.\n\nWhere the responsibility for this condition will rest, we may not judge. Neither are we in any position to insist on immediate action, which you will see is vitally necessary, as the children are now coming in, and we are without any sewer at all.\n\nMay we ask, therefore, that you will see that we get action on this?\n\nMay we suggest, also, that the matter requires the presence of an inspector with authority to see that the repair is properly made.\n\nWith the latter request comes the thought that a member of our staff would be personally interested in the matter, and could act in that capacity for the Dep't, more economically than any other, so far as this matter for all time, and our engineer, knowing of these things, would seem to us to be the logical person for that job. May we therefor, suggest his appointment for this sewer matter? Would you care for a detailed report from him as to the condition of the building generally?\n\nVery Respectfully,\n\nRev. L. Balter, O. M. I.\nPrinciple.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6325, file 659-5, part 3)\nOnion Lake, ask.\nAug. 30th, 1925.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSup't. of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nThere is a letter in the mail for you mailed at Onion Lake, so this one may reach you first, in which case you will have the full explanation of this one, which is being written in haste.\n\nThe sewer mess, which was the subject of the above mentioned letter, may be in the process of being solved, as a wire to Bearisto Ltd., Winnipeg, the contractor, brought the reply that \"Hamilton knows where the extra outlet for that sewer is\".\n\nWe have wired Hamilton, the Dep't. inspector who was on this job, for the location of this outlet, as it is not in the plans or any note of it anywhere that we can find. The Dep't. of Water and Power, who are putting the outside sewer and water connections know nothing of it, and it seems to be a brain child of Mr. Hamilton, and kept a dark secret.\n\nIf this hidden outlet is found, and it is in working order, most of the trouble will be at an end as far as that is concerned, but when all the known connections were made, and the sewer was put in use, all the waste mentioned in the other letter was being dumped under the floors, and is now quite horrible mess.\n\nIn view of the above, the other letter will not prove to be altogether a false alarm, and as soon as there is anything definite known or done, we will inform you fully, since we have taken the matter up with you personally.\n\nResp'y.\n\nRev.

Tank to be completed first, then dam.\n\nReservoirs at School.\n\nExcavation about 40% completed.\n\nThe above details show all the work done to date.\n\nA considerable amount of rock has been encountered and, as has been already emphasized, circumstances and contingencies have arisen which have caused changes in design and arrangement and layout and these have somewhat delayed operations.\n\nOn the whole, however, excellent progress has been made, and the school authorities are highly pleased with the progress made and the obvious quality of the work done.\n\nAnother month will see the job practically completed barring accidents or any serious and unforeseen obstacles to the proper completion of the work.\n\nRecommendations.\n\n1. The writer is of the opinion that the water in the rain-water tank should be made available for use in case of fire or for the domestic uses of the school. This can be done very simply by placing a connecting pipe - say 4\" in the wall between the two tanks, at the bottom of the rain-water tank.\n\nThis should, of course, have a valve, spindle, and wheel to control the flow, the latter carried up through the roof of the tank into the pumphouse.\n\n2. The writer is also of the opinion that means (a valve, spindle and wheel, the latter properly braced) of draining the pool above the dam at the spring should be made available, so that work inside the tank may be possible, if such be at any time necessary.\n\n3. A third recommendation is that the contractor be authorized to extend the deep 10' section of the dam to a distance of 25' from the tank, instead of 15' as on place, in order to permit the dam to rest on solid clay bottom at the lower side of the pool.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd.

(RG 10, Volume 6325, file 659-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sirs,\n\nI received word from Brown & Hudson Contractors for the erection of the R C Indian Residential School at Onion Lake Aug 13 saying that the contract was completed except some minor items, so on the strength of that information and waiting a couple of weeks I proceeded to Onion Lake Sept 1st. I found on arrival that there had been practically nothing done by them since I had visited the school July 8th.\n\nThe sub-contractors were trying to make arrangements with men in the locality to do the work but up to the present time they have failed to get any one to do the work.\n\nThey told me in their letter that they took the matter up with Mr Gurney Orr when he was in Kenora and he suggested that I issue the final estimate and hold what I considered was enough to cover the work which is incomplete, but seeing that at the present it is so hard to get action from them now it would be more so if they received what was coming to them except the amount covering the work to be done, but if you wish it done that way I will make arrangements to have the estimate issued.\n\nThey wrote me about trying to have it arranged to cancel the insurance on the building and under the circumstances I should judge that as the mission have occupied the school that Brown and Hudson should be relieved of carrying the insurance, and I would ask your opinion re same.\n\nThey are also asking for an extra of $5250.00 as they claim that when they figured on the school they understood that it was to be erected in Onion Lake alongside of the old one, and in my opinion I consider if that was the case it should be the other way as the old school is over six miles further away from the railway than where it is now located, and they told me that they were given to understand that the distance from the railway to the school was 35 miles and I took the trouble to get the mileage registered on the truck they hauled their material with which gave it a little less than 30 miles to the present site and over 36 miles to where the old school was located, so if there was any adjustment to be made it would be in favor of the Department of Indian Affairs instead of to Brown and Hudson.\n\nThere were several items I wished to take up with Dr Scott when he was in Regina and asked Mr W M Graham to arrange for an interview and he promised he would when Mr Scott was here but for some reason he never phoned to let me know but perhaps they were too busy while they were here.\n\nI am figuring out some adjustments of several changes in the layout which were requested by the mission, and I think the reductions will more than cover the extras apart from the recreation...\nI am herewith enclosing some estimates which were sent to me here and asked me to forward same to you. One is for staining and varnishing the Chapel Pews, the other is for painting the cement floors and which they claim was taken up with Mr Ferrier when he was at Onion Lake.\n\nI am also enclosing an account from The W H Cushing Co for Chapel Pews which is in accordance with estimate forwarded to you re same. The Cupboards which were ordered from The Western Mfg Co were shipped from here the last of the month and as soon as the account is received will be checked and forwarded to you.\n\nI remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\n2259 Lorne Street\nSept. 12, 1928.\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nMay have water supply to burn installed price quoted.\n\nJ.

H. Goodchild.\nDepartment of the Interior\nCanada\n\nDOMINION WATER POWER AND RECLAMATION SERVICE\n\nCalgary, Alberta,\nSeptember 22, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing in duplicate details of extras in connection with the July and August estimates for Contractor J. Towers; also, the August certificate for $6,398.27 in connection with the contract for the water supply and sewerage works at the Onion Lake (R.C.) Indian Residential School. I should be glad if you would be good enough to forward these statements to the Department of Indian Affairs for approval and early payment.\n\nIn regard to the second paragraph of Mr. Goodchild's report, I may say that the delay in connection with forwarding the July certificate was explained in my letter of August 28.\n\nIn reference to the installation of a 3\" valve for emptying the small reservoir created by the dam, should occasion arise. Mr. Jennings discussed this question with Mr. Towers during his recent visit to Onion Lake and as provision has already been made through the contract for the installation of this outlet, and as the latter has estimated a cost of $250.00 instructions were issued to the contractor to install the control valve. It is considered that this is very desirable as it will undoubtedly be necessary, for various reasons, to be able to empty the reservoir from time to time.\n\nIn regard to connecting the spring water reservoir with the rainwater reservoir, it is not considered that this is necessary or desirable and the additional expense is therefore not recommended.\n\nMr. Jennings reports that no provision was made in the original tender for painting buildings and has instructed Mr. Towers to submit an estimate of cost for this work. It is considered that two coats of a brick red with dark olive trimmings would be suitable for the buildings. However, if there is any particular color scheme which the Department of Indian Affairs wishes to follow, it should be able to resolve the question respecting same. It has been found necessary to enlarge the pump-house at the reservoir near the building. This is due chiefly to the fact that two large water tanks for cooling purposes had to be installed near the 25 h.p. engine. These large tanks necessitate a different type of roof and the contractor has therefore been instructed to enlarge the building to provide sufficient accommodation for the tanks and a stove for heating purposes and will be paid the difference between the original estimate and the actual cost of the addition plus 15%.\n\nThe contractor has been somewhat concerned about the installation of the 25 h.p. engine, particularly so as the method of connection shown in the drawing submitted cannot be followed out on the ground due to the presence of a large muffler on the engine which is not shown on the drawing, and prevents the drive being taken off as shown on the plans. In order to correct this condition, it will be necessary to move the engine over to one side and enlarge the concrete foundation to provide for this change. Mr. Jennings reports that there was no alternative in this case and therefore instructed the contractor to proceed at once with the large engine base and to charge the additional concrete required, as an extra.\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Reclamation,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6325, file 659-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFrom Mr. Jennings's verbal report regarding his visit, it would appear that considerable improvement could be made to the condition at the dam by installing a few drain pipes with open joints covered with loose gravel. These are considered necessary in order to collect the water and lead it into the filter bed adjoining the spillway and pump house. In this connection, I may say that the spring water supply at this point needed a great deal more work to insure the collection of the various small seepages than was originally contemplated; in fact, Mr. Towers opened up numerous little channels by hand digging and collected these various little streams,\u2014thereby greatly improving the supply. It is now considered that by installing the drain pipes in the manner indicated and covering them with brush and earth, the supply will be preserved and the \"sink\" eliminated. In order to compensate the contractor for the work already done in this connection and also for the additional work contemplated, I would recommend that an expenditure of $25.00 be approved. The work of covering up with brush and earth to afford protection against frost will be done by the engineer and directions have already been given him in this regard.\n\nMr. Jennings has further advised me that he considers a further expenditure at the distribution beds from the septic tank would greatly improve conditions at this point. The distribution channels, which have been constructed in accordance with the plan, are working satisfactorily, but by cutting down the ends of the channels to ground level and extending these in one or two places a very much better distribution would be made. As the cost of doing this work is estimated by the contractor at $10.00, I would recommend that he be instructed to carry out same. Mr. Jennings has drawn my attention to the unsatisfactory delivery of material which the contractor has experienced. Various items of plant and machinery have been delivered with parts missing or not in accordance with the original orders. This has caused considerable delay in erection and has been costly to the contractor. The pumphouse and engine were not assembled at the factory prior to shipment and in both cases, pulleys required changing and other minor parts were in many instances missing.\n\nI would like to mention at this time the fact that the contractor has on many occasions been of great assistance to the staff at the school. During the month of July, when the building was flooded, his men worked at night to help relieve the condition. At other periods, when furniture and equipment was being delivered, his men helped to carry same into the building in order that it might not be damaged by rain and storm. During Mr. Jennings's visit he found the contractor's men were being used for operating the steam plant for heating the school owing to the fact that the caretaker was indisposed. These are only some of the many ways in which the contractor has been of great assistance to the staff at the school and on no occasion has he made any charge for these services. The job on the whole has been a difficult one owing to the fact that the conditions found at the building in regard to outlet pipes, etc., were not in accordance with the drawings submitted. Furthermore, owing to the rainy season and the bad state of the roads between Lloydminster and the school, additional cost of freighting has been unavoidable.\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) J. S. Tempest,\nCommissioner of Irrigation.\nPrince Albert, Sask. Sept.19,1928.\n\nThe Commissioner of Irrigation,\nW. P. & R. S.,\nCalgary.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to report progress made on Onion Lake School contract as follows - as on Sept.14.\n\nDam and well at spring:-\n\nDam complete except for opening at base of wall left to take outlet pipe, if such be decided upon.\n\nAs previously reported a 3\" valve, stem, etc., are on the job and this part of the work can be completed in a day or two when the contractor is notified to go ahead. The writer considers the 3\" valve quite adequate for the purpose.\n\nWell.- This concrete tank is completed.\n\nMachinery.- On the spot but not hooked up.\n\nPumphouse.- Practically completed but not yet floored.\n\nWater Supply Line.- Trenching, pipe laying and backfilling done.\n\nReservoir and Soft Water Tank.- Concrete tanks completed. Backfilling around sides completed.\n\nMachinery at reservoir.- Pump and engine bases complete.\n\nMachinery on the spot and suction pipe was being connected with pump which was in place at time of visit.\n\nEngine had not been set on its base on Sept. 14 but was on the spot and ready.\n\nSewage Disposal Plant.- Completed and ready for use; in fact being used in so far as possible without water in the building.\n\nPlant for Pumping Soft Water.- Not yet installed.\n\nPressure tanks & machinery for engineerom.- On the spot but not in place.\n\nFrom the foregoing it will be seen that the work is nearing completion; in fact, the contractor figures that the first week in October will see it completed.\n\nNo further delays are anticipated and the work remaining is mainly the installation of the machinery, piping, etc.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6325, file 659-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAs you well know, the lack of any plans or information as to the layout of plumbing, drain pipes, etc., has delayed progress and increased the cost, but in spite of these holdups the Contractor has made excellent progress and done good work.\n\nThe workmanship is of a high order and when finished the job may be considered a permanent one. No serious troubles may be expected to develop.\n\nIt is the writer's intention to keep in touch with Mr. Towers to know just when the work is finished so as to make only one more trip necessary. He also wishes to suggest that Mr. Jennings make the final inspection with him so that he may also see the plant in operation and be able to judge of its satisfactoriness.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) R.H. Goodchild.\nDepartment of the Interior\nCanada\n\nDominion Water Power and Reclamation Service\n\nCalgary, Alta.,\nSeptember 24, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nWe have now received Mr. Goodchild's report on the progress made on the Onion Lake Indian (R.C.) Residential School contract as at September 14, two copies of which are enclosed for your information.\n\nIn regard to Mr. Goodchild's remarks dealing with the dam and well at the spring, we would point out that Mr. Jennings has already given instructions to Mr. Towers, the contractor, to install the 3rd valve in the dam so that the reservoir can be emptied at any time it should become necessary.\n\nPumphouse:\n\nThe pumphouse at the dam and spring is completed with the exception of a small strip of concrete flooring which still remains to be done owing to the fact that the pumphouse was slightly enlarged and the additional piece of concrete floor will therefore require extra labour. This is a very small item and the contractor was instructed to complete the flooring before leaving the work.\n\nAs you will note from Mr. Goodchild's report, the work is progressing satisfactorily and the contractor expects to have the plants in operation by the first week of October. The whole of the contract has been carried out in a workman-like manner and as Mr. Goodchild points out, is of a high order and when finished may be considered permanent, so that no serious troubles whatever should develop. The extras which have been necessary have been due entirely to the fact that the plans prepared in this office were based upon an inspection of the building made in the winter months and not on any new plans for the building showing drain pipes, outlets and other conditions indicated by the contractor of the building. It is therefore considered that the additional items which have been recommended were under the circumstances unavoidable and necessary expenditures.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. S. Tempest,\nCommissioner of Irrigation.\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power and Reclamation,\nDepartment of Interior,\nOttawa.\nYour file number: 115-8-15.\n\nI enclose herewith copies of two letters received from Mr. V.S. Tempest, the Commissioner of Irrigation, with reference to the water supply and sewage system now being installed at the Onion Lake Indian residential school, to which are attached certificates in duplicate for the payment to the contractor, Mr. J. Towers, of $6,318.00 on account of the contract with extras amounting to $50.27, or a total of $6368.27, this being the third monthly certificate on account of this particular contract.\n\nYou will note that the estimated sum to complete the contract is $1150.31.\n\nI am also enclosing a copy of the resident engineer's August estimate for the Onion Lake school with particulars as to the extra work carried out during July and August, together with a progress report as at September 14. From this material you will see that the work is now nearly completed and according to Mr. Tempest's report has been carried out in a workman-like manner, which should give satisfaction when completed.\n\nI beg to draw your attention to the extras which have been carried out and those which are recommended to be made. As Mr. Tempest points out these extras have been necessary due to the fact that the plans prepared in our Calgary office were based upon an inspection of the building made in the winter months and without any detail plans of the building showing drain pipes, outlets and other connections installed by the contractor of the building. From the information now before me I am of the opinion that the extras recommended are necessary and I shall be obliged if you will give your authority to have them completed in accordance with our engineer's recommendations.\n\nI shall be glad also if you will send me a cheque for the third payment to the contractor amounting to $6368.27, and transmission to Mr. Towers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6325, file 659-5, part 3)\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of the 28th ult.

McLean Assistant,\nDeputy & Secretary\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to our letter of Sep. 10th with reference to the Lighting Plant at the Indian Residential School, Onion Lake, Sask.\n\nWe were very much surprised to receive the following Telegram this morning from our Engineer who is now at Onion Lake:\n\n\"Absolutely nothing done to installation of engine or Batteries stop No floor in Engine Room and no support for Battery stop looks like about fourteen days work have no instructions to install engine do you want me to stay until installation is completed is the engine installation up to us.\"\n\nIt was our understanding that we were to send a man to wire up the Switchboard and start the Engine only.\n\nIn view of the fact that nothing has been done to the installation and since Onion Lake is rather inaccessible and an expensive point to reach, we were prompted to instruct our Engineer to remain and carry the work to its completion.\n\nWe trust that this will meet with your approval and that it will be in order for us to bill you.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6325, file 659-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sirs,\n\nI have just received a letter from Fairbanks Morse Co saying that the expert had arrived at the R C Indian School, Onion Lake and wired them that the electric lighting plant was not set up or the floor of the machinery room put in.\n\nI wish to say that the concrete base for the engine and generator was put in before I left there and the engine and generator was in place ready for the belting to be put on.\n\nThe floor of the machinery room over the pit where the pressure tanks were to be placed for the water system was not put in and the contractor agreed to put in the floor as soon as he got the tanks in place, and as soon as I received word that the floor was not completed I wired Mr Turner to have someone do this work and I have received word from him that the expert would be through about Saturday.\n\nMr Brown of the firm of Brown & Hudson came to Regina last Saturday to see me re the adjustments of the extras and deductions in connection with the R C Indian School but we could not see the matter in the same light, he has asked me to go to Ottawa with him but I would not give him any answer to the proposition as I consider some of his claims are unreasonable, and I would like to have your suggestion in the matter before I give him any answer.\n\nThere was two accounts sent in to your office for cartage on lumber from Lloydminster to the school, the material was for the lockers, cupboards, tables and benches, one was sent in about June 2nd and the other was about July 11th and Mr Taylor writes me that he has not received the cheque yet. The W H Cushing Co called me up by phone to say that they had not received a cheque for their account yet.\n\nYou will oblige by letting me hear from you re the several items referred to above and anything I can do to help you to have the matters cleaned up will be gladly done. I remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\n2259 Lorne St\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nOct. 5th, 1928.\n\nLang Turner Esq.\nIndian Agent\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nThe contractor has finished the buildings that shelter the two pump plants for the school here, and both have been arranged for stove heat by the addition of tin roof jacks only, and as the buildings are sealed inside with lumber, it constitutes a fire hazard.\n\nWe will be obliged to keep both places from freezing, and with the stove pipe going through the roof and ceiling, a very large opening would be required to make them safe from fire, and as a consequence it would take much more heat to keep them above the freezing point, and a freeze would be disastrous in the fire house especially.\n\nFor the protection from both frost and fire therefor, we submit the proposition of putting a small brick chimney in each place, when the brickmason comes to erect the chimney for the farmer's house now under construction here, when the work could be done for the minimum cost.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nRev. L. Balter, O. M. I.\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a letter received from Rev. L. Balter, Principal at the Onion Lake Indian Residential School, in which he asks that brick chimneys be built in the two pump houses recently erected.

Residential School\n\nSince the writer's last visit, good progress has been made at the above school, and the work is fast nearing completion.\n\nAt Springs:\n\nAll that remains to be done here is the cleaning of the surface of the gravel filter (which will be done as soon as the leaves cease falling), the covering of the flooded area or pond with brush, etc., to protect from frost, and the painting of the pump house.\n\nThe engine and pumping plant are in place, and ready for operation.\n\nWater Supply Lines:\n\nThis line is completed and ready for operation.\n\nUpper Tanks:\n\nCompleted and connections with supply line and outside pumping plant (for fire fighting) all made, soft water supply pipe carried into building.\n\nUpper Pump House with Contained Plant:\n\nMachinery all in place and connections with reservoir and building complete.\n\nSuction pipe from Rumsey pump yet to be securely braced and supported.\n\nPump house yet to be painted.\n\nInside lining (1\" boards) not yet completed.\n\nBackfilling and Surfacing:\n\nThis work is not yet completed, but a few days' work will finish it.\n\nInside School Building:\n\nPressure Tanks in place and connected together. Small motor and pump for their operation were being installed at time of visit.\n\nSmall Automatic Water System:\n\nNot yet installed, but pipes carried into laundry for connection with it.\n\nSewage Disposal System:\n\nCompleted and ready for operation. Disposal beds have\nbeen completed satisfactorily and well. Boiler room and laundry drains have been functioning for some time.\n\nRemarks:\n\nThe lighting system for the school and the necessary power plant have not yet been completed.\n\nThe motor to operate pump supplying pressure tanks, as well as the motor for the automatic water system, cannot be hooked up until the above plant is in operation and, in the writer's opinion, it would not be fair to ask Mr. Towers to hold his men at the school if the power plant be not ready when his work is done and he, ready to connect up the machines he has installed.\n\nI would suggest that a wire be sent to the Department of Indian Affairs through our director, to the effect that our work will be ready to be hooked up with the school electric system in a week's time, but that there seems to be no assurance that their system will be ready by that time.\n\nMr. Towers has other work in view, and he will be put to considerable inconvenience and expense if he be obliged to spend days or weeks waiting around.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) R. H. Goodchild.\nDepartment of the Interior\nCanada\n\nDominion Water Power and Reclamation Service\nCalgary, Alta., Oct. 9, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nI am attaching for your information two copies of a report which has been received from Mr. R.H. Goodchild in connection with the work being undertaken at the Onion Lake (R.C.) Indian Residential School.\n\nYou will note from a perusal of this report that the work has now progressed to a point where it is anticipated that the plant will be in operation in the course of a few days. One important feature, however, which may delay operation of the plant is that in connection with the lighting system for the school, the necessary power plant for which we have not yet ready for operation. Mr. Towere was instructed to make final tests on the portion of the water supply system within the building. The failure to operate the pressure plant and the automatic water system obtain their power from the lighting plant and unless this is in operation with the next week it is hardly thought that this portion of the installation will be tested out. I have therefore wired you to this effect so that you may advise the Department of Indian Affairs and thus enable them to take immediate action.\n\nI am also enclosing in duplicate certificate No. 4 for $1,546.94, being the amount due the contractor for the month of September. Of this amount, you will note that $746.35 is for extras. A certificate from our engineer is also enclosed, giving details concerning the extras.\n\nIn regard to the recommendation contained in my letter of the 22nd instant regarding the painting of buildings, I have now been advised by Mr. Towere, the contractor, that he has received a very satisfactory tender from a local painter for the painting of the two pump houses, each to have two coats. The price submitted is $140.00 and Mr. Towere points out that, as the season is closing in, he deemed it desirable and in the best interests of the department to close this offer and the work is now in hand. In view of these circumstances you will approve the contractor's action in this regard, as it appeared most desirable that the buildings be painted before the contractor left the site. We consider the price submitted as reasonable and would recommend that the necessary approval for payment thereof be obtained.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) J. G. Teague,\nCommissioner of Irrigation.\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power and Reclamation,\nDepartment of Interior,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nYour file number: 115-8-15.\n\nI enclose herewith copy of a letter received from Mr. Tempest, Commissioner of Irrigation, with reference to the water supply and sewage system of the Onion Lake Indian school, to which is attached copy of a report received from Mr. Goodchild, also certificate No. 4, in duplicate, for the payment of $1546.94 to Mr. Towers, the contractor, with a certificate from the engineer giving details of extras amounting to $746.63.

If the building has been completed you should forward a final certificate together with a full report with your recommendations regarding the payments or deductions for extra work. For your information I would advise you that on the 2nd of October a further payment of $5,000 was made to Brown and Hudson, and this amount should be taken into consideration when making out your final certificate.\n\nIn order to wind up this contract, if you think it advisable and also agreeable to Mr. Brown to deduct an amount from his contract to cover the cost of carrying out whatever work is required to complete the building, you may give this consideration when making out your final certificate.\n\nRegarding the accounts for material and carriage, etc., for the lockers, cupboards, tables, and benches, if these have not already been paid, the accounts will be given immediate attention.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter which has just been received from the Fairbanks Morse Co. of Winnipeg, with reference to the electrical installation.

Residential School\n\nGeneral Remarks:\n\nThe installation above referred to is now complete and the plant installed is in good condition and in operation.\n\nThe contractor, Mr. Towers, had the pumps put into operation for inspection purposes and the writer found them to work smoothly and efficiently.\n\nThe construction work and the installation of the machinery has been done in a workmanlike manner, it has a good appearance and, in the writer's opinion, with proper handling and care, will give excellent satisfaction and be as permanent as such things can be.\n\nWorks at Springs:\n\nThe works here can do, and are doing, the work required efficiently and well; and the water supply is more than sufficient to supply the demands of an institution several times larger than the one which it is intended to serve.\n\nUpper Tanks and Pump House:\n\nThe changes in design have all been carried out, and everything in connection with these works is in good order.\n\nThe pump was operated, the fire hose was connected and a stream thrown over the school building, demonstrating the value and importance of this addition to the fire fighting equipment.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nIn connection with the equipment of the 25 H.P. engine, a very serious omission was made. This engine is so cumbersome and the fly-wheels so heavy, that it is quite impossible for one man to start the engine and, as it is now equipped, it takes two strong men from twenty minutes to one half hour or more to start the engine.\n\nAn air starter must be installed here; otherwise, the plant for fire fighting purposes would be quite useless.\n\nThe writer is informed that such an apparatus, suitable for the starting of this engine, can be purchased for approxi-\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is suggested that this starter be purchased from the Fairbanks-Morse people and installed under their supervision, as this is considered the only safe and satisfactory way of having this installation done, since Mr. Towers will not be here when it arrives.\n\nAs a further protection of a valuable barn and outbuildings, and to enable the west side of the school building to be reached in case of fire, it is recommended that another three hundred (300') feet of 2\" fire hose, with couplings, be sent to the school. It is considered that this protection is necessary.\n\nIn the matter of additional protection against fire inside the school building and barn and pumphouses, it is urged and recommended that fourteen (14) more soda-acid fire extinguishers be purchased for placement in the corridors in the main building and in the barn and in each pumphouse.\n\nFor the quenching of an incipient blaze, these apparatuses are handy, efficient and inexpensive, and their presence here might easily save the school from destruction or check a fire until the fire hose could be brought into play.\n\nWith the improvements as suggested, the writer is of the opinion that the fire protection afforded would be as complete as it can reasonably be made.\n\nWater Supply in Building:\n\nThe pressure tanks, small typhoon pump, motor with automatic control, as well as the automatic supply for soft water, are all connected up, in working order, and in operation. The systems are in operation and are efficient.\n\nThe writer saw the Diaphragm Regulator in operation, also the automatic water system, which is directly connected with the soft water tank, and in each case the operation was smooth, quiet and efficient.\n\nSewage Disposal System:\n\nSince the writer's last visit on the first of the month, the water supply system has been put into operation, and the septic tank used for the first time.\n\nThis system is functioning very satisfactorily, and will easily take care of the work for which it was designed.\n\nThe disposal beds are caring for the effluent from the tank and there is as yet no offensive odour therefrom.\n\nThe soil here is very nearly pure sand and this is, of course, a very satisfactory condition.\nConcluding Remarks:\n\nAbout the middle of the present month an expert in electrical equipment and pumping machinery from the Fairbanks-Morse firm at Winnipeg visited the school.\n\nThis gentleman was of considerable assistance to Mr. Towers, who was at that time getting his equipment hooked up and ready to operate.\n\nThe writer has been informed that this gentleman complimented Mr. Towers and his chief mechanic upon the excellent work and careful installation which had been accomplished. He also stated that everything was satisfactory and in first class working order.\n\nAs it has not been possible for this branch to have an engineer resident on the job this comment by an outside competent judge is very gratifying, and the writer would suggest that Mr. Towers be commended for the conscientious and thorough manner in which he and his staff have carried out the work entrusted to them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) R.

Goodchild dealing with the final inspection of the works constructed in connection with the installation of a water supply and sewage disposal plant at the Onion Lake (R.C.) Residential School.\n\nFrom Mr. Goodchild's report you will note that the works have now been installed in a very satisfactory manner and a complete test of the entire installation has been made.\n\nCertain recommendations have been made by Mr. Goodchild in regard to the desirability of a further small expenditure in connection with the large 20 H.P. engine which operates the fire fighting equipment. An additional equipment entails an air starter and it is estimated the cost would be approximately $150.00. In view of the fact that there is only one man at the plant, who acts as an engineer and caretaker, it would seem to be highly desirable and necessary to be able to start this engine at very short notice. Prices will therefore be obtained from the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Company in regard to the cost of this equipment, together with the cost of installation, and as soon as these are received, I will again communicate with you.\n\nA further recommendation is also made by Mr. Goodchild in connection with the protection of the barn and outbuildings by the purchase of an additional 300' of 2\u00bd\" fire hose with couplings. He has likewise recommended the purchase of an additional 14 soda-acid fire extinguishers for use within the school building. These would appear to be most desirable additional requirements and we are therefore obtaining an estimate on the cost of this extra equipment and will embody same in our letter to you when it has been received.\n\nIn regard to Mr. Goodchild's concluding remarks commending Mr. Towers on the quality of the work which he has done for the department, we would suggest that in sending Mr. Towers his final cheque, a suitable letter be forwarded to him along the lines suggested by Mr. Goodchild.\n\nI am attaching two copies of the final estimate certificate, together with two copies of the details of extras, all of which are recommended for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

Brown of 791 Preston St., Winnipeg, of the firm of Brown & Hudson, (which is in my constituency) saw me on Monday with regard to their contract for the construction of the Indian School near Onion Lake, Sask., and asked me to write to you with regard to the matter. The contractors completed the job about the 1st of June and the premises have been occupied by the Department since about that time. Subsequently the contractors were advised that certain repairs were necessary. They completed these repairs and finished the job entirely about the end of September.\n\nThey have paid all their sub-contractors and are anxious to receive settlement of their account with the Department as early as possible. Mr. Brown has, I believe, sent you statements with regard to the amount coming to him.\n\nMr. Brown tells me that he wrote to you about two months ago with regard to settlement and with regard to fire insurance and although he received $5000.00 on account, he has had no reply from you to the letter which he wrote to you and cannot understand what the reason for this is.\n\nMr. Brown tells me that he interviewed the Inspector some two weeks ago and was told that everything was in order and complete. He has paid out his own money to the sub-contractors and is naturally anxious that he should receive settlement of his account with the Department immediately. I would very much appreciate it if you would look into the matter at once and expedite settlement of the account. I would appreciate an early reply from you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD. C.

The Inspector was written to last week with a request to see Mr. Brown and endeavour to have the work completed.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 31st ult., with regard to the above. Mr. Brown has been in to see me several times recently and tells me that the Inspector has not called on him nor has he had any letter from him.\n\nOn the 7th inst., I wrote to the Hon. Chas A. Stewart with regard to this contract and advised him that Mr. Brown had told me that he saw Inspector Hamilton at Regina early in October and that Inspector Hamilton told him that everything was finished as far as he knew. There has been apparently some complaint with regard to the grading of the cement in the basement of the school. Mr. Brown has made arrangements to have this work gone over so there will be no complaint on this ground. Recently Mr. Brown has been advised that the heating apparatus is not entirely satisfactory and he has taken this matter up with his sub-contractor here in Winnipeg who has undertaken to put the work in order. This would have been attended to long ago if the water had been available at the School when the plumbing and heating apparatus was put in.\n\nIn any event, the amount required to complete this work and the cement floor will be comparatively small. I would imagine that if $300 or $400 was kept out that would be ample protection to the Department. Mr. Brown has paid out large sums of money in connection with this contract and feels that settlement with regard to it should be made now. Mr. Brown put up a deposit of $800 which has been with the Department since April 1927. There is also a large sum coming to him with regard to his contract. He has had no notification from the Inspector since early in October and is quite willing to allow you to keep back a certain sum until you are completely satisfied that everything is done in accordance with the contract.

Nov. 23rd, 1926.\n\nINSPECTION REPORT ON SCHOOLS ONION LAKE AGENCY.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nONION LAKE R. G. RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nI visited this school on three occasions during my stay at Onion Lake. All the details in connection with the construction of this school had not been completed. The electric lighting plant was installed at the time of my visit and the water system was also completed. It appears that there has been a great deal of difficulty experienced in getting the contractors to complete their work. I examined the plumbing system, the heating and lighting plant, and the water in connection with these appears to have been well done. There appears to have been no provision made for a chimney for the laundry and bake oven. They require a stove in the laundry for the purpose of heating irons. The laundry floor has not sufficient fall to carry off the surplus water. As a matter of fact, the fall appears to be away from the drain instead of to it. This is a detail that was pointed out by the Sisters and is not being mentioned here with a view to fault finding.\n\nThe fire fighting equipment consists of 2 sets of hose on each floor attached to the water supply system. This equipment, being new, is in first class condition. I noted that there were no fire extinguishers and would point out that all our residential schools, in addition to the hose, we have 2 fire extinguishers on each floor. Access to the fire escapes is obtained through rooms occupied by members of the staff.\n\nThe school has been very nicely equipped with new furniture. The Rev. Father Balter O.F.M., has been chosen as Principal. Mr. Balduz is the Farming Instructor and Mr. Rose is Engineer. There are 6 Sisters of Charity, 3 of whom are teachers. The Sister Superior is the business manager of the institution and appears to exercise supervision over the outside operations as the present Principal is not a practical man being more of a student.\n\nFARMING.\n\nThis year they had their first crop. 30 acres of wheat produced 575 bushels; 45 acres of oats yielded 3300 bushels. Their garden produced 400 bushels of potatoes, not sufficient for their requirements. The wheat was a good quality of Garnet and will make excellent seed. They will realize a good price for this.\n\nTheir stock consists of 18 cattle, including 8 milking cows, 7 horses, 16 pigs and 75 hens. Mr. Balduz appears to be a good farmer and a careful man with stock.\n\nI was very unfavorably impressed with Rose, the Engineer. He had a great deal of fault to find with the plant which he is expected to operate and has succeeded in getting the Principal and the Sister Superior very much dissatisfied. He found fault with the plumbing, the boilers, the electric lighting plant and the water supply system. Even the engine wasn't properly constructed. Everything was wrong. I was presented by the...\nI was presented by the Principal with a typewritten list of all the imperfections in connection with this plant and came to the conclusion, after examining the plant, that Mr. Rose was making a big noise to hide his own incompetence. This man is a trouble maker pure and simple, in my opinion, and I think the best class of man to have associated in any way with an institution of this kind. The outside dwelling for the Farming Instructor, as well as the poultry house and implement shed, were nearing completion at the time of my visit.\n\nThere are 92 pupils enrolled, 50 boys and 43 girls. The children looked well nourished. There were a few cases of whooping cough and 2 children were sent to the hospital while I was there suffering typhoid symptoms.\n\nThis being the first summer that this school has been occupied and as work has been under construction during the whole period, very little has been done towards beautifying the grounds, but as soon as the construction work and buildings are completed, the premises can be put in shape.\n\nThe foregoing report is respectfully submitted.\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nCommissioners Office, Sask.\nNov. 29th, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nYou will note what Mr. Grewil, the Engineer at the Onion Lake C. of E. School asks for in the way of hose for fire protection. This might be authorized. You will also note what the Inspector says regarding the completion of the contract at the new R.C. Indian Residential School. He states that no provision was made for chimneys in the laundry and bake-oven. This may or may not have been an oversight, as they may have had some other scheme in view when the plans were drawn. He also complains about the manner in which the laundry floor has been built. I do not know whether this was in accordance with the details of the plans or not. Mr. Hamilton has gone to this school to make a final report and the Department will then be in a position to know just how the matter stands. One matter, however, I think should not escape the attention of the Department and that is that the Inspector says he was not impressed with the Engineer. I do not know whether this man has the proper qualifications or not, but if he has not he should be replaced. It is absolutely wrong to have an incompetent man handling a plant of this kind, as he can do more damage in a few months that we should expect to occur in ten years. I would ask the Department to look carefully into this man's qualifications. The Inspector remarks that he has a great deal to say. I found this to be the case when I was at this school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nMr. W.A. Hamilton  \n2259 Lorne St.,  \nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Howard J. Skinner\n\nOn the 31st of October 1928 we wrote to Mr. Duncan Scott Superintendent of Indian Affairs, at Ottawa, with reference to a claim of the above party for work done on Onion Lake Indian School as painter from October 1927 to April 1928. We also sent him a Statutory Declaration setting forth details of the claim.\n\nDetails of the claim were as follows:\nTo 302 3/4 hours painting at 45\u00a2 per hr during said period $86.26\nTo payment on account 202.00\nBalance claimed $364.26\n\nThe contractor of the Government was Brown & Hudson, who hired a sub-contractor one A. Cloughton, and Cloughton hired our client to do this work.\n\nThere is a balance owing to our client of $364.6 which A. Cloughton has not paid him or anyone else.\n\nIn making final payments under the contract we should be pleased to obtain settlement of this balance from you direct, if possible, the contract with the Government provides in clause 17 and elsewhere for such manner of settlement.\n\nPlease let us hear from you by return with reference to this matter, and oblige,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Deputy Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the work done by our engineer wiring up the Switchboard and Generator in the new Roman Catholic School at Onion Lake, the writer has just learned that while there our engineer ordered to go forward from Winnipeg some porcelain insulators, some fuses, and some wooden screws, the total cost of which amounted to $63.31, as per the attached invoice in triplicate, on our file No. 44265.\n\nOn taking this matter up with Mr. Pedersen who did the work at Onion Lake, he tells us that the porcelain Insulators were to be used on the wire from the Battery to the Switchboard and from the Switchboard to the Distribution Board. The Plug Fuses and the 60 Ampere Cartridge Fuses were for spare parts for the Switchboard and the 90 Ampere Cartridges were required for the Distribution Board.\n\nThese goods were shipped to Onion Lake without an order number, or without an order from your department and we would be glad if you could arrange to pass this Invoice for us. We understand that this would probably have to be referred to Mr. Hamilton at Regina and we are arranging to have a copy of this latter sent to him.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTHE CANADIAN FAIRBANKS MORSE COMPANY LTD.,\n\nPer: J.H.Walton\nEngine & Pump Dept.\n\nMontreal, Quebec, Saint John, Ottawa, Toronto, Windsor, Winnipeg, Regina, Calgary, Vancouver, Victoria\nFactories-Toronto and Sherbrooke.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Taylor.\nOnion Lake Agency\n\nDecember 11, 1928.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq., I.L.D.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nYou will remember that at the time you visited the new R.C. School here, the Sisters spoke to you about a mail delivery for them, as they are situated about six miles from the nearest postoffice. You then told me to write and remind you of this after you returned to Ottawa. Early in September I mentioned to the Rev. Father Balter, the Principal at the School, that I would write you on the matter, and he then asked me not to trouble you about it, as he had the matter well in hand and that the school was going to have a mail delivery. However, a few days ago he informed me that his negotiations had fallen through, and asked me to write you requesting that you use your influence to obtain this concession for the school.\n\nFather Balter also handed me a copy of an agreement (enclosed) which he had obtained from Mr. Taylor, the Onion Lake mail carrier, offering to collect and deliver the mail at the school for the sum of $100 annually. The whole thing is this - Taylor would have to go about two miles out of his regular route, four times a week, to pick up or drop a bag at the school; and he offers to do this for $100 per year.\n\nWith kind regards to Mrs. Scott and yourself, in which Mrs. Turner joins.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6325, file 659-5, part 3)\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nHaving taken the matter up several times with Brown & Hudson re completing the contract of the Roman Catholic Indian Residential School at Onion Lake, it seems almost impossible to get them to take any action in getting the matter cleaned up, so when I received your request through Mr W M Graham I went up to Onion Lake Friday Nov 30th arriving at the School Monday Dec 3rd. I went over the building and made a thorough inspection and find the conditions as follows.\n\nThe heating plant is not completed and in its present condition is not giving satisfaction. There is one boiler out of commission as there seems to be trouble with the wet return, they claim that when they put up steam to about one pound the water leaves the boiler and will not come back till the pressure goes down, the matter has been taken up with Brown & Hudson and the Sub Contractor several times but they do not seem to want to do anything, so I asked the Engineer at the School if he could put the plant in working order, and he assured me that he could so I have notified the Contractors that unless the repairs are completed within thirty days that the changes would be made and the expense would be charged against the contract.\n\nIn the final estimate I have allowed $450.00 of a hold back till the work is made satisfactory. There is some cementwork & other adjustments which were taken up with Mr Brown and he made a deal with Mr Rose the Engineer at the school to do the work for $55.00 &\nthat amount is also held back from final estimate, and the both amounts as mentioned above to be paid over as soon as the work has been done to the satisfaction of the Principal of the School.\n\nYou will find herewith enclosed the Final Estimates & also the Final Certificate which I hope you will find in order.\n\nWhen I was at the School the Sister Superior took the matter up with me about a chimney for the laundry and bakery as you will notice by the plans that there is a room between the bakery and the kitchen which is a store room and at the present time they put a pipe through the partition and into the store room vent flue and in so doing it makes the storeroom too warm and no way to ventilate it.\n\nThey also require a stove in the laundry for heating the irons for ironing the laundry. I went into the matter while there & in case you decided to have one built it could be erected in the laundry room and extend up on the outside wall of the chapel which would require about 35 feet of chimney. I took the matter up with a bricklayer at Lloydminster to submit a price for the above and as soon as I receive it I will forward it for your consideration, it is greatly needed from what I saw when there last week, the one chimney would suit for both the laundry and the bakery as the pipe could cross the corridor to the laundry which would do away with the heat in the storeroom. awaiting your further commands I beg to remain.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n2269 Lorne Street\nDec. 20, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Thorson,\n\nReferring to past correspondence regarding the balance due Mr. Brown for work on the Union Lake School, I have today received a report from the Building Inspector, together with a certificate amounting to $2,068.35. This leaves a balance still owing Mr. Brown of $975.00. The Inspector has reported that this amount should be held back on account of work still to be done on the heating system also some concrete work, together with an amount required to protect the P. T. Roberts site, for lumber supplied and not paid for amounting to $66.75 and J. H. Skinner for painting amounting to $304.25.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nJ. T. Thorson, Esq.,\n309 Mining Exchange Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hunter of Onion Lake, was used in the construction of the floor over the pit which was made to receive the pressure tanks for the water system.\n\nThe corrugated fasts as supplied by Bridgman's Hardware of Winnipeg were used in the construction of the doors for the lockers and cupboards which I had erected for the school.\n\nThe glass as supplied by A.F. Miller Hardware Co. of Lloydminster was for the glass doors of the cupboards in the class rooms for supplies.\n\nThe account of the McDonald Wilson Electric of Winnipeg I authorized the first items namely 2 bracket lights in the chancel of the chapel, which the principal said was necessary, the rest of the wiring was authorized by Mr. Turner, Indian Agent there at the request of the Sister Superior. The material as specified left at the job was at the request of the Principal and the Engineer; the material shipped to the school as specified on page two of this account, I did not know that it was ordered and when I received their account I forwarded a copy to the principal for information & they notified me that the material had not been received by them. I then took the matter up with the firm and they notified me that the material was shipped from Winnipeg Nov 8th and when I was in Lloydminster the beginning of this month I found it there and checked it off by the account.\n\nThe account of the Fairbanks Morse Co., the work was done by them since I left the school so I took the account up with me & had it checked over by the Engineer at the school who assured me that the account was O.K. while I was there I found that the switch board that had not been used being replaced by one suitable for the plant I had it shipped back to the Fairbanks Morse Co. at Winnipeg for which there will be a credit for same coming to you.\n\nIn making the above explanation is to explain my position in the matter as it seems to be a little out of the regular way of ordering.\n\nYou will notice in the final estimate that there is some extras which I did not receive instructions from you to have done but in asking to have the work done the Sister Superior asked to have the deductions as specified in the final estimate to cover the amount of the extras which was not authorized by you.\n\nI hope when you have looked into my explanation as above you will overlook anything you may think was not quite in order and that my action may meet with your approval.

I am pleased to be able to say that the finish of the contract is in site at last.\n\nI have just received word that the switch board which was replaced by one suitable for the lighting plant has been shipped to Fairbanks Morse Co., Winnipeg so there will be an adjustment to be made between the costs of the two, the cost of the cartage from the school to Lloydminster is $1.20 which I am forwarding them, awaiting your further commands.

In this letter we referred to the recommendations which were made by Mr. Goodchild regarding the installation of an air starter for the twenty-five H.P. engine, an additional 300' of 2\u00bd\" fire hose with couplings and fourteen soda acid fire extinguishers. We have now obtained quotations for supplying and installing the air starter and also, for the hose, details of which are submitted hereunder:\n\n| Air Starter | Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Company. |\n|-------------|----------------------------------|\n| 1 - 2/2 H.P. engine with belt | $475.00 |\n| 1 Curtis 3 x 3\u00bd\" air compressor | |\n| 1 - 16 x 60\" vertical tank | |\n| (suitable for 200 lb. pressure) | |\n| All valves and fittings for installation | |\n| including 1 length \u00be\" and 1 length 1\" pipe | |\n| 1 air starting burner for quick heating | |\n\nPrice of installation ........................................... $650.00\n\n| Fire Hose | Messrs.

Residential School in the Onion Lake Agency, viz:- a farming Instructor's cottage, implement shed and chicken house, I wish to inform you that the painting is not completed. The Agent estimated that the paint and labour would cost approximately $375.00, work which he was authorized to go on with, but owing to it getting too late in the season, it was deemed undesirable to go on with the work and only $55.00 was spent. It will therefore be necessary to provide for approximately $325.00 in the spring to complete this work. I am bringing this matter to your attention now so that provision can be made for this expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. H. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, January 16, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 309-11A R.C. of the 9th instant, relative to the painting of the outbuildings mentioned at the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School. In this connection it is noted that the Agent was authorized to have this work done, but, owing to the lateness of the season, it was deemed inadvisable to go on with same. We have noted for our Estimates the amount necessary to complete this work next Spring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nMr. S. Brown,\n791 Preston Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nIn reply to your enquiry of the 5th instant, I beg to inform you that the site for the new school is about 30 miles due north of Lloydminster, C. N. Ry., and the Saskatchewan river has to be crossed by ferry. The roads are usually in good condition excepting in the early spring. Water is right on the job, and I do not think the gravel haul will be more than a mile. Common boards and dimensions can be purchased locally; I will ask the owner of the mill to write to you re prices. For the sand and gravel you would be expected to make a small payment to the Indian band funds, say 25\u00a2 per load.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"Lang Turner\"\nIndian Agent.\nDepartment of Finance\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter and enclose as requested cheques in favour of the undermentioned persons, being refund of deposits and interest thereon on account of...\n\nYours truly,\n\nFor Deputy Minister of Finance\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\n\nPage 6.\nDr. Scott Re: Onion Lake School. File 532.\n\nRe: P. T. Roberts' claim, $88.75.\n\nThis item referred to in Final estimate No. 10 is disputed by Mr. Brown. He says that he had no dealings at all with P. T. Roberts Limited; that he placed his order with James Gibson for all lumber and that he has a receipt in full from Mr. Gibson for all claims signed by Mr. Gibson in the presence of a witness. This item therefore should not be held back and should certainly not be paid to P. T. Roberts Limited without further investigation.\n\nRe: Claim of H. J. Skinner, for labor, as a painter.\n\nThis is disputed by Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown gave the painting sub-contract to a man named Cloughton, who quit before the job was finished and Brown had to finish the job himself. Skinner admits that he knew Cloughton was getting his estimates regularly but he gave no intimation to Brown that he was not getting his wages until about 3 weeks after he had quit the job although he met Mr. Hudson immediately after he quit work at Lloydminster and said nothing to Mr. Hudson at that time. If he had advised either Mr. Brown or Mr. Hudson that he was not being paid, they could have protected him. Mr. Brown contends that Skinner's claim is a sham and that he has been paid. Neither Mr. Brown nor Mr. Hudson have had any statement up to this time from Skinner as to the particulars of his claim. They have had some notification with regard to it from Mr. Hamilton. [Certainly this amount should not be paid out to Skinner without further investigation.]\n\nThe information contained in this letter is submitted to you for your consideration. If there is any further information on any of the points involved, that I can get for you, I shall be very glad to obtain the same. If there are any such points, I should be glad if you would let me know what they are, so that I may take them up with Mr. Brown before I leave for Ottawa.\n\nI am advised that everything is now in order in the school with perhaps the exception of one item regarding fire escapes which is in dispute.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. J. Thomson\n\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6325, file 659-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\n\nP. 5.\nDr. Scott Re: Onion Lake School-File 532.\n\n3. Extra pulleys. These were used in connection with the washing machines and were ordered by Inspector Hamilton. The price of them was $12.71, which together with an additional 10% makes $13.98.\n\n4. Extra electrical work. Inspector Hamilton knows all about this account and copies of it were sent to him. This was extra electrical work required and I understand that the account of Messrs. MacDonald Wilson Electric Co., Ltd., has been forwarded to the Department. It stands at $107.15. This together with an additional 10% makes up the item of $117.86.\n\n5. Brass clips to door. This is an extra which ought to have been included in the final estimate.\n\n6. Extra excavation and concrete work for machinery room. This item is in dispute as between the contractors and the inspector. Mr. Brown wrote to you in August with regard to this item and stated that Mr. Hamilton was absent for part of the time during which this work was done but that Mr. Hudson took the time and entered it in his time book each night. Mr. Hudson's affidavit covering this item was sent forward to you on the 23rd of August. Mr. Brown was on the job at the time himself and states that he is prepared to take an affidavit that Mr. Hudson's statement as to this item is correct.\n\nRe: Deductions\n\nMr. Brown contends that this item of $298.29 which appears as a deduction in final estimate No. 10 should not be deducted. Inspector Hamilton says that this item is based on Mr. Brown's own figures but he forgets that Mr. Brown's figures included all the overhead which was buried in the whole job and in any event no deductions were contemplated for months after all the material was placed on the job. Mr. Brown was unable to realize anything at all on the material that was left over, since the cost of transporting the material back would have been as much as it was worth. Mr. Brown contends that $75.00 would be ample to cover the deductions.\n4. Hauling Lumber and camp supplies. Mr. Brown used about 125,000 feet of lumber and it cost him $6.00 per thousand for hauling it from Onion Lake to the site of the school. This accounts for the $750.00. In addition to that, he had to haul all his camp supplies and the sum of $100 would be a very reasonable estimate for this additional expense. When Mr. Brown went up to the site of the school in September, he found the state of affairs very different from that intimated by Mr. Turner in his letter of April 11th, and very different from that regarding which he had been advised by the man whom he and the Western Steel Products sent up. Mr. Turner's letter is consistent with the school being built at Onion Lake itself and quite inconsistent with its being built on the present site, 8 miles from Onion Lake. It seems to me that Mr. Brown was perfectly justified in assuming that the school was going to be built right at Onion Lake and that he ought to be recompensed for the additional cost to him due to the erection of the school at the present site. He made his estimates on the basis of the school being built at Onion Lake and the Department has received the benefit of that estimate. The Department in paying Mr. Brown the additional expense is not paying twice. May I also stress the point that the contract itself calls for the erection of an Indian Residential School at Onion Lake, not 8 miles from Onion Lake. In view of the circumstances outlined above, there is a very great difference between the two.\n\nWith regard to the other disputed items in extras:\n\n1. Balance for verandah extension and stairs to chapel, $301.00.\nThis item was authorized by Inspector Hamilton and his statement of $86.34 takes into account only the stairs and does not take into account the verandah extension. The item should stand at $301.00 instead of $86.34.\n\n2. Copper for wash tables.\nThe plans for wash tables in the basement show that they were to be covered with copper but the plans for the wash tables elsewhere do not so specify and there is no mention in the specifications of copper covering. Mr. Brown tells me that he made no account in his tender for copper covering and that the Department would not be paying twice for it, if it were now allowed as an extra, as he says it should be. Mr. Brown received a telegram in March, 1928 from A. F. McKenzie to the effect that Inspector Hamilton had been requested to advise him that all wash tables were to be covered with copper as indicated in the basement plans; accordingly, copper covering was used and should be paid as an extra $200.00.\non the present site, Mr. Brown has been put to considerable expense not contemplated by him when he made his tender. The items of this additional expense are as follows:\n\n1. Building and furnishing campus, $1800.00. If the site had been at Onion Lake near the old school, Mr. Brown could have used certain buildings at Onion Lake belonging to the Hudson's Bay Co., which were available and vacant and convenient to the job. Instead of that, he had to erect certain buildings near the job some 3 miles away including a bunk house, a cook house, an office for the inspector and an office for Mr. Hudson and himself. Mr. Brown did not figure on these buildings in view of the situation which had been disclosed to him at Onion Lake itself; so that there is no question of the Department paying twice for this item.\n\n2. Hauling water, $1400.00. At Onion Lake itself, water was available right on the job and could have been taken out of the well near the old school. You will note that Mr. Turner in his letter of April 11th states that water is right on the job. It would certainly appear that at the time, Mr. Turner wrote this letter, he had in mind that the site would be right near the old school at Onion Lake. As a matter of fact, all the water had to be hauled a distance of over three-quarters of a mile uphill, and water was hauled this distance right from the commencement of the job until its completion and wages were paid at the rate of approximately 45\u00a2 per hour for hauling water. Mr. Brown tells me that his Estimate of $1400 for this item of expense which would not have been necessary if the site had been at Onion Lake near the old school, is very conservative.\n\n3. Difference in costs of gravel, $1200.00. Mr. Turner says in his letter of April 11th, 1927 that he does not think that the gravel haul will be more than a mile. As a matter of fact, Brown had to haul gravel a distance of about 4 miles instead of 1 mile. He had considerable difficulty in finding gravel and had to open up a pit himself. The cost of hauling gravel a distance of a mile would have been about $1.00 per yard for hauling. The government was constructing a barn not far from the school and was paying $1.75 per yard for gravel whereas Mr. Brown estimated this item at $1.00 per yard and did so on the strength of Mr. Lang Turner's letter. Mr. Brown had to pay $1.25 per yard for hauling instead of $1.00 as contemplated.\nThe specifications intimate that for all information with reference to the site of the proposed building, contractors should refer to Indian Agent, Mr. Lang Turner, Onion Lake, Sask.\n\nPursuant to this, Mr. Brown communicated with Mr. Lang Turner and received from him a reply dated April 11th, 1927, copy of which is attached to this letter. Mr. Brown also made arrangements with the Western Steel Products Ltd., to send a man up to Onion Lake in order to look over the ground. These arrangements were made in April, 1927, and the man sent up was told that the site was to be right beside the old school at Onion Lake. I am not quite certain whom this man sent out under this joint arrangement between Brown and the Western Steel Products saw. It may have been the priest in charge of the school at Onion Lake. At any rate the tender sent in by Mr. Brown was based upon the information he obtained from the Indian Agent as per the enclosed letter and upon the information he obtained from the man who went up to Onion Lake under the arrangement above mentioned.\n\nMay I also point out that the contract itself dated the 8th day of June, 1927, calls for the erection of an Indian Residential School at Onion Lake, Sask.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the school was actually built about 8 miles from Onion Lake Post Office. Mr. Hudson went up to the job in June 1927, shortly after the contract was let and started building. Mr. Brown did not go up to the site until about September, 1927 and was very much surprised at the location of the school. He spoke to Inspector Hamilton about the site then and as far as I am advised, Inspector Hamilton told Mr. Brown that a Saskatoon contractor had told him that the site was to be near the old school and that when he was named Inspector of the job, he wrote up to Onion Lake engaging rooms there and was very much surprised when on his arrival at Onion Lake he learned that the school was about 8 miles away. Mr. Brown was also told that the present site of the school had been decided upon towards the end of May, 1927. The tenders closed on the 2nd of May, 1927. Contract was awarded in June of 1927 and no notification was given to Mr. Brown of the change in the site. Certainly Mr. Brown understood from the information he had obtained, that the site was to be at Onion Lake near the old school. As a result of the school being built\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\n\nJan. 7th, 1929.\n\nRe: Brown & Hudson and Onion Lake School.\n$532.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,-\n\nI acknowledge receipt with thanks, of your letter of the 20th ult., herein. I also have a copy of the Inspector's Final Estimate No. 10. Some time in August, Mr. Brown sent you a memorandum of the extras claimed by him. These are as follows:\n\n- 2 extra doors $450.00\n- Corridor partitions $156.00\n- Paper for ceiling $44.00\n- Balance for verandah extension and stairs to chapel $301.00\n- Copper for wash tables $200.00\n- Brass clips to doors $15.00\n- Extra excavation and concrete in machinery room $273.92\n- Extra pulleys $13.98\n- Extra electrical work $117.86\n- Difference in cost owing to site of school $5250.00\n\nThe first three items are admitted in final Estimate No. 10 submitted by the Inspector. With regard to the other items, I should like to submit the following facts for your consideration with a view to the adjustment of this account.\n\nDifference in costs due to site, $5250.00.\n\nMr. Brown sent you particulars in regard to this item in a letter dated August 23rd, last, as to how the amount was made up, namely:\n\n- Cost of building and furnishing camps $1800.00\n- Cost of hauling water $1400.00\n- Difference in costs of gravel and hauling same $1200.00\n- Hauling lumber and camp supplies from Onion Lake $850.00\n- Total $5250.00\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nJan. 16, 1929.\n\nMemorandum: Dr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to Mr. Brown's claim for extras other than those allowed by Inspector Hamilton, I beg to submit the following:\n\nWith regard to the extra of $5,250.00 asked for for the difference in cost due to the moving of the site I beg to submit the following facts:- In the specifications it is stated that before submitting a proposal the bidder shall visit the site of the proposed work and fully inform himself as to all existing conditions. There is also a paragraph in the specifications which states that for all information with reference to the site of the proposed building the contractor shall refer to Indian Agent Lang Turner. In the letter submitted hereunder there is a copy of a letter received by Mr. Brown from Mr. Turner in which he stated that the site for the new school is about 30 miles due north from Lloydminster, on the C. N. R.\n\nThe following is an extract from a letter dated Sept. 8th signed by Mr. Hamilton,-\n\n\"They are also asking for an extra of $5,250.00 as they claim that when they figured on the school they understood that it was to be erected in Onion Lake alongside of the old one, and in my opinion I consider that if that was the case it should be the other way as the old school is over six miles further away from the railway than where it is now located, and they told me that they were given to understand that the distance from the railway to the school was 35 miles, and I took the trouble to get the mileage registered on the truck they hauled their material with which gave it a little less than 30 miles to the present site and over 36 miles to where the old school was located, so if there was any adjustment to be made it would be in favour of the Department of Indian Affairs instead of to Brown and Hudson.\"\n\nIt would appear from Mr. Hamilton's statement that the building site is located a distance of exactly 30 miles from Lloydminster. It is also apparent from correspondence that Mr. Brown did not personally visit the site of the proposed building.\nWith reference to the other items which Mr. Brown claims as extras I would recommend that Mr. Hamilton, the Inspector of Construction be asked to submit a further report on these items. When this information is received it will assist in deciding as to whether these items should be allowed.\n\nWith reference to the amount held back re the P. T. Roberts claim it would be well to write to this firm and find out if this claim has been settled.\n\nRegarding the claim of H. J. Skinner for labour there is an affidavit on file signed by Mr. Skinner to the effect that there is still an amount of $384.26 owing to him. There is also a letter on file from the Department of Labour asking for protection for Mr. Skinner. This is a case where, I think, an agent of the Department of Labour should investigate before the amount is paid over to Mr. Brown.\n\nIn the last certificate issued in addition to the amount held back to protect the P. T. Roberts Co. Ltd., and H. J. Skinner was an amount of $505.00 to cover the necessary repairs and adjustments to the heating plant and also some cement work. The Department has been advised that this work has been satisfactorily completed, and it would, therefore, be in order to make a payment to Mr. Brown of $605.00, which will leave a balance due him on his contract of $473.01, plus whatever amount is allowed for extra work not included in Mr. Hamilton's final statement.\n\nARCHITECT.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDR. SCOTT.\n\nWith further reference to my memorandum regarding claim made by Messrs. Brown and Hudson for the moving of the site at the Onion Lake School, I beg to give you the following facts which I have taken from the site file.\n\nOn June 15th, 1926, Commissioner Graham was asked to arrange for the selection of a suitable site for the proposed new school.\n\nOn March 30th, 1927, you telegraphed Graham asking what arrangements had been made regarding the site.\n\nOn March 31st Graham wired stating that excellent situation for school chosen by Inspector and Principal approximately 1\u00bd miles north of south-west corner of Seesakooch, good spring, good farming land and a lake. This telegram was confirmed in a letter of the same date from Mr. Graham. In this letter he further states that Mr. Murison advised him that the Reverend Principal had selected the site mentioned in his telegram some two years ago, and it was situated in the best farming land of the reserve. The site was to be approximately 4 miles from where the present school is located and 33 miles north of the town of Lloydminster, and the Reverend Principal strongly favoured the site.\n\nOn April 6, 1927 Graham was requested to arrange for suitable property for the school farm and to obtain a resolution from the band setting aside the land.\n\nOn May 10th, 1927 a letter was received from Mr. Graham enclosing a resolution from the band setting aside 640 acres of land to be used for educational purposes.\n\nOn May 27th, 1927 Indian Agent Turner was authorized by telegram to arrange for the fencing of the section for the new school and for the breaking of 75 acres, and on August 11th a voucher was received from Mr. Turner for $85.00 to cover the cost of breaking the 75 acres of land for farming.\n\nOn June 27th 1928 a voucher was received from Agent Turner and a cheque issued to cover the cost of the fencing.\n\nNowhere can I find any correspondence mentioning placing the new school opposite the old building.\n\nARCHITECT.\nJanuary 19, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Thorson,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant dealing with claims preferred by the contractor under his contract for building the Onion Lake school. All the claims allowed by Inspector Hamilton have been settled and the security deposit has been returned to the contractor.\n\nWe are holding back $35.75 for P.T. Robert's claim and will write to the firm to ascertain if they have received a satisfactory settlement.\n\nAs the Department of Labour has been appealed to by Mr. H.J. Skinner with reference to his claim ($384.26) I propose to ask that Department to investigate it.\n\nThe extras, a list of which follows, have been allowed in part by Inspector Hamilton. I am submitting Mr. Brown's claim to him in full detail and I am asking him to report immediately.\n\nBalance for verandah extension and stairs to chapel........................................... $ 301.00\nCopper for wash tables.................................................. 200.00\nBrass clips to doors...................................................... 15.00\nExtra excavation and concrete in machinery room................................. 273.92\nExtra pulleys............................................................... 13.98\nExtra electrical work.................................................... 117.86\n\nMr. Brown has no claim whatever for \"Difference in cost owing to site of school $5250.00.\" The location of this school was decided on before the tenders were asked for and there was never any intention of placing the school on or near the old site. You state the specifications intimate: \"That for all information with reference to the site of the proposed building contractors should refer to Indian Agent Lang Turner, 'Onion Lake, Sask.;' this is not part of the specifications.\"\n\nJ.T.

(RG 10, Volume 6325, file 659-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nbut is an extra note giving the contractors the address of the Indian Agent. The important note in the specifications is the following:\n\n\"Before submitting a proposal, the bidders shall carefully examine the drawings and specifications, visit the site of the proposed work, and ascertain for themselves the nature of the soil to be excavated and the amount of excavation required, and fully inform themselves as to all existing conditions.\"\n\nThe description given by Mr. Lang Turner to Mr. Brown on April 11 is an accurate description of the site on which the school was to be erected. I take the following extract from a letter dated September 8, signed by Inspector Hamilton:\n\n\"They are also asking for an extra $5250.00 as they claim that when they figured on the school they understood that it was to be erected in Onion Lake alongside of the old one, and in my opinion I consider that if that was the case it should be the other way as the old school is over six miles further away from the railway than where it is now located, and they told me that they were given to understand that the distance from the railway to the school was 35 miles, and I took the trouble to get the mileage registered on the truck they hauled their material with which gave it a little less than 30 miles to the present site and over 36 miles to where the old school was located, so if there was any adjustment to be made it would be in favour of the Department of Indian Affairs instead of to Brown and Hudson.\n\nIt will be quite impossible to consider favourably Mr. Brown's claim.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6325, file 659-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nJan. 21, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to the extra work claimed by Messrs. Brown and Hudson in connection with their contract for the Onion Lake R.C. School, I beg to give you the following particulars regarding the claims made by this firm for extras in addition to those which you have allowed.\n\n1. Balance for verandah extension and stairs to chapel, $301.00. This item was authorized by Inspector Hamilton and his statement of $65.34 takes into account only the stairs and does not take into account the verandah extension. The item should stand at $301.00 instead of $65.34.\n\n2. Copper for wash tables. The plans for wash tables in the basement show that they were to be covered with copper but the plans for the wash tables elsewhere do not so specify and there is no mention in the specifications of copper covering. Mr. Brown tells me that he made no account in his tender for copper covering and that the Department would not be paying twice for it, if it were now allowed as an extra, as he says it should be. Mr. Brown received a telegram in March, 1928 from Mr. MacKenzie to the effect that Inspector Hamilton had been requested to advise him that all wash tables were to be covered with copper as indicated in the basement plans. Accordingly, copper covering was used and should be paid as an extra $200.00.\n\n3. Extra pulleys. These were used in connection with the washing machines and were ordered by Inspector Hamilton. The price of them was $12.71, which together with an additional 10% makes $13.98.\n\n4. Extra electrical work. Inspector Hamilton knows all about this account and copies of it were sent to him. This was extra electrical work required, and I understand that the account of Messrs. MacDonald Wilson Electric Co., Ltd., has been forwarded to the Department. It stands at $107.15. This together with an additional 10% makes up the item of $117.86.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6325, file 659-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n5. Brass clips to door. This is an extra which ought to have been included in the final estimate.\n\n6. Extra excavation and concrete work for machinery room. This item is in dispute between the contractors and the Inspector. Mr. Brown wrote to you in August with regard to this item and stated that Mr. Hamilton was absent for part of the time during which this work was done, but that Mr. Hudson took the time and entered it in his time book each night. Mr. Hudson's affidavit covering this item was sent forward to you on the 23rd of August. Mr. Brown was on the job himself at the time and states that he is prepared to take an affidavit that Mr. Hudson's statement as to this item is correct.\"\n\nWill you please let me have a full report giving your opinion on the above claims.\n\nMr. Brown also contends that the item of $298.29 which appears as a deduction in the final estimate should not be deducted, and his reasons are as follows:\n\n\"Mr. Brown contends that this item of $298.29 which appears as a deduction in final estimate No. 10 should not be deducted. Inspector Hamilton says that this item is based on Mr. Brown's figures but he forgets that Mr. Brown's figures included all overhead which was buried in the whole job and in any event no deductions were contemplated for months after all the material was placed on the job. Mr. Brown was unable to realize anything at all on the material that was left over, since the cost of transporting the material back would have been as much as it was worth. Mr. Brown contends that $75.00 would be ample to cover the deductions.\"\n\nWill you kindly let me know if the materials were delivered on the job before the changes were made. I will be glad to have your report at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. A. Hamilton, Esq.,\n2259 Lorne St.,\nREGINA, Sask.\n\nJ. D.

J. Skinner, 584 Spenser St., Winnipeg, for wages owing to him in connection with work on the Chignecto Lake Indian Residential School, the contract for which was awarded to Messrs. Brown and Hudson, 791 Preston Ave., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nThis claim is disputed by Mr. Brown, who states that he gave the painting sub-contract to a man called Cloughton, who quit before the job was finished, and Mr. Brown had to finish the job himself. Skinner admits that he knew Cloughton was getting his estimates regularly but he gave no intimation to Brown that he was not getting his wages until about three weeks after he had quit the job, although he met Mr. Hudson immediately after he quit work at Lloydminster, and said nothing to Mr. Hudson at that time. If he had advised either Mr. Brown or Mr. Hudson that he was not being paid, they could have protected him. Mr. Brown contends that Skinner's claim is a sham and that he has been paid. Neither Mr. Brown nor Mr. Hudson have had any statement up to this time from Mr. Skinner, as to the particulars of his claim. They have had some notification with regard to it from Mr. Hamilton.\n\nMr. Skinner still claims that there is a balance of $394.26 due him, and I am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter received by the Department in connection with this claim, also a copy of a declaration accompanying the letter. Will you please arrange to have this claim investigated by one of your fair wage officers and advise me as to what settlement should be made.

Roberts, Ltd., in reference to a bill which they claim is owing to them for lumber supplied to Messrs. Brown and Hudson in the building of the Onion Lake R.C. School.\n\nMr. Brown claims that he had no dealings with the P. T. Roberts Co., that he placed his order with James Gibson for all lumber, and that he has a receipt in full for all claims signed by Mr. Gibson in the presence of a witness.\n\nThe Department is holding back $60.75 on Mr. Brown's contract to cover this claim, and I would ask you to please investigate and advise me if their claim is correct.

Arrangements are being made to have this claim investigated at once by one of our Departmental officers as requested in your letter.

McLean, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy Minister and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nYour letter of Jan 21st received and contents noted. I am surprised at Brown and Hudson making such a claim, but I will do my best to explain the matter to you in the order as the items show in your letter.\n\nItem #1\nVerandah extension and Stairs to gallery in Chapel. I authorized the stairs to the gallery in the chapel, and which item I have allowed them $634 in the final estimate, and in reference to the verandah I refused to have anything to do in the matter on receiving your letter of July 15th/27 and I notified the Sister Superior of your decision, she then took the matter up with the contractor who gave her a price for the work and which she accepted and authorized the work to be carried out, which they did and when completed Mr Hudson received a cheque for part of the amount and made arrangements with her to pay an account for gravel of $96.00 to the Indian Agency and the balance which amounted to about $50.00 was taken up for wood which the mission furnished them, therefore the Department had nothing to do with the extension to the Verandah.\n\nItem #2\nCopper for wash Tables. This matter was taken up with the Contractors and they accepted my decision in the matter but they claimed that the Plumbing Contractor should cover them but this Sub Contractor that they did not consider it was their work but would go part way agreeing to do the work of covering the tables providing that Brown & Hudson would furnish the sheet copper and in this way it was carried out, in my opinion I consider the mention of covering the tables in the basement covered all such tables in the building.\n\nItem #3\nExtra Pulleys for Laundry Machinery. The specifications calls for all the necessary Shafting, Pulleys etc and the machinery installed complete, but there is a question whether the pulley for the engine shaft should be furnished by them or the Department owing to the fact that the engine was supplied by the Department, but they certainly should supply the driven pulley on the shafting.\n\nItem #4\nThe account for extra electrical work as per invoices from McDonald Willson Electric Co., and forwarded to you Dec 15th which includes supplies ordered by the mission, and as for the contractors financing the work they had nothing to do with it and it seems hardly the right thing to do to ask for 10% on the account.\n\nItem #5\nBrass Clips for Doors. I am surprised at Brown & Hudson asking for an extra on those clips, they were used for the folding doors between the class rooms on the ground floor, the hangers on those doors were not put on properly at first and when they tried to make them work they split the styles of some of the doors and...\nI ordered them to have the doors replaced so they offered to put those clips on if I would allow them to use the doors, so I consented providing they made a good job of it and that is where the clips were used which saved them from having other doors ordered.\n\nItem #6\n\nExtra excavation and Concrete work for Machinery Room.\n\nThe work was carried out by the men from time to time and I was there all the time that the work was being done. I told the Contractor that the work would be paid for according to the detailed estimate which they furnished me at my request, as there was no estimate given for the work, and the second clause on page 4 of the specifications covers that item.\n\nReferring to the deduction of $298.25 as specified on final estimate. To the deductions were figured out as per the detailed estimate which included Brown & Hudson overcharges and as for the material he referred to that were buying the same kind of material for the job months after those deductions were decided on and as for the doors and millwork which was used at the school were not received at the job for three months after the deduction were decided on, which was on receipt of your letter dated Aug 24/27 and if any of the material was shipped to the job it was their own fault.\n\nI am very sorry that there should be so much trouble about the work in connection with the above mentioned school and I wish to say that in all my experience as an Inspector of Construction I have never had so much trouble with all the contractors put together as I have had with the contractors on this school, and I am very sorry that it was not possible for me to have had a personal talk with your office and it was for that reason I suggested it in letters on two occasions and I am more convinced now than ever that it would be the best course to take in such matters.\n\nI hope that the enclosed information will clear matters up and any other information or assistance I can give you in arriving at a settlement will be cheerfully given. I beg to remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\n2259 Lorne Street\nRegina Jan 26th/29\n\nDoyle Costigan & Christopherson\n845-9 Somerset Building\nWinnipeg Man\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nYour letter of the 14th received, I am very sorry to hear that Mr Skinner has not received a settlement of his wage account yet.\n\nIn issuing the final estimate in December I had not received notice of any settlement made re the above mentioned claim.

Skinner\n\nYour letter of the 26th of November is hand.\n\nWe have interviewed both Mr. Cloughton and Mr. Brown in this matter. Mr. Cloughton states Mr. Skinner's account is O.K. Mr. Brown objected that $100.00 was paid to Mrs. Skinner on account of the claim of Mr. H.J. Skinner. Now it can be proved that she received only $40.00. This quite agrees with the statement made by Mr. Skinner that he had received $162.00 in all. Mr. Brown has not shown specifically wherein his objections are founded. We have tried to get this information from him and also his solicitor here, but without success. We submit that these should be signed under the circumstances. We have waited now more than a month for Mr. Brown to get this, and Mr. Skinner is staying here in the City, and needs his money very much.

Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter, days as above.\nThis is with reference to a difference of accounts between Messrs P.T. Roberts Ltd., Wholesale Lumber Dealers, of this city, and Messrs Brown & Hudson, contractors for the building of the Onion Lake R.C. School at Onion Lake.\n\nI am directed by your letter to investigate and to advise if the claim of Messrs P.T. Roberts Ltd. is correct.\n\nI have ascertained certain facts by interviewing Mr. Sam Brown of Brown and Hudson, Mr. P.T. Roberts of Messrs P.T. Roberts Ltd., and Mr. James Gibson who is implicated in this matter as the Salesman of Messrs P.T. Roberts Ltd., and who sold the lumber to be used on the work at Onion Lake.\n\nThe order for this lumber, mentioned above, was dated as follows, Winnipeg, June 24th, 1927, and is addressed to Messrs P.T. Roberts Ltd. of Winnipeg, for delivery at Lloydminster, Alta., for the prices shown in the order, the order states the terms of payment and is signed \"S. Brown.\"\n\nMr. Sam Brown also knows that Messrs P.T. Roberts Ltd. shipped the lumber mentioned in the order, some in June, 1927, bulk in July 1927, some in August and September 1927. Mr. Brown also knows that he paid certain monies from time to time for this lumber, so far as I know, it seems strange that Mr. Brown should say he had no dealings with Messrs P.T. Roberts Ltd., and there is good grounds to be doubtful of the validity of his statement. I understand that Mr. James Gibson, as a salesman called at different times on Mr. Brown. In fact Mr. Brown knew who this man was in a business way.\n\nWhen I interviewed Mr. Sam Brown re this matter he showed me a receipt. I enclose a copy of this receipt herewith, he gave a cheque to Mr. James Gibson, drawn as shown in the copy of this cheque herewith enclosed, and he gets the receipt, which is signed \"P.T. Roberts Ltd\" per J. Gibson, both the cheque and the receipt have written thereon \"In full &c &c.\" I think Mr. Gibson exceeded his position with the firm he represented when he gave such a receipt, and my conclusion was confirmed when I read the letter from...\nfrom Messrs P.T.Roberts Ltd., dated 20th Dec., 1927, a copy of this letter is enclosed herewith. After reading this I am again convinced that Mr. Sam Brown was well aware that he was dealing with Messrs P.T.Roberts Ltd. Mr. Brown's assumed ignorance, as to Messrs P.T.Roberts Ltd., is only an excuse, and is taken to back up his claim that he \"settled in full\" with Mr. James Gibson, which claim I feel is on a very doubtful base.\n\nWhen Mr. James Gibson turned in to Messrs P.T.Roberts Ltd., the cheque he had received from Mr. Sam Brown he endorsed it and Messrs P.T.Roberts Ltd. placed the amount of $160.00 to the credit of Mr. Sam Brown's account, and notified Mr. Sam Brown that this was \"not in full\" settlement of his account (see letter 20 Dec., 1927). After this incident Messrs P.T.Roberts Ltd. that they move to protect themselves and they then addressed Mr. W.A. Hamilton, the Building Inspector of construction. This action then placed Mr. Brown in the position that he would have to meet Messrs P.T.Roberts Ltd. to get his \"settlement\", so called, confirmed. Mr. Brown takes the position that he \"does not know Messrs P.T.Roberts Ltd.\", which in my opinion is foolish, as the receipt, on which he bases his claim of \"settlement in full\", is signed \"P.T.Roberts Ltd., per J. Gibson\", and in order to have this receipt confirmed it is in his interest to meet the lumber people.\n\nI have also found that there were some other difficulties developed by the fact that Mr. W.A. Hamilton would not accept some lumber that was offered for the job, as it was \"off grade\". Messrs P.T.Roberts Ltd. shipped the grades they received an order for, but they had nothing to do with the grades Mr. Sam Brown ordered, except to ship what was asked, the prices given were for the grades ordered. When the \"off grade\" was fixed by the Building Inspector, Mr. Brown felt that he must blame someone else, so you can readily understand what he would do.\n\nAs a sensible business man, having his own best interests at stake, I told Mr. Brown that he should seek and court a satisfactory settlement with Messrs P.T.Roberts Ltd., and to do this quickly by calling on them and asking what was the trouble. Mr. Brown says he will not meet Messrs P.T.Roberts Ltd. In short he will not proceed to take any steps to adjust differences. Under the circumstances then, I think The Department, taking a proper stand to inform Mr. Brown that they have to insist upon his getting this dispute adjusted and validated without any further delay. Such a request would bring Mr. Brown to the realise that he is really the cause of delay in closing this business up.\n\n1. Mr. Brown placed order with Messrs P.T.Roberts Ltd. and arranged terms of payment with them. Not with Mr. James Gibson.\n2. Mr. Brown attempts to make a settlement with Mr. James Gibson, and he is notified that what he did with Mr. Gibson is not a \"full settlement\" as long ago as the 20 Dec., 1927. In spite of this notice he is still holding off closing the account with the proper principals.\n3. He feels hurt because Messrs P.T.Roberts took proper steps to protest\n3. Protect their interests by informing the Building Inspector of their difficulties with the contractor. Mr. Brown could and can readily remedy this phase of the business.\n\n4. The trouble about grades of material cannot be placed against the lumber people; they shipped what was ordered and were paid for what they shipped. In fact any claims by Mr. Brown have, so far as I can find out, been adjusted and fixed up; his account indicates that.\n\n5. The balance claimed is indicated in the statement of account as rendered. All payments made by Mr. Brown have been properly credited to him. I think it is up to Mr. Brown to show why he persists in holding up a settlement. The balance claimed is correct so far as I can determine that.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nyour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJno. R.

I received the price on the boiler some time ago but just received the price on the chimney today and am herewith enclosing both estimates for your consideration.\n\nReferring to the chimney it is greatly needed both for the laundry and the bakery. I asked for a price on a single flue and a double flue but in my opinion I think the single flue would handle both the bakery and the laundry. The way they have the pipe from the bakery is through the store room to the kitchen chimney which makes the store room so warm that it destroys the use of the store room for keeping certain stores in.\n\nIf it is your wish that the above mentioned work should be done I would be pleased to do anything in my power to assist you in the matter. I note in the estimate for the chimney that Mr Venning has quoted on 30 feet but I think it will take about 35 ft so that would make a little difference in the estimate.\n\nI would be pleased to hear from you re the above, I beg to remain,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Skinner's wage claim, I beg to say that it would appear if Skinner is forced to go to the courts to settle his claim, that one of the advantages of inserting the Fair Wage Clauses in the specifications would be defeated.\n\nYour Fair Wage Clauses, which form part of the specifications for the Onion Lake School, provide that if a claim for wages is filed in your office, and proof furnished, the claim can be paid from money due the contractor. Skinner has filed a claim in your office and has furnished a declaration as to the amount due. Fair Wage Clauses also provide that the contractor shall furnish the Minister of Labour with such detailed information as is deemed necessary to secure payment of wages. As far as the records of this Department show, Mr. Brown has not furnished proof that Skinner has been paid his wages, and unless he can in a reasonable time submit proof to you that Skinner has been paid, it would seem in order for the Department to adjust Skinner's claim and charge same to the contractor.\n\nAs the contract for this building has been completed for some time, I would like to have a final settlement made as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

This may be the case, but as already intimated in our Departmental letter of February 12th, our officer in Winnipeg interviewed the different persons concerned in this claim but was unable to obtain what he regarded as sufficiently conclusive evidence to warrant him in making a definite recommendation. It is under these circumstances that the view was expressed that if the matter is to be further proceeded with, Mr. Skinner had better take his case to court, if he sees fit to do so.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGerald H.

If the site had been at Onion Lake near the old school, Mr. Brown could have used certain buildings at Onion Lake belonging to the Hudson's Bay Co., which were available and vacant and convenient to the job. Instead of that he had to erect certain buildings near the job some 6 miles away including a bunk house, a cook house, an office for the Inspector and an office for Mr. Hudson and himself. Mr. Brown did not figure on these buildings in view of the situation which had been disclosed to him at Onion Lake itself so that there is no question of the Department paying twice for this item.\n\nHAULING WATER. $1,400.00. At Onion Lake itself, water was available right on the job and could have been taken out of the well near the old School. You will note that Mr. Turner in his letter of April 11th states that water is right on the job. It would certainly appear that at the time Mr. Turner wrote this letter, he had in mind that the site would be right near the old school at Onion Lake. As a matter of fact, all the water had to be hauled a distance of over three-quarters of a mile uphill, and water was hauled this distance right from the commencement of the job until its completion and wages were paid at the rate of approximately 45\u00a2 per hour for hauling water. Mr. Brown tells me that his estimate of $1,400.00 for this item which would not have been necessary if the site had been at Onion Lake near the old school, is very conservative.\n\nDIFFERENCE IN COSTS OF GRAVEL. $1,200.00. Mr. Turner says in his letter of April 11th, 1929, that he does not think that the gravel haul will be more than a mile. As a matter of fact, Brown had to haul gravel a distance of about 4 miles instead of 1 mile. He had considerable difficulty in finding gravel and had to open up a pit himself. The cost of hauling gravel a distance of a mile would have been about $2.00 per yard for hauling. The government was constructing a barn not far from the school and was paying $1.75 per yard for gravel whereas Mr. Brown estimated this item...\"\nat $1.00 per yard and did so on the strength of Mr. Long Turner's letter. Mr. Brown had to pay $1.75 per yard for hauling instead of $1.00 as contemplated.\n\nHAULING LUMBER AND CAMP SUPPLIES. Mr. Brown used about 125,000 feet of lumber and it cost him $6.00 per thousand for hauling it from Onion Lake to the site of the school. This accounts for the $750.00. In addition to that, he had to shell all his camp supplies and the sum of $100.00 would be a very reasonable estimate for this additional expense. When Mr. Brown went up to the site of the school in September, he found the state of affairs very different from that intimated by Mr. Turner in his letter of April 11th, and very different from that regarding which he had been advised by the men whom he and the Western Steel Products sent up. Mr. Turner's letter is consistent with the school being built at Onion Lake itself and quite inconsistent with its being built on the present site, 6 miles from Onion Lake. It seems to me that Mr. Brown was perfectly justified in assuming that the school was going to be built right at Onion Lake, and that he ought to be recompensed for the additional cost to him due to the erection of the school at the present site. He made his estimates on the basis of the school being built at Onion Lake and the Department has received the benefit of that estimate. The Department in paying Mr. Brown the additional expense is not paying twice. May I also stress the point that the contract itself calls for the erection of an Indian Residential School at Onion Lake, not 6 miles from Onion Lake. In view of the circumstances outlined above there is a very great difference between the two.\"\n\nAs far as the Department's records show it was never contemplated placing the building at any other site than the one selected. I would appreciate having your views on these statements at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. B. MacKenzie,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. A.

As you are aware this work was carried out under the direction of your branch, and I would ask you, therefore, to furnish me with two copies of this contract in order that one might be sent to the Auditor General and the other kept on the files of this office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power Branch,\nOttawa.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nIn answer to your letter of the 5th which was received today asking information re claims of Brown & Hudson as to change of site of the R.C. Indian Residential School at Onion Lake. I will give you my opinion on the several items in the order as they appear in your letter.\n\nItem #1 Building and furnishing camp. \u00a3800.00\n\nIn the first place the specifications call for the school to be erected on the Onion Lake Indian Reserve, and that the bidders were supposed to visit the site of the proposed work and ascertain for themselves as to the existing conditions. The buildings referred to as bunk house, cook house, office for the company also office for the inspector did not cost them \u00a3500.00 altogether and then they got a fair price for them when they were through with them and in my opinion it would have cost them far more if they had rented buildings.\n\nItem #2 Hauling water. \u00a3400.00\n\nThere is a lake about 300 yards from where the school site is and a fine spring about 150 yards from the building, and if Mr. Hudson had taken the interest in the work he should have done he could have put up a small gasoline engine and a pump at the spring and could have supplied all the water required for the work and also for drinking purposes. This spring is at present supplying all the water required for the school, and as for Mr. Turner saying that the water was right at the site he was correct, and in all my conversation with Mr. Turner he never mentioned any other site than the one where the school is located, and the water is far better.\n\nItem #3 Difference in cost of gravel. \u00a3200.00\n\nAll the gravel used in the building did not cost them more than \u00a31.25 per yard as most of it was procured within a mile of the job and when the pits run out they hauled from another pit from which they paid \u00a31.25 per yard for hauling and 20\u00a2 to the Agency. The reason the Government had to pay \u00a31.75 for gravel was on account of most of the teams were out harvesting. Mr. Hudson put their trucks at hauling gravel and they made eight trips per day with each truck from the farthest pit.\n\nItem #4 Hauling lumber and camp supplies.\n\nThe price charged for hauling lumber from Onion Lake was \u00a33.00 per thousand, and the amount of lumber they received from Onion Lake was approximately 35,000 feet but the balance of the \u00a38,000 feet of lumber namely about 90,000 feet they saved money on the hauling as the new school is about seven miles closer to the Railway than the old school site, and the above applies to the Camp Supplies.\n\nReferring to the change of Site they never mentioned anything to me about it till about the time the contract should have been completed and in talking with the agent Mr. Turner at Onion Lake...\nand also the authorities at the St Anthonies School they told me that they had never considered having the school erected at the old site in Onion Lake.\n\nThere are some conditions that existed in the handling of the work in connection with the erection of the school which was anything but good management, and I feel sorry for Mr Brown as any loss which has occurred through the way the work was handled will have to be borne by him, but of course it was his own fault as he should have known the man he was sending there to handle the work.\n\nI hope that the above explanation may be of assistance to you in deciding re the claim referred to, and in reference to the first clause of your letter of regret in having to trouble me in regard to the particulars, I am only too pleased to give you any assistance possible in getting the matter straightened out for I am sure you must be near the end of your patience, and any other information I can give you will be cheerfully given. I beg to remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\n2259 Lorne Street\nRegina March 9th/29\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nI received another letter from Doyle, Costigan & Christophe-\nrson, Solicitors of Winnipeg, dated Feb 26th in connection with the\nclaim for wages by H J Skinner against Brown & Hudson. They claim\nthat there has been nothing done up to the date of their letter by\nMr Brown, and I wrote them saying that you were having the Depart-\nment of Labour send a Fair Wage Officer to investigate the claim.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n2259 Lorne Street\nMarch 23, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Thorson,\n\nWith further reference to Mr. Brown's claim in connection with his contract for the Onion Lake School, I beg to give you the following information. The items are in the order that they appear in your letter of the 7th of January.\n\nITEM NO. 1:\nWith regard to this item it has been ascertained that the buildings erected by Mr. Brown did not cost more than $500.00, and that when they were through with them they received a fair price in disposing of the buildings.\n\nITEM NO. 2:\nThere is a lake about 200 yards from the school building and a fine spring about 150 yards from the building. This spring is at present supplying all of the water required for the school. Mr. Turner was therefore absolutely right when he stated that water was on the site.\n\nITEM NO. 3:\nThe gravel used on the work was procured from a pit within one mile of the job.\n\nITEM NO. 4:\nMr. Brown mentions that 125,000 feet of lumber was required. This amount is approximately correct, but I would point out that only 50,000 feet of this was purchased from the mill at Onion Lake; the balance was hauled from Lloydminster.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

Our engineers made a reconnaissance survey of these Falls in the summer of 1921 and estimated that under ordinary minimum flow conditions an aggregate of 27,000 horse power would be available and upwards of 60,000 horse power for six months at the two sites, in two developments. The engineer reported that the two crops might possibly be combined in one development and this, apparently, is what the present applicant proposes.\n\nUse to be made of Power.\n\nThe Company proposes to transmit the power 40 miles to certain lead-zinc deposits located west of Pine Point on Great Slave lake and use it there for the recovery of the metals indicated where probably all the power obtainable will be required.\n\nOther Sources of Power.\n\nThe nearest large source of power other than that applied for appears to be that on the Slave river, in the fall between Fitzgerald and Fort Smith upwards of 100 miles distant in a direct line from the mineral deposits. The Slave river sites are very large and would, with the transmission line required, probably involve a much larger outlay than the Hay river sites.\n\nR. A. Gibson, Esq.,\nActing Deputy Minister,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6325, file 659-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nReport of N.W.T. Branch.\n\nAs the site applied for is in the North West Territories it has been referred to Mr. Finnie and from his memorandum on file, immediately hereunder, it appears that he has no objection to offer to the favourable consideration of the application when the provisions of our Regulations have been fully complied with.\n\nScenic Considerations.\n\nWe have on our file copy of a memorandum by Mr. Harkin, dated June 20th, 1917, suggesting that steps be taken to preserve these Falls from disfigurement and recommending that instructions be issued to reserve the lands in the vicinity from homestead or mining entry. This recommendation was apparently approved by the then Minister, Hon. Dr. Roche, and acted upon by the Land Patents Branch. So far as I am aware no further action in the matter has been taken.\n\nInformation Furnished.\n\nThe information furnished by the applicant is not sufficient under the Dominion Water Power Regulations to permit the issue of an Interim License for a power development, but it is adequate with the data already secured by our own officers to justify the issue of a Priority Permit. A Priority Permit under our Regulations, as you are aware, does not constitute a definite concession nor does it obligate the Department in any way to subsequently grant such concession, it merely grants the applicant priority in the consideration of his general layout plans for a fixed period and thereby affords him protection for the time he requires to make surveys and plans and prepare the information required by the Department before an Interim License can be considered.\n\nRecommendation.\n\nI beg to recommend, therefore, that the Atlas Exploration Company be advised that the information contained in their application is insufficient for the consideration of the issue of an Interim License for the site, but that the Department is prepared to issue a Priority Permit for the period of one year in order that the applicant may proceed with its surveys and prepare the further information required. A letter along these lines is submitted herewith which, if it meets with your approval, might be forwarded over the Minister's signature.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nIndian Affairs.

MacKenzie, Esq.,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMarch 30, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 8th instant with reference to the awarding of a contract for the construction of the water supply and sewage disposal system at the Onion Lake Indian Residential School, I beg to enclose herewith copy of contract between this Department and Mr. John Towers in connection with the above mentioned work. I trust that this is the document required by your Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing, Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMr. Hume, Esq.,\nAssistant Auditor General,\nOttawa.\nI have been requested by the Rev. Father Falter, principal at the R.C. Indian Residential School here to ask the Department to bear the cost of the erection of two granaries, one permanent and one portable.\n\nI may state that the granaries asked for by this school, are of the same type as those which were built by the Department for the Anglican School here in 1927. The size of the portable one is 14' x 16' and that of the permanent one 20' x 30'; the latter being set on a cement foundation. The cost of the two buildings was approximately $650.00, and I estimate that the erection of two similar ones for the R.C. School will cost the same amount.\n\nThe Rev. Father Falter has also requested me to draw the attention of the Department to the matter of having a root cellar built for the school in readiness for the coming vegetable crop.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 8, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 99-19 of the 26th ultimo, with reference to improvements at the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School. At the time Mr. Ferrier visited the school last summer, the Rev. Principal urged that an ice house be provided; that a cold storage be built beside the laundry door and that the painting be finished. Funds were placed in the Estimates for these purposes. If the granaries and the root cellar are more important than either the ice house or the cold storage, the Department would be glad to have the information, so that the improvements this year will give most satisfaction. Please discuss this question with the Rev. Principal and forward to the Department, at your earliest convenience, a list showing the relative importance of these improvements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Brown.\n\nI pass this letter on to you for your information. I have not had a reply to my letter to you dated April 2nd, and I would appreciate hearing from you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJTT:H\nS. BROWN\nGENERAL CONTRACTOR\n\n791 Preston Ave., Winnipeg\n\nApril 5th, 1929.\n\nMr. J. T. Thorson, M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour favor of April 2nd received and carefully noted.\n\nRe ITEM NO. 1.\n\nThe men had to travel back both night and morning, a distance of eight miles by horse and wagon, also carting of all the material caused much delay and extra expense. We could not sell them for money, only succeeded in getting rid of them by trading them for poplar wood at a mere fraction of their value. We realized approximately $100.00 for them in that way, which might be deducted from the $1,800. Otherwise costs are quite reasonable and could not be built under the circumstances for any less.\n\nITEM NO. 2.\n\nI cannot understand Mr. McLean's remarks on this item. There is only one lake in the vicinity near the school and that is approximately half a mile in a straight line and I presume two hundred and fifty feet below the school site, but the wayround to the lake to overcome the steep descent is three-quarters of a mile. There is a series of small springs approximately 1200 feet from the school and from eighty to a hundred feet below school level. The stream was so small that it required about five minutes to fill a pail. We considered building a reservoir and pumping it up but estimated it would cost more than getting it from the lake. To verify this it must have cost the Department about $3,000.00 to get their water supply from this source. I know the tenders they received were in that neighborhood. We tendered for it ourselves so you see there was no alternative for us but getting the water from the lake.\n\nITEM NO. 3.\n\nThere was no gravel pit known to anybody up there nearer than Onion Lake. We were two weeks discovering the pit where we obtained the gravel which was on private property and as near four miles\nas they could measure it with the speedometer on the truck. If they still dispute Item No. 2 and No. 3, the Lake will speak for itself also the gravel pit as both can be seen. (To verify this the Department paid $1.75 for gravel from the same pit for the barn).\n\nITEM NO. 4.\n\nThere was two hundred and fifty-eight thousand feet of lumber in the school; approximately eighty thousand feet was purchased in the vicinity of Onion Lake from different parties but all supplies for camps also other supplies for the school are included in the $550.00.\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nThe sum of $200.00 has not been paid for copper coverings ordered but not specified. Deepening machinery room has only been partially allowed. The Department have Mr. Hudson's sworn declaration for the right amount. Extras for electrical work have not been allowed. I think I gave you particulars of this item.\n\nDEDUCTIONS:\n\nFull amount of labor and material have been deducted whereas only labor should be deducted as material was supplied. Correct amount of this item should be one-third of Inspector's figures.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"S. BROWN\"\n18th April, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Thorson,\n\nI have before me your letter of the 2nd instant and also your letter of the 12th instant enclosing a copy of a letter from Mr. Brown, dated the 5th instant.\n\nIn reply I am enclosing the draft of a letter to the Deputy Minister of Justice submitting the question as to whether the action of the Department in repudiating Mr. Brown's claim is warranted. If you have any observations to make with respect to this draft kindly submit them for consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nJ.T. Thorson, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of the 8th instant, No.115-8-5, and to report that I have consulted the management of the R. C. Indian Residential School here, regarding the contents thereof; and it is of the opinion that the greatest need of the school, just now, is for the granaries and root cellar; and that the ice house and cold storage could stand over for another year.\n\nThe granaries and root cellar which, I believe, would be best suited to the requirements of this school, are similar to those erected by the Department for the Anglican School in 1927. These were a concrete root cellar, 14' x 20'; one permanent granary, 20' x 30', set on a cement foundation; and one portable one, 14' x 16'; and the total cost of the three buildings was, approximately, $1100.00. However, as local lumber prices have increased somewhat since 1927, I believe the cost of putting up similar buildings at the R. C. School, will be, approximately, $1200.00.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 10, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 99-19 of the 29th ultimo, with reference to improvements at the Onion Lake R.C.

Burrows Lumber Co., Limited, in which Brown claims that he has a claim against us. This is the first time that he has ever made such a statement that we know of, and is absolutely untrue.\n\nWe have written Brown today to send us in a statement of his claim. He owes us a balance of $32.75, and the Theo. A. Burrows Lumber Co., Limited $55.00 a total of $87.75, which is the amount we have been asking you to remit.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP.T. Roberts, Limited.\n\nPer \u2014\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to direct your attention particularly to conditions with respect to the fire escapes and fire protection equipment at the R.C. Residential School, Onion Lake Agency.\n\nFIRE ESCAPES.\n\nTwo very steep iron ladder stairways are provided, one for each wing, with access to same from each floor. These stairways terminate about 6 ft. from the ground and are installed at the front of the building. In the event of a fire at night there is grave danger that serious casualties might take place. When I last visited this school in October 1923 I informed the principal that the Department regulations called for regular fire drill and pointed out the importance of the children being trained in this respect. Upon my recent visit I again took up this question and was informed by the Sister Superior that they were afraid to send the children down the present escapes. They consider them very dangerous. Apart from the danger in connection with the steep descent, there is the necessary jump at the bottom. I pointed out that they might make some temporary arrangement at the bottom of these stairways whereby the children would not have so far to drop to reach the ground, and again impressed upon them the importance of having regular fire drill.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6325, file 659-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFIRE ESCAPES (CONT'D.)\n\nI would suggest that four pole fire escapes be installed, one for each dormitory, similar to those which were installed at the Edmonton Residential School at a cost of $125.00 each.\n\nFIRE FIGHTING EQUIPMENT.\n\nSince my last visit a separate unit has been provided exclusively for fire protection purposes. This consists of a 25 Horse Power Fairbanks-Morse engine and a force pump which has capacity to deliver water at a pressure of 150 lbs. to the square inch. Only 100 ft. of hose has been provided for this unit. The pump house is located 25 ft. from the building. The building has a 144 ft. frontage, and is 160 ft. from the front to the rear, so it is very easily seen that the length of hose is inadequate.\n\nIt appears to me that this equipment would be absolutely useless in its present condition in the event of a fire taking place, for the following reasons:\n\nIn the first place, it requires five men to start the engine and one man is required with a pry to keep the belt on the pulleys. I am informed that when the engine was installed and tried out it took the expert and five men 23 minutes to start it. An 8\" belt delivers the power from the engine to the pump and is not large enough to work the pump to its full capacity of 150 lbs., and they reduced the valve to 60 lbs. pressure, and when the outfit is in operation it is necessary to have a man with a pry, as I said before, to keep the belt in its place. Either this plant has not been...\nbeen properly installed and thoroughly tested, or it will be necessary to have it equipped with a compressed air starter. It is very evident, I think, that an outfit requiring five men to start the engine is of very little value at an institution of this kind. In the event of a fire starting and the absence of some members of the staff, it would be impossible to operate the outfit, and even when started its usefulness would be considerably curtailed through an inadequate supply of hose.\n\nThis plant, I am informed, was installed by the Water, Power & Immigration Co., Calgary, and a man named Goodchild from their Head Office in Calgary passed it.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Linoleum had been purchased by the Department for the children's dining tables at the new R. C. School here, and to have this put on properly a brass binding was necessary.

School, Onion Lake.\n\nWith reference to the Inspector's remarks dealing with the fire escapes, I suppose these steps are standard, but I am of the opinion that in addition to these we should have the pole fire escapes. These would not cost much money and we would have the satisfaction of knowing that the Department had taken every precaution to safeguard the children.\n\nWith regard to the fire-fighting equipment, this, to my mind, is a very serious matter and I am directing this letter to you personally as I think you should know what the Inspector has said. I should be glad if you would let me know if steps are to be taken to change this situation. A simple equipment, costing perhaps less than half what this equipment cost could be installed and give adequate protection. The Qu'Appelle School, or in fact any of our schools have a very simple system, but this one appears to be impracticable.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJune 13, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nA report has been received from one of our inspectors at the Regina office regarding the fire fighting equipment installed at the Onion Lake R.C. School. The Inspector states that this equipment will be absolutely useless in its present condition in the event of fire for the following reasons:\n\n\"In the first place it requires five men to start the engine and one man is required with a pry to keep the belt on the pulleys. I am informed that when the engine was installed and tried out it took the expert and five men 25 minutes to start it.

On receipt of this information I will again communicate with you.\n\nRegarding the installation of the pole fire escape this type of fire escape has proven in many cases to be exceedingly dangerous. Accidents have occurred from pupils sliding down the pole before the preceding pupil had reached the bottom or left the pole at the ground, also in extremely cold weather in the winter there have been cases where pupils leaving hot dormitories have stuck to the metal pole with serious injury resulting. In case of fire where pupils are overcome by smoke it is impossible for them to be removed from the building where a pole fire escape is used. If you think it necessary to install additional fire escapes at this school it would appear to be advisable to install the open stair type.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\n\nW.

Brown has absolutely refused to come near our office in connection with this matter, and probably if he was aware of the fact that you had paid my account he would have the decency to call on me, and talk the matter over.

Scott,\nAssistant Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, OTTAWA.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nRe - Brown and Hudson.\nIndian School at Onion Lake, Sask.\n\nI should have replied earlier to Mr. McLean's letter of April 18th, enclosing copy of letter written to the Department of Justice, asking for an opinion with regard to the points of controversy between the Department and Messrs. Brown and Hudson. Reference was made to a letter from Mr. Lang Turner, Indian Agent, written from Onion Lake, Sask. on April 11th, 1927. It reads as follows:\n\n\"Mr. S. Brown,\n791 Preston Ave.,\nWinnipeg Man.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your enquiry of the 5th instant, I beg to inform you that the site for the new school is about 30 miles due north of Lloydminster, C.N.Ry., and the Saskatchewan River has to be crossed by ferry. The roads are usually in good condition excepting in the early spring. Water is right on the job, and I do not think the gravel haul will be more than a mile. Common boards and dimension can be purchased locally; I will ask the owner of the mill to write you re prices. For the sand and gravel you would be expected to make a small payment to the Indian band funds, say 25\u00a2 per load.\n\nYours truly,\n\"Lang Turner\"\nIndian Agent.\"\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6325, file 659-5, part 3)\nI am quite prepared to admit that the information given in Mr. Turner's letter is correct, but the information as given by him is consistent with the school being built right at the settlement called Onion Lake, but is not consistent with the school being built on its present site. Water would be right on the job if the school were being built near the settlement. The gravel haul would have been more than a mile in that case and common boards and dimension lumber could have been purchased there. As it turned out, water had to be hauled some distance and gravel had to be hauled a very much longer distance. The facts with regard to the length of the gravel haul can be readily ascertained since the pit from which the gravel was hauled is still there.\n\nMay I point out also that Onion Lake is the name given to the small settlement which is, I am told, about eight (8) miles from the present site. I would also call attention to the terms of the contract itself, which call for the erection and completion of an Indian Residential School at Onion Lake, Sask. - not eight miles from Onion Lake.\n\nUnder the circumstances, it would seem to me that Messrs. Brown and Hudson have a claim for extras in respect of the additional expense to which they were put, as outlined to you in my letter of June 7th to you.\n\nIf this question has not already been submitted to the Department of Justice, I would be glad if this letter could be sent along with your letter of April 18th.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJTT:H\n\nIndian Affairs.

Indian Residential School, I beg to say that Mr. Hamilton, who was Inspector in Charge of Construction when the two Onion Lake schools were erected, was in my office yesterday with regard to another matter and I questioned him regarding this fire fighting equipment. He informed me that he was familiar with the situation and that Mr. Murison's report is absolutely correct. Mr. Hamilton saw this plant on the occasion of his last visit to Onion Lake, and he states that the engine cannot be started with less than five men, and that the Principal told him it took three-quarters of an hour to start it under the best of conditions. Mr. Hamilton also tells me that the water supply tank which is just outside the building and feeds the pressure tank is only 2\u00bd or 3 feet underground, and in order to prevent the water from freezing in the winter time they have to keep it stirred by pumping at short intervals, and in his opinion they will sooner or later have to have this water put down below the frost level. I may say that the Anglican School at this point has a first-class system which works perfectly, when properly handled, although at the present time it is out of order through neglect. This system, which is quite simple, was devised here in Regina by Mr. Paulin and myself, and Mr. Hamilton states that he recommended to the Department that it be installed at the Onion Lake School (R.C.)\n\nI merely write this letter to impress upon you the fact that something should be done at once to remedy this serious state of affairs, as we apparently have no adequate fire protection at this school at the present time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Mr. Tempest recommended that in connection with the twenty-five horse-power engine an air starter should be installed at an estimated cost of $150.\n\nIt was also recommended in this same letter that another three hundred feet of two and one-half inch hose with couplings should be supplied with fourteen more soda acid fire extinguishers.\n\nThese additional items recommended by Mr. Tempest at that time do not appear to have been authorized and I shall be glad to have your authority for the immediate installation of an air starter for the large engine, so that the danger in case of fire may be obviated.\n\nIn view of the information which we have already obtained on this matter I am not asking for a report from Calgary until I hear from you again.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. J.D.

School, and I note the Department is taking steps to have the Dominion Water Power Branch look into this matter.\n\nWith regard to the last paragraph of your letter in reference to the installing of pole fire escapes, I note you state that in using this type of escape accidents have occurred from pupils sliding down the pole before the preceding pupil had reached the bottom or left the pole at the ground, and also that in extremely cold weather in the winter there have been cases where pupils leaving hot dormitories have stuck to the metal pole with serious injury resulting. I recommended pole fire escapes for the reason that the reports I have from our Inspectors, in addition to the impressions which I gained through personal observation on many occasions led me to believe that they were the ideal thing for Indian Schools. I have never known of a case where a child had to put its hands on the pole when sliding down, so that the danger of injury resulting in frosty weather would be negligible. It was only within the last five or six days I watched the children coming down the poles at the Cowessess School. Thirty children came down from the third storey in less than two minutes, and not one child was touching the pole with hands or feet, as they merely hugged it with their legs and arms. There was no confusion at the bottom, and if there had been a case where one child lit on top of another it would not have been very serious. We have ladder escapes at some\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nof our schools, and these, in the opinion of the Inspectors and myself, are most dangerous. If a child slips on one of these ladders it is liable to be seriously hurt, and as some of the ladders are almost perpendicular and in some cases even attached right to the wall of the building it is pretty difficult for small children to negotiate them. The open stair type of escape is just about as bad, as the treads on these are not more than six or seven inches wide, and to get a lot of children seven or eight years of age down these steps is almost an impossibility. Then again, on this type of escape it is necessary for the children to hold on to an iron hand rail all the way down so that the danger in cold weather of having the skin peeled off their hands would be much greater than with the pole escapes.\n\nYour officers here have given a good deal of personal consideration to this matter and I think their views should be considered. I should like to see the pole fire escapes installed, as I think they are in every way the most efficient and the safest means of getting the children out of a building in case of fire, but it is, of course, for the Department to decide whether poles or treads shall be used. I may say that the treads cost four or five times as much as the poles, but I am not taking this into consideration in making this report.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n18th April, 1929\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to enclose file No.115-8-15B containing a contract, together with specifications, entered into by McCarr, Brown and Hudson, Contractors, with the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs for the erection of an India residential school at Union Lake, Saskatchewan, dated the 9th of June, 1917. This contract has been completed and Mr. Brown has claimed a further sum of \u00a33250 in respect of extras due to an alleged change of site for the erection of the building, the particulars of which claim are set forth in a letter from Mr. J.T.Thorson, M.P., dated the 7th January, 1929. As you will observe in the first paragraph on page E of Mr. Thorson's letter, he bases his claim primarily on the information contained on the outer cover of the specifications, that \"for all information with reference to the site of the proposed building contractors should refer to Indian Agent, Lang Turner, (Union Lake, Sask.)\" and on the letter which Mr. Brown received from Agent Turner in reply to his enquiry, dated the 11th April, 1927, it is stated also that Mr. Brown sent a man to Union Lake to look over the ground and this man was told by some person that the site was to be right beside the old school at Union Lake, and it is intimated that Mr. Brown's tender was based on this information. Our view is that even on these statements Mr. Brown has no claim since the information given in Agent Turner's letter as to the site of the school is absolutely correct. Moreover, it is specifically provided that \"Before submitting a proposal, the bidders shall carefully examine the drawings and specifications, visit the site of the proposed work, and ascertain for themselves the nature of the soil to be excavated and the amount of excavating required, and fully inform themselves as to all existing conditions.\"\n\nThe Deputy Minister of Justice,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Brown's answer is contained in a copy of his letter to Mr. J.T. Thorson, M.P., dated the 5th April, 1929.\n\nI may say that in view of the facts as we understand them, we are not disposed to recognize Mr. Brown's claim, and I should be glad to know whether you consider our action warranted.\n\nYours truly,\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nat Onion Lake which he says is a small settlement 8 miles south of where the school was actually built, I have to point out that the first paragraph of the advertisement for tenders for the construction of the building in question reads as follows:\n\n\"Sealed tenders addressed to the undersigned and endorsed on the envelope 'Tender for St. Anthony's Indian Residential School on the Onion Lake Indian Reserve, Sask.' will be received up to noon of the 2nd day of May, 1927, for the erection of the above mentioned building,\"\n\nand the heading of the Specifications on which Mr. Brown based his tender reads as follows:\n\n\"Specifications ---- Of the work to be done and the materials furnished in the erection and completion of the St. Anthony's Indian Residential School on the Onion Lake Indian Reserve, Saskatchewan ...........\"\n\nand further that Paragraph 4 of the said Specifications is as follows:\n\n\"Before submitting a proposal, the bidders shall carefully examine the drawings and specifications, visit the site of the proposed work, and ascertain for themselves the nature of the soil to be excavated and the amount of excavating required, and fully inform themselves as to all existing conditions.\"\n\nThe school was built on the Onion Lake Indian Reserve.

This letter was held pending a submission of a copy to Mr. Thorson, M.P., whom Mr. Brown had interested on his behalf.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of Mr. Thorson's letter of the 14th ultimo setting forth his observations with respect to our letter of the 18th April. Mr. Thorson, you will observe, admits that the information given in Mr. Turner's letter to Mr. Brown is correct but claims that the information as given is not consistent with the school site on which this school was built. With reference to Mr. Thorson's observation, I have to say:\n\n(1) that the school was built thirty miles due north of Lloydminster, the exact site stated in Mr. Turner's letter;\n(2) Mr. Hamilton, the Inspector of the Contract, states in his memorandum of the 9th March last that most of the gravel was procured within a mile of the job;\n(3) that there is a lake about 200 yards from the school site and a fine spring about 150 yards from the building.\n\nWith respect to Mr. Thorson's observation on page 2 of his letter that according to the terms of the contract itself it called for the erection of an Indian residential school\n\nThe Deputy Minister of Justice,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We mentioned it very briefly when I met you on the street. I am very sorry that I was not able to go into it more fully with you before I left Ottawa. With regard to the question of claim for extra by reason of the difference of opinion as to site; I understand that this is still under consideration by the Department of Justice. If any progress has been made with regard to the matter and if the Department of Justice has expressed any opinion with regard to the points of difference I would be very glad indeed if you would be good enough to advise me.\n\nIn my letter to you of January 7th I referred to other claims for extras in connection with the construction of the school. Some time in August last Mr. Brown sent you a memorandum of extras claimed by him and I referred to them in the first paragraph of my letter of January 7th. They are as follows:\n\n| Item                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 2 Extra Doors                             | 450.00 |\n| Corridor Partitions                        | 156.00 |\n| Paper for Ceiling                         | 44.00  |\n| Balance for Verandah extension and stairs to chapel | 301.00 |\n| Copper for wash tables                    | 200.00 |\n| Brass Clips to doors                      | 15.00  |\n| Extra excavation and concrete in machinery room | 273.52 |\n| Extra Pulleys                             | 13.96  |\n| Extra Electrical work                     | 117.86 |\n| Difference in cost owing to site of school | 5250.00 |\n\nIndian Affairs.

I would be glad if you would be good enough to advise me as to what action has been taken in respect to the other items. On page four of my letter of January 7th I made certain observations with regard to some of the above items.\n\nThere is also a dispute with regard to the claim of H.J.Skinner for wages. I would be glad if you would advise me as to the attitude taken by the Department with regard to this.

Cloughton at Indian School, at Onion Lake, Sask between Oct. 11/27 to April 30/28.\n\nIn your letter to us of Nov. 5/28 you refer us to Mr. W.A. Hamilton of Regina, Sask. We have written Mr. Hamilton more than a dozen letters. He has stated to us that notice was received of this claim, and sufficient amount was deducted to meet this claim. His letter to us of Jan. 26/29 states he has issued the final certificate, and there is no reason why these moneys should not be paid over to us for Mr. Skinner. We have kept writing Mr. Hamilton all spring and summer, and now in his last letter he states he has resigned his position with you. In such an event it is no use to write him any more. We can then do nothing but write you direct.\n\nWe wish to know, to begin with, what is the cause of this delay. The work was done nearly two years ago and it is almost impossible to get reply to any letters. This is just like the dunning we have to carry on with certain dead beats. We are certainly entitled to know what is holding this up. Instead we have to wait several months before we can get anybody to answer.\n\nThis is a substantial sum and it should be paid without this trouble. Please let us hear from you on receipt of this letter and better still, let us have your remittance for the sum claimed to close this matter out.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDOYLE COSTIGAN & CO\n\nper\n\nIndian Affairs.

Under the circumstances I submit that there is no longer any reason for holding from Messrs. Brown & Hudson the sums of money in respect of these two claims, namely, P.T. Roberts $85.75, H.J. Skinner $384.26, total $473.01. I would be glad, therefore, if you would forward Cheque to Messrs. Brown & Hudson for this amount, and at the same time advise me what decision has been arrived at with regard to the other claims for extra.\n\nWhen I wrote you on the 28th ultimo, I asked you whether you had any objection to sending me a copy of the opinion of the Justice Department to which you made reference in your letter to me of the 24th ultimo.\n\nYours truly,\n\nEnc.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOct. 4, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Thorson,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 27th ultimo with further reference to Messrs. Brown & Hudson's contract for the Onion Lake School, I beg to say that a letter has been received from the Department of Labour advising that Brown and Hudson have settled the claim of Mr. J. Skinner and an amount of $354.26 can now be paid to Mr. Brown and a cheque will be sent to him.\n\nWith reference to the account of P.T. Roberts, I beg to say that this company does not acknowledge the cheque for $160.00 as final settlement of their account, and the following is an extract from a letter written to Mr. Brown on December 20th, 1927, by P.T. Roberts, Ltd.\n\n\"The writer is directed to write to you regarding your account; that the cheque you issued in favour of James Gibson under date of 15th instant for $160.00 is not in full settlement of your account.\"\n\nReferring to your letter of August 16th regarding the claims for extra work the first three items have been allowed and to these will be added the $200.00 for the placing of copper on the wash tables and the providing of extra pulleys. With regard to the other items I beg to give you the following particulars which have been taken from the report submitted by Mr. W. A. Hamilton, Inspector of Construction on this work.\n\n\"Balance for verandah Extension and stairs to Chapel.\"\n\"Verandah extension and stairs to gallery in Chapel. I authorized the stairs to the gallery in the Chapel and which item I have allowed them $86.34 in the final estimate, and in reference to the verandah I refused to have anything to do in the matter on receiving your letter of July 12th/27 and I notified the Sister Superior of your decision. She then took the matter up with\n\nIndian Affairs.

Brown and Hudson covering the Skinner claim, copper for the tables and the pulleys, amounting to $998.25.\n\nAs requested I am enclosing a copy of the\nopinion of the Department of Justice.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

School there a man arrived from Winnipeg to install a compressed air starter in connection with the 25 h.p. engine which supplies the power at this institution.\n\nOn examining the engine it was found that the cylinder was badly cracked through the neglect of someone, presumably the engineer in charge of the plant last winter, who failed to drain it and it is necessary to supply a new cylinder before the starter can be installed.\n\nAs the matter is urgent I have ordered the necessary parts from the Fairbanks Morse Company, and I wish to again direct the attention of the Department to the great expense continually being incurred on account of these valuable power and lighting plants being operated by incompetent men. The time has arrived when the Department should insist that at least one member of the staff at any school equipped with a plant to produce electric light and pump water, should be competent to operate the plant in a satisfactory manner. This, I am sure, is not asking too much, and I think steps should be taken at once to ensure that at every institution so equipped, at least one member of the staff can be relied upon to take proper care of the plant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa, October 22, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nMr. Commissioner Graham reports that a cylinder in the engine which supplies the power at the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School was badly cracked, and that this is evidence of neglect on the part of your engineer. The Department must insist on a properly qualified man to look after the mechanical plant at each residential school, and I should be grateful if you would take immediate steps to secure the services of someone who is competent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Indian Residential School. I am today writing to the Rev. Principal, informing him that a competent man must be engaged to look after the machinery.\n\nThe Department has insisted for some time that one member of the staff at each school should be competent to operate whatever mechanical plant is provided. Whenever you learn of incompetency, I know you will write the Department, and steps will be taken to secure a properly qualified man.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Oct. 16th, 1929.\n\nInspector Murison's report on the schools in the Onion Lake Agency.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to report that I visited the Onion Lake Roman Catholic Residential School on the 7th instant and made a general inspection of the buildings.\n\nWhen I last visited this school I arranged, under your instructions, for the erection of a root house and two granaries. This work has been completed with the exception of painting. I was assured that the painting would be proceeded with at once. The work in connection with these improvements has been well done.\n\nWhen visiting the engine room in the main building, I noted that the wiring from the switchboard and dynamos had not been insulated. The wire was simply wound around nails and spikes and hanging loose. When the Fairbanks-Morse Co. representative, Mr. Pedersen arrived the same day, I brought this matter to his attention and he stated that last fall he paid Mr. Rose, who was then the engineer at the school, the sum of $40.00 to do this work and sent the necessary insulators. The Farming Instructor, Mr. Balduc, who was present, produced a box which he said he did not know the contents of, and upon opening it, the insulators and other material was found. Mr. Pedersen said that he would interview Mr. Rose regarding this work. This is a matter that I pointed out to the Principal as one which should be attended to as I do not consider it safe in its present condition.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6325, file 659-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nONION LAKE R.C. INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nI have explained, under separate cover, the condition of the 25 H.P. engine installed for fire protection purposes. The air compression starter is on the ground ready for installation as soon as the engine is repaired. Additional hose has been supplied to enable them to reach any part of the building.\n\nThe Rev. Father Therien has been re-appointed Principal and has just taken up his duties. He is a business man and I am satisfied he will see that these things are put in order. I pointed out to him how important it was to have a capable man in charge of the heating and lighting equipment, as well as the engine. The question of providing pole fire escapes has already been dealt with by you.\n\nI noticed, in going through the building, that the plaster work, particularly on the stairway walls, is not standing up well and is badly broken in spots. This might be protected by placing burlap on the walls to take the jars. The paint on the outside walls of the main building, particularly at the north side, is very badly blistered and was evidently put on during the time when there were heavy frosts.\n\nIn going through the dormitories, it was noted that hay mattresses are being used on all the beds, with the exception of about 20, which are equipped with wool mattresses.\n\nI found the school scrupulously clean throughout.\n\nThere are 83 pupils enrolled at this school.\n\nThe stock\nONION LAKE R.C. INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nThe stock consists of 10 cows, 6 young stock, 6 horses, 58 hogs, and they have about 80 hens, as well as some turkeys and ducks.\n\n40 acres of wheat yielded 380 bushels, 80 acres of oats yielded about 300 bushels. They had only 47 bushels of potatoes. Their garden was a failure and they will have to purchase potatoes and vegetables for their requirements. 50 acres of new land was broken during the summer.\n\nW. Morrison,\nSup't of Indian Affairs\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6325, file 659-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:-\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a report of an inspection made at the various schools in the Onion Lake agency.\n\nI would draw your attention to the very unsatisfactory condition of the plaster on the inside walls of the R.C. School, and also the paint on the outside. It looks to me as though the work had been very defective and there is criticism coming to the Inspector who was in charge. It seems too bad that in a remote part of the country where it is so difficult to get work done, special care was not taken to see that it was performed in a proper manner. The Department will be called upon now to spend a considerable sum of money to put this building in repair, although it is practically new. I would also draw your attention to the manner in which the Fairbanks-Morse Company installed the new 25 H.P. engine at this school. The purpose of supplying this engine was, I understand, to provide adequate fire protection. I do not know what the Department's arrangements were regarding the installation, but it seems to me most unusual that Mr. Rose, while employed as Engineer at the school, should undertake work of this kind, and be paid twice for his time. I think the Department should look into this matter. We have had trouble in the past with this large engine and it seems to me that our troubles are not ended. It is so important that we should have fully qualified Engineers at these institutions, otherwise we are just smashing, breaking and spending money recklessly in repairs. I think the Department should take immediate steps and call upon the people who agreed to install the engine to see that the wiring is properly done.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\n- With reference -\nWith reference to the Inspector's remarks regarding the shortage of beds at the C. of E. School, it has long been the policy of the Department to see that each child has a bed and that there should be no doubling up, and I would recommend that the additional beds required should be supplied. I would also recommend that proper mattresses be supplied. I have never felt that straw mattresses would be a success and I think the Department has abandoned the idea and are now buying proper mattresses.\n\nI do not think the Department would be well advised in spending any money on the erection of new buildings for a Day School in this agency. The time will come when there will be a Residential School built at Saddle Lake and the children from Cold Lake should go to this school, or to a school of the same denomination at Onion Lake. I think you will agree with me in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. A. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOctober 28, 1929.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. ORR.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Graham's letter concerning the installing of the engine and switchboard by the Fairbanks-Morse Company, you will note that letter of the 6th instant authorized the proper wiring - the work to be done by a local electrician. Do you feel that Mr. Rotherham's account, when presented, should be paid by the Department, or should we look to the Fairbanks-Morse Company for settlement? There is correspondence in this connection on the -15 of the file, in October, 1928, with the Fairbanks-Morse Company.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6325, file 659-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nCALGAR OFFICE\n\nWith reference to your Register C-4339, which called for Air Starting Equipment to be shipped to the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School, we are now in receipt of a report from Mr. Pedersen, who went to Onion Lake to make this installation, from which we quote as follows:\n\n\"When looking over the 25 H.P. Engine No. 707553, I found that they had neglected to drain the water or to heat the building warm, with the result that the water jacket of the cylinder and the elbow in the cooling water line were cracked. As the Principal of the school can not order big repairs like these, I went to see Mr. Morrison, the Inspector, and he told me this matter had to be taken up with Ottawa. I gave Mr. Morrison (Murison) a list of the parts needed, as follows:\n\n1 - #1A-0 Cylinder with all studs.\n1 - #638 Cylinder head gasket (inner)\n1 - #118 Combustion Chamber Gaskets (inner)\n2 - #40A \" \" (outer)\n2 - #33B Cylinder Head Gasket (outer)\n36\" x 36\" Asbestos packing\n(Cylinder must be fitted with piston, piston rings and piston pin.)\n\nand he will attend to the matter.\n\nI had intended to place the small engine and compressor on a wooden foundation, as the floor of the building is wood, but as we cannot start the engine for some time I pointed out to Mr. Morrison that a wooden floor was dangerous and unsatisfactory, and he will try to have a concrete floor put in. I, therefore, decided to make a concrete foundation, if someone will, no doubt, have the good sense to go to Onion Lake to install the new cylinder and on. The former engineer at the school did not install the insulators we sent up for the lighting plant. I placed these and also examined the 15 H.P. engine, which is in good shape. The engineer would like to have some spare parts for this 15 H.P. Engine, and the following is a list of the parts he desires:\n\nSpare Parts - 15 H.P. Type \"Y\" Engine No.702166\n\n1 - #1209 Torch Body\n2 - #97 Injection pump plunger cushion\n22 - #5 Connecting rod shims thin\n1 - #40 Combustion chamber gasket\n1 - #33A Cylinder head gasket\n1 - #2639A Instruction Book\n1 - Hydrometer (for testing fuel oil)\n1 - Set of brushes for 10 K.W. type DH Generator\n1 - 1 ft. 1 H.P.

(RG 10, Volume 6325, file 659-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nWhen inspecting the 110 Volt Battery, I found it to be in bad shape; the sediment on the bottom of the jars reaches the plates. All of the cells should be cleaned out as soon as possible to avoid ruining the battery. I told the engineer this. The cleaning will have to be done by a competent man, and will require four or five days' time.\"\n\nThese are the parts of Mr. Pederson's report which we believe should be brought to the attention of the proper persons, and since the order for this equipment was given to you in Calgary, we think possibly you may know with whom to communicate.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTHE C.

Indian Boarding School at Onion Lake, and our Repair Department are making shipment of these parts.\n\nIt was not our intention to send our man back to Onion Lake because, as you will appreciate, it is rather an expensive trip, and the profit on repair parts will not permit of our furnishing this service without charge. While our man was at Onion Lake, it was not possible for him to complete the installation of the Air Compressor, etc., but this work was carried as far as possible while he was there, and we believe that your operator has sufficient information to enable him to complete this installation when the new cylinder has been put on. However, we are rather inclined to believe that it might be advisable to have one of our representatives at Onion Lake when the new cylinder and piston are installed, to make certain that they are correctly put on, and that the engine is operated under no load for a certain period of time, until the piston has become properly seated in the cylinder.\n\nThe order for the Compressed Air Starter, which included the services of our mechanic, was placed by the Dominion Water Power Branch in Calgary without Calgary Branch, and we, therefore, sent to our Calgary Office an extract of the report made to us by our Engineer after his visit to Onion Lake. Our Calgary Branch advise that the Dominion Water Power are no longer interested in this particular transaction, and we, therefore, attach to this letter a copy of the letter we wrote to our Calgary Branch for your information.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTHE CANADIAN FAIRBANKS-MORSE CO.LIMITED\n(Sgd.)

Deputy & Secretary.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Department letter No. 115-8-5, of the 23rd instant, and am glad to learn of the Department's insistence that at least one member of the staff at each school shall be competent to operate a mechanical plant. I note further that the Department will take steps to secure a properly qualified man on being advised of any case of incompetency.\n\nIn this connection, I beg to advise the Department that there should be a change at once at both the R.C. and C. of E. Schools, in the Onion Lake Agency, and with regard to Gordon's and Old Sun's Schools, steps should be taken to see that only qualified men are appointed when plants are installed in the new buildings. It would be folly to allow the Principal, in each case, to employ a man and find out when it is too late that he is not taking proper care of the plant. The Department should be assured of the competency of the men they propose to employ before they are placed in charge of the machinery.\n\nAt the Peigan R. C. School there is a very incompetent man in charge and he should be replaced at once by a man capable of taking care of the light and water plant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

Hunter, is for material and labour making shelves and cupboard in the storehouse at the school, and also some work at an outside shed; and Voucher No. 208, in favour of the Co-Operative Assoc., Ltd., Lloydminster, is for shingles to cover a small shed put up by the school, between the permanent granary and implement shed, and for paint to paint the concrete floors in the boy's and girl's recreation rooms, which were painted last winter, but the paint was worn off and the floors needed another coat. Whilst this work was in progress the school management drew my attention to it, with a view to having the Department bear the cost. I asked Father Balter to write me regarding the work and told him that I would forward his letter to the Department with a recommendation. However, as at that time a change was taking place in the school management, Father Balter did not do this, and Father Therien, who has taken Father Balter's place, has handed me the accounts.\n\nThe work was all very necessary and I would ask the Department to kindly honour the vouchers.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n| QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION OF GOODS                        | LIST PRICE | GROSS EXTENSION | DISCOUNT | NET       |\n|----------|--------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------|----------|-----------|\n| 1        | #1AC Cyl. & Piston with all Studs          | 375.00     |                 |          |           |\n| 2        | #632 Cyl.

Indian Residential School, the installation of which was placed in the hands of the Dominion Water Power Branch, at Calgary, I may say that although we have been corresponding on this subject for a month we do not appear to get anywhere.\n\nIn the first place, the Company handled the work very badly and have sent in connections that will not connect with the standpipe. We have had sketches made of the couplings, and I have been in correspondence with Messrs. Bell & Morris, with whom the Dominion Water Power Branch placed the order, and they apparently cannot understand what is wrong. It seems to me this should have been a simple matter if it had been properly handled. First of all, the people who supplied the hose and couplings should have made careful inquiry from the Dominion Water Power Branch regarding the size of the couplings on the standpipe. Will the Department place the matter in the hands of the Dominion Water Power Branch and let them finish their job. I have had plumbers here who agree with me that the only thing to do is to let the people who undertook the work complete it. The trouble is that the outlet on the hydrant is 3-3/16 inches in diameter and 6 threads to the inch, whereas the hose couplings supplied are 2-3/16 inches diameter and 8 threads to the inch. I have pointed this out to Messrs. Bell and Morris but it does not appear to be understood.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIt seems\u2014\nIt seems to me this is the only way to straighten out this unsatisfactory business. We are putting in hose and connections at various points all the time, and never have any difficulty like this.\n\nIt will be necessary to supply a new nozzle to fit the hose supplied by Bell and Morris, and the Rev. Principal asks for a half inch outlet, as the present one uses the water too fast.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, January 28, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 309-11A R.C. of the 23rd instant, with reference to fire protection equipment at the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School. The Department regrets that there is any difficulty in getting this matter adjusted; but, as I hesitate to write to the Dominion Water Power Branch concerning such detail, I will ask you to complete whatever alterations are necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

One team of working horses for the farm. We have only six horses to do our spring work, and considering the number of acres we intend to put under cultivation, about 175 acre we need two outfits, four horses each, running simultaneously. The slowness of the seeding season amply justified this appropriation.\n\nAnd as everything points out to an early spring, I beg to request your immediate attention.\n\n2nd..... One Hog-pen needed very badly. This winter we had to winter our pigs in the stable along-side of the horses and cows. Raising pigs is one of our best sources of revenue, but we need proper accommodation to warrant a fair success.\n\n3rd..... Enlargement of our actual stable;\u2014 Our stable is already too small to warrant an increase of our stock. We should have twenty instead of thirteen, our present number, in order to supply the quantity of milk required for the children.\n\n4th..... One Ice-House. We have nothing of the kind. Badly needed.\n\n5th.... One Chimney in the Wash-House. Up to now we are using the ventilator as a chimney, a poor substitute and far from being safe.\n\n6th.... A sink near the community-room, and a cellar near the kitchen, and a Drier.\n\nMr. Morrison was here lately and took note of the different items above mentioned, and saw by himself the urgency of an appropriation to cover the same.\n\nLet me once more draw your attention to the discrimination we are laboring under with regard our capita grant, $65 instead of $70 dollars, granted to some other schools which are not giving a better service than ours and have not to meet the expenses incurred for being far away from the station.\n\nI hope your demand for these different items will receive a favorable answer.\n\nI remain,\n\nYour's faithfully.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

C. INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI visited this school on March 4th, and made a general inspection of the buildings. There were 109 pupils enrolled and 3 non treaty children, about whom there has been considerable correspondence. The Principal is making an effort to have these children taken over by the Province. I found the children neat and clean. They have a well nourished appearance. The school building was scrupulously clean and tidy throughout.\n\nFIRE PROTECTION\n\nSince my last visit pole fire escapes have been installed with access to them from the dormitories. These are in addition to the outside stairways. Regular fire drill is given the children. I had them demonstrate the use of both the stairways and the fire escapes, and noted that they evacuated the school very quickly when they used the pole escapes. The stairways, as I have already pointed out, are very steep, and it was noted that care had to be taken by the children when going down these stairs. There is altogether too long a drop at the bottom and some means should be provided to decrease this. They have to jump about 5 ft. to the ground when they reach the bottom of the stairs, and the children are apt to hurt themselves.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6325, file 659-5, part 4)\nR. C. INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nFIRE PROTECTION (CONT'D.)\n\nI found the fire equipment in good condition, and it will be in good shape when they receive the proper hose connections. When the new hose was sent, the wrong connections were provided with it.\n\nI have a suggestion to make which, I think, will add to the safety of the children in the event of a fire taking place in this building. The top floor of the building provides a dormitory at each end. Each of these dormitories have access to the fire escapes, but there is no connection from one dormitory to the other, and in the event of fire at one end of the building cutting off access to the escapes, it would be impossible for them to pass to the other dormitory and use the escapes from there. It would be an easy matter to make an opening and put in a door between these dormitories. This could be properly secured, but would be available for use in case of emergency.\n\nThey have two chemical fire extinguishers on the first two floors of the building, but none on the top floor and none for the outbuildings. They should have at least six more extinguishers as a measure of safety.\n\nThe paint on the outside of the building is in bad shape. As I pointed out in my last report, it is scaling off badly.\n\nLAUNDRY\n\nThe Sisters pointed out that although they have a soft water tank, they have no means of heating soft water in the laundry. They are using a small agricultural boiler now, the pipe from which is carried through a ventilator across the hall to a main chimney.\nR. C. INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nLAUNDRY (CONT'D.)\n\nThis does not look a very safe arrangement to me, and I think that a separate brick chimney should be built for the laundry. The brick for this chimney to be freighted by the school teams free of cost. They also pointed out that they have no drier for clothes, and they expressed a desire to have one. The laundry is equipped with four sett tubs, a washing machine and extractor.\n\nThe Sisters also asked that a wash basin and toilet be placed on the first floor for their private use. There was none provided when the building was built.\n\nThe dormitory beds are equipped with 110 hay ticks. The hay is changed once a year. The only smell noticeable in the building was the smell from the old hay in these ticks.\n\nFARM\n\nThey have 170 acres ready for seed this spring; 60 acres of this will be sown to wheat and the balance to mixed feed grains. They have 12 milk cows, 9 of which are pure Ayrshire. They have 1 bull and 6 young heifers.\n\nThey raise about 50 hogs each year, but have had to cut down on account of having no accommodation for them. They have to keep the hogs in the barn owing to lack of room. There is an item in the Estimates for a piggery for this institution this year. There is also an item in the Estimates for a garage, but the Principal states that he would rather forego the garage this year in favour of more room for the live stock. They have only sixteen stalls in their barn, and the Principal states that if we could provide a lean-to shed to the barn, it would be\nR. C. INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nFARM (CONT'D.)\n\nwould be more useful to them than a garage.\n\nThey have six work horses and would like to get two more to enable them to make up two - four horse teams.\n\nThe cottage provided for the Farming Instructor at this school is a very neat building. It was wired for electric lights, but no fixtures were provided and the building was not connected with the system. They informed me that they could do the work if the Department would provide the fixtures and wire, which, it is estimated, would cost $75.00.\n\nThere is no ice house or refrigerator at this school and they have no means of keeping fresh meat during the summer months. As they have to bring their meat from Lloydminster, a distance of over 30 miles, it is impossible to keep it for more than a day or so during the warm weather.\n\nThe Rev. Father Therien is again in charge here, and the work of the school appears to go very smoothly and efficiently under his management.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., March 29th, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a report on the schools in the Onion Lake Agency, inspected by Mr. Murison during the present month.\n\nConditions at the Roman Catholic Residential School seem to be very satisfactory. With reference to that portion of the Inspector's report which deals with the escapes coming within 5 ft. of the ground, I do not know what we can do in the matter. If the fire escape stairways were carried down within 2 ft. of the ground, there is a danger of people getting up into the dormitories or children escaping. I think all escapes are about this distance from the ground. If a fire should take place the bigger boys and girls should be at the bottom to help the smaller children down. With regard to the suggestion that a door be built to connect the two dormitories, this is for the Department to decide. I have no doubt, when the plans were prepared, that it was thought inadvisable to have doors connecting these dormitories. I will be glad to have your instructions in the matter. It is pointed out that 6 more extinguishers should be supplied. These could be procured here if the Department wish me to do so.\n\nWith regard to the paint on the outside of the building, I may say that I drew the Department's attention to this in a letter, but have received no reply. You will note that the paint here is scaling off. This should not be. The paint supplied by the Contractor must have been of an inferior quality.\n\nI would draw your attention to what the Inspector says with regard to the agricultural boiler being used to heat soft water, the pipe from which passes through a ventilator across the hall. This is a dangerous business.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nbusiness, in my opinion. It will cost some money to build a new chimney as it will be quite a height if a new one is built.\n\nI think perhaps the Sisters can do without the wash basin and toilet on the first floor. It would cost a lot of money to send plumbers to the school to make the changes - several hundreds of dollars in my opinion.\n\nI notice that this school is fitted with old hay mattresses, which, in my opinion, is a serious mistake. I have expressed my views on this matter several times. I notice, in some cases, the Department are reverting to ordinary mattresses. There is no economy in using hay, to say nothing of it being inconvenient and insanitary.\n\nYou will note that the pigs at this institution are kept in a barn. There is an amount of $500.00 in the Estimates for a piggery, which I presume will be allowed.\n\nI wish to point out that they have six work horses and would like to get two more. It is not up to the Department to buy any more horses for this school, and with your instructions I will make this clear to them.\n\nIf it is the desire of the Department to put electric lights in the newly erected Farming Instructor's house, this can be done, but I think our Agents, who have served many years, are more entitled to electric lights than Farming Instructors, even at schools.\n\nIt is pointed out that there is no ice house at this school.\nOttawa, April 1, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 19th ultimo, with reference to the needs at the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School. The per capita grant compares favourably with that at other schools similarly situated, and I regret that no increase can be considered at the present time. I am writing to Mr. Commissioner Graham regarding an addition to the cow barn. The Department considers that the extra team of horses should be provided by the school, from the per capita grant or other earnings.\n\nI am also writing to Mr. Graham, concerning the need for an ice house, a hog pen and a cold storage near the kitchens. I am hopeful that some funds will be available for improvements at your school this year, but I wish to have Mr. Graham's recommendation before giving him authority.\n\nI regret there are no funds for a sink near the community room. I am making inquiries regarding the need for a drier in the laundry. Mr. Graham is being requested to investigate the need for a brick chimney in the laundry. In the meantime, the present arrangement for heating soft water should be discontinued, as it appears to be dangerous.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

C. Residential School. I believe this added precaution is wise in these buildings as they are not fireproof. Six additional fire extinguishers will be ordered by the Department. I have noted, for next year's Estimates, the advisability of painting the outside of the main building.\n\nPlease ascertain if some other arrangement cannot be made for the heating of soft water for use in the laundry. Could not this be done on the kitchen range and carried into the washing machine? The present arrangement appears to be unsafe, and you should give immediate instructions that it be discontinued. I hesitate to authorize the erection of a costly chimney for the laundry, until other alternatives have been carefully considered. There are no funds for additional plumbing fixtures near the Sisters' community room nor for two additional work houses. I believe it advisable, however, to arrange for the electric lighting of the farm instructor's home, and you may authorize it.\n\nI am pleased to state that funds will be available this year for the erection of an ice house and a hog pen at this school. You might let me have an estimate of the cost of these two outbuildings. It has also been represented to the Department that a cold storage room should be provided near the laundry door. Please let me have your recommendation. You might also comment upon my request for a drier for the laundry. If most of these improvements are allowed this year, there will not likely be funds for the addition to the barn. In the meantime, you might let me have an estimate of the cost of the lean-to shed which is requested.\n\nYou will receive separate letters concerning the other schools mentioned in Mr. Murison's report.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Duncan Scott,\nDeputy Minister of the Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHon. Sir,\n\nI beg to submit to your earnest consideration an appropriation for the following items:\n\n1st. One team of working horses for the farm. We have only six horses to do the spring work, and considering the number of acres we intend to put under cultivation about 175 acres, we need two outfits, four horses each, running simultaneously. The shortness of the seeding season has justified this appropriation. And as everything points out to an early spring, I beg to request your immediate attention.\n\n2nd... One Hog-pen needed very badly. This winter we had to winter our pigs in the stable alongside of the horses and cows. Raising pigs is one of our best sources of revenue, but we need proper accommodation to warrant success.\n\n3rd... Enlargement of our actual stable:- Our stable is already too small to warrant an increase of our stock. We should have twenty cows instead of thirteen, our present number, in order to supply the quantity of milk required for the children.\n\n4th... One Ice-House. We have nothing of the kind. Badly needed.\n\n5th... One Chimney in the Wash-house. Up to now we are using the ventilator as a chimney, a poor substitute and far from being safe.\n\n6th... A sink in the corridor near the sisters' community room and a cellar near the kitchen.\n\nMr. Morrison was here lately and took note of the different items above mentioned and saw by himself the urgency of an appropriation for the same.\n\nLet me once more draw your attention to the discrimination now existing with regard to our capita grant, 165 instead of 170 dollars, granted to some other schools which are not giving a better service than ours and have not to meet the expenses incurred for being far away from the station.\n\nI hope our demand for these different items will be granted as soon as possible as every one of them is badly needed.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(SGD.)

Indian School, Lloydminster, together with a report on the Church of England School also situated at Onion Lake.\n\nAn effort was made to carry out these instructions earlier in the year, but owing to the river crossing, this inspection was postponed till May 8th, 1930.\n\nONION LAKE (R.C.) INDIAN SCHOOL.\n\nDate of inspection. May 8, 1930.\n\nPurpose of Inspection. To ascertain if the new equipment which was ordered last August had been installed, and as to whether or not the water system is working satisfactorily.\n\nThe list of equipment which was forwarded in your instructions of October 22nd, was checked over in company with the Indian School engineer, and it was found that all the new equipment had been installed.\n\nThe engineer complained of the main drive belt in the engine house, constantly jumping off the pump pulley, as he stated that every time he started to pump water, this belt flew off. He was therefore unable to let any of the students run the plant, and he requested some means of maintaining the belt. I was of the opinion that the belt was used too tightly, and that if it was slackened a little bit, and possibly resin applied to the driving surface, this would solve the difficulty. I am further of the opinion that a belt drive guide with weights would effectually keep this belt on, at the same time giving the correct tension to the belt.\n\nThe pump and the engine appear to be functioning very well, and the engineer had no complaints to make about any of the machinery except the engine belt. The sewage disposal plant is working excellently and has given no trouble this winter.\n\nIn connection with this visit to the school, I would respectfully point out one defect that was noted. In the laundry room, there is no means of heating the soft water which is collected from the roof, and carried to a storage reservoir, so it is collected in pails and carried to the laundry room where it is heated upon a wood stove, chimney of said stove being carried in a ventilator shaft in lieu of a proper chimney. This constitutes a certain hazard and I would recommend that a proper chimney be built with an outlet from the roof of the laundry room.\nIn conclusion I would state that the condition of the water supply system is in first class shape, and is being well looked after in every detail.\n\n(Sgd) W.C. Stuart\nDepartment of the Interior\nCanada\n\nDOMINION WATER POWER AND RECLAMATION SERVICE\n\nCalgary, Alta.,\nMay 15, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI am attaching for your information two copies of Mr. W.G. Stuart's report of an inspection made by him on the 8th instant of the water supply and sewerage disposal plants at the Onion Lake (R.C.) Indian School, Lloydminster, and of the water supply plant at the Church of England school in the same locality.\n\nFrom Mr. Stuart's report on the Onion Lake (R.C.) school you will note that conditions in regard to the plant and equipment are satisfactory and everything appears to be functioning well. Mr. Stuart's suggestion regarding the belt from the engine to the pump will no doubt dispose of the difficulty complained of by the engineer.\n\nIn the concluding paragraph of Mr. Stuart's report on this school he points out that no satisfactory means of heating soft water in the laundry are available. The wood stove now being used, with the pipe carrying into a ventilator shaft, is far from satisfactory and undoubtedly creates a fire hazard. I agree with Mr. Stuart's recommendation that a proper chimney be built with an outlet from the roof of the laundry room.\n\nWith regard to the Church of England school, Mr. Stuart has recommended that the pump house be enlarged so as to facilitate operation and also, in order that the building may be properly heated during the winter months. It is likewise recommended that the intake pipe be extended to deep water, which can be obtained by the construction of an additional one hundred feet on 2\u00bd\" pipe. It is also recommended that a fine screen filter be placed on the up-turn elbow of this intake pipe in order to eliminate drawing small fish into the system.\n\nThe question of a suitable preparation to apply to the sunken reservoir, where Mr. Stuart reports hair-checking to have started, will be considered and we shall advise you concerning this matter at a later date.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Stuart considers the engineer in charge to be a capable man and fully qualified to undertake the duties involved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

Duncan Scott\nDeputy Minister of the Depart-\nment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nHon. Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter No. II5-8-5 of May 26,\nI am sorry to say, after investigation, that the old\narrangement you are referring to, is going on, although\nas scarcely as possible with that unsafe use of the ven-\ntilator; the sister in charge of the laundry is obliged\nto do so. The inspector of machinery, passing through\nthe establishment just lately, said that he was going\nto mention the necessity of a chimney. Will you kindly\ngrant appropriation for that chimney?\n\nLet me also apply for the following items:\n1st. Paint necessary for the floors of dining rooms, re-\ncreation rooms and passages in the basement, (work could\nbe done by one of our employees).\n2dly. A tank of about 500 gs. in the ground near the ma-\nchine room for oil, as it is not safe to keep that oil\nin the open alongside of the building.\n3dly. A sink in the room of the Principal; this would\nbe a very handy convenience, and considered as a per-\nsonal favor to the Principal. Same thing has been wis-\nhed for by the Rev. Sisters near their community room,\nand we trust in your kindness to grant both parties this\nsmall satisfaction.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, June 12, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to reply to your letter of the 4th instant, concerning improvements at the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School. In my letter of April first, last, you were instructed to discontinue heating soft water, as in the past, because of the dangerous use of the ventilator. This is a serious matter and must not be treated lightly. The question of a chimney is being considered - Mr. Commissioner Graham having been asked to report, but soft water must no longer be heated in this manner, and the Department expects you to give immediate orders. As you have been informed, there are no funds this year for the extra wash basin facilities in the Principal's room and in the Sisters' community room. I am corresponding with Mr. Commissioner Graham regarding paint for the floors and a 500 gallon oil tank.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Jos. Portier, O. M. I.,\nPrincipal,\nOnion Lake R. C. Indian Res. School,\nLloydminster, Sask.\nOttawa, June 12, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing, for your information, copy of my letter of today's date to the Rev. Principal of the Onion Lake H. C. Indian Residential School. The Department wishes you to see that the old method of heating soft water in the laundry is immediately discontinued. It must not be resorted to again.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake,\nSask.\nOttawa, June 12, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to the Deputy Superintendent General's letter of April first, last, concerning repairs and improvements at the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School. Please let me have your recommendation regarding alternative arrangements for heating soft water in the laundry. Is a chimney really necessary? The Department also wishes an estimate of the cost of the 16' house and the hog pen and your recommendation concerning a cold storage room near the laundry door and a drier for the laundry. Further, you were to estimate the cost of a lean-to addition to the barn. A recent communication from the Rev. Principal indicates that painting materials are needed for the floors of the dining rooms, recreation rooms and passages in the basement and that a 500 gallon oil tank should be installed near the machine room. Please comment on these requests also.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nReferring to the fourth paragraph of your letter No. 115-8-5 dated April 1st last, with reference to the erection of an ice house, hog pen, and an addition to the barn at the Onion Lake R.C. Residential School, I may inform you that I estimate that a lean-to to the barn to accommodate 10 milch cows, and with a shed for young cattle, 16'x30' will cost $780.00. We can build an ice house with a refrigerator for $600.00, and a hog pen at an estimated cost of $665.00, or a total of $2,015.00 for the three buildings. It will not be necessary to provide a cold storage room near the laundry door in view of the provision for a refrigerator in the ice house.\n\nWith regard to the request for a drier for the laundry, my experience is that these driers do not give very satisfactory service, and it is a utility that can be done without.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, June 18, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 309-11A R.C. of the 10th instant, with reference to outbuildings at the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School. You may erect a lean-to to the stock barn, with shed, an ice house with refrigerator and a hogpen, at a total estimated cost of $2,015. I note that the cold storage near the laundry door will not be required, in view of the other provision, and that you do not recommend a drier for the laundry. In the purchase of materials and the engagement of labour, please be guided by the Deputy Superintendent General's 1-1-5 of the 14th ultimo.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI have your letter No. 115-8-5 of the 12th instant, with reference to certain items asked for in connection with the Onion Lake R.C. Residential School. I may say that I forwarded recommendations in connection with the addition to the barn, ice house, and hog pen, together with an estimate of the cost of the three buildings on the 10th instant.\n\nWith reference to the arrangements for heating soft water, I may say that it is too bad that this was not foreseen when the building was being put up as arrangements at that time could have been carried out at much less expense than will be necessary now. In my opinion, it would not be feasible to heat soft water in the kitchen for the large amount of washing to be done in the laundry of a school of this size, and the only alternative now will be to build a chimney, the cost of material and labour for which should not exceed $100.00. The school authorities informed the Inspector when he was there that they would freight the brick to the school free of cost.\n\nWith reference to the painting material required for the floors of the dining room, recreation rooms, and passages in the basement, this would appear to be necessary in order to keep down dust which accumulates through wear on the concrete floor.\n\nWith reference to the oil storage tank and pump, I estimate that this could be supplied at a cost not exceeding $200.00. I think that this is a very wise thing to buy, and the expenditure would be justified.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nbe justified as a measure of safety.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. W. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, June 20, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 309-11A R.C. of the 16th instant, with reference to improvements at the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School. You will have received my letter of the 18th instant, authorizing outbuildings. I have now to authorize you to erect a chimney in the laundry, at an estimated cost of $100. The Department would be grateful if you would arrange for the construction of this chimney immediately. You may purchase painting materials for the floors of the dining room, recreation rooms and passages in the basement. The school authorities should arrange for the labour. Please keep the expense as low as possible. You may install an oil storage tank, with pump, near the machine room, at an estimated cost of $200.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M.

I have personally attended to the removal of the dangerous pipes; and in order to give satisfaction to the sister in charge there I have devised and fixed a temporary outside arrangement for heating soft water & boiling white linen, this of course could not be in use but only during present summer weather. I realise perfectly well that the building of a chimney would be rather expensive, and I dare not insist in my application for the granting of it, as we are in need of many other improvements. But would you give me leave to put up outside, at a safe distance and along side of the chapel wall to the top of the building a good galvanized pipe, this to be done on my own account? I would not do it without your approval and I shall wait for your answer.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Jos. Portier O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, July 3rd, 1930.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo, concerning improvements at the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School. It is noted that you have made other arrangements for the heating of soft water.\n\nRelative to the erection of a chimney in the laundry, I have to inform you that Mr. Commissioner Graham has been authorized to arrange for the construction of this chimney at an early date. He was also authorized to arrange for the installation of an oil storage tank, with pump, near the machine room, and to supply painting materials for the floors of the dining-room, recreation rooms and passages in the basement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Indian Residential School.\n\nIt appears that the management of the school purchased this paint on the authority of Departmental Letter No. 115-8-5, dated June 12th, last, to Rev. Jos. Portier. However, I should add that, before doing so, the Reverend Father asked me on more than one occasion whether I had received authority to purchase this paint for the school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOnion Lake, Sask.,\nSept. 24th, 1930.\n\nMr. Lang Turner,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to Commissioner Graham's letter regarding the inspection of all the joints in the wiring at the Church of England School - It would be necessary to take down every lighting fixture in the building to get at the taped joints in the ceiling outlet boxes. These boxes contain anywhere from two to four of these joints. It has been found that the wall switch boxes have also been used as junction boxes in some cases. This would mean that all of the wall switches would also have to be removed, in order to get at any joints that might be in these boxes behind the switches.\n\nThe work of inspecting all of these joints, removing the tapes to see that the joints were soldered, and then putting fresh tape on the joints would take almost as long as would be required to re-wire the building.\n\nIn Mr. Graham's letter, no mention is made of whether he wants anything done about the loop-in system of wiring, shown in the sketch enclosed with his letter. There is no doubt that this loop-in system is much superior to the system of wiring now in use as the wires in the loop-in system are continuous throughout the circuit, whereas the present system is composed of short lengths of wire joined together in each outlet box. If the loop-in system was used however, it would be necessary to purchase new wire, as the wire now in use in the building, would be in too short lengths to be used for the loop-in system. In view of the amount of work required to inspect the joints, as requested by Mr. Graham, would it be advisable to communicate with him before proceeding with this work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. E. Rotherham.\nWith reference to Department No. 118-1-5 of the 10th instant, in regard to the suggested form of inspection of the electrical wiring at the Onion Lake C. of E. Indian Residential School, I enclose copy of a letter received from Mr. E. Rotherham of Onion Lake in connection therewith.\n\nIn forwarding this the Indian Agent states Mr. Rotherham appears to think that this work is unnecessary, as he has already tested all the wiring and feels almost positive that there are no loose joints. Just before receipt of the Department's letter I had received information in response to my enquiries that proper fuses had not been installed in the first instance, those in use being altogether too large for the purpose, and had written to the Indian Agent, after consultation with an expert here, to arrange for the installation of the proper sizes of fuses. The same expert endorses the opinion of Mr. Rotherham that the carrying out of the suggestions made in the Department's letter of the 10th September would be unnecessary on the grounds that the wiring has been inspected and tested by a qualified man and is reported as satisfactory; that proper sized fuses are now or about to be installed, and that switches which were overloaded have been replaced by those of the proper size. In view of these reports, I am not prepared to recommend to the Department that any further inspections are necessary, as I am satisfied that all safeguards have been taken. I have, therefore, not further instructed the Indian Agent. If, in view of the information I now forward to the Department, it considers the suggested work should be done, I will arrange for it, but I consider, with the expert, that it will be an unnecessary expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian commissioner.\n| ARTICLES | Co-op.

Hunter, Onion Lake, Sask., for lumber for the ice house, hog pen, and lean-to, to the stock barn at the R.C. Indian Residential School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 115-8-5 dated 18th June, 1930.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nOttawa, 11th October, 1930.\n\nDear Major Kennedy,\n\nI have before me your letter of the 22nd ultimo with enclosures on behalf of Messrs. Brown and Hudson, contractors for the erection of the Indian residential school on the Onion Lake Indian Reserve.\n\nIn reply I have to say that Mr. Brown's claim as set forth in Mr. Thorson's letter of the 15th August last is based on the fact as alleged that the school building was constructed upon a site other than that contemplated by Mr. Brown when he made his tender and it is intimated that Mr. Brown was misled into this matter, first, by the contract itself which designates the building as the \"Indian Residential School at Onion Lake, Saskatchewan\", second, by the letter from Mr. Lang Turner, Indian Agent at Onion Lake, and, third, by the information given to the representative sent to look over the ground for this building at the request of Mr. Brown.\n\nWith respect to the first matter of complaint, I have to point out that the notice calling for tenders for this building provides that tenders shall be addressed as follows: \"Tender for St. Anthony's Indian Residential School on the Onion Lake Indian Reserve, Sask.\" The specifications on which Mr. Brown tendered refers to this building as \"The St. Anthony's Indian Residential School on the Onion Lake Indian Reserve, Sask.\" Mr. Brown's tender was made and his offer accepted before the effect of the formal contract had been officially registered by the word \"Saskatchewan\" in the formal contract which designated this building as the Indian Residential School at Onion Lake, Sask. The latter is merely an abbreviation of the fuller description set forth in the specifications on which Mr. Brown had already tendered.\n\nMajor W.W. Kennedy, M.C., LL.B., M.P.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nWith respect to the second matter of complaint, Mr. Brown points out that on the second page of the specifications it is provided that \"with reference to the site of the proposed building\" contractors were to refer to Indian Agent Lang Turner. Pursuant to this direction Mr. Brown wrote to Mr. Lang Turner and received a reply stating that \"the site for the new school is about thirty miles due north of Lloydminster\". This description, or lack of description, of the site is quite significant. At the settlement known as Onion Lake, there is a postoffice by that name. If the site had been at that place, the simplest way of informing Mr. Brown of the location of the site would be for the Agent to say that it was at Onion Lake. The site, however, was not so designated. There was no mention of Onion Lake. The location as given by the Agent was only of a general character and could not have been intended by him or relied upon by Mr. Brown as defining the actual site on which the school was to be erected. No one could identify the site from such information. Nor could the Agent inform Mr. Brown as to the exact site by correspondence without a surveyor's plan of the portion of the reserve on which the school was to be built.\n\nWith reference to the third circumstance by which Mr. Brown claims to have been misled, I have to say that it shows that Mr. Brown did not rely on the information given in the letter from our Agent above referred to for the location of the site. Mr. Brown apparently did not visit the site to ascertain for himself the necessary particulars as provided by the specifications but made an arrangement with a firm to send a man to look over the ground on his behalf. It is said that this man was told at Onion Lake that the site was right beside the old school at Onion Lake. It is not alleged that this man was told by the Indian Agent. The Department can take no responsibility with respect to any information given to this man by anyone else as to the location of this site.\n\nAgent Turner in his letter to Mr. Brown above referred to apparently volunteered some information or gave it on request from Mr. Brown, as to the availability of gravel, water and lumber. As Mr. Brown, in the specifications, was referred to the Agent for the location of the site only, and as Mr. Brown was requested to visit the site and ascertain the facts for himself, the Department can take no responsibility as to what correspondence passed between the Agent and Mr. Brown as to these matters. We are advised, however, that the information given by the Agent to Mr. Brown as to the availability...\nof gravel, water and lumber at the site where the school was intended to be erected and was erected is substantially correct.\n\nIn view of the facts, as above set forth, I regret that I am unable to give favourable consideration to this claim.\n\nI am returning your enclosures herewith.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(Minister's signature)\nOnion Lake Agency\n\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nOctober 7, 1930.\n\nWe, the undersigned, Indians of Onion Lake Agency, hereby set our marks opposite our respective names in acknowledgement of the receipt of the amount therein following, being payment for freighting, paid by the Rev.

But would you let me draw your attention to the heavy expenses that through special circumstances have accumulated against our budget in connection with those improvements? I know that it was understood that the freighting of all materiel would be done by the School; but most of it has to be drawn for 35 miles from Lloydminster and at a time when the children were away for their holidays, when the work on the farm was very pressing and taking all hands; so that we have been obliged to get outside help for the freighting of lumber, nails, bricks, cement, sand...\n\nWe have to pay to various persons for carrying lumber and sand an amount of $749.00; we owe to one man only, Mr. Percy Taylor $175.39. Of course I do not mention what we have done ourselves.\n\nIs it unreasonable to expect that on account of the circumstances, the Department will back up and pay the extra expenses? I hereby do make an instant request for that purpose, trusting that you will kindly consider it and recommend it to the Department, and I hope this will be granted.\n\nI am glad to have this opportunity to thank you and to thank the Department for all that has been done this year for our School, and I remain\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nOctober 7, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a letter received from the Reverend Jos. Portier, principal at the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School; in which he asks the Department to re-imburse the school for its outlay in having material freighted for a refrigerator, hog pen and lean-to stable, recently erected at this school.\n\nThese buildings were erected during the school summer holidays, and, although the farming instructor did all the freighting he possibly could, he could not do very much as haying and harvesting operations were also being conducted at the time. Therefore, although the school management had agreed to do this freighting, it was impossible for it to do so without the cash expenditures for which the principal is now asking reimbursement.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSIR,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 23rd, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to official letter of June 18th, last, regarding the erection of a lean-to to the stock barn, with shed, an ice house with refrigerator and a hogpen at the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School, an account has recently been submitted to the Department for approximately $200., covering the cost of freighting the material required for the above buildings from Lloydminster to the school.\n\nIn forwarding the account, the Reverend Principal points out that, as the buildings were erected during the school's summer holidays when a number of the children were away and work on the farm was very pressing, it was necessary to employ outside help for the freighting. Please let me have a recommendation from you with regard to the payment of this account.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. M.

Harris, Onion Lake, Sask., for labour as per agreement for building the laundry chimney at the R.C. School. This agreement is made up from the original tender that 2100 bricks would be required & Mr. Harris made no change in his tender through his error. This expenditure was authorized by Departmental.\n\nLetter No. 115-8-5 dated 20th June, 1930 & 12th August, 1930.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant No. 115-8-5 with reference to an account of $200.00 which has recently been submitted to the Department, for freighting of material used in the erection of certain buildings at the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I may say that I do not think the Department should pay this account. The resident Agent made it clear to me that the freighting could be done at the school and I believe it could have been done. I do not think the excuse offered by the Principal is a good one. I am of the opinion that he should be called upon to pay this $200.00 out of the school earnings. In addition to this he should be told that he had no authority to incur this expenditure without first taking the matter up with the Department or this office, unless he was prepared to meet it himself. Had he taken it up with this office he would certainly have been told that he would have to get the freighting done, and it would have been done.\n\nI would judge from your letter that the Principal has been in communication with you regarding this matter. He should have passed any communication he had to make through the local Indian Agent, in my opinion. If he had done so the chances are the account would not have been forwarded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nM. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, November 6, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 99-19 of the 7th ultimo, with reference to freighting material for the new outbuildings at the Onion Lake R. C.

We are in need of a cellar adjacent to the house with convenient access from the kitchen so that we may have at hand the sufficient quantity of potatoes and other vegetables for the winter, and keep in a cool place all preserves and other provisions. We will be very thankful if you can get appropriation for that. The digging should be about ten feet, and the material needed is: Cement around 60 bags; 2000 feet of lumber, and a few yards of galvanised iron.\n\n2. Then, in the house on the walls in the public passages and up along the stairs a lining of burlap would be necessary to prevent the falling of plaster and keep it clean.\n\n3. In the nurse's room is wanted a kind of combined glassed case and cupboard, 4 feet wide, where could be kept the most used medicines and accessories.\n\nYou have seen by yourself that these requests are very reasonable, and I trust that by your recommendation they will be granted.\n\nThanking you in advance, I remain\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nWhy burlap is not put on in these schools is hard to understand.\n\nW.M.G.\nOnion Lake Agency\n\nAttached to letter No. 99-19, dated 22nd of January, 1931.\n\nIndian Affairs.
