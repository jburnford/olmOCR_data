G. Sommerville, manual training instructor at the Nanaimo Indian Day School, forward to the Department a detailed report regarding the vocational training that is given at the Nanaimo Indian Day School. This report should contain the following information:\n\n(a) Instruction: Name age and qualifications of instructor or instructors.\n\n(b) Industries: Under this heading you should specify the industries taught, the number of pupils in each industry, number of hours weekly that each pupil is engaged, and list of work accomplished during the period April 1, 1933, to March 31, 1934.\n\n(c) General Remarks: Under this heading you should state if the pupils are interested, and if you consider the results that are being obtained justify the expenditure that is being made.\n\nIf you feel that the value of the course could be improved, you should state in what manner you believe this could be done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\nReport of Manual Training Department\nAt Indian Day School\nTansimo Reserve\n\nName of Instructor: John G. Somerville.\n\nAge: 61\n\nQualifications: Certificates:\nHigh School Technical First Class.\nJunior High Manual Training First Class.\n\nSpecial Certificates in:\nMetal Work.\nWood Turning.\nMechanical Drawing.\n\nTechnical Training: Regent Street Technical School,\nLondon, England.\n\nIndustries.\n\nIt should be fully understood that this is an Indian Day School with limited room and equipment, and the work is therefore governed by these facts. The work however, is planned so that the pupils will gain a full knowledge of construction and wood-working joints that will be useful to them in after life.\n\nThe classes are held for one day of each week and although this is a one day school, the amount of work accomplished compares favorably with that in any school carrying it in periods for a whole week. Besides wood construction; sheet metal and metal are co-related with the projects and in some cases plan drawing is also taught.\n\nBefore appending the number of pupils and the work they have been engaged in, taken from the register, from April 1, 1933, to March 31, 1934 it might be advisable to state that a great deal of repair work is also being done. During the last two months the following are some of the articles which have been repaired: spinners; tubs; lamps; table; chair; bicycle; drag-saw; gun; and axes and hammers shafted etc. In addition to this, the pupils are encouraged to bring any tools which they may have at home and put them in working order.\nExamination of the files, when this school was started, it is noted that the instructor was asked to find room and equipment for ten boys. The register now shows an enrollment of over twenty pupils; the morning session as much as possible being given over to the seniors, and the afternoon to the juniors. The school, especially for the last two months, has been a little over crowded, the February attendance percentage showing 98%. The attendances in Winter and Spring however, are generally much higher than the Summer and Autumn.\n\nName: Some of the work accomplished:\n\nMcLean, S. Cedar chest, spinning-stand and frame, fishing boat model to scale, repairs.\n\nWhite, W. Fence gate, table, various Day School repairs, chest of drawers\n\nWhite, E.

Small cupboard, tool holder, stool.\nJoe, J.  Hat and coat rack, stool.\nGood, G.  Tool box, small cupboard, plant stand tooth brush holder,\nJohnny, H.  New boy.\n\nBesides the above list, the small boys have made many toys such as\nmodel planes, boats, windmills, gameboards, etc., bringing in various\ntool exercises.\n\nA complete list of all the activities of the Juniors has not been\nkept.\n\nJ.G. Somerville\nInstructor\nGeneral Remarks\n\n(i) I am quite sure the pupils are interested; and the projects are laid out so that their interest will be held. The Instructor has found that there is an innate love amongst the Indian boys, to work with wood-working tools.\n\n(ii) The trend today is for more and more practical education in our schools; and, judging from results and observances of the boys taught this particular branch of training; I would say that the money spent is more than justified. If anything, this training should be extended; results cannot be measured by dollars and cents.\n\n(iii) In the first place, let me say that the Instructor would welcome constructive criticism from any competent inspector, and is quite willing to stand aside at any time if the boys can be better helped. Mr. John Kyle, Organizer of Technical Education for B.C., has visited this school once or twice and has had nothing but praise for the work being done and its practical nature. The tragedy of youth today is that after school training, no positions are available. I should like to suggest that some of these lads be given an opportunity to further develop an outlet for the practical training which they have received.\n\nAs has been suggested by the Department, the boys might make caskets. This could be done, not only for our own Reserve, but for the whole Island extending up from Duncan. This project could be tried out at no expense to the Department, excepting the cost of material. If specifications were available, we could estimate the amount of costs etc.\n\nSecondly, so many of the Indians are fishermen and live at the seaside that a course in boat building (small boats) would fill an urgent need. Again here, as above, it would be a matter of first cost.\nThere is an old shed here that is available and that would be suitable for such work.\n\nIf these two courses could be worked out and started, the writer is confident that the school would soon pay its own costs, which on the whole, are very low.\n\nJ.G. Somerville\nInstructor\nYour No.152-11-11\n\nDear Sir:\n\nHaving reference to your letter of February 28th asking for a report from Mr. J.G. Sommerville, Manual Training Instructor at Nanaimo Indian Day School. I now have much pleasure in enclosing Mr. Sommerville's report which is very comprehensive, and I do not think that he overestimates the work that these pupils are doing.\n\nWe have had examples of the work that can be done by ex-pupils in the building of the houses that have been recently built on this reserve. The boys are taught very practically and it is really hard to improve very much upon the work that is being done, with the exception that perhaps if the department supplied material that coffins could be made and kept in stock it would save the department on various occasions when these have to be purchased. The classes are so well attended that the building is often found to be a little too small.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Box 5,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to refer to Departmental letter 152-11-11 dated November 3rd, 1937, in the case of Mr. Warner J. Huddleston whose employment as Manual Training Instructor at the Nanaimo Indian Day School has been recommended to the Indian Affairs Branch by Indian Agent Graham in place of Mr. Somerville who contemplates resigning on account of ill-health. Mr. Huddleston was previously employed as Manual Training Instructor at St. George's Indian Residential School and his work there has been adversely reported on by Principal Lett. Inspector Barry also informs me that Mr. Huddleston lacks the necessary qualifications and should not be appointed. Under these circumstances I would suggest that action with respect to this appointment be deferred until after the forthcoming inspection of the Indian Day School which is to be made by Capt. Barry early in December.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nRe A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nP.O.Box 444,\nVancouver, B.C.\nFebruary 5, 1936.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 8,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nWith reference to the vacant position of Manual Training Instructor in the Nanaimo Indian Day School, I may say that when last in Nanaimo on inspection duties I had a short conference with Mr. Indian Agent Graham and Mr. J.G. Sommerville in the hope that we could find a suitable candidate. I asked Mr. Sommerville whether he considered an Indian would be able to undertake the duties with any hope of success. It will be remembered that Mr. Sommerville has been the Provincial Manual Training Instructor for the Nanaimo Schools for many years and has also been in charge of the work in the Indian Day School. Mr. Sommerville promised to consider the matter and said he would later suggest a candidate for the vacant position. He rather favoured the employment of one of the Indians.\n\nEdison Whyte, an Indian of the Nanaimo Band, is now applying for the position of Manual Training Instructor at the Indian Day School. While I do not remember this boy passing through the Day School, I am very glad to know that Mr. Sommerville can recommend his employment. I notice that Mr. Indian Agent Graham suggests that Edison Whyte be employed in a temporary way till the end of the present school year on June 30th 1936. I would recommend that Edison Whyte be appointed Manual Training Instructor at the Nanaimo Indian Day School, the appointment to be a temporary one till I have an opportunity to inspect the work done by his class. There is a new teacher at the Nanaimo Indian Day School this term and I shall make a point of visiting the school before the end of June, possibly just before Easter. At that time help will be given to Edison Whyte should the Department make the appointment recommended above, and his work reported on in the usual manner.\n\nIn forwarding this recommendation may I draw your attention to paragraph 2 of Departmental letter 155-11-11 dated December 7, 1937.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n434 - 4th Street,\nNanaimo, B.C.,\nJanuary 22, 1938.\n\nTO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:\n\nThis is to certify that I have known Mr. Edison White for the past ten years, during which time he was trained under me. He is a splendid type of a young man and I am sure that he would make a success of teaching the younger boys.\n\nMr. White is an expert craftsman and as a student showed marked ability in his work. In addition to this he took many prizes in open competition with other schools.\n\nI have no hesitation in recommending this young man for this position, and if he is successful in his application I will keep in touch with the school until it is in good running order again. Mr. White is quiet, industrious, and anxious to better his position.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"J. G.

I am a resident at the Nanaimo Indian Reserve, and am 25 years of age.\n\nMr. Somerville, who recently retired from this position knows me personally, and as one of his pupils. A letter from him is enclosed.\n\nIf my application is favorably considered I shall think of this as a permanent position and not as something of a temporary nature.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"Edison Whyte\"\n\nGen.

G. Sommerville, former Manual Training Instructor at this school.\n\nI may say that I discussed this application with Mr. Graham, who is still in hospital, and he asked that I forward the application on to you, and to say that he considered this man did real good workmanship, and he would suggest that he be given a trial till the Summer holidays\u2014 and holding one session a week.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n\"Kate Robertson\"\n\nClerk.\n\nD.

Sommerville, Manual Training Instructor at Nanaimo Indian Day School, found it necessary to give up his duties because of ill-health, and that Mr. W.J. Huddleston applied for the position but was not recommended for the reasons set out in my letter of November 30th, file 15/3/1198.\n\nAn application has now been received from Edison Whyte, a young man 25 years of age and a member of the Nanaimo Band. Mr. Sommerville, late Manual Training Instructor, is of the opinion that Whyte has the necessary qualifications, and recommends him for the position. A copy of Whyte's application, together with copies of letters from Mr. Sommerville, Inspector Barry, and Miss Robertson, Acting Agent in the absence of Mr. Graham who is ill, in support of the application is forwarded herewith.\n\nI would recommend the temporary appointment of Edison Whyte as Manual Training Instructor, and that a report on his work be submitted by Inspector Barry before the close of the current school year, when such further action as is considered necessary can be taken.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

It is noted from your letter that before that date Inspector Barry will visit the school and report on Mr. Whyte's work.

B.M. clear spruce at .50\u00a2 and the extension read $5.40. The correct extension is $4.50. This means that the total of the account should have been $5.00 instead of $5.90. A cheque for the former amount is being forwarded to the company.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nJ. D. Caldwell, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nDuncan, B. C.\nThe small boys are making good progress in the making of toys and small articles. A few of the older boys have made satisfactory articles. The class has not been operating to allow me to judge in any sort of final way whether the Department is justified in continuing this work, under the guidance of an Indian.\n\nI would recommend that the Manual Training Shop be put into good repair, a heater supplied as mentioned above, the necessary new tools purchased, and the experiment continued for the school year 1938-39. Edison Whyte in my opinion might well be informed that he has to show during the next School Year that the expenditure of the Department's funds on his salary and the Manual Training Shop in general is worth while. The Indians are at present trying to get as much for themselves out of the Department as possible and it is obvious that those boys not attending the Day School should be excluded.\n\nI believe that it would be well to retain the services of this young Indian as instructor for another year but that he be informed that his salary will only be paid monthly and that if considered necessary the arrangement may be terminated at any time with a month's notice.\n\n(Sgd.) Gerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B. C.\npresent pupils of the school are given instruction in very elementary Manual Training. The older school pupils, the four mentioned above are in the afternoon employed on school repair work etc. Some of the ex pupils have been coming in the afternoon also but I have asked that this be not allowed as all the time and space is required by the small boys.\n\nAt the six single benches and the long bench for three pupils only about nine or ten pupils can be properly accommodated. It is necessary to exclude the ex pupils of the Day School in the afternoon, as the little people require great attention in learning to work with sharp tools if we are to avoid accidents.\n\nA register has been kept in a rough exercise book since April. From this I have been able to extract the following information:\n\nTotal Morning Attendance 21 for 6 lessons\nAverage attendance in Morning Class 3.5\n\nTotal afternoon attendance 63 for 6 lessons\nAverage attendance in afternoon class 10.5\n\nAt first the ex pupils gave trouble and had to be warned by the acting Indian agent. The worst of these older boys have left.\n\nI do not consider that the Department should permit those Indians who are not attending the Nanaimo Indian Day School to receive Manual Training instruction here. The three or four older boys with perhaps a few more from the lower Grades later will make a Morning Class.\n\nThe whole of the work done should remain the property of the school and not the pupil. It should be exhibited and sold and at least half of the money so obtained should be retained for purchase of materials and other articles for the school and particularly the Manual Training Class. Most of the articles made should be for the definite use of the school however. A number of small articles are required now by the teacher. The boys must be instructed that though they make articles from school lumber, with school tools, and in school time, these articles will not in future become their personal property as in the past.\nA Singer sewing machine is badly needed by the girls to enable them to learn to make their own clothes. Such machines are used in the Indian homes, and the older girls need this training. I would recommend that such a sewing machine as is used in the Residential Schools be supplied to this Day School.\n\nI wish to strongly recommend the granting of the sum of $100.00 to the school for the purpose of starting the above mentioned native wool work. This would cover cost of material and salary of Indian woman for the coming school year. After this the school might be able to carry on the work on the money obtained from the sale of articles.\n\nAs reported in December 1937 the old school now used as a Manual Training Shop is some 20 feet by 30 feet. There are four windows, one of which needs repair and all need wire mesh screens to protect from damage by balls. A new door which will lock is urgently needed. The outside walls of the room in one place at least need renewal.\n\nAs mentioned in my previous report a new coal burning heater is required if this room is to be used.\n\nA fairly large number of tools are urgently needed if any worthwhile Manual Training is to be carried on here. It must be possible to lock the Manual Training Shop door, and there should be a locked cupboard for the new tools and the few now in the room. The list of what is required will be prepared by the present teacher of this subject and sent to the Acting Indian Agent at Duncan.\n\nIn accordance with instructions from the Department I wish to report on the work of Edison Whyte (Indian) a young man of about 25 years of age and a member of the Nanaimo Band.\n\nEdison Whyte holds a temporary appointment as Manual Training Instructor here. In the morning class on Fridays three or four of the older school boys and seven of the ex-pupils of the school make under guidance articles for themselves, for which they appear to use Department lumber. In the afternoon class on Friday some ten small boys at\nExtract from Inspector Barry's report on the Nanaimo Day School dated May 27, 1938.\n\n............\n\nWith reference to Departmental letter 152-11-11 dated February 15th 1938 with regard to the temporary appointment of Edison Whyte (Indian) as Manual Training Instructor at Nanaimo Indian Day School, I would recommend that the present temporary arrangement be continued for the present. All Indian youths other than those attending the Day School should be excluded from the Manual Training Classes.\n\nThe construction of a small row boat has been suggested but the boys have not had sufficient training as yet to undertake this. Edison Whyte has been given some help and advice, and I have asked him to send the Acting Indian Agent a list of any tools which he may require, so that the matter may be taken up with the Department.\n\n............\n\nMiss Creighton wishes to arrange for the girls to learn to knit \"Cowichan Sweaters\" with native wool, which would be carded and spun in the school. It would be necessary to have a local Indian woman good in this sort of work give instruction for a few months possibly a year. One afternoon a week would be sufficient, and this should not cost more than $1.00 a week. The wool costs a considerable sum now. Articles made in school should be sold after exhibition and at least half the proceeds kept back by the teacher to purchase more wool. Miss Creighton has learned something of the work when this plan was put into operation at her last school, Koksilah, in this Agency. She considers that in a year she would be able to instruct without the aid of a local Indian.\nDear Sir:\n\nReporting on the Nanaimo Indian Day School Inspector Barry writes in part as follows:\n\n\"Miss Creighton wishes to arrange for the girls to learn to knit \"Cowichan Sweaters\" with native wool, which would be carded and spun in the school.

Provided the material does not cost over $50.00 you may arrange for its purchase and you may engage a qualified Indian woman to teach knitting as suggested by the Inspector. You will note that he considers that one afternoon a week should be sufficient and that not more than $1.00 a lesson should be allowed.\n\nPlease let me know the approximate cost of the heater recommended by the Inspector.

McLean,\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,-\n\nWith reference to your instructions of October 15th, to make an inspection of Kamloops, B.C. Agency, I have to report as follows,-\n\nx x x x\n\nSchools.\n\nIt would appear to me that a day school at the head of Okanagan Lake would be a great boon to these people. A settlement is fast surrounding them. Two bright young girls about thirteen years of age, appeared before Dr. McDougal and myself and asked that they might be assisted to learn to read and write like the white people. The band desires the school which I think should be a public school and would strongly recommend a school being established in this district.\n\nx x x x\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd. J.G. Ramsden,\nInspector.\nRe Schools\n\nRosy Dupret and Josie Chaco.\n\nThere are about fifty children eligible for school.\n\nQ. By Ins. Ramsden would you girls like a school to go to.\nAns. Yes, to learn reading and writing.\n\nQ. Do they think lots of the other children would like to learn like to read and write by the white people?\nAns. Yes.\nRe Education\u2014 I found in the Kamloops and Okanagan Agency two boarding or industrial schools, one at Kamloops and the other at or near Lytton, these being full to their utmost capacity, yet falling far short of the needs of the people. The Indians themselves brought this matter to me and repeatedly importuned for schools. \"Day schools, on or near the Reserve\" \"Secular Day Schools\" these were what they asked for, and after going over the Districts I would recommend that day schools with competent teachers be established at Enderby and at the head of the Okanagan Lake, and also in the Lower Similkameen country, also at Bonaparte near Ashcroft, and also at Spencer's Bridge, further down the Thompson. This would give this District five day schools, which in my judgment, are very much needed and for which, as above stated, the Indians have most earnestly asked for.\n\n(Signed) John Macdonald.\nOttawa, February 7th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nThe establishment of schools for the Indians of the Lower Similkameen, Bonaparte and Okanagan reserves has been recommended and the Department is disposed to favourably consider the requests of these Indians.\n\nThere are several matters in connection with these propositions on which the Department desires full information. The first is the site in each case. Is there a suitable site available within reach of the majority of the Indians, affording drainage facilities and suitable soil for gardening purposes, if desired, and a good water supply? If a school is to be erected, what style of building would you recommend; what material should be used in construction; how many children should be provided for and how ought it to be heated? You should also give an approximate cost of material and labour, and give your opinion as to the best means of construction, whether by contract or day labour.\n\nYou will recollect that at Enderby it was decided to utilize the council building for a time; but the Department is not aware of any buildings at the localities now under consideration that might provide temporary accommodation. If there are such you will be good enough to so state.\n\nThe Department will expect you to give this matter your immediate attention, so that operations may\n\nA. Irwin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\nbe undertaken at an early date, if it is finally decided to build. In addition to the information asked for anything else that occurs to you as being of importance should be dealt with in your report.\n\nKindly keep your reports on each of the three proposed schools separate, and send them direct to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 7th instant, No. 34551, in reference to the proposed establishment of schools for the Indians of Lower Similkameen, Benharta and Okanagan reserves. It is presumed that day schools are intended. A personal inspection with this object in view would involve 800 miles of travel by train, boat and stage, and would occupy considerable time. I can, I think, off-hand, with data at my disposal and an intimate knowledge of conditions, give the Department full and accurate information.\n\nA separate report on each of these bands is herewith appended.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.\nIndian Agent.\nSecretary Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont. /\nOkanagan.\n\nThe great majority of these Indians live on the N.E.I. reserve, which surrounds the head arm of Okanagan Lake. The principal village is situated at the head of this arm and is always referred to as Head-of-the-Lake. Within and tributary to this village there could be collected a school population of 15 children, and possibly some might come for a greater distance for a portion of the time.\n\nThere is no building suitable for school purposes. The water supply is distant and not good in summer. A garden plot might be secured, though a crop would be uncertain near the village. But I might say that half-a-mile distant from the village there is a good spring creek, and this would be the most suitable spot for school and garden.\n\nThe school building could best be constructed of lumber, and heated by a stove. By contract would be the most satisfactory means of construction, as I would not look for these Indians to unite on any undertaking. I estimate a building would cost $700.00.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 1st, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your report upon the application for the establishment of a school on the reserve at the head of Okanagan Lake, in which you state that 15 children live in or near the village and that others at a distance might attend during a portion of the year.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is disposed, under these circumstances, to erect a small school building and would be glad to have further details from you as to the style, size, etc., of building you would suggest. You might also give the approximate cost of materials that would enter into the construction. You should also state whether it would be possible to obtain board and lodging for a teacher or whether it would be necessary to provide some accommodation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Irwin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant in further reference to the establishment of a school at the head of Okanagan Lake.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will await the information asked for in official letter of the 16th instant. You state that you do not consider this locality as the most suitable to make a test as to the success of a day school and that you know some other places where the chances would be infinitely better. In this connection I beg to say that this information should have been given by you in your letter of February 16th, last. If you are not disposed to recommend the establishment of a school at Okanagan you should state definitely the place to which reference is made by you, at the same time giving a full report upon the conditions, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. Irwin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of lst. instant, No. 354351, and other correspondence in reference to establishment of Indian Day School, but chiefly in reference to one at head of Chananan Lake. It will be necessary for me to first visit the locality in order to fully answer the requirements of your letter. I am hoping to do this month, but I am very much hindered in such work by lack of means to defray my travelling expenses.\n\nI might say in connection with the intention to start a school among these Indians that I don't consider the locality should be singled out as place to make a test case as to the success or otherwise of Indian Day Schools. I could mention some other places where I think the chances of a school succeeding would be infinitely better.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nA.D. McLean, Esq.\nIndian Agent.\n\nSecy. Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nExtract from letter from Mr. Agent Irwin re. proposed school at Enderby. Original on File 329913/1.\n\nKamloops, B. C., April 19th, 1910.\n\nPlans for school building were being prepared by a competent man at Enderby when a building was first considered, but afterwards, when it was decided to use the council house, preparation of plans was discontinued. I saw this man at Enderby on the 2nd instant and asked him to complete plans as soon as possible, as they would answer for the Head-of-Lake school as well. Why I have to date not received them I am at a loss to understand.\n\nIn this connection I found conditions at Head-of-Lake even better for the establishment of a school than I had reported. The band as a whole is not as enthusiastic as one would wish to see, but there ought not to be any difficulty in procuring sufficient children.\n\nBoard at both places could be procured for teacher within easy distance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) A. Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 2, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, and in reply to that portion in which you deal with the establishment of a school at the head of Okanagan Lake I beg to say that the Department will be pleased to have the plans to which you refer, with an estimate of the cost, at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nsecretary.\n\nA. Irwin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\nOttawa, June 14, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nIt has been represented to the Department that it would be well to establish a day school for the Indians on the reserve at the head of Okanagan Lake. There would appear to be a sufficiently large number of children to justify the Department in making provision for a day school and you will be good enough to report as to the style and size of building that you would suggest, forwarding at the same time a sketch and an estimate of the approximate cost of the materials and labour and stating whether the work should be let by tender or performed by some reputable contractor under direct supervision of an officer of the Department. Inquiries should also be made with a view to securing a teacher.\n\nThe matter of a site should also receive careful consideration. It should be within the reach of the majority of the Indians and have good drainage facilities, suitable soil for gardening purposes, if desired, and a good water supply. Mr. Irwin, the Indian Agent, has already reported favourably in regard to this proposal and has stated that a suitable site is available, but no plans or estimates have been received from him.\n\nIn reference to a teacher it might be advisable to communicate with the authorities of the Roman Catholic\n\nK. O. McDonald, Esq., M.D.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nVernon, B.C.\nChurch, of which these Indians are members or adherents, as they might be in a position to nominate a suitable person.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, January 24, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to official letter of June 14th, last, in reference to the establishment of a day school for the Indians on the reserve at the head of Okanagan Lake. In this connection you were asked to look carefully into this question and obtain certain information that would enable the Department to have the work undertaken in due course. I have to ask you to be good enough at your earliest convenience to report upon this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nK. G. McDonald, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nVernon, B.C.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 24th ultimo File No.354351 I beg to say that Agent Brown and myself have discussed the question of a day school with the Indians at the Head of Okanagan Lake and are convinced that it would be useless to open a School there at the present time, the Indians being divided as to the desirability of a school and the location of same, and in view of the unsettled condition regarding the Enderby school would advise holding this matter over for a time.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nSecretary of the Department,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\nOttawa, Feb. 10th., 1912.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st. instant in reference to the establishment of a school at the head of Okanagan Lake and in reply I beg to say that in view of the circumstances no further action will be taken at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nK. G. McDonald, Esq., M.D.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nVERNON, B.C.\nOttawa, June 16, 1915.\n\nSir,-\n\nThe following letter was sent to the late Inspector Cumiskey on March 1, 1913: \"In the year 1909 the question of the erection of a school at the head of Okanagan Lake for the Indians of the Okanagan Band was brought to the attention of the Department and given consideration. There were reported at that time to be fifteen children of school age living in or near the village at the head of the lake, but no building for school purposes was available.\n\nThe late agent, Mr. Irwin, was not prepared to make a definite recommendation that a school be opened here, although at a later date he was more favourable. The late inspector was then asked to look into the question of the erection of a building and the opening of a school and he finally reported on February 1st, 1911, that he and Mr. Agent Brown had discussed the question thoroughly and were convinced that it would be useless to open a school then as the Indians were divided as to the desirability of a school and the location of the same. The matter was then dropped. The Department would like you to look into it now and report.\"\n\nInspector Cumiskey did not reply to this letter and the Department now wishes you to look into this matter and report.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA. Megraw, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nKamloops, B. C.\n\nAsst.

It\nappears that there were more than half the Indians at the\nlast meeting in favour of the school, but some of them\nrefrained from voting when the vote was taken. The old\nIndians were the most opposed and the freest in expressing\ntheir opposition, and the younger men who favour the school\nhave not the courage to oppose old reactionaries like Komasket. Another thing that affected the vote on the last occasion was the proximity of the time for re-election of the Chief. Pierre Michel is really in favour of the school, but he is afraid of the opposition and refrained from voting on that account. Had there been no election in sight he would doubtless have voted in favour of the school, and others who held back as well, would have been sure to follow his example.\n\nI think it would have been better if the last vote had been deferred. The prospects for the return of Pierre Michel as Chief do not appear to be very bright, but it is possible that Pierre may decide to drop out of the running and throw his weight in with Jimmy Joseph who was his best Councilman, and there is a possibility that Jimmy Joseph might carry it. He appears to be the best man in sight, and if he should be successful it would be an opportune time to revive the school propaganda. Until the Chiefship is disposed of it would seem to be better to allow the school to remain in abeyance.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nOttawa, July 20, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that, as you suggest, the question of the establishment of a school at the head of Okanagan Lake for the Indians of the Okanagan Band may be left in abeyance until the Chiefship is disposed of.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. Mcgraw, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nVernon, B.C.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, July 30, 1915.\n\nSchools Branch.\n\nGaston Louis (presumably Gaston Louis) has just been appointed chief of the head of the Lake Okanagan band, for an indefinite term. You asked for this information in connection with some school matter.\n\nH.C. Ross.\nOttawa, June 27, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nThe attention of the Department has again been called to the lack of educational facilities for the education of the Indian children of the Okanagan tribe, and the Department would like you to state what, in your opinion, would be the best means of meeting this deficiency.\n\nThe question of establishing a school at Enderby was under consideration up to the year 1915, and you were written to on the 10th of March of that year and asked to advise the Department of the quantity of lumber reserved for the purpose of building a school out the permit granted the Enderby Indians on the 16th of February, 1915, as it was considered that the 400,000 feet they were allowed to cut would leave a sufficient quantity for that purpose after meeting all their indebtedness. No reply has yet been received to the letter above referred to.\n\nIf a school were started at Enderby there would still be a number of children unprovided for in the neighbourhood of Penticton. The last census shows that there are about 140 Indian children from Osoyoos to Enderby along the Okanagan Valley, and the Department would like to know where would be the most suitable places to establish schools for these children and the probable cost of erecting suitable buildings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

For May.\n\nI visited our one school in the Agency (Inkameep) during the month and will shortly make a report with a view to having schools at the Head of the Lake and Penticton. There are over fifty children of school age at the Head of the Lake, scattered over a wide area and two schools may be necessary, these fifty children will otherwise receive no education at all which I believe is not the wish of the Department.\n\nRespectfully submitted\n\nSgn. Fred J.C. Ball\nIndian Agent,\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 27th ultimo in regard to schools in Okanagan Agency.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the situation in this Agency with regard to Indian education has always been deplorable. The only Indian school in the Agency is in Osoyoos band at Inkameep village, and the building in which it is being conducted is the merest excuse in the way of accommodation, while the teacher is living in a tent on the bank of Inkameep Creek, summer and winter.\n\nAttempt has been made at various times to induce the Indians of Spallumcheen, Okanagan and Penticton bands to establish schools at suitable points on their reserves, and votes to that end were taken by the former Indian Agent, J. R. Brown, but in every case the Indians voted it down. At one time previous to my connection with the Department the Spallumcheen Indians did think of having a day school opened on Spallumcheen reserve No. 2 at Enderby and school furniture was procured, but for some reason the school was never opened and the furniture was shipped to Penticton for the Osoyoos school and hauled by Osoyoos Indians to Inkameep. Nothing was ever done about a building for the school at Enderby, and it is perhaps fortunate, in a measure, that no special building was erected for the purpose, in view of the possibility that Spallumcheen reserve No. 2 may be given up for a soldiers' settlement and the Indians\nIndians moved over to reserve No. 1 on Salmon River. In that event the new church at Enderby would be moved over to Salmon River and the new church at Salmon River would serve admirably as a school building.\n\nIn regard to the Okanagan band an enumeration has shown that there are over 50 Indian children of school age on the Head of the Lake reserve, but unfortunately from the configuration of the reserve it would be impossible for one school to accommodate them, as they are scattered along a shore line of about 22 miles at the Head of the lake and down the east and west sides. To accommodate all these there should be a school at either Siwash Creek or Six Mile Creek, which could serve for Whiteman's Creek, Siwash Creek, Six Mile Creek and Blacktown. Then there should be a school for those at the Head of the lake which children from the east side could attend, although some of them would have to go 5 or 6 miles. The Council House at the Head of the Lake might be used for a school, but a building would have to be provided at Siwash Creek at a cost of about $500.00 or thereabout.\n\nAt Penticton an Indian school could easily be maintained and no building would have to be provided, for the Council house could be used. The older Indians are opposed to a school and most of the younger men and women are indifferent. Unfortunately, too, most of the clergy of the Roman Catholic Church which is the only church concerned in Indian mission work in this Agency, are opposed to Indian day schools. With one exception, Father John, who was in charge at Penticton in 1917, none of them have given encouragement to the establishment of a day school on the Penticton reserve; and had he remained there a year longer, I believe we could have had one started. There may be something in their contention that Indian children require the discipline that is more easily attainable in the industrial school or boarding school, but where institutions of that\nthat kind are not always available where there are Indian children to educate, it seems unreasonable to maintain this opposition to the day school which in so many cases is the only means within reach, and Indian parents want their children at home with them while they are being educated in day schools, as well as white parents.\n\nA difficulty often connected with the day school is to find living accommodations for the teacher where the services of white teachers will have to be depended upon, and there will be some difficulty of that kind in a school at Siwash Creek where there is no white habitation near enough in which a white teacher could board; but no difficulty of that kind would be experienced either for the Spallumcheen Indians at Enderby or for the reserve at Penticton. In this connection also it is desirable where possible, but not essential, that the teacher should have knowledge of the Indian language, and it is singular that the boarding schools for Indian girls in some of the other Agencies do not seem to turn out Indian girl teachers.\n\nAfter all the main thing requisite in all these Indian communities where reactionary tendencies on the part of the older members of the band, sets them against schools of any kind, is a firm hand for compulsory education. It is a mistake to allow a group of reactionary Indians in any band to dominate the situation and deprive Indian children of the education they should have. Also, if the church is to be entrusted with Indian education, it is desirable that its educational policy be sufficiently elastic to embrace day schools where industrial or boarding schools are clearly unattainable. There are instances where Indian day schools are doing excellent work in Agencies where there are industrial schools as well.\nThe Indian day school at Boothroyd in the Lytton Agency is a notable example, and the interest taken by Indian parents in the education of their children in that case, is most marked. Compulsory education was necessary at one time among the whites and is still provided for by statute, although it is now rarely necessary to employ it. From the attitude maintained by these bands in the Okanagan Agency towards education of their children, there should be no hesitation about putting in force compulsory education in Indian communities like Enderby, Head of the Lake and Penticton, where there appears to be no other way of obtaining education for these children.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nOKANAGAN AGENCY\nMONTHLY REPORT FOR JULY, 1920.\nINDIAN AGENT Ball, VERNON, B. C.\n\nThe head of the Lake Reserve which only receives a visit from the priest two or three times a year, and where no children attend school, is badly in need of education, and will need first attention. The standard of morals there is the lowest in this agency and is a by-word among the Indians of other reserves. Here the young chief, about twenty-five years old with several children, says \"no school will be allowed on the reserve and no children will go to school\" as it spoils Indians to educate them. If this is the attitude of the chief it is easy to understand the state of the remainder. Schools being closed during July no report is made this month.\n\nFred. J. Ball\nIndian Agent\nSir,\n\nI beg to bring to the Department's attention the matter of building a day school on the Okanagan Reserve No. 1. There is only one school in this Agency at present, it being on the Inkhameep Reserve at Osoyoos where there are only seven pupils attending.\n\nOn the Okanagan Reserve there are over 50 children of school age who could attend a school at a central point, and having looked the situation over very carefully, I find that 6-Mile creek would be the best location although another school will be necessary at the Head-of-the-Lake later on.\n\nThe cost of the school and teacher's house would not exceed $3000 as the lumber is easily obtained at present on account of a saw-mill being in operation on the Reserve. The difficulty of finding a suitable place for a teacher to live would be overcome as there are white people living near this locality at 6-Mile creek. There are several families of the better class of Indians living around there, and they are anxious for the School now.\n\nOn account of the distance from the nearest public school there are no children on this reserve attending, and a school is therefore an absolute necessity.\n\nYour advice and instructions in this matter are respectfully requested as soon as possible, so that early action can be taken.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst Deputy & Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of the 6th August last regarding the establishment of a day school on the Okanagan Reserve No. 1. This matter has been considered by the Deputy Superintendent General and it has been decided to act upon your recommendation. It will be some little time before plans and specifications can be prepared. In the meantime I shall be glad to have any suggestions that you can offer as to the kind of building that should be put up, the accommodation that ought to be provided and to know whether building operations might be conducted during the winter months.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. J. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B. C.\nOTTAWA, APRIL 26TH, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo, with reference to arranging temporary accommodation for the purpose of providing educational facilities for the children of school age on the Penticton and Okanagan Reserves.\n\nIn reply I beg to say, with reference to Penticton, that it is noted the Band desire to use the priest's house as a temporary school and that you consider it would be satisfactory for the purpose until such time as a new day school building can be erected.\n\nIt is also noted that you are advertising for a teacher, and that it will be necessary for this Department to supply 30 desks and the school material required. If you are able to obtain the services of a suitable teacher and can arrange with the priest for the use of his house on the Reserve, you may arrange to have it fitted up for school purposes.\n\nRegarding the desks required, it is noted that you consider 30 will be needed. These desks, if purchased now, could be used when the new day school is erected. The Department will approve of the purchase of the number of desks considered necessary by you. You should be careful to ascertain the probable attendance and only that quantity of desks required shall be purchased. It is noted in former communications that you state it would be necessary to arrange for temporary accommodation for 25 or 30 pupils of the Penticton Band and if this is all that would be likely to attend it will not be necessary to obtain desks for a larger number. We will leave this matter in your hands, and expect that there will be no unnecessary desks ordered.\n\nIt will be necessary, in compliance with the requirements of the Purchasing Commission of Canada, to obtain competitive prices before making the purchase of these desks. They have directed us to authorize you to submit quotations from the following firms, in addition to any others you wish, viz:\n\nE. N. Moyar Co., Ltd.,\n13167 - 10th St., Edmonton, Alta.\n\nG. Parnell,\n567 Hamilton St., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nClarke & Stuart Co., Ltd.,\n550 Seymour St., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nIn asking for quotations, you should state that the desks required are \"Single Silent Sanitary Desks,\" \"OR EQUALS.\" The contract should be given to the firm from whom you obtain the lowest price.\n\nF. J. C. Bell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\n\n- Properly -\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6405, File 833-1, part 1)\nProperly certified accounts, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred, together with a memorandum showing the names of the firms asked to quote a price and the prices quoted, should be forwarded to the Department when payment will be made.\n\nYou will be careful to obtain these desks in the sizes and quantities of each size required.\n\nRegarding the teacher, you should submit for the consideration of the Department the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher secured by you. If a properly qualified teacher is secured, we would be prepared to pay a salary at the rate of $850 per annum, plus any bonus provided by law.\n\nWe will provide a blackboard, school books, stationery etc., as soon as a teacher is secured and a requisition forwarded for the school material required. The size of the blackboard should be given, both length and width of same.\n\nI will be pleased if, at a later date, you will inform me as to the amount of rent, if any, that will be charged for the use of the priest's house during the time it is used for temporary school purposes.\n\nRegarding a school for the Okanagan Reserve, it is noted that it is difficult to find a suitable building in which to carry on the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActg. Deputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, Nov. 13, 1922.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received your letter of the 4th instant, enclosing a resolution of certain members of the Okanagan Reserve No. 1 Indian Band, relative to the erection of a building to be known as the Okanagan Indian Day School. I have noted that five members of the band have protested on the grounds that they do not wish to incur this expense until such time as the major B. C. Indian problems have been solved.\n\nI wish to assure you and your clients that the present intention is to meet all initial and current expenses in connection with the Okanagan Day School from parliamentary appropriation. $4,500 has already been provided in the Vote for Indian Education for the purpose of erecting a building.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent General.\n\nAlec D. Macintyre, Esq.,\nBank of Hamilton Building,\nKamloops, B. C.\nOttawa, Nov. 13, 1922.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have to inform you that certain members of the Okanagan Reserve No. 1 Indian Band have protested, through a lawyer in Kamloops, regarding the building of the Indian day school, on the grounds that they do not wish to incur this expense at the present time. You might assure Chief Alexander Jimmie Joseph and any other members of the band you meet that it is the present intention to meet all initial and current expenses in connection with the Okanagan Day School from parliamentary appropriation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B. C.\nNovember 13, 1922.\n\nMemo for File:\n\nIndian Education Vote 1921-22 provided for the Okanagan Indian Day School, but the building was never erected. Indian Education Vote 1922-23 provided for Salmon River and Penticton Indian Day Schools - neither of these schools will be built, but the money voted for the Salmon River School is being used for the Okanagan School. These last mentioned day schools are situated close together and have been confused on the files - thus the indecision regarding building.\n\nThe File Numbers are: Okanagan 164-5, Penticton 164-10, Salmon River 552462.\nThe Okanagan school building is well under way, the concrete work being completed. One of the Indians, Gasto Louie, went to the school site when building operations were commenced and attempted to prevent work going on. I thought it best to attend to him right away and went over there at once and gave him distinctly to understand that any interference with the building would be severely dealt with. I have had no complaints since from the contractors. The Mounted Police also saw him after his attempt and I think in future his opposition to the school will take the form of letters to the Department. I understand that he has a coterie who have been signing a petition about this school, but other Indians have come in recently and said that they are satisfied to see it on the Reserve and have taken their names off the petition. The instigator of this is Jimmie Antoine, an Indian who was educated at the Kamloops Industrial School and apparently wishes to deprive every other Indian of the same advantage. He is opposing the school whereas he was one of the appointees to the Allied Tribes Association meeting at Vancouver, although, I believe, he got lost in North Vancouver and did not attend the meeting with the Minister of the Interior. I cannot quite follow this man's reasoning as I believe the Allied Tribes were asking for better educational facilities for Indians so apparently he is trying to curry favour with both ends on the Reserve with a view to being elected chief whenever such an election is held.\nSecret & Confidential.\n\nThe Officer Commanding,\nWest Kootenay Sub-District,\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police,\nGrand Forks, B.C.\n\nSir,\n\nRE: DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS.\nRe: School, Okanagan Indian Reserve,\nnear Vernon, B.C.\n\nI have the honour to report on instructions received from the H.C.O. in charge Penticton Detachment, I patrolled to the Okanagan Indian Reserve near Vernon, B.C., on the 20th Inst.\n\nThere is a school being built on the Okanagan Indian Reserve, near Whitman's Creek on the upper Okanagan lake, and some of the members of this Band are opposed to the school being built on the Reserve, the reason for this is that they do not want their children educated.\n\nWhen Mr. W. Buckland and his men started building this school, an Indian from this Reserve named Gaston Leulie went to where they were working and told them to get off the Reserve, when he saw that they were not going to pay any attention to him, he said he would move them off, Gaston Leulie then went away and has not bothered them since.\n\nOn Monday Oct. 23rd, I saw Mr. Ball Indian Agent and decided to give this Indian Gaston Leulie a good talking too which I did.\n\nI do not think this Indian or any of the others will try to interfere with these men building the School.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.E.

Charles Stewart, M.P.,\nSuperintendent General Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am greatly obliged by your communication of the 13th instant re the Okanagan Day School for which an appropriation of $4500 has been provided by the Dominion Government.\n\nI note the expression in your letter of \"five members of the Band have protested\". The word \"five\" is, I suppose, a clerical error because nearly the whole Band to the number of twenty five subscribed to the protest, the original of which I mailed to you. Five of the members, however, travelled all the way from the Head-o-the-Lake to my office, some seventy miles, to instruct me to lodge this protest.\n\nI have forwarded a copy of your letter to the Chairman of the Indian Meeting. I assure you that it will give the Band the utmost satisfaction.\nHon. Charles Stewart, M.P. . . . . . .\n\nI ask you to note also the stupid and needless irritation caused by Inspector McGraw in withholding from the Indians the information which you have kindly given. This particular Band is made up of Indians of decidedly average intelligence. They reside within a few miles of the town of Vernon, in the heart of the Okanagan Valley, and, having known them and their affairs for 23 years, I am in a position to say that until the appointment of McGraw there has been comparatively no friction whatever between them and the local Indian agents.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAlex Macintosh\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise that I am experiencing some difficulty in obtaining the services of a teacher for the new Okanagan Indian Day School. Advertisements were placed with the leading papers both in this Valley and at the Coast, but only three replies were received from Roman Catholics; one of these applicants required nearly twice the salary offered, one was from a youth without any experience in teaching and the third appeared to be suitable in every way, judging from the references given, but after delaying for two weeks her decision as to accepting the position, I have just received a wire refusing it. I am therefore writing to inquire whether it is imperative that the teacher of this Day School should be of the same religious denomination as the Band, even though the school is undenominational. None of the Indians object to a Protestant teacher. They say they will be satisfied with any teacher selected for them.\n\nAs neither councillor or chief have made any regulations or desire to make any in regard to this matter, I presume the school does not come under Sections 97 (2) and 194 of the Indian Act. A teacher from the St. George's Industrial School, Lytton, has applied for the position, she is an Anglican and as her services will not be required after this year on account of her class at that school being abolished, she would be available.\n\nMay I be advised by wire please as to whether there is any objection to the Lytton teacher being engaged, if her references are satisfactory and Mr. Lett will recommend her? If a Roman Catholic teacher can be found, of course she will be given preference, but I do\nnot want to be without a teacher when the school is ready to be opened after the holidays, and every effort has been made to locate one.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nDecember 21st, 1922.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Hon. the Superintendent General has transferred to me your letter of the 4th November, acknowledging a communication of the 13th November with reference to the Okanagan day school.

MacIntyre, Esq.,\nbarrister, etc.,\nBank of Hamilton Building,\nKamloops, B.C.\nDecember 9, 1922.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Featherston,\n\nI am somewhat averse to preparing a letter for the Minister's signature to this man Macintyre. He is a personal enemy of Inspector Megraw, and in league with the worst elements on our reserves in the Okanagan agency. The day school is being erected without objection, and everything is going well, and I should like to be able to simply acknowledge this letter myself instead of having the Minister write him. However, if it is thought advisable to do so, I will prepare a letter.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOTTAWA, December 29th, 1922.\n\nF. J. C.

D. McLean.\nOttawa, Dec. 29, 1922.\n\nSIR:-\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant, advising the Department as to the difficulty of obtaining the services of a Catholic teacher for the new Okanagan Indian Day School, and requesting to be informed as to whether you might engage a Protestant teacher from the Lytton Industrial School.\n\nIn reply I beg to confirm the following night telegram to you of today's date:-\n\n\"Telegraph Rev. John Welch, Fifty-nine Blackwood Street, New Westminster, that only applicant for Okanagan Indian Day School is Protestant and as Indians there are Roman Catholic, you would like either a nomination from him or his concurrence to employ teacher from Lytton Industrial School.\"\n\nProviding the Roman Catholic Church authorities have no objection to the engaging of a Protestant teacher, you may do so. Although this school is to be charged as underdenominational, yet the Indians for whom it will provide educational facilities are Roman Catholic and it might be advisable - in order to prevent any friction - to obtain a teacher of that faith in the future, if possible. If Father Welch, who takes a direct interest in the work of the Roman Catholic schools in British Columbia, is satisfied at the present time with the engaging of the teacher from the Lytton Industrial School, we will confirm the appointment.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform the Department later as to the action taken and also give the name of the teacher, qualifications and salary as well as the date the school opened.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6405, File 833-1, part 1)\nSir \u2014 \n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, also night telegram of the same date with reference to teacher for the Okanagan Indian Day School. I took this up with the Rev. John Welch who wrote to me to defer the opening of the school until he could secure a teacher. He has nominated a man who has a family, but as he has had no qualifications as a teacher, having been employed on a newspaper previously, I advised him that this man could not be accepted as the Indians of the Okanagan Reserve are strongly advising the securing of a woman teacher on account of the ages of the children who will be attending.\n\nAs Rev. John Welch apparently objects to the Lytton Industrial School teacher being employed even temporarily, I am endeavouring to secure the services of Mr. and Mrs. Marsden who have been teaching a Roman Catholic School in another Agency and believe they will be able to arrive here next week. As these people are Roman Catholic there will be no objection from any quarter.\n\nAs soon as possible I will forward the full name of the teacher and qualifications, etc., for your approval. I presume the salary will be as stated previously, $850.00 per annum.\n\nRev. John Welch requests me to apply to the\nDepartment for the teacher's fare from Vancouver to Vernon, but as a previous similar request was refused, I am not making application for the same unless advised further by the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSIR,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.S.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOTTAWA, January 12, 1925.\n\nF.

D. McLean.\n\nChg. Dept. I.A.\nOTTAWA, January 12, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, regarding the obtaining of a teacher for the Okanagan Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say we note that the Rev. Father Welch objects to the employing of the teacher from the Lytton Industrial School, and, also, that the teacher nominated by him is not satisfactory. We further note that you are endeavouring to secure the services of Mr. and Mrs. Marsden, who are at present teacher and field matron, respectively, at the Homalco Indian Day School in the Vancouver Agency.\n\nIn this connection, I beg to confirm our night lettergram to you of yesterday's date:\n\n\"If Mr. and Mrs. Marsden transferred from present positions to Okanagan school the services of former only will be paid for at rate of $850 per annum. Field matron not required and salary cannot therefore be paid Mrs. Marsden\".\n\nI may say that Mr. Marsden is in receipt of salary at the rate of $800 per annum as teacher of the Homalco school, while his wife is paid at the rate of $40.00 per month for her services as field matron. Besides this, they have both received bonus as provided by law. We have had no intimation that it is their intention to give up duties at this school, and, as stated in our night lettergram, if they are transferred to the Okanagan school, we would only require the services of Mr. Marsden. It would be necessary, before a field matron could be appointed, to have the position created by the Civil Service Commission. We do not intend to appoint a field matron at Okanagan and, therefore, you will observe, if both the above named are transferred to take charge of the Okanagan school, that it would be at a considerable pecuniary loss to them. We consider that it would be advisable for them to remain in their present positions. However, it is noted that you expect them to arrive during the present week, and if so, we would approve of the appointment of Mr. Marsden as teacher, but we do not require the services of his wife as field matron, and cannot allow her salary.\n\nI may say, further, that we do not pay travelling expenses of teachers and cannot, therefore, arrange to pay any part of the expenses of the above named from their present school to the Okanagan school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. J. C. Hall, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 12th instant with reference to teacher for the Okanagan Indian Day School and with reference to night lettergram, it was understood that no Field Matron would be appointed for this Agency if Mr. and Mrs. Marsden transferred.\n\nI understand from Chief Inspector Ditchburn and Inspector Cairns that the Marsdens are anxious to leave the Homalco District on account of Mr. Marsden's health, and I asked Mr. Cairns to explain that if they came to the Okanagan School there would be no field matron position open nor would one be created for them. They were also advised that they would be expected to pay their own expenses when transferring from Homalco to Okanagan.\n\nI have received a telegram from Mr. Cairns stating that they would arrive on February 1st so apparently they are willing to forego the extra wages for the sake of transferring to this district.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\nOkanagan Day School plans do not provide heating in living quarters stop Marsdens have arrived but cannot live in the building without heating I have ordered furnace and have forwarded full report in explanation of this action\n\nF J Rall\nIndian Agent\n\nUSE OUR DIRECT ALL-CANADA SERVICE TO VANCOUVER, VICTORIA AND BRITISH COLUMBIA POINTS\nA meeting of the Okanagan Band was held on the 30th at their request. This is the most difficult Band in the agency to handle, and the one I have tried to do most for. They have every advantage possible, the best land, most irrigation, ample grazing and timber lands, and fishing; in fact the Okanagan Reserve No. 1 is in my opinion the ideal reserve, yet the Indians on it are the most dissatisfied and quarrelsome Band in the Agency. If they would not listen to a few low-down white people who are always ribbing them up, they would be further ahead. They are continually getting up petitions and round robins keeping all the members unsettled who do want to work and make something of their lives. At the last meeting they were protesting about having a school at all as \"Indians don't need education.\" At this meeting they were led by Jimmie Antoine in protest against the location of the school. Of course there are a number of good, sound hard-working Indians who strongly disapprove of all this agitation by Jimmie Antoine and his clique but their voices are seldom heard at the meetings. One old man, Komasket, who lives on the best farm in the Reserve said after the meeting, \"We know Antoine, you know Antoine, that's enough. The peculiar thing about him is that he attended school at Kamloops but opposes others attending. I understand a petition will shortly be forwarded about the school and am told the writer is R. Gillespie, of Vernon, who rented the Antoine Estate, but is in default with rental and is a continual source of annoyance to this office.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Marsden arrived on the 26th. Mr. Marsden is teacher at the new school on Okanagan Reserve. They appear to be capable people and I feel sure the school will be in good hands. Owing to an oversight in the plans, no provision was made for heating the residential quarters and a furnace had to be provided before they could occupy same. While our Okanagan climate is mildly advertised, we still require heating in the houses during the short cold snaps when the temperature drops ten to fifteen below zero.\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise that Mr. W.E. Maraden arrived on the 26th ultimo accompanied by his wife, to commence his duties as teacher at the Okanagan Indian Day School.\n\nHe has applied to me for his travelling expenses and mentioned also if I made an application for a field matron on this Reserve, the position would be created.\n\nHe said although Mr. Cairns did not make any definite statement, he certainly left him under this impression. I have informed Mr. Maraden that I cannot apply for his expenses or for a position to be created for Mrs. Maraden and read him that portion of your letter dated January 12th, File 164-5-1 referring to this matter. So that there could be no misunderstanding with Mr. Maraden before he left Vancouver, I wrote Mr. Cairns January 22nd as follows:\n\n\"I have again been advised by the Department that there is no position open for Field Matron in this Agency, neither will one be created for Mrs. Maraden, and that they will not pay travelling expenses of teachers from one agency to another. I trust you will be good enough to explain this to Mr. and Mrs. Maraden if it has not already been done. I am glad they have decided to come here, as the school has been ready for occupancy for a month.\n\nIn face of this letter I fail to see where there could be any doubt in Mr. Cairn's mind, and exactly the same situation arose in the case of Miss Helen Coughlan, at Penticton. These misunderstandings cause unpleasantness which can well be avoided, and I am afraid both Miss Coughlan and Mr. Maraden feel that I am personally responsible for non-payment of their expenses and other favours.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Marsden arrived on the 26th ultimo to commence duties as teacher of the Okanagan Indian Day School.\n\nRegarding the teacher's request that his wife be appointed field matron, I beg to say that as you have already been informed we do not intend to appoint a field matron at Okanagan. We note that you have advised both the teacher and Mr. Inspector Cairns accordingly.\n\nRegarding the payment of travelling expenses of teachers, I beg to say that a communication has been directed to Mr. Inspector Cairns informing him that the Department does not pay travelling expenses of teachers to and from their schools unless in very exceptional cases where they are travelling to remote points, and in such cases the approval of the Department is first obtained.\n\nWe shall be pleased if you will give Mr. Marsden any assistance you can in his work at this school, and use your influence with the Indians to encourage a regular attendance of the children of school age.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nFred J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith four day school reports from this Agency; one of them, the Westbank School, being for four Indians attending at Westbank Ferry Public School.\n\nThese reports show fifty children now receiving an education and there are twenty-two others scattered around the various public and residential schools who do not show on any of these reports. I hope it will be possible in the near future to have schools available for all the Indian children in this Agency. Those who are attending show a remarkable keenness and one of the teachers informs me that the children arrive as early as 7.30 in the morning and, if allowed, are sometimes in the school room after nine at night, and made a request that they do not close the school for Easter holidays. The teachers also report that they are having no trouble with discipline, the elder children keeping the younger ones in order voluntarily. Some of the work done in the short time two of the schools have been open is remarkably good.\n\nThere is opposition to the schools on the Reserves among the older Indians, but this seems to be lessening weekly. On the other hand many of the parents have come to the office specially to express their gratification to the Department for starting the schools.\n\nAt Penticton, I hope the new school will be\n(2)\n\ncommenced shortly as it is over-crowded.\n\nI am enclosing a few specimens of hand-writing of children who six months ago knew absolutely nothing.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, April 20th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, enclosing the March quarter returns of the day schools in the Okanagan Agency.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we are pleased to note there has been a good attendance and that the Indians are taking advantage of the facilities provided for the education of their children. We note that good work has been done by the pupils, and that the opposition on the part of the Indians against the schools is gradually dying out.\n\nThe specimens of writing which you forwarded have been examined with interest, and we hope that the general interest and progress will keep up.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Marsden, teacher of the Okanagan Indian Day School, found it necessary to proceed to Vancouver to consult medical advisers regarding an operation. He was advised by them that the operation was so serious that he should go to Mayo Brothers, for attention. He has already left with Mrs. Marsden for the East and Mrs. Marsden has requested permission to carry on with the teaching should he not be able to return when school is re-opened.\n\nMr. Marsden states in a letter to me dated June 30th that he is on his eighth year with the Department as a teacher and considers himself entitled by now to the maximum salary. Mr. Marsden's services have been satisfactory whilst teacher of the Okanagan Indian Day School since January, 1927. Previous to his appointment to this school, he was teacher of Church-house School, Komako Indian Reserve.\n\nMrs. Marsden has applied for payment as janitoress of the school. I would respectfully recommend that this be paid. The school is a large one and requires much work in keeping it clean.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.G.Fall]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, August 3, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo, informing the Department that Mr. Wm. Marsden, Teacher of the Okanagan Indian Day School, has found it necessary, owing to ill health, to undergo medical treatment.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is hoped that Mr. Marsden will, in the near future, be able to resume duties as teacher of the above named school. In the meantime, the Department will approve of having Mrs. Marsden carry on the work as teacher, until her husband is able to again take up duties.\n\nWith reference to your request that Mrs. Marsden be paid for her services as caretaker of the school, I beg to say that we will allow the sum of $50 per annum for these duties, from the date upon which she began the work. We understand that Mr. and Mrs. Marsden arrived at the school on the 26th of January, last. You may forward a voucher, in duplicate, properly certified, for the salary due Mrs. Marsden as caretaker, from January 26th to June 30th.

This increase will date from the first instant and is allowed in view of the favourable reports of yourself and Mr. Agent Bell, regarding the services of Mr. Marsden in the classroom.

C.\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI am sending you a request through the Indian Agent Mr. Call, to authorize Mrs. Macdonald to substitute for his husband teaching while he is absent for a time undergoing medical treatment. Mrs. Macdonald was obliged to go to Quebec City for an operation some time ago and is still obliged to return to the hospital occasionally for further and more complete treatment.\n\nMrs. Macdonald has a complete common school education in England; a teacher's certificate or normal training for lower grades, not as principal or matron; she taught four years in England schools, one year in Winnipeg private school, and was matron in an Indian Boarding School in Saskatchewan. When Macdonald she was five months in Diamond Creek area and at Church House three years. Now at Six Mile Creek in the & Savage she is helping and in close touch with the teaching.\n\nHoping this request will receive your earliest convenient attention and thanking you in advance for it,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJames Macdonald\n\nMr. Russell & Ferrier,\nDir. of Ind. Education,\nClergy,\nOnt.\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from Reverend James McGuire, O.M.I., at Kamloops.\n\nI do not quite understand why this request should come through Father McGuire as the Marsdens are not in his district or under his jurisdiction in any way.\n\nMr. Marsden is teacher of the Okanagan Indian Day School and his services have been satisfactory. Last year, Mr. and Mrs. Marsden went to Rochester, Minn., during the holidays so that Mr. Marsden could receive medical attention from Mayo Bros. Mrs. Marsden returned to Vernon just before school re-opened and requested permission to carry on until Mr. Marsden returned and authority was requested and given for such arrangement.\n\nIf Mr. Marsden finds it necessary to stay this year longer than the usual leave, I presume it will be in order for the same arrangement to be made without any special appointment being given to Mrs. Marsden.\n\nWhile Mr. Marsden's services have been satisfactory, his wife seems to have an infinite capacity for making trouble on the Reserve.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nOTTAWA.\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 27, 1924.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant, with reference to allowing Mrs. Marsden to teach the Okanagan Indian Day School if Mr. Marsden finds it necessary to remain in Rochester for a longer period than the usual summer holidays.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of this arrangement this year. The returns should, of course, be signed by Mr. Marsden. Please inform him accordingly and you should intimate to him that requests of this nature should be forwarded direct to the Indian agent's office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. B. McLean,\nAsst.

FATHER MCGUIRE.\n\n---\n\nHowever, I do not see the necessity of appointing Mrs. Marsden teacher during Mr. Marsden's absence. Last year, while Mr. Marsden was attending hospital, it was arranged for Mrs. Marsden to carry on with the work in his place and no special appointment was made.\n\nMr. Marsden's work has been quite satisfactory at the school, but Mrs. Marsden is inclined to cause trouble and unpleasantness and for this reason I would not care to have her appointed as teacher. I hope, however, that Mr. Marsden will regain his health and be able to stay on indefinitely.\n\nI thank you for the interest you have taken in our little school and hope everything is progressing well with the Kamloops one.\n\n------ ------\nOttawa, May 30, 1924.\n\nDear Father McGuire:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, enclosing a communication from Mr. Indian agent Hall to you with reference to the teaching services at the Okanagan Indian Day School. I am returning Mr. Hall's letter and wish to explain that on the 27th instant he was informed that the Department would approve of Mrs. Marsden substituting for her husband for a brief period this summer. We have requested that the quarterly school returns should be signed by Mr. Marsden and the salary cheques will, of course, be made out in his favour. In cases like this the Department does not consider it advisable to make a formal appointment of the wife who is substituting for a week or two.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T.

After reading and copying it, you will oblige me by having it returned.\n\nFor the letter I have no commentary.\n\nWe don't want boys and girls shaking loose in Catholic schools, and among Catholic Indians. We expect that you and Mr. Cairns will see that this special appointment is given in writing.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJames McQuire O.M.I.\n\nMr. Russell T.

(RG 10, Volume 6405, File 833-1, part 1)\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nIn reply to your letter concerning Mrs. Marsden, I wish to say that I have Mr. McGeary sign the quarterly school returns and to have the census made out in his name, as quite satisfactory and naturally what I would expect, as it is natural likewise to suppose he will do the teaching save when absent for medical treatment.\n\nHowever, I wish you to shut a door, and you are not shutting it. \"The Department\" would allow of Mrs. Marsden substituting for her husband for a brief period. (How long? This summer; simply June, July and August?)\n\nNow, Mr. Ferrier, will you be kind enough to read sufficiently through those letters sent to you to realise that my request is: That Mrs. Marsden be authorized to substitute for her husband when he is obliged to undergo medical treatment?\n\nHoping you may grasp my viewpoint without further explanation.\n\nI remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\nJames McQuire, M.M.S.\n\nMr. Russell T.

Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, regarding the arrangements for teaching service at the Okanagan Indian Day School during the absence of Mr. Marsden for medical treatment and enclosing a communication from him regarding the matter.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Marsden may arrange his departure at as early a date as he desires, and his wife may take up duties from the date he leaves. If Mr. Marsden has not completed his treatment by the last of September, Mrs. Marsden may re-open the school and teach until the end of September next. Should it be necessary for Mr. Marsden to have further leave, we will request our Agent to so inform the Department, when consideration will be given to continuing arrangements whereby Mr. Marsden is to act as substitute. It is hoped that Mr. Marsden will be able to resume duties by the end of September, at the latest.\n\nThe letter which you enclosed from Mr. Marsden is returned herewith as requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. James MacKenzie, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal, Indian Res. School,\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa, June 16th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nA communication has been received from Rev. Father McGuire, Kamloops, enclosing a letter which he received from Mr. Wm. Marsden, teacher of the Okanagan Indian Day School, regarding the period of leave that will be granted him to take medical treatment and the carrying on of the work by Mrs. Marsden during his absence.\n\nWe are informing Father McGuire that Mr. Marsden may leave as soon as he desires and that Mrs. Marsden is to carry on during his absence. If he has not returned when the school re-opens after the summer holidays, Mrs. Marsden may teach during the month of September. If it is found that Mr. Marsden is unable to take up duties by the 1st of October, the fact should be drawn to the attention of the Department, in order that consideration may then be given to the continuing of the above arrangement. We hope, however, that Mr. Marsden's health will have sufficiently improved for him to resume duties by the 1st of October, next.\n\nYou should inform the Marsdens that all communications regarding matters connected with the school should be forwarded to the Department through your office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\nSir,\n\nFile 164-7-1\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th instant and to inform you that Mr Wm. Marsden called here yesterday saying he was leaving for Vancouver for medical treatment and would probably go direct from there to Rochester Minn. for treatment. This was the first intimation I received that he was leaving the school and he mentioned having arranged it with Father McGuire! Why with him, I am unable to say. Mr Marsden is a good teacher and I hope he returns in good health to his duties. On account of his unfortunate illness, I have been very careful in avoiding even the slightest trouble with him, and have tried to make conditions at the School as pleasant as possible for him.\n\nHe has intimated to me on more than one occasion that I have nothing to do with the School and that he takes his instructions from the priest. I notice however, when he wants anything,\nhe applies to me for it, so he seems rather mixed in his ideas.\n\nProvided the school maintains its present high standard, I overlook Mr. Marsden's peculiarities, but am glad to receive the information contained in the last paragraph of your letter, which will be communicated to him.\n\nWhile inspecting the three schools in this Agency last week, School Inspector Mr. R.H. Cairns told me that the Penticton and Okanagan Indian Day Schools were the best day schools in the Province and the standard attained was equal to other schools of ten years standing; these schools are only 1\u00bd and 2 years old.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[F.J.C. Ball]\nIndian Agent\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nPenticton and Okanagan Bay Schools were visited during this month, where progress is being maintained. The discipline is good in both schools and the children very keen.\n\nIt is much regretted that there is still opposition to the schools among certain of the Bands, these being the trouble-makers referred to above. They have the effrontery to tell the Bands that they have been supported in this opposition by the authorities at Ottawa! As an example of the way they try to mislead the more ignorant Indians, two of them sent a letter to His Excellency the Governor General. The reply they received was merely an acknowledgment by the Governor General's Secretary, but was read to them as \"appointin Baptistie Chief, and boss of all the Indian lands\" (Baptiste being one of the trouble-makers). It can be easily understood how they belittle some of the Indians, and I am continually being called upon to refute absurd statements which they make, but as soon as one ghost is laid they scare up another equally absurd. Of course the majority pay little attention to the agitators and these Indians are seldom heard from, but the minority make a great deal of unpleasantness and noise out of all proportion to their numbers. However, the idle season is over and they will now settle down to work for another season and will not have so much spare time on their hands to employ in stirring up discontent.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n(Sgd.) F. J. C. Ball,\nIndian Agent.\nVernon, B.C.\n\nOct. 12th., 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nAt the Okanagan School the cause of the poor attendance since the school reopened in September is on account of the Indians being absent in the orchards picking apples at which time the children are almost as capable as their parents and some of the families make very good wages. It would be advisable at the Okanagan School to make the holidays somewhat later than at present if this could be arranged, and I will take up this matter further.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.J.C. Ball\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAJCB/33\nOKANAGAN AGENCY\n\nMONTHLY REPORT FOR SEPTEMBER, 1926.\n\nI visited the three day schools in the Agency during September. At Osoyoos there is a full attendance but the Okanagan attendance is affected because so many families are away picking apples. Next week should see an improvement and the question of a change in the vacation period at the schools will be taken up before next year. The holidays commence and finish too early in the year to suit the Indian mode of life. At Penticton the school is temporarily at a standstill until their difficulties mentioned above are disposed of.\n\nF.J.C. Ball,\nIndian agent.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report that Mr. William Lawson, teacher of Okanagan Day School, Okanagan Indian Reserve No. 1, has been ill in hospital for three months or more. He was admitted to the Victoria General Hospital, Vancouver, during the school holidays and remained there until he was able to resume his duties but found it impossible to do so and has been ordered back to Vancouver again, where the lower altitude may benefit him. I understand he has been teaching in various Indian schools for twenty years, the last four and a half being at the Okanagan Day School, where he has been quite successful. Mr. Lawson was formerly a field agent of the Coast, but gave up that position when they came to the Okanagan.\n\nEvery year, during the holidays, Mr. Lawson has spent most of the two months in hospital. Last year, while going to Mayo Brothers, Rochester, last year's doctor, Dr. Lee, Lawson was in hospital six weeks. This time, Mr. Lawson being pointed upon for a specialist. I do not know whether you are aware of Mr. Lawson's condition, but he has been treated for several months by a surgeon of the bladder, having had treatment at Rochester for two years in succession.\n\nBoth Mr. and Mrs. Lawson have been most conscientious in connection with the school and have taken a keen interest in the children. Mr. Lawson was formerly an architect and is very fine man. I consider it very unfortunate that he is sick as teacher, on account of his own sickness and his considerable expense and I respectfully request that the sick leave be granted him if possible on salary, at least, aid to his wife. His services in consideration of his thirty years service.\n\nIt is rather unfortunate I did not know about this in time to secure the services of another teacher but will make every effort to do so before school opens.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSIR,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Before the expiry of that time, you should again write the Department regarding his health, and indicate when he will likely be able to resume duties. Please let me know the address to which Mr. Maraden's cheque should be sent at the end of September.\n\nThe name and qualifications of the substitute teacher that you secure should be forwarded for the approval of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nFJCB:C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to place before you the following circumstances with reference to the school on Okanagan Indian Reserve No.1. This Reserve is a narrow one, but is seventeen miles long, so that it was impossible to place the school where it would be within walking distance of all the children on the Reserve, consequently some of them have been unable to attend. Recently a number of parents who have opposed the school in every way have advised me that if the children are taken to school they will be agreeable to it. There are now twelve children ready to attend if transportation is provided.\n\nI have looked carefully into the matter and can make arrangements for a car to do this work for $60.00 per month. The distance for the trip is 36 miles per day, so that for a 21 day month it would figure at about 7\u00bd cents per mile, the person taking the contract paying all running expenses and providing the car.\n\nAs there is no possibility of persuading the parents to send these children to a residential school, it would be most advisable to have them attend the Day School on the Reserve now that opposition to the school is weakening among those who have hitherto done everything they could to close it.\n\nIf the Department will give this favourable consideration I respectfully request advice by wire so that a commencement can be made by May 1st.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nFJCB:O.\nOttawa, May 1, 1928.\n\nF.

I note that arrangements can be made for an automobile for this work at a total cost of $60 per month, and in reply, I wish to confirm my telegram of today's date, as follows:-\n\n\"Your letter twenty-third. May arrange transportation Okanagan school children.\"\n\nThe Department considers this activity worth while, as long as the average attendance of those pupils who are being transported continues high. You should inform the parents that the Department expects an average of at least ten per day, and, in the event that this mark is not reached regularly, if there is no illness or other sufficient reason, that you will be forced to recommend to the Department that the car be taken off the route. When I write an average of ten, I mean independent of those that are already in attendance at this school.

C.\nChamplain Indian Day School,\nVernon, B.C.\nMay 16th, 1923.\n\nF.J.C.Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of another of your uncalled for and extraordinary letters dated the 14th inst.\n\nI suppose it gives you some sort of satisfaction to have these defamatory epistles - questioning my ability of running the school - on file. Had you taken your own advice \"talebearing be not accepted as proof of guilt\" - to wit, - and had you had the courtesy to come to the school and investigate for yourself, before giving expression to the statements your letter contains, you would have found:\n\nFirst - There had been no child dismissed from the school.\nSecond - No one has been unjustly accused.\nThird - No one is punished through talebearing nor is talebearing tolerated.\nFourth - This boy Ned Louis, whom you state is not fifteen years of age, was entered in the school register on February 1st, 1923 as eleven years of age - said age being supplied to me by his own parent when he was brought to school on that date. Ned Louis is now over sixteen years of age.\n\nNed Louis was never dismissed from this school, but when in class, he was insolent and insubordinate. I warned him, that he would have to leave the school if he did not behave himself better and he was too over age. He thereupon walked out of the school in the middle of the class, feeling quite sure of the support of his parents for his action. However, he returned the next day, and I punished him by keeping him in his schoolroom during recess to write an imposition. Since then, the mother has kept both her boys away from the school.\n\nThe accusations:- None have been made, but owing to Ned Louis' immoral conduct in front of the school windows, so public - no investigation was at all necessary. I, as teacher, with the welfare of the school children at heart, presume I have the right to keep such a boy off the playground without being subject to any officious interference.\n\nI may say, on our return from our leave of absence, we have had some anxious weeks with the children, as their conduct has become so loose. In this connection, two mothers visited us, immediately on our return, saying they were going to take their girls away from the school, had we not returned when we did.\n\nThe parents of Ned Louis also called and complained to us, that practically all the parents of the children at the school, had visited their house, complaining of the conduct of their boy, Ned Louis, towards their children.\n\nHad you been so solicitous about the attendance of Mrs. Pierre Louis' children at the school, as you would wish...\nyour letter to infer,\u2014 why did you not ask Mrs. Louis for her reasons for keeping her two boys from school\u2014Ned Louis 63 days, Walter Louis 75 days during the six months prior to our return. You have the figures in your office.\n\nKnowing, as you do, the antagonism of Ned Louis' mother and several others, towards schools, and the mischief they are capable of making, it would certainly assist matters, if you could bring yourself to show a little loyalty towards the teacher, when they come to you with their mischievous tale-bearing, instead of taking the ground from under his feet and encouraging insubordination among the children, and unhappiness in the parents, by listening to their imaginary grievances, thereby taking all authority over the children out of the teacher's hands, as you have done on previous occasions.\n\nI should have thought, you would have seen, all the time this woman Mrs. Louis was talking, she was simply seeking an excuse to use her boys at home, as the record of their attendance should have shown you.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"William Macdonald\"\nVernon, B.C.\nMay 14th, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Marsden,\n\nI have received several complaints recently that some of the school children have been accused of wrong-doing without any proof being produced and these accusations have created a hostility to the school among those parents who intended sending their children as soon as a bus was supplied. I now have authority to start this school-bus and am arranging with the Indians at today's meeting.\n\nI have also received a complaint that Ned Louie has been refused admittance to school on account of misbehaviour, which he absolutely denies. As this boy is not yet 15 years of age he should be encouraged to attend rather than refused admittance when there is so much opposition to the school.\n\nI sincerely hope that every effort will be made to increase the attendance at the school and that tale-telling among the children is not accepted as proof of guilt without a full inquiry. No pupil can be refused admittance unless a full report of the cause of such refusal is made through this office to Ottawa.\n\nYou will realise that the morale of the Okanagan Indians is reflected in the children and no sudden changes either for better or worse can take place, but it is hoped that eventually as the present generation become members of the Band, that an improvement will be noticed among them, and the school be the biggest opportunity of helping in such improvement, but not by refusing admittance to any pupil suspected of wrong doing.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"Fredk.J.\" Ball\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nWm. Marsden, Esq.,\nOkanagan Indian Day School,\nVernon, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copies of two letters, one written by me to the teacher of Okanagan Indian Day School and the other his reply.\n\nMy letter was written in all friendliness and I was astounded to receive such an epistle from him. He apparently made several carbon copies of his letter so Mr. Cairns, School Inspector for B.C., received one. Mr. Macdonald is a sick man and physically is not fit to be teaching, but his wife, who is doubtless well known to the Department, assists him and incidentally causes practically all the unpleasantness possible in connection with the school.\n\nI have left the Macdonalds severely alone in their conduct of the school and absolutely do not know what he means by accusing me of \"officialness and interference\". I know it is their opinion that the Agent has absolutely nothing to do with the school except to attend to their numerous requests, which are unceasing. I have always done everything possible for them (which they do not appreciate and consider it is due to do) by arranging transportation for them when they come to Vernon, taking them out to the school at considerable personal inconvenience, attending to their mail and carefully forwarding it, also telegrams and cables have been delivered to them at most inconvenient times and in fact every courtesy and help has been extended to them. Personally I consider Mrs. Macdonald a great detriment to the school and a confirmed trouble maker and I sincerely hope they will find another school more suitable to their peculiarities.\n\nWith regard to the enclosed letter Mrs. Pierre Louis seems to have incurred their displeasure. As a matter of fact, Mrs. Pierre Louis had nothing to do with the complaint, it was Pierre Louis who came to my office and said he was seriously considering removing his children from the school on account of Mr. Macdonald's action towards them. Pierre Louis is far and away the best Indian in this Agency, he is absolutely truthful, honest and industrious and it was through his efforts, in spite of bitter opposition from other Indians, that the school was made possible and it is only his loyal support of education which loses him the Chiefship, the majority of the voters being opposed to the school. The complaints Pierre Louis made to me were quite rational and made without rancour or heat and were entirely regarding Mrs. Macdonald's treatment of his son, he said Mr. Macdonald allows his wife to do as she pleases with the school and I know from personal observation that this is true and it is a serious drawback as she is totally unfitted to have charge of the pupils on account of her temperament.\n\nNo one questions Mr. Macdonald's authority over the pupils and if it were not for his wife there would be no\nI now wish to call particular attention to paragraph six of the letter. This may seem much or little, but in any event it is absolute nonsense to say that the conduct of the children became loose because Harsten's were absent for some months last year. During their absence Mr. Frank Grist was employed as teacher and if Mr. Harsten is making any reflection upon his character I beg to advise that such reflections are lying, slanderous and unwarrantable. Mr. Grist is a gentleman in whom I have entire confidence; his integrity and uprightness are without question and I was extremely fortunate in obtaining his services. Mr. Grist is a Roman Catholic and it was not easy to find a teacher of that religion at short notice to fill in during Mr. Harsten's enforced absence and it is pitiful to see such statements as this in Harsten's letter. I notice two others visited them on their return saying that they were going to take their girls away etc. May I mention that many parents told me they hoped the Harstens would not return so their children were doing so much better in school and in proof of their confidence in Mr. Grist I may also add that he formed a night class for the parents who he was teaching to read and write. This I think entirely refutes any statement that the conduct of the children suffered during Mr. Harsten's absence. However, I quite expected to hear some such thing as this from Mrs. Harsten's remarks even before they had reached the school on their return and I consider Mr. Harsten should be severely censured for making any such statement without more proof than his wife's surmises.\n\nI have visited this school as seldom as possible and have never interfered in the slightest with Mr. Harsten. They are kindhearted people and I like Mr. Harsten very much, but he is completely dominated by his wife who is a most unpleasant, foolish and interfering woman and I wish to respectfully, but strongly, protest against receiving such a letter from this teacher.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nRussell T.Ferrier, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nFJCB:G.\n\nIndian Affairs.

[all Enq.],\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of another of your uncalled for and extraordinary letters dated the 14th.\n\nI suppose if gives you some sort of satisfaction to have these defamatory epistles\u2014questioning my ability of running the school\u2014on file. Had you taken your own advice, \"talebearing be not accepted as proof of guilt\"\u2014to-wit\u2014and had you had the courtesy to come to the school and investigate for yourself, before giving expression to the statements your letter contains, you would have found:\n\nFirst \u2014 There had been no child dismissed from the school.\nSecond \u2014 No one has been unjustly accused.\nThird \u2014 No one is punished through talebearing, nor is talebearing tolerated.\nFourth \u2014 This boy, Ned Louis, whom you state is not fifteen years of age, was entered in the school register on February 1st, 1923 as eleven years of age\u2014a said age being supplied to me by his own parent when he was brought to school on that date. Ned Louis is now over sixteen years of age.\n\nNed Louis was never dismissed from this school, but when in class he was insolent and insubordinate, I warned him, that he would have to leave the school if he did not behave himself better, as he was now over age. He thereupon walked out of the school in the middle of the class, feeling quite sure of the support of his parents for his action. However he returned the next day, and I punished him by keeping him in the school room during recess, to write an imposition. Since then, the mother has kept both her boys away from the school.\n\nThe accusations\u2014None have been made, but owing to Ned Louis' immoral conduct in front of the school windows... so public\u2014no investigation was at all necessary. I, as teacher, with the welfare of the school children at heart, presume I have the right to keep such a boy off the playground without being subject to any officious interference.\n\nI may say on our return from our leave of absence, we have had some anxious weeks with the children, as their conduct had become so loose. In this connection, two mothers visited us, immediately on our return, saying they were going to take their girls away from the school, had we not returned when we did.\n\nThe parents of Ned Louis also called and complained to us, that practically all the parents of the children at the school, had visited their house, complaining of the conduct of their boy, Ned Louis, towards\nCOPY.\n\nHad you been as solicitous about the attendance of Mrs Pierre Louis' children at the school, as you would wish your letter to infer,\u2014why did you not ask her the said Mrs Louis for her reasons for keeping her two boys from school\u2014Ned Louis 63 days, Walter Louis 75 days during the six months prior to our return. You have the figures in your office.\n\nKnowing as you do, the antagonism of Ned Louis' mother and several others, towards schools, and the mischief they are capable of making, it would certainly assist matters, if you could bring yourself to show a little loyalty toward the teacher, when they come to you with their mischievous tale-bearing, instead of taking the ground from under his feet and encouraging insubordination among the children, and ugliness in the parents, by listening to their imaginary grievances, thereby taking all authority over the children out of the teacher's hands, as you have done on previous occasions.\n\nI should have thought, you would have seen, all the time this woman Mrs Louis was talking, she was simply seeking an excuse to use her boys at home, as the record of their attendance should have shown you.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Signed) William Marston.\nDear Mr. Marsden,\n\nI have received several complaints recently that some of the school children have been accused of wrong-doing without any proof being produced and these accusations have created a hostility to the school among those parents who intended sending their children as soon as a school-bus was supplied. I have now authority to start by this school-bus and am arranging with the Indians at today's meeting.\n\nI have also received a complaint that Ned Louis has been refused admittance to attend school on account of misbehaviour, which he absolutely denies. As this boy is not yet 15 years of age, he should be encouraged to attend school rather than refused admittance when there is so much opposition to the school.\n\nI sincerely hope that every effort will be made to increase the attendance at the school and that tale-bearing among the children is not accepted as proof of guilt without a full inquiry. No pupil can be refused admittance unless a full report of the cause of such refusal is made through this office to Ottawa.\n\nYou will realise that the morals of the Okanagan Indians is reflected in the children and no sudden changes either for better or worse can take place, but it is hoped that eventually, as the present generation become members of the Band, that an improvement will be noticed among them, and the school has the biggest opportunity of helping in such improvement, but not by refusing admittance to any pupil suspected of wrong doing.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Signed) F.

Mrs. Marsden has given a great deal of trouble whilst on the Reserve besides quarrelling with Indian women and it was only on compassionate grounds that I did not recommend the dismissal of these people some time ago. The teaching also was not up to standard. I have a high regard for Mr. Marsden personally, but his health was a handicap and too much was left to Mrs. Marsden, who is totally unfitted temperamentally to teach Indian children or have anything to do with the Indian people.\n\nI have today received a letter from the Inspector of Schools, Mr. R.H. Cairns, stating that he has an application from Mr. George S. Quigley, who has had seven years teaching experience. I am writing for full particulars regarding this man and if his recommendations appear satisfactory will report in the near future. I presume this man has not been previously employed by the Department and would recommend a salary of $65.00 per month if his record is satisfactory.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nFJOB:C.\nOttawa, September 5th, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to securing a teacher for the Okanagan Indian Day School. It is noted that Mr. Cairns and yourself are considering Mr. Geo. S. Quigley. If you decide to engage him, salary will be allowed at the rate of $85 a teaching month. If, however, you decide to obtain a better qualified teacher, the Department will consider payment of $90 per month if the applicant is particularly well qualified.\n\nAs soon as you have made a decision regarding the teacher, please advise the Department of the name, qualifications and salary promised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

After consultation with Mr. Cairns I beg to recommend that Mr. Quigley be engaged. As a matter of fact he has arrived here and in order to have the school opened as soon as possible I took him out yesterday.\n\nMr. Cairns advised me that on account of his previous experience he would recommend payment of $90.00 per month. The Registrar of the Department of Education for this province, to whom I wrote for information, advises me that Mr. Quigley was employed for four years in the public schools at Malakwa, Alexis Creek and Glencoe. The Registrar states that \"His work as teacher in the above schools was quite satisfactory when it is taken into consideration that he never attended Normal School in British Columbia. During his period of employment his character and conduct were satisfactory in so far as this Department is aware\". Mr. Quigley taught in England for three years and also served Overseas for three years. The Reverend John Welch certifies as to this character.\n\nMr. Quigley has been advised that subject to your approval he is appointed on probation for six months.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nFJCB:C.\nOttawa, September 19, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, informing the Department that, after consulting with Mr. Inspector Cairns, Mr. Geo.

His retention in the position will depend upon the success which he achieves in his work. We note that he has had previous teaching experience and that his work in white schools was satisfactory.

Quigley, teacher at the Okanagan Indian Day School, has applied for an increase in salary to $100.00 per month.\n\nMr. Quigley has had several years experience in Provincial schools and he now has 22 pupils on the roll of the Okanagan Indian Day School. He is doing good work at this school and the pupils are making good progress under his tuition, although he has only been here since September, 1928. I believe he was advised by the Reverend Father Welsh, who recommended him, that he would be paid the same salary as the former teacher, although of course Father Welsh had no authority to tell him this. We are expecting an increase of several pupils in the school as soon as the weather moderates and I respectfully recommend an increase of salary from $90.00 to $100.00.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 15, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department is allowing Mr. Geo.

Cheque for his salary has already been forwarded, as per your telegram of the 30th ult.\n\nMr. Quigley has applied for three days leave and left yesterday for the Coast to visit the United States Immigration officials in regard to his entry into the United States. He has resigned as teacher, taking effect at the end of October. I respectfully request that the resignation be accepted.\n\nAlthough Mr. Quigley stated that he would return at the end of three days leave, he has proved so utterly unreliable that he may, if permitted to enter the United States, not return to complete the month.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nFJCB:C.\nOttawa, October 10, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your Ok. 1-10 of the 3rd instant, with reference to Mr. Quigley, teacher of the Okanagan Indian Day School. I note that he has resigned as on October 31st. His resignation is accepted, and I have to authorize you to secure a suitable successor who can commence duties on the 1st proximo. You might discuss this matter with whatever priest is missionary for the Okanagan Reserve and see if he has any suitable nomination. It is not necessary to write to the Very Rev. Father Welch, as he is no longer Provincial, and the present Provincial happens to be in Ottawa at the present time. At a later date you can report if Mr. Quigley returns to his school and teaches any during the month of October.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th inst. in connection with the resignation of Mr. Quigley as teacher of the Okanagan Indian Day School. I visited the school yesterday and found it still closed and from an examination of the living quarters have come to the conclusion that although Mr. Quigley applied for three days leave and later wrote from Vancouver asking for three days extra, he had no intention of returning. The quarters were dirty and the furniture had been carelessly handled and the place looked quite dilapidated.\n\nIn case Mr. Quigley ever applies for another position it may be well to report that I have had trouble with him almost from the day of his appointment. He tried to undermine the priest who attends the Reserve, the Agent and everybody who had any dealings with him. I had numerous inquiries about him from all sorts of people, a warrant for him was sent to the local provincial police in connection with non-maintenance of his family, and recently there was an advertisement in the Vancouver papers asking for information as to his whereabouts. He was also in trouble with his nearest white neighbour on the Reserve on a timber deal and he was undoubtedly encouraging the Indians to cut timber from their allotments for sale through him, although his name did not appear. However, I checked this as soon as it came to my notice.\n\nI did not wish to trouble the Department with his many activities, which have caused me considerable unpleasantness, but I was seriously considering placing the facts before you at the end of this term. He has been on the quota for entry into the United States and apparently his turn has now come and personally I consider we are well rid of him. Your instructions as to a successor are being followed and I hope to send an application for your approval in the near future.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary;\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\n(F.J.C.

I have not been able to find a suitable qualified teacher, but have been requested by Father Carlyle to re-open the school with Mr. Anthony Walsh as teacher.\n\nMr. Walsh is not a qualified teacher, but feels that he could handle this position. I have agreed, subject to your approval, to give him an opportunity of doing so and have arranged for him to re-open the school on November 15th. By the end of the term we shall know what progress he has made and he realises that to hold the position he must make good as a teacher. He appears to be a very good type of man for the position and may be much more successful than a qualified teacher if he is in earnest and interested in the work. Mr. Grist, who has been teaching for some time, has had no previous experience, but is one of the most successful teachers we have had in the Agency.\n\nI respectfully request authority to employ Mr. Anthony Walsh temporarily as from November 15th at a salary of $30.00 per month.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nFJCB:C.\nOttawa, November 16, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, relative to the appointment of a successor to Geo.

Please advise him of his appointment. His retention in the position is to depend entirely upon the success with which he meets in his work.

Attendance has increased under his direction to a point where practically all seating accommodation was full at the end of last term. He has improved the school grounds by flower beds, etc., and carries on agricultural instructions by this means.

We are getting ready for Christmas from now on until the end of the term.\n\nI am weaving a mat for Standing Rock, and I am half finished with it, and it is very pretty, on a loom.\n\nWe all wish you a very happy Christmas.\n\nI Remain\nyour obedient servant,\nLaura Marchand\n(Secretary)\nSir:\n\nI enclose herewith a letter addressed to you received from the Secretary of the Indian Crafts Guild on Okanagan Indian Reserve No.1. Under separate cover I am forwarding at their request a sample of their work for your use.\n\nIn explanation, I would advise that the Guild at present is composed of pupils of the Okanagan Indian Day School under instruction of Mr. Anthony Walsh. Mr. Walsh attended the B.C. University Summer School during the vacation, specializing in handicrafts, and has made considerable headway with this work among his pupils during the Fall term, and the children are very keen indeed on the work, a few of them displaying outstanding talent. The small basket is one of their early attempts with rattan, and it well conveys an impression of what they are doing. I loaned the School a simple weaving loom and four frame loom with which they are turning out good work, considering their short experience. I have also recently loaned them a pyrographic outfit, and they are experimenting with burnt leather and birch bark decoration. They have already turned out a variety of articles decorated in various ways and at present, in addition to their ordinary school work, are engaged in making up birch bark greeting cards, and other novelties to fill orders from white people. Already they have added over $20.00 to their school library fund, which represents a small contribution from each article sold, and the library is growing fast. The most recent request from the Guild is for an autographed copy of Dr. Scott's poems.\n\nIt might be interesting to know that the Guild, which is also a Junior Red Cross \"branch\" conduct their business in a perfectly formal and business-like fashion with regular meetings where questions are gravely debated and subject to resolutions, and this without the \"interference\" of the teacher.\n\nOne of the great hopes I have for this handicraft training is that in the event of these children ever being stricken with T.B. or other disability, they will be enabled to support themselves and considerably improve their chances of getting on their feet again, as probably the greatest difficulty in securing satisfactory results with tubercular Indians is due to the fact that they will not rest for any length of time.\n\nYou are probably aware that this school secured...\nfirst place at the recent Indian Exhibit at Kamloops and great credit is due Mr. Walsh for his keen interest in this, as well as his agricultural instruction during the summer months.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(James Coleman)\nIndian Agent.\n\nRussell F.

The Okanagan school is an outstanding success in every way, and the pupils are confronted with a bigger demand for their handicrafts than they can fill. A number of these pupils have provided themselves with winter clothing from this source and the teacher, Mr. Walsh, believes several of them will be self-supporting in a few years. This, of course, in addition to their routine studies. The attendance at this school is increasing and it is not at all unlikely that new desks, etc., will have to be provided in the comparatively near future, as a number of children living at a distance from the school are now anxious to attend. The Osoyoos children are contemplating the formation of a Boy Scout troop, and it is hoped that this can be brought about. This school, under the care of Mr. Grist, is very successful, his strong point being agriculture and stock, and his work in the reserve is equally as valuable with the adults as with the children. Penticton school has a much harder problem on account of the opposition and indifference of the Indians.\n\nJames Coleman.\nIndian Agent.\nJanuary 16th, 1931.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nI was very pleased to receive your letter of the 4th instant and am much interested in what you say regarding handicrafts. I hope your dream of an \"Okanagan rug\" will come true.\n\nI am sending you today under separate cover, some of the picture parts of my Christmas cards. I thought possibly they might amuse the children and that they might make some use of them.\n\nWith Best Wishes to you all for a Very Happy New Year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nAnthony Walsh, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nOkanagan Indian Day School,\nVernon, B.C.\nThe Okanagan Indian Day School\nVernon B.C.\n\nJanuary 25th\n\nDr. Duncan B.

We appreciate the honour you have bestowed on us and sincerely hope that one day you might give us the pleasure of paying us a visit and hear some of your poems recited by the children. Some of them will be writing a letter to thank you.\n\nAt present we have twenty pupils, a most charming bunch of youngsters very keen on their studies and each nice manners, and a wonderful sense of humour, so we have a very happy time together.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

There were thirteen children present, who all seemed to be taking a great interest in their work. Mr. Welch, the teacher, takes a great deal of pains with the children, not only at school work, but in handicrafts and gardening. Some of the weaving done by the children is really marvellous and should be encouraged.\n\nG. S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nCANADA\n\nOffice of Inspector of Schools,\nP.O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nJuly 31, 1932.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAssistant Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been informed by Mr. Indian Agent Strang, of the Lytton Agency, that the position of teacher of the SHALALTH Indian Day School has become vacant, owing to the resignation of Mr. D. Burden-Murphy on his appointment to the staff of the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nTo fill the above vacancy I beg to recommend that Mr. F.G.M. Grist, the present teacher of the OSOYOOS Indian Day School, be appointed teacher of the SHALALTH Indian Day School. Though Mr. Grist has no Normal School training, he is taking the Primary, and Indian Courses at this year's Provincial Summer School. There is a little friction between Mr. Grist and the local Priest at Osoyoos; but from my inspection of Mr. Grist's work I feel that he should have the chance to show what he can do under other conditions, and it is for this reason that I wish to recommend his transfer to SHALALTH in place of Mr. Burden-Murphy resigned.\n\nShould the Department agree to transfer Mr. Grist to Shalalth, I wish to recommend that Mr. A. Walsh, at present teacher of the Okanagan Indian Day School be appointed teacher of the OSOYOOS Indian Day School. Mr. Walsh has been very successful with native handwork at the Okanagan Indian Day School, and it is hoped that he will be able to train the Indian children at Osoyoos in the same sort of work.\n\nBoth Mr. Grist and Mr. Walsh have applied to me for transfers. I have put the whole matter before the Right Reverend the Bishop of Victoria during a special conference which I had with him at the Palace in Victoria on July 28th. He informs me that he is in agreement with my views on the matter, and will so inform His Grace Archbishop Duke, or his representative. I hope that the above transfers will do away with any cause for friction between the teachers of the Indian Day Schools and the local Priests.\n\nTo fill the position of teacher at the OKANAGAN Indian Day School which would become vacant should the Department approve of the above transfers I would recommend the appointment of Mr. Bernard Neary, 1228 Yates Street, Victoria, B.C.\n\nMr. Neary holds an Interim First Class Certificate for British Columbia, having been trained at the Victoria Normal School, and Victoria College. In addition to two years College he holds...\nPhysical Training and First Aid Certificates, and will have a Summer School Certificate for Indian and rural work at the end of my present course of lectures on August 5th. He has had one year's successful experience in a three-roomed rural school, and is only leaving as the local trustees are doing away with one division. Mr. Neary is very highly recommended by the local Catholic Priests, is well known to the Right Reverend the Bishop of Victoria, and is recommended by the Provincial Department of Education. May I ask that if his appointment be approved he be so informed by telegram, as it is quite likely that offers of other schools will be made to him, and I am very anxious to obtain his services on the staff of the Indian Day Schools.\n\nThe above recommendations here, I may say, been worked out with some care, are approved by the Right Reverend the Bishop of Victoria, and now await the approval of His Grace Archbishop Duke and the Department of Indian Affairs, to whom they are respectfully submitted,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian schools, B.C.\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith a letter dated July 31st, ultimo, addressed to me by Captain G.H. Barry, District Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia, in regard to changes recommended by him affecting the teachership of the Okanagan, Osoyoos and Shalalth (Seton Lake) Indian Day Schools.\n\nThis matter has been discussed with Inspector Barry and, in consequence of his recommendations, I would advise that the latter be given favorable consideration by the Department and that its decision be communicated here by telegram so that Mr. Neary may be advised and our file completed on this subject.\n\nP/KD.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosure: -\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 10th, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nIt has been decided to transfer Mr. A. Walsh, teacher of the Okanagan Indian Day School, to the Osoyoos Indian Day School.\n\nTo succeed Mr. Walsh, the Department is approving of the appointment of Mr. Bernard Neary as teacher at Okanagan. Mr. Neary holds an interim first class certificate for British Columbia, having been trained at the Victoria Normal School and Victoria College. In addition to two years College, he holds Physical Training and First Aid Certificates and, this summer, he is obtaining a summer school certificate for Indian and rural work. He has already had one year's successful experience in a three-roomed rural school.\n\nThe transfer of Mr. Walsh and the appointment of Mr. Neary are effective from September 1st, next.\n\nMr. Neary's salary will be at the rate of $90 a teaching month, less 10% for the current fiscal year. The Department trusts that you will give him every possible assistance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJames Coleman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B. C.\nOttawa, August 10th, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to 15/25895 of the 2nd instant, enclosing Inspector Barry's letter of the 31st ultimo, I beg to say that the Department approves of the following changes in teachers:\n\n(a) Transfer of Mr. F. G. M. Grist from Osoyoos to Seton Lake - salary $90 a teaching month, less 10% for the current fiscal year.\n\n(b) Transfer of Mr. A. Walsh from Okanagan to Osoyoos - salary $90 a teaching month, less 10% for the current fiscal year.\n\n(c) Appointment of Mr. Bernard Neary as teacher at Okanagan Indian Day School - salary $90 a teaching month - less 10% for the current fiscal year.\n\nThe appointment of Mr. Neary and the transfer of Messrs. Grist and Walsh will take effect from September 1st, next. It is noted from the Inspector's letter that the above appointments have the approval of the Church authorities concerned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC. C.

I.A.\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th inst., advising of the transfer of Mr. W. V. Smith to the Boyd Lake school and the appointment of Mr. Henry to the Okanagan Indian Day School. Mr. Henry will of course be given every assistance in his work.\n\nI understand Mr. W. V. Smith was transferred from Okanagan to Shalalth day school and his loss is keenly regretted as he has not only been a keen and capable teacher, but on numerous occasions been of great value to me there being no substitute attached to this Agency. He has also given great service in connection with our farm shop work at Okanagan. I might mention that no difficulty could be raised in connection with his duties but for his unwillingness to serve the Department and I sincerely trust it will be possible to transfer him back to this Agency at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6405, File 833-1, part 1)\nMuch greater interest is being shown in this school lately. During the inspection of this school, a short conference was held with the Indian Agent, the Teacher, the Missionary, Rev. Father Sullivan, and the Indian Chief Pierre. It was brought to my notice that there were a number of Indian children in the districts near the school but beyond walking distance, who were not in receipt of any education. I asked the Indian Agent, Mr. Cleman, to gather the facts of the case with a view to making a full report to the Department. My own view is that there are from 20 to 30 children who could be brought to this school daily by a small school bus or large automobile. If these children were so brought, it would be necessary to add a second schoolroom to the present buildings, and engage a second male teacher. It is most important that one or other of the two male teachers, who would then be available, should drive the school bus. There is sufficient room in the school building for the residence of a second teacher, there being a spare bedroom. I understand the local teacher and the Missionary are thoroughly in favour of this solution to the school attendance question in this district. I have so far no particulars of the children who could attend if this plan should be adopted. I am rather in favour of it; but am not prepared to recommend it to the Department till I have a report from the Indian Agent. Some method will have to be found for the education of this fairly large number of children. I am satisfied that the establishment of a second one-roomed school at a selected place would not solve the difficulty. The average attendance figures and classification are given below.\nOKANAGAN AGENCY INSPECTION REPORT NO. 9 (Cont'd)\n\n6. SCHOOLS: I regret that at the moment I cannot find my notes upon the Day School on Okanagan Reserve No. I. I must, therefore, rely upon memory. I found that the attendance was well up and this school seems to be doing quite well indeed. The children in the various grades demonstrated to me in the way of reading, writing and arithmetic, and they seemed to be alert, intelligent, and well up to grade. The school was clean and tidy.\n\nThe teacher at this school has a system of allotting gardens to the various children, and though early in the season, I found the gardens all planted and the children taking a great interest in each individual garden. The children themselves had built their own irrigation system very creditably indeed, and I strongly recommend that a small sum of money, say $5.00, be allotted for prizes when these gardens are judged by the local Government Agriculturist who has promised to do this for us. It stimulates great interest amongst the children, and I think, would be a very good move.\n\nI found the manual work done around the school by the boys, very good.\n\nTaking everything into consideration, I find a great improvement in this Day School since my last visit.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo. S. Pragnell\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, August 3, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nA vacancy has occurred at the Cowichan Indian Day School, in the Cowichan agency, and Mr. Bernard F. Neary, teacher of the Okanagan Indian Day School for the past two years, has requested that he be transferred to the Cowichan School, as it is nearer Victoria than his present school. The Department has approved of his transfer and he has been so informed.\n\nThis leaves a vacancy at the Okanagan Indian Day School, and I would appreciate if you would consult the local Catholic Church authorities and forward, as soon as possible, the name and qualifications of the teacher whom they desire to nominate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

Coleman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have recommended the transfer of Mr. B. Neary from the position of teacher of the North Okanagan Indian Day School to a similar position in the Cowichan Indian Day School, Cowichan Agency. Mr. Indian Agent Graham has I understand also recommended that Mr. Neary be appointed to the latter school, and I have every reason to think that the Department of Indian Affairs will so appoint him. Nothing definite however has come to hand in this connection as yet.\n\nI leave on Friday next the 10th instant for my annual vacation, and I shall not be in a position to recommend suitable candidates, should you request me to do so. I am therefore taking the liberty of recommending the below named teacher for any vacancy that may be caused through Mr. Neary's transfer, and I would ask you should the position of teacher at the North Okanagan Indian Day School become vacant to consider favourably Miss Hepworth's qualifications. I should also be glad if you would communicate direct with this candidate, and should she be accepted by the Department, instruct her in due course with regard to the opening of school, Etc.\n\nRecommended for the position of teacher of the North Okanagan Indian Day School:\n\nMiss Marie Hepworth, Box 284 Trail, B.C.\n\nMiss Hepworth is a Roman Catholic, age 21, trained at Victoria Normal School (1921-22), holds a B.C. First Class Interim Certificate, and has about four months experience as a substitute teacher in Grades 2 and 3 at the Trail Central School. She is about five feet three inches tall and weighs one hundred three pounds. She has taught Sunday School for some eight years, and is very well able to teach the children their Religion. She has been always in the best of health, and when not in school has worked in a drug store gaining a knowledge of simple drugs. She is prepared to dispense the usual medicines to the Indians. Miss Hepworth gets on well with the children placed in her care, and to qualify for a teaching position in one of our Indian Schools, gave up a position to attend the courses in Primary Work and Indian & Rural Problems at this year's Provincial Summer School here. In fact I have had Miss Hepworth as a student in my class for the past five weeks, and have observed her attitude and class work with some care. She can play the piano or organ and is well able to conduct a choir. She is also quite good at cooking and sewing, which subjects she is prepared to teach to the girls.\n\nMiss Hepworth's aunt a lady of some fifty years of age is prepared to make her home with this teacher at the school, as otherwise I could not recommend a single girl being given this appointment. I may add that this nomination has the express written approval of His Grace the Archbishop of Vancouver, Archbishop Duke. I wish also to strongly recommend Miss Hepworth's appointment, and would ask that a copy of this letter be forwarded with your recommendation when the position becomes vacant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H.

The children of each of the three day schools entered the annual poster competition of the Latham Humane Foundation (an organization somewhat similar to our Society of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) to which there were over 5,500 entries from all over the world. Each school secured several certificates of merit and one young woman at Penticton Reserve managed to get into the not very extensive prize list for a small award, which was very good considering the extent of the entries. This all came about by the Foundation inviting my personal entry but as I had no time I suggested that they might be interested in the Indian children's contributions with the results stated.\n\nJames Coleman,\nIndian Agent.\nAGENCY'S REPORT ON OKANAGAN AGENCY FOR JUNE 1927\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nThese have all made satisfactory progress during the month, particularly at Penticton.

C., dated Victoria, Aug. 14/37.\n\nWith reference to the third paragraph of your letter of the 9th instant and the third paragraph of your communication 167-34-1 of July 30th last, I am forwarding herewith a letter from Archbishop W. M.

This teacher has 16 years successful experience; 10 years having been spent in Ontario rural schools and 6 years at St. Patrick's School, Vancouver. Her sister is a widow who could and would live with her, should her appointment as teacher of the Okanagan Indian Day School be approved. She was interviewed in Vancouver on June 19th last by our Inspector of Schools.\n\nI would recommend that approval be given for the transfer of Miss Marie Heyworth to Simmon Indian Day School and the appointment of Miss Catherine McDonald as teacher of the Okanagan Indian Day School. On receipt of a telegram that the Indian Affairs Branch has approved of these appointments, I shall immediately inform the Indian Agents concerned.\n\n(SIGNED) D. N.

C.\nEX.D.\n\nOttawa, August 23, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th instant, you were informed by radiotelegram on the 21st instant as follows:\u2014\n\n\"Department approves appointments of teachers Marie Hepworth to Sliammon and Catherine McDonald to Okanagan schools.\"\n\nIt is noted that both the transfer of Miss Marie Hepworth to Sliammon and the appointment of Miss Catherine McDonald to the Okanagan School are approved by His Grace W. M. Duke, Archbishop of Vancouver. Please notify these teachers of their appointments and arrange with them to begin duties on September first.\n\nThe salary allowed Miss Hepworth at the Sliammon School will be at the rate of $85.00 a teaching month.\n\nMiss Catherine McDonald will be allowed salary at the rate of $90.00 a teaching month at the Okanagan School.\n\nI am enclosing herewith Staff Questionnaire Forms, which you should request these teachers to fill in and return to the Department at the earliest possible date. A circular regarding the dates of opening and closing of Indian day schools is also enclosed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nD. H. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVictoria, B. C.\nThe teacher at this school (Okanagan Indian Day) has been transferred to Sliammon and an elderly woman teacher appointed in her place, which I regard as rather unfortunate, a male teacher being particularly desirable. The school is quite isolated and there has been a great deal of comment from white residents in that locality about placing women in this position, with requests from them that we give them telephone connection, which would be extremely costly, both for installation and maintenance. Apart from this a man that could have handled manual training training, agriculture and the boys was very desirable. However, I had no knowledge of the proposed changes until they were effected a few days before school opening. Every assistance and encouragement will of course be extended to the new teacher and her sister who is with her, but I do not feel very comfortable about the matter and it is to be hoped that a more satisfactory arrangement can be made later.\n\nJas. Coleman,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 14, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your report for the month of August, it is noted that you consider it would have been preferable to appoint a male teacher in charge of the Okanagan Indian Day School.\n\nThe present teacher, Miss McDonald, was nominated by His Grace the Archbishop of Vancouver, and her qualifications were approved by Inspector Barry.

I fully appreciated the circumstances in regard to her appointment and on her arrival immediately endeavoured to assist her in every possible way. As it was apparent that she was unfamiliar with handling Indian children and general educational procedure, I had Mr. F.G.M. Grist, recently of Seabird Island School and now in Vernon, endeavour to assist and advise her in detail, this man having been eminently successful when teaching in this Agency and having taught at this particular school at one time, with success. There was no expense to the Department in this connection. As it was evident that Miss McDonald was still somewhat off the line I deemed it advisable to bring Miss M.E. Weydert up from the Penticton Day School to give her a day. Miss Weydert being the most competent and successful teacher we have ever had in our work and being a woman I thought possibly she might make a more effective contact with her in some ways than Mr. Grist. I think between the two of them and myself we have possibly acquainted Miss McDonald with our requirements and methods.\n\nSo far as I can see Miss McDonald is a very fine type of woman typical of the teacher of a small Ontario school of twenty-five years ago and the whole problem is that of adapting her to the type of education now in vogue and many of the young teachers are finding difficulty in meeting the recent changes in curriculum in British Columbia. If this can be done I have no doubt but that she will do excellent work for this Department and you can rest assured that she will be given the fullest and most sympathetic cooperation from myself and my staff in every way possible. This school would be a problem even for an experienced Indian teacher as I consider it is in a somewhat run-down condition and the children have lost interest in the work, consequently it would not be fair to pass an opinion on Miss McDonald's work until she has been with the children for some months.\n\nI am not entirely satisfied with our educational set-up as regards its value in training our Indian children for the work they will undertake on their maturity, both for boys and girls, and feel that we are merely tending to make them dissatisfied with their future prospects, which in this Agency hold out a great deal more promise for them than\n\nR.A.Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6105, File 833-1, part 2)\nthe majority of white children, if they can be educated to see and take advantage of them. After the rush of Fall work is over I hope to report more fully my views to the Department in this respect, for what they are worth, but meanwhile I do feel that as the agent is responsible for the success or failure of his Agency and the school work is the foundation for the near future that he should have something to say with regard to the particular type required to cope with his peculiar Agency requirements, high academic attainments being useless to us if the teacher is unable to fill the school, as an example.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Jas. Coleman)\nIndian Agent\n\nJO/HM\nMiss Katherine McDonald arrived and was inducted in her school on the 1st. She appears to be very zealous and a hard worker, but has had no experience in this particular type of work and is not very up to date in her methods. I had Mr. Grist give her some instruction on our methods (without cost to the department, thanks to his courtesy) and brought up Miss Weydert from Penticton to give her a day in the class room (also at no cost) and every assistance is being given Miss McDonald to make her work a success. It seems to be largely a question of having her adopt our methods and if this can be done she will no doubt prove as satisfactory as a woman can at this particular school, but as the work there is at a rather low ebb it will take her some time to get things in shape.\n\nJames Coleman,\nIndian Agent.\nAGENCY'S REPORT ON OKANAGAN AGENCY FOR OCTOBER 1937.\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nThese were all visited at least once during the month and found to be progressing.

In addition I might point out that the Indian schools in the Okanagan Valley are well provided with the regular textbooks, also supplementary reading books, and I do not consider there is any great need for the circulation to them of books from the Okanagan Valley Union Library.\n\nDirector.\nREPORT ON OKANAGAN AGENCY FOR MONTH OF DECEMBER 1937.\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nIt is uncertain at present just how the new teacher will succeed with the Okanagan Day school, but there is no doubt of her industry.\n\nJames Coleman,\nIndian Agent.\nSchools\n\nThese have been making their usual progress. Miss Weydert of the Penticton School is marrying a young Catholic school teacher, who has very excellent reports from his inspectors. Miss Weydert has proven unusually successful with this school and as her husband made application to join our teaching staff after his marriage in July, I thought that it would be an excellent idea to have this young couple take over the Okanagan Indian Day school, which has always been a problem, there being a number of adult girls attending and the attendance has fallen off rather badly in recent years. It has an enrolment of 35 pupils with the last average attendance being only 24.68. It was considered that this young couple working together on the problem could promote the interest of the children and that a young married woman could handle the elder girls by securing their confidence and bringing them to a better understanding of their responsibilities, as well as handle the domestic science end of the teaching, the young man being quite capable of taking the boys with elements of agriculture and manual arts. However, to my surprise the present incumbents, two aged ladies, are not taking favourably to a transfer to Penticton where I felt they would be much more comfortable living in the town and free from the inconveniences of living on a reserve where they are liable in ordinary winters to be snow bound for weeks at a time, besides the undoubted advantage of taking over a school that has been brought up to an excellent standard, by Miss Weydert. Personally, I would prefer to see competent male teachers in all of the three day schools in this agency in order to give effective training to the boys on agricultural subjects as well as the orthodox curriculum and have part of the available time allotted to training these youngsters in what will eventually be their life work.\n\nJames Coleman,\nIndian Agent.\nARCHDIOCESE OF VANCOUVER\nArchbishop's Office\n\n646 Richard Street,\nVancouver, B.C., June 4, 1938.\n\nMajor D.M. Mac Kay,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI understand that there will be a vacancy at the Okanagan Indian Day School and also at the Penticton Indian Day School, and after conferring with the priests in charge, I am writing you, recommending Mr. Thomas Noel Curteis for the Okanagan School and Miss Catherine McDonald for the Penticton Indian School.\n\nI take this occasion of expressing our appreciation of your great help and interest in the recent Indian Exhibit, to which the Indian people, generally speaking, throughout the Province showed the greatest interest, and co-operation.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nW.

Duke.\nArchbishop of Vancouver.\nNo.15/10/5090.\n\nVancouver, B.C., July 19, 1938.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am forwarding herewith a copy of a letter received from His Excellency Archbishop W.M. Duke, in which the archbishop nominates Miss Catherine McDonald on transfer from the Okanagan Indian Day School to be teacher of the Penticton Indian Day School in place of Miss Mary Elizabeth Weyert who resigned her position to be married to Mr. T. Curtis, your file 164-10-1 of June 2nd last.\n\nTo fill the vacancy at the Okanagan Indian Day School, His Excellency has nominated a teacher with Provincial experience, Mr. Thomas Noel Curtis, the man Miss Weyert is to marry this month.\n\nThe above nomination would have been forwarded to the Department some time ago had it not been that Miss Catherine McDonald was at first rather unwilling to accept His Excellency's nomination and wished for transfer to a school near Vancouver or Victoria. These matters have now been adjusted and Miss McDonald is anxious to go to Penticton on transfer from the Okanagan Indian Day School near Vernon.\n\nI have interviewed Mr. T.N. Curtis and find that he has trained in the Victoria Normal School and now holds a Permanent First Class Certificate in British Columbia. He is a Catholic and 21 years of age. For the past three years he has been in charge of Grades 1 to 4 inclusive at the North Cedar Provincial Day School. In 1936 he attended the Provincial Summer school in Victoria and qualified in Reading, Geography, and Modern Methods, while at the 1937 Summer School he received certificates in Psychology, Literature and Science. He is a well set up young man interested in school games, and with some experience in Manual Training which would be of use in the Okanagan Indian Day School.\n\nThe Indian agent, Mr. Coleman, is anxious that a married man be appointed to the Okanagan Day School, and I have no hesitation on behalf of the Indian Commissioner in recommending that the Archbishop's nominations be accepted and Miss C. McDonald be moved to Penticton and Mr. Curtis be appointed to the Okanagan School.\n\nNominations for any other teaching positions in Indian Day schools working under Catholic auspices will be forwarded as soon as I have had an opportunity to discuss the matter with His Excellency Archbishop Duke who is expected to return to Vancouver towards the end of the month.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nRepresentative of the Treasury\n\nRe: Okanagan Indian Day School, No. 375\n\nAs you are being advised in my other memorandum of today's date, Miss Catherine McDonald, who was in charge of this school to June 30 last, is being transferred to the Penticton Indian Day School, and the Department has appointed Mr. Thomas Noel Curteis to succeed her.\n\nHe will begin duty on September 1, 1926, at a salary of $1,000 a year.

I believe one of them is now going to apply for the position. He has not Normal School training, but his education, of which he will write you the details, is quite advanced. His name is Gregory Schiller, Canadian-born of Bohemian and Irish ancestry. He is a Catholic.\n\nI do not hesitate to recommend this young man, if you consider his qualifications sufficient.

Jennings, Auxiliary Bishop of Vancouver, of Gregory Schiller who, it will be noted, has no professional qualifications but is well recommended by the Bishop. It will also be noted that this applicant has been exempted from military service apparently on medical grounds.\n\nIt has been found quite difficult to secure teachers for these positions, and, while I am not favourable to the appointment of unqualified persons, in view of the Bishop's recommendation I would approve of Mr. Schiller being engaged on a purely temporary basis until such time as a qualified teacher can be secured.\n\nThis school has been conducted on the basis of a term of 9 months at a salary of $100 a month, and reference to your files will show that the $100 a month rate was paid to Mr. Curtis in consideration of his wife, who was formerly teacher at the Penticton Indian Day School, devoting a part of her time to teaching the children domestic science, etc. In view of the fact that Mr. Schiller is not qualified professionally and there are excellent furnished quarters built on to the school, I would recommend that he be paid a salary of $90 per month for the school term ending June 30th unless a qualified teacher could be secured before that date.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

However, I still have no word in this regard, and the Indians are, to say the least, unhappy and discontented at the school being closed, and accuse myself and the Department of having no interest in their children's education. This is a great pity as these people are eager to send the children, and some have no left for the United States and are sending the children to the public schools there until we obtain a teacher.

I regret to say that no teacher has yet been appointed for this school for which there are about 35 pupils anxious to attend and the Indians are very bitter in their feelings over it. They have requested that if a teacher cannot be obtained, then the Department employ a bus and transport the children to school in Vernon. I have advised them that this is impossible as the white schools are now filled with more children than can be properly accommodated.\n\nThis school has been very unfortunate in the matter of teachers for the past 4 years and the Indians openly state that no encouragement is given them in the education of their children. I sincerely hope that a qualified teacher can be obtained at an early date.\n\nA.H. Barber,\nIndian Agent.\nWelfare and Training:\n\nOkanagan Indian Day School. There is still no teacher at this school, and the parents of the 35 or more children, who are anxious to have the school opened, are very much perturbed and accuse myself and the Department of lack of interest in their education.

There is, however, absolutely no assurance that we will secure a teacher for the 1946-47 academic year.\n\nFor D. M.

The Okanagan School has been closed for over a year, and there are approximately 40 children awaiting its reopening and the Indians are all very perturbed and dissatisfied with the situation. This is very regrettable as they are so anxious in that area, that their children go to school and I recommend priority of this school be given over others where there are less children to attend.\n\nAlfred H.

However, he has not taught school for more than 15 years, and I would say he is very much out of date as to modern teaching methods. However, whilst I possibly would not recommend his appointment if teachers with modern teaching were available at this time, I am of the opinion that he would give satisfactory service if his appointment was approved by the Bishop. However, it will be noted that Mr. Pitman is an Anglican.\n\nHe is also a married man, and is of pleasant personality, but has had no experience with Indians.\n\nIn view of the fact that this School has remained closed since June 1945, and that there are approximately thirty-five children available, I would ask that Mr. Pitman's application be given every consideration.\n\n(Alfred H.

If, however, you are not in a position to nominate a Roman Catholic teacher for this school it would be appreciated if you would give consideration to the nomination of Mr. Pitman whose appointment, subject to your nomination, I am prepared to recommend to the Department for the balance of the academic year.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

O. Box 70  \nVancouver, B. C.\n\nDear Major Mackey,\n\nI have your letter of November 20, and the enclosed recommendation from Mr. Indian Agent Berber of Mr. John Pitman for the position of teacher at the Okanagan Indian Day School. For the reason that Mr. Pitman is not of the religious faith of the Indians on that reserve I feel that I could not recommend him for this position, though otherwise he would seem to have sufficient qualification. I am sure you will understand that in my position as bishop it would not be reasonable to make such a recommendation.\n\nI have been doing all I can to find a teacher for this school, but without success. Just now, however, Father Scott who is the missionary for the reserve, is in touch with two rather likely prospects, and we are in hopes that he will be able to present one or other of them for the position.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nE. J. Jennings  \nBishop of Kamloops.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 164-5-1 (W.T.I)\n\nFollowing receipt of Mr. Neary's letter of November 5th in connection with the teaching vacancy at the Okanagan Indian Day School and following considerable correspondence with Bishop Jennings who was unable to nominate a teacher for the school, the attached application was received from Mr. John Pitman, a resident of Vernon, who although not a Roman Catholic, has the necessary academic qualifications, and in view of the inability of Bishop Jennings to nominate a teacher it was felt that we might avail ourselves of Mr. Pitman's services. Mr. Indian agent Barber's letter of November 6th in connection with the applicant is enclosed together with a copy of my letter of November 20th to Bishop Jennings and his reply thereto. It will be noted that in spite of the fact that the Bishop was unable to nominate a Catholic teacher he is not prepared to recommend Mr. Pitman for the position as he is not of the religious faith of the Indians on the reserve.\n\nThis school has been closed continuously since September, 1945, and for varying periods prior to that through lack of a teacher and it is most unfortunate that the children should continue to be deprived of an education because of the authority exercised by the church in the matter of the nomination of the teacher. Although Section 10, subsection 2, of the Indian Act might appear to imply the right of the church in this connection my own view is that the reference was intended to cover the operation of residential schools only.\nThis case should serve to focus attention on the imperative need for clarification of the position of the church in the matter of the operation and control of the Indian Day Schools in this province. There should be no place in this country for a policy that makes education to our Indians, which under the law is the sole responsibility of the state, dependent on decision of church authority.\n\nI may say that we have endeavoured to make use of Mr. Pitman's services in a Protestant school elsewhere but he does not wish to return to the coast, desiring the dry climate of the interior for the benefit of his wife's health.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Okanagan Indian Day School\n\nI enclose for the Department's attention a letter from Bishop Jennings nominating Miss Doris Fraser for the position as teacher at the Okanagan Indian Day School.\n\nMiss Fraser is not a qualified teacher and apart from the occasions on which she was deputed by her teacher to teach the younger children at the Squam Bay Public School when she herself was a pupil there she has had no experience whatever as a teacher. It will also be noted that Bishop Jennings suggests that it would be to the advantage of Miss Fraser to have Mrs. Tierney O'Keefe, a trained teacher, in the immediate vicinity of the school, presumably to lend assistance when necessary although just how this is to be arranged is not clear.\n\nI am unable to find sufficient grounds to justify the appointment of Miss Fraser and consequently this nomination is not endorsed.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDecember 11th, 1946\n\nMajor D. M. Mackey  \nIndian Commissioner for B. C.  \nP. O. Box 70  \nVancouver, B. C.\n\nDear Major Mackey,\n\nI would like to recommend a young lady, Miss Doris Fraser, to take over the Okanagan Indian Day School. I believe, if she is accepted, that it would be better now to have her open the school at the beginning of the New Year, since we are already so close to the Christmas holiday season.\n\nMiss Fraser is not a qualified teacher. But, having had two interviews with her, I am convinced she would be able to handle the school well. She is 18 years old, but seems responsible beyond her age. She has her complete Grade XII, and is at present working in the Royal Bank of Canada in Kamloops. Except for the time spent doing her High School in St. Ann's Academy, New Westminster, she has been all her life at her home in Squam Bay, on the North Thompson River, and is therefore very accustomed to Indians and likes them. During her school days at Squam Bay her teacher freely deputed her to teach the smaller children in the school. As with a great many of the young ladies brought up in this part of the country, she has no hesitancy in the matter of doing her own housekeeping in the teacherage at the school. She is, of course, a Catholic.\n\nI believe also that it would be an advantage to her to have Mrs. Tierney O'Keefe in the immediate vicinity of the School. Mrs. O'Keefe was formerly Miss Betty Beave and taught in the same school for a year or two and who is still very interested in the school and in the welfare of the\nMajor D. M. Mackay, Indian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nIndians in the district.\n\nMiss Fraser, if accepted, would have to give notice at the Bank here, but I believe she would be ready to start at the beginning of the New Year.\n\nTrusting that Miss Fraser may be acceptable to the Department, at least for the balance of this school year or until a qualified teacher can be found, I remain\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nE. Q. Jennings\nBishop of Kamloops.\nCopy to: Major D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nFile 164-10-1\n\n164-5-1 (W.T.)\n\nOttawa, Ontario,\nDecember 24, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nOKANAGAN INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nWe have for answer your letters of December 16 and 31, on File 215-10-8124.\n\nAs you are probably aware, the above school is located some seventeen miles from Vernon and on a relatively isolated reservation. We do feel that it is not a good school for an 18 year old lady teacher to live in alone.\n\nIt is difficult to understand the Bishop's sentence \"I believe also that it would be an advantage to her to have Mrs. Tierney O'Keefe in the immediate vicinity of the school\". It is presumed that Mrs. O'Keefe is living at O'Keefe Station, which is at least eight or nine miles from the school.\n\nThese distances may not seem serious obstacles but when you consider\n\n(a) that this school is situated on a road which seldom used to be plowed\n\n(b) that there is no telephone communication near the school\n\nthen the Bishop may question the advisability of sending this young girl to this school without an older lady as escort.\n\nHowever, our records show that there is a need for a Catholic teacher at the Penticton Indian Day\nSchool. It is understood that this school is much closer to town and that there have been other young lady teachers there in the past.\n\nWould the Bishop consider\n\n(a) sending Miss Fraser to the Penticton Day School\n\n(b) sending Mr. Pitman to the Okanagan Indian day school on a temporary basis until June 30, 1947. It would be understood that at this time the Bishop could nominate a Catholic teacher to replace Mr. Pitman.\n\nB. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent,\nWelfare and Training.\nJanuary 3rd, 1947.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nP.O. Box 70\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay,\n\nRe: 215-10-6171\n\nReferring to your suggestion in your letter of Dec. 31, that of sending Miss Doris Fraser to the Penticton Indian School and Mr. Pitman to the Okanagan School, I would say that I cannot make any decision in regard to Penticton, as it is in the Diocese of Nelson and therefore in the Diocese of Bishop Johnson.\n\nI would not like therefore to withdraw my nomination of Miss Fraser for the Okanagan Indian Day School. Although she is not a qualified teacher, I feel that she could take over the school at least for this term and bring benefit to the Indian children there, who have now been without a teacher altogether for some time.\n\nIn mentioning Mrs. O'Keefe as being of assistance to her, it was meant by advice and guidance, as in that part of the country they would inevitably become friends. Mrs. O'Keefe does not live at O'Keefe Station but at the O'Keefe Ranch. That is still five or six miles away, but will not, I believe, present the kind of assistance of which I was thinking.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n\"B. J. Jennings\"\n\nB.J. Jennings,\nBishop of Kamloops\nJanuary 16, 1947.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTO D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner\nFROM R. F. Davey, District Inspector of Indian Schools.\n\nRe: Appointment of teachers to Indian Day Schools.\n\nThere are at present eleven Indian Day Schools in B.C. closed because of the present shortage of teachers and it is likely that the majority will remain so unless those teachers available are used.\n\nThe Okanagan Indian Day School is an example. This school has been closed since June 1945. Recently there has been two possible appointments, one, a young woman of eighteen years of age without teaching training, and the other, a qualified man with nineteen years experience. To send a young woman of this age with virtually no experience to the isolated Okanagan school is unjustifiable. This is particularly true when a mature qualified man is available. Apparently the only obstacle in the way of opening this school is obtaining the nomination of this teacher from the church authorities concerned. This nomination was apparently refused on the basis of the teacher's religious convictions. This is one example where an appointment to a school has been prevented because it has not been possible to secure the nomination of the teacher by the church authorities. There is no need or excuse for a teacher's religious convictions interfering with his work in a school or his work in the church and community.\n\nThe attendance at Provincial Normal Schools indicates that the present shortage of trained teachers will not be overcome for two or three years. In view of this I suggest that consideration be given to a change in the present policy of appointing teachers to Indian Day Schools only after a nomination to the position has been secured from the church authorities concerned.\n\nR. F. Davey.\n\nRFD/mh\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 164-5-1 (W.T.)\nOkanagan Indian Day School\n\nI have to refer to your letter of December 24th and previous correspondence regarding the above-noted school, and in this connection enclose for your information a copy of a letter received from Bishop Jennings in response to my letter to him of December 31st in which the Department's suggestions for meeting the needs of both the Okanagan and Penticton schools were set out. It will be observed that Bishop Jennings is not inclined to endorse the suggestions made insofar as they concern the vacancy at the former school which is in his Diocese. I have communicated with Mr. Barber to ascertain if Mr. Pitman would be willing to go to the Penticton school and if so the matter will be taken up with Bishop Johnson as the Penticton school is in his Diocese and the Department duly advised.\n\nA memorandum received from Inspector Davey, dated January 16th, 1947, on the subject of the appointment of teachers to Indian Day Schools is enclosed for your information. I may say that I am in accord with the views expressed therein by the Inspector.\n\nMy own position with respect to the appointment of Miss Fraser to the Okanagan school was set out in my letter of December 16th, my file 215-10-5934, and remains the same.\n\nD.

Barber)\nIndian Agent.\nAir Mail\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nYour File 134-8-1 (W.)\n\nFurther to my letter of January 17th and application of Mr. Litman for the position of teacher at the Okanagan Indian Day School, and in particular the suggestion that he might be willing to go to the Penticton School, a copy of Mr. Indian Agent Barber's letter of February 10th is enclosed which to me indicates that there would be no object in pursuing the matter of Mr. Litman's appointment any further insofar as the Penticton School is concerned.\n\nWith reference to the final paragraph of Mr. Barber's letter we already have a teacher at the Shulus Indian Day School and I am advising the Agent accordingly.\n\nD. H. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAIRMAL\n\nOttawa, February 24, 1947.\n\nDear Bishop Jennings:\n\nThe Department now has before it, two nominations for the position of teacher of the Okanagan Indian Day School:\n\n1. Miss Doris Fraser - aged 18 years - no teacher training - no teaching certificate - no teaching experience - a Roman Catholic.\n\n2. Mr. John Pitman - aged 57 years - two teaching certificates (England and Saskatchewan) - 19 years teaching experience (in England and Saskatchewan Provincial Schools) - an Anglican.\n\nAs you know, it has been the policy of the Department to appoint a day school teacher of the same religious denomination as the majority of the band. Unfortunately, the supply of qualified teachers of the various denominations has not been sufficient in recent years to meet the demand. As a result we have had to appoint unqualified teachers and the standard of teaching in our schools is now under criticism. Therefore we are very anxious to appoint only qualified and certificated teachers. As you are probably aware, the Indians themselves are pressing their demands for more educational facilities and especially for better teachers.\n\nReverend Father Scannell, C.M.I., has just brought to our attention the broadcast made over C J O R in\n\nMost Reverend E.

We are prepared to pay the following salary scale:\n\n(a) $1180 for a qualified teacher with no experience,\n\n(b) $1250 for a qualified teacher with one year's experience,\n\n(c) $1310 for a qualified teacher with two or three years' experience.\n\nAttached please find application forms which should be forwarded to Major Mackay in Vancouver.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

At present I have no nominations available for the position of teacher in the Okanagan Indian Day School. As you no doubt know there is difficulty in the west to have qualified teachers for even the white schools and a good number of schools have found it impossible to have qualified teachers.\n\nThe missionary who goes to the Okanagan reserve and I agreed that it would be better to have the school open and the children attending under a capable person even though not a qualified teacher. Miss Fraser was available and is the right type and I nominated her. Although Commissioner MacKay gave no hope that she would be accepted for this school, he nevertheless suggested that she be sent to the Penticton school and Mr. Pitman sent to the Okanagan. Apart from the fact that she is not a qualified teacher whether in Okanagan or Penticton, I have no authority to nominate for Penticton, as it is in the diocese of Nelson.\n\nWe are still looking out for teachers.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop of Kamloops.\nOttawa, 24 January 1947.\n\nLAX,\n\nMajor D.M.

Sister Patricia also wrote to me giving an outline of her experience and manner of working with the Indian children.\n\nThe school at Shalalth, also in this diocese, is badly in need of a teacher, and it is practically impossible to find one in these parts.

While the Department recognizes other teaching certificates for the purposes of the salary schedule, we must insist on Canadian certificates for superannuation applications.

From personal knowledge, I agree with your recommendation concerning the possibility of opening a second school on the Okanagan Reserve at the head of the Okanagan Lake. There is a large centre of population near the mission church and a school there would eliminate the necessity of sending these children to the Kamloops Residential School and would therefore help to relieve the overcrowding at that institution.

(RG 10, Volume 6405, File 833-5, part 1)\nHerewith is a recommendation for the acceptance of lowest tender for the construction of a combined school-house and teacher's residence on the Okanagan Indian reserve, B.C.\n\nThere is no school on this reserve but, as there are over 50 children of school age thereon, it is felt that they should be provided with educational advantages.\n\nPlans and specifications were sent to the Indian Agent, last month, and he was requested to obtain competitive tenders for the construction of the building. On the 24th instant he submitted the tenders which a list is embodied in the report herewith, that of J.F. Moffat of Nelson, B.C. being the lowest, - $4,985.00.\n\nThis tender is stated by the Architectural Department as being fair and reasonable. The amount is covered by the Vote for Education, No. 282.\n\nSection 2, of Section 36, of the Works Act, stipulates that when tenders are received the contract shall be awarded by the Governor General in Council.\n\nIndian Affairs,\n\nSept. 23rd, 1922.\nSir,\u2014 \n\nI beg to enclose herewith in reply to your letter of the 16th ult. tenders which have been handed in for the erection of the Okanagan School. I am forwarding these unopened, and do not know all who have submitted prices. Ferguson, Moffat, and Morley are three included in these, and I know they are all men of undoubted integrity. The specifications are in many respects unusual for this province, measurements being somewhat different, and material not often used out here, and should the lowest tender be much lower than the net lowest, I would respectfully suggest that before accepting it I should be given an opportunity of going into the details of these specifications with the lowest tenderer in case they are not fully understood. The reason I suspect this is that in the case of Mr. Doherty who submitted figures, I do not think he quite realized the position. He is building a small municipal school near Vernon which is quite different from these specifications. I do not wish it to be prejudicial to this party in any way, but believe it is in the best interest of all concerned to mention it.\n\nI also enclose an application received from Mr. Bell of Bell and Curtis which was handed in to this office.

The plasterer who had the contract for this portion of the job has asked permission to put on a sand finish instead of a plaster of Paris finish for the reason that the putty in the plaster finish will have to be made during probable freezing weather taking possibly two weeks to prepare the material rendering it liable to freeze, whereas sand finish can be put on in one day and be dry the next. I have ascertained that most provincial schools have a sand finish.\n\nThe sub-contractor who has the plastering job is a reliable man who has done several government buildings, including the Vernon Post Office, the plastering of which is considered an excellent piece of work, and his application to have this change made is been filed, the cost being the same in either finish. As this work will be started in about two weeks or so, I respectfully request advice by wire if I may be permitted to allow this change in the specifications.\n\nIn this connection I may say that Mr. J.F. Moffat, who received the contract for this School is a man of undoubted integrity. He has a large number business in this town and stands high in the community.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir,\n\nOKANAGAN COMBINED DAY SCHOOL AND TEACHER'S RESIDENCE.\n\nI beg to report that the building of the above school is proceeding very satisfactorily and the shingling was completed yesterday. The specifications have been faithfully carried out by Mr. Moffat as far as they have gone, the only change requested being in the finish of the walls from a plaster of Paris to a sand finish as authorized in your telegram received today which reads:\n\n\"May substitute sand finish for Plaster of Paris\".\n\nIt is expected that the extra time requested for painting the outside of the building will not be required now, as the outside painting can probably be done within the next few days, the weather being still above freezing point in the Valley.\n\nI notice that the whole construction of the building is more substantial than usually seen in this part of Canada, and has been favourably commented upon. If it is not presumptuous for one not an architect to make a suggestion for future schools, I would like to draw attention to the windows in the class room. It appears to me that if they were raised about 12\" or 2 feet they would allow better light on the opposite side of the class room which on a dull day will be noticeable, and will also\nprevent the children looking out of the windows during school hours. Of course this can be accomplished at a sacrifice of some light by painting the lower panes of glass, but in my opinion the better plan would be to raise the windows. Fortunately, the window side of the school is to the south, with no trees, etc., obstructing the light but similar favourable conditions might not always exist in other localities.\n\nIt is hoped that the plans for the Penticton School will not be unduly delayed as the temporary quarters are over-crowded already and not very convenient, the teacher there, Miss Coughlan, is complaining of the lack of space, and difficulty of satisfactorily heating a small crowded room like the priest's house.\n\nI have heard nothing about the Penticton proposed School for some time and trust it will not be overlooked. I am reporting separately upon my visit there last week.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nNovember 24th, 1922.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nWill you kindly let me know whether you think there is any necessity for appointing an Inspector of the work during the construction of the Okanagan Schoolhouse.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from you, in reply, as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nF.J.C.

This Indian is not now, never has been, and I trust never will be a chief of this or any other Band; and apparently the lawyer in question has, as usual, misled you by naming the Indian who selected him a chief.

I have made inquiries in this locality and the Vernon Hardware Co. has a heater for sale for $45.00. It was ordered for another school which afterwards decided on furnace heat instead, and is quite new, has not been unpacked yet and is listed in the manufacturers catalogue at $60.00. It is built to burn wood up to 3 feet 6 inches long and almost any diameter, and there is enough rough timber near the school to last for years. The Hardware Co. say that on account of its size they may have no call for such a heater for a long time hence the price offered.\n\nMay I be advised please whether this heater should be purchased and if not, what steps I should take to obtain one. In ordering one from a distance, the cost of freight should be borne in mind.\n\nIn addition to the heater, I presume a school-room table and chair for the teacher will be necessary when the school is opened on the 3rd January next.\n\nCompetitive prices were asked for thirty \"Silent Sanitary Desks\" or equal and the lowest price $272.50 was tendered by Clarke and Stuart, of Vancouver. The same firms as before were asked to quote. The price is a trifle lower than those purchased for the Penticton School last August when E.G. Farnell, of Vancouver, quoted lowest. At that time 25 desks were purchased, which filled the temporary school room; for\nthis school I have called for tenders for 50 although the school room will hold 50. This is in accordance with your instructions not to purchase more desks than are absolutely necessary.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Fred Ball]\n(F.J.O.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOTTAWA, Dec. 15th, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to the purchase of a heater for the new school building which is nearing completion on the Okanagan Reserve, and stating the price at which you can obtain the same.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase, from the Vernon Hardware Company, at $45.00, of the heater which they had ordered for another school, and which is listed in the manufacturer's catalog at $60.00. You should first, however, make sure that the heater will be satisfactory for the purpose required.\n\nYou may obtain prices for the supplying of a teacher's desk or table and a teacher's chair. The purchase of same should be made from the firm quoting you the lowest price. An abstract of the prices received should accompany your voucher covering the cost of the desk and chair.\n\nIt is noted that you have called for competitive prices for the supplying of 30 desks, as you consider this number is all that is required at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6405, File 833-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nI have the honour to report that the Okanagan combined day school and teacher's residence has been completed and I made a final inspection of the same today. The work has been done in a most satisfactory manner and no attempt made to change the specifications in any way although some of the dimensions, etc., were of a nature not often seen here. On two or three occasions I have taken with me Mr. R.B. Bell, the pioneer architect of Vernon who has done the Bank of Montreal work in this Valley for many years and has built most of the best houses in Vernon so his opinion can be relied upon. He told me today that the job is one of the best he has seen, and that the Department is to be congratulated on the building, which is much superior to the Provincial schools. I appreciated his courtesy, which was offered voluntarily on account of long standing friendship, and feel more assured in reporting the successful completion of building operations seeing that it has been expertly inspected.\n\nNo provision was made for bringing water to the building. There is a creek within 75 yards of the School and by going up stream 1,200 feet enough fall can be obtained to have water piped into the house and I have asked a local man to give me an estimate of labour and material to bury a pipe this distance to a depth of four feet. Upon receipt of this information I will forward full details for your consideration. Mr. Moffat, the contractor of this school is also fire-chief of Vernon, and he states that although there would not be high-pressure in such a pipe-line, it would be of some\nassistance in case of fire. With reference to the usual fire-extinguishers placed in Government buildings, will these be supplied from Ottawa or shall I receive instructions to purchase them? The heater has been set up and has been kept going to thoroughly dry out everything before occupation and I have arranged with a trustworthy Indian, Pierre Louie, to see that a small fire is kept on for another week as in this damp weather there will be much \"sweating\" in the plastering.\n\nMr. Moffat advises me that the heater purchased as per your instructions, is perfectly safe and exactly the right type and size. As fire-chief, I consider his opinion can be accepted in such matters without question.\n\nThese particulars are respectfully submitted for your further instructions.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nDuncan C.

He replied on the 30th, to the effect that the work would be completed within seven days from that date and that during the construction he had carefully supervised the work.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of the 4th instant with reference to the Okanagan Combined Day School and Teacher's Residence.\n\nI have obtained tenders for providing a water supply for the building, but the lowest is $1,150 including material, with the pipe buried four feet for a distance of 1,500 feet, thus giving a fall of 40 feet. This estimate is considerably more than I anticipated and presume the expense is not justified. It will probably be necessary to put in a pump from the creek with a wooden flume to the house which is only a distance of about 30 yards from the creek. Water for irrigation purposes around the school could be brought down in an open ditch by going a few hundred feet above the school, but this of course will be of no use for fire protection.\n\nAs an appropriation is needed for the new Penticton School and later for one on the Spallumcheen Reserve, I am not forwarding the various estimates for the above water supply unless instructed further by you to do so.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nTHE VANCOUVER DAILY PROVINCE\n\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nJan. 13th, 1923.\n\nDominion Government,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nThe Secretary,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nWe beg to acknowledge receipt of your check #3644, dated Jan. 3rd for $2.40, which according to memo. is intended in payment of advertisement for Teacher.\n\nWe are at a loss to know to what account to credit this and shall be glad if you will favor us with further particulars or copy of our original invoice.\n\nThanking you in anticipation,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE PROVINCE.\n\nRK/MG:\nAPPROVED.\nOttawa, January 30th 1923.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to enquiry in your letter of the 13th instant, I beg to say that on behalf of cheque No 3644 for $2.40 sent you recently was in payment of your account of the 13th December 1922 for advertising for a teacher for an Indian day school 15 miles from Vernon.

(RG 10, Volume 6405, File 833-5, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI beg to bring to your attention the plans of the above school (which was duly completed last month). It was pointed out that no heating was provided for in the residential part of the building but we considered the school room heater would be sufficient. However, upon the arrival of Mr. Macdonald and his wife, who has accepted the position of teacher, they complain that such heating arrangement is wholly unsatisfactory, as any heat obtained from the school-room would be figure and totally inadequate. Upon reference to the plans it will be seen that the only chimney provided is in the rear of the building and connects to the kitchen range and the stove in the school-room. I went out to the school on the 27th to try and find some way out of the difficulty. At first I thought it would be possible to put up a small heater in the living-room and connect it with the kitchen chimney, but this is impossible on account of the low ceilings and lack of space. An alternative scheme would be to put a metal pipe from the living-room far up the flue above and carry it out through the roof but however well-protected it might be, the fire risk would still have to be considered.\n\nThe same objection prevented putting a pipe through the east wall of the living-room and carrying it up outside the building, bringing it with stoves from the oven. Another plan would be to build another chimney but this would be an expensive undertaking even if feasible. After reviewing all these circumstances and considering the urgency of getting heat into the living quarters, I have taken the responsibility of ordering a small furnace to be placed in the cellar under the west end of\nthe living room and a register cut through the floor close to the west wall; the furnace smoke pipe to be connected with the present chimney. This will be sufficient to heat the whole of the residential portion of the school, the school room being heated by the present arrangement of a wood stove which is satisfactory. The cost of this, including material and labour will be approximately $175.00. There is only one such furnace in town and it is quite a satisfactory and large enough one for the space to be heated.\n\nI sent a short lettergram today as follows:\n\n\"Okanagan Day School plans do not provide heating in living quarters. If readers have arrived but do not live in the building without heating. I have ordered furnace and have forwarded full report in explanation of this action.\n\nI hope this arrangement, which is the only practical one, will be acceptable to the Department and I would respectfully suggest that in any other plans for buildings of this size & at two chimneys be provided for, or if only one is built that it is placed where stove-pipes can be carried to it from all parts of the building. This appears to me to be a serious defect in the plans provided, which was not noticed before as the weather has been mild enough for the school heater to take care of the other rooms, but as previously stated heat obtained from a classroom would not be sanitary.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(N.J.O.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nGOVERNMENT OF THE DOMINION OF CANADA\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, British Columbia\n\nO K A N A G A N AGENCY\n\nTo Joe Marchand, c/o Indian Agent, Vernon, B.C.\n\n| DATE       | DETAIL                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1931       | To work on irrigation ditch - Okanagan Indian Reserve No.1, as per account attached........ | $3.15  |\n\nJune 9th\n\nJOE MARCHAND\n\nWORK ON IRRIGATION DITCH\n\n1931\nMay 3rd To work on irrigation ditch (digging) 8\u00bd hrs.@ 30\u00a2....$2.55\n\" \" \" \" \" \" \" (horse & man) 1 hr.@ 60\u00a2.... .60\n\n$3.15\n\nI hereby certify that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that all expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This source of water will also furnish the teacher with domestic water during the summer, pending an investigation of a more permanent supply, as requested in your letter of April 21st, (file 164-5-5).\n\nAn old Indian above the school had also put in about an acre of garden truck, which was also threatened.\n\nThis ditch will bring the water on to a level where it will be available for other Indian families, but will require enlarging somewhat. The total cost of labour was $45.60 and in view of the fact that we are required by the Provincial Water Board to bring considerable additional acreage under irrigation from this source, I recommend that only a portion of the cost of this ditch be charged to the School, and have prepared one voucher for $9.90, the balance I would recommend be charged to the funds of the Band, as it is of direct and immediate benefit to the Indians themselves and being used by them.\n\nIt is possible that a small amount of flume at the intake may be necessary at a later date during the dry weather when the level of the creek drops, and this would make an additional cost of about $35.00, but the expense will be avoided if possible, as a main ditch at a much higher level and serving other and more distant land will be required to bring about 400 additional acres under irrigation, and this is being investigated, as soon as the Census is completed.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJODH.\n\n(James Coleman)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nPayment recommended\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(RG 10, Volume 6405)\n\nFile 832-11, part 1\nCowichan Agency - Nanaimo Day School -\nVocational Training. 1924 - 1938\n\nFile 832-17, part 1\nCowichan Agency - Nanaimo Day School -\nCadet Corps Band Set\nSupplies - Accounts. 1938 - 1938\n\nFile 833-1, part 1\nOkanagan Agency - Okanagan Day School -\nGeneral Administration -\nTeachers' Salaries. 1909 - 1937\n\nFile 833-1, part 2\nOkanagan Agency - Okanagan Day School -\nGeneral Administration. 1938 - 1949\n\nFile 833-3, part 1\nOkanagan Agency - Okanagan Day School -\nTeachers' Salaries. 1923 - 1947\n\nFile 833-5, part 1\nOkanagan Agency - Okanagan Day School -\nBuilding Maintenance -\nSupplies - Accounts. 1922 - 1931\n\nFile 833-5, part 2\nOkanagan Agency - Okanagan Day School -\nBuilding Maintenance -\nSupplies - Accounts. 1933 - 1938\n\nFile 833-5, part 3\nOkanagan Agency - Okanagan Day School -\nBuilding Maintenance -\nSupplies - Accounts. 1941 - 1949\n\nFile 833-11, part 1\nOkanagan Agency - Okanagan Day School -\nVocational Training -\nAccounts. 1941 - 1945\n\nFile 834-1, part 1\nOkanagan Agency - Inkaneep Day School -\nGeneral Administration -\nTeachers' Salaries. 1914 - 1936\n\nFile 834-1, part 2\nOkanagan Agency - Inkaneep Day School -\nGeneral Administration -\nTeachers' Salaries. 1936 - 1949\n\nFile 834-1, part 3\nOkanagan Agency - Inkaneep Day School -\nGeneral Administration -\nTeachers' Salaries. 1949 - 1950\n\nFile 834-3, part 1\nOkanagan Agency - Inkaneep Day School -\nTeachers' Salaries. 1915 - 1945\n| Item          | Quantity | Price |\n|--------------|----------|-------|\n| brace        | 1        | $2.25 |\n| small saw    | 1        | $3.16 |\n| pipe 90      | 1        | $3.16 |\n| nails        | 5        | $4.00 |\n| level        | 1        | $6.00 |\n| hinges       | 1        | $1.85 |\n| gauge 75     | 1        | $1.85 |\n| coping saw   | 1        | $0.50 |\n\nTotal: $25.00\n\nIndian Affairs.

It would be fairly easy to pipe water from Silver Hill Creek above the schoolhouse. Possibly Mr. Indian Agent Coleman has made a detailed report on the possibility of providing a pure water supply for the school. He spoke to me about it during the inspection. Ill health at this school is costing the Department considerable expenditure. It will be remembered that I reported an outbreak of Diphtheria which took place here in September, 1931, see my report after inspection during the following December.\n\nHot Air Furnace:\n\nI beg to recommend that the Hot Air Furnace in the basement be connected to the schoolroom, where a hot air register should be constructed. In building the school, provision has been made for the necessary hot air pipe from the furnace, the opening in one wall having been constructed. A suitable hot air pipe and register, with the necessary fittings, would be all that is necessary. If this work was done, the old heater stove and long range of stove pipes should be removed from the schoolroom.\n\nEXTRACT from Asst. Indian Commissioner Perry's letter of March 3rd, 1934, forwarding above report. - Original on File 164-5-6.\n\nArrangements could be made by the Department with the Dominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau whereby its resident engineer at Kamloops, Mr. Corbould, could prepare and submit a report and recommendation together with an estimate of the probable cost of providing a supply of water for the school. The cost should be negligible as it is understood Mr. Corbould is in charge of a considerable district and would probably have other business in the vicinity of Vernon occasionally to attend to and during one of his visits this matter could be looked into.\nOttawa, March 20, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nThe following are extracts from Inspector Barry's report regarding his visit to the Okanagan Indian Day School, on February 14th, last:\n\n\"Considering the very serious series of cases of illness in September, 1933, I wish to again draw the attention of the Department to the poor water supply at this school and to my report on this subject after an inspection on March 20, 1931, and after an inspection on December 8, 1931.

OSOYOOS and OKANAGAN are engaged in spring work on gardening projects, which the teachers use as a method of imparting agricultural principles to the children. It is rather unfortunate that this extremely valuable work does not receive better recognition.\nMay 13th 1934\n\nThe Forest House,\nKilliney,\nEwing's Landing, B.C.\n\nThe Agent,\nIndian Department,\nVernon, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter referring to the possibility of the people in this district being interested in co-operation with the Indian Department, in providing something towards the salary of a nurse who would include this district with the Indian reserve at the head of Okanagan Lake, I have spoken to several people on the subject and find that most of them are not much interested, principally for the reasons you mentioned in our conversation last week - they can all communicate with doctors in Kelowna and Vernon by phone and if they are seriously ill, generally go into hospital. Mrs. Hodges of Killiney and myself would be willing to contribute annually towards a salary for a nurse for the Indian Reserve, and I have been wondering if it is possible to form a district to include the common needs of this Indian Reserve and adjoining it, i.e., Grandview Plateau and Moore, both of which are quite accessible to the Reserve, or more so, than the District on the west side of Okanagan Lake. I might also mention that the school at Ewing's Landing is inspected by Drs. Knox & Ootmar of Kelowna, who always bring the district nurse from Kelowna with them.\n\nMy daughter is very much interested in the suggested plan for a nurse for the Indian Reserve. She was trained at the Jubilee Hospital in Victoria and is now in Boston, Mass., taking a post-graduate course in maternity work at the Boston Lying-in Hospital - the best of its kind in the U.S.A. She wishes to take a course in Public Health and is much interested in social work, and if the Indian Department decide to form a district on this Reserve she would be willing to inspect the school and visit families when there is illness, she would like to apply for the job. It would be an advantage in many ways to have a person who could live in her own home, and be within reach of her work, and operate her own car. I do not know anything about the Grandview Plateau district, but as far as distance from here is concerned, it would be no greater than Wilson's Landing.\n\nTrusting to hear from you shortly,\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"E.A.

Nevertheless, Mrs. Killiney and myself would be willing to contribute annually towards a salary for a nurse for the Indian Reserve, and I have been wondering if it is possible to form a district to include the country north of this Indian Reserve and adjoining it, i.e., Grandview Flats, and Meafe, both of which are quite as accessible to the Reserve, or more so, than the district on the west side of Okanagan Lake. I might also mention that the school at Swing's Landing is inspected by Mrs. Knox a teacher of Kelowna, who always brings the district nurse from Kelowna with them.\n\nMy daughter is very much interested in the suggested plan for a nurse for the Indian Reserve. She was trained at the Jubilee Hospital in Victoria and is now in Boston, Mass., taking a post-graduate course in maternity work at the Boston Lynn-In Hospital\u2014the best of its kind in the U.S.A. She wishes to take a course in Public Health and is much interested in Social Work, and if the Indian Department decide to form a district outside Reserve and to appoint a nurse to inspect the school and visit families, when there is illness, she would like to apply for the job. It would be an advantage in many ways to have a nurse who could live in her own home, and be within reach of her work, and operate her own car. I do not know anything about the Grandview Flats district, but as far as distance from here is concerned, it would be no greater than Wilson's Landing.\n\nTrusting to hear from you shortly,\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"E.A. Peace\"\nSir:\n\nre: Your File No.164-5-5.\n\nReplying to your letter of March 17th with reference to Mr. Inspector Barry's report of February 14th re periodical inspection of this school by a qualified nurse, I beg to advise that I have been making enquiries, but so far have been quite unable to find any means by which this service could be adequately performed by a nurse.\n\nThe school is situated seventeen miles from Vernon, the nearest town, and in winter is often inaccessible to car travel by reason of snow drifts. A combination such as we have at Osoyoos Reserve, where a Victorian Order Nurse visits the Reserve and school at least once a week and spends the rest of her time with the white population, would be a satisfactory arrangement, but there appears to be very little likelihood of anything being done along these lines in the neighbourhood as the area adjacent to the Reserve is too sparsely populated to support a nurse, except on the Vernon side, which, of course, is served by medical practitioners.\n\nI have discussed the question with the Department's Medical Officer for this Reserve, Dr. E.G. Baldwin. This officer's work with the Okanagan Band has increased to such an extent during the past four years that he has found it necessary to take on a partner, Dr. Pettman. There has been a very marked increase in maternity work alone. A few years ago practically all such cases were handled on the Reserve by Indian midwives, but they are increasingly demanding medical attention. Also there is the increasing demand of the Department for special attention to such matters as trachoma, tuberculosis, communicable diseases, etc. Dr. Baldwin suggested that it might be found more economical to include the special care of the school in his official duties, and that for an increase of his remuneration to $100.00 per month, he would undertake at least two routine visits to the school with his own nurse each month, and any special work that may be found necessary. Dr. Pettman's association with him ensures continuity of the work.\n\nThere would be undoubted advantages in this arrangement, in that the children would not only have the attention of a nurse, but what, in my opinion, is much more important, the individual oversight of a competent practitioner. Such an arrangement last year when we had an outbreak of Bacillus Enteritidis among one family of school children would have avoided four deaths and extremely heavy hospital and medical accounts, which amounted to probably somewhere about $1,000.00. Dr. Baldwin's present salary is $66.60 less 10%, per month. I would venture the opinion that he and his partner are the most competent medical men in the agency.\n\nThe extension of Dr. Baldwin's work would cost an\nadditional $40.00 per month. To secure and operate with a nurse from Vernon in the ordinary way would involve a minimum return trip of 34 miles, and over to the extent of visitation of children's homes, so that on a basis of 10\u00a2 per mile there would be a minimum cost of $3.40 per trip, and in addition the nurse's fees for the day. From a point of cost alone, it is questionable whether any saving would be effected.\n\nI have been in communication with Mrs. E.A. Pease, who resides about 10 miles south of the southern extremity of the Reserve, and about 15 miles from the school, and I enclose a copy of her letter, which is not particularly helpful and the suggestion that she and another lady contribute to the cost of medical services for the Indians, I presume could hardly be considered, notwithstanding the philanthropic motive which actuates the offer.\n\nPersonally, I am rather inclined to the Medical Officer handling the proposition as suggested, particularly in view of the fact that his present remuneration is, in any event, not commensurate with the calls on his services.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSIR,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(James Coleman)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA\nSir:\n\nRe: Your File No.164-5-5.\n\nReplying to your letter of March 17th with reference to Mr. Inspector Barry's report of February 14th re periodic inspection of this school by a qualified nurse, I beg to advise that I have been making enquiries, but so far have been quite unable to find any means by which this service could be adequately performed by a nurse.\n\nThe School is situated seventeen miles from Vernon, the nearest town, and in winter is often inaccessible to car travel by reason of snow drifts.

Pease, who resides about 10 miles south of the southern extremity of the Reserve, and about 15 miles from the school, and I enclose a copy of her letter, which is not particularly helpful and the suggestion that she and another lady contribute to the cost of medical services for the Indians, I presume could hardly be considered, notwithstanding the philanthropic motive which actuates the offer.\n\nPersonally, I am rather inclined to the Medical Officer handling the proposition as suggested particularly in view of the fact that his present remuneration is, in any event, not commensurate with the calls on his services.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n(James Coleman)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA\nMay 25th, 1934\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn reading your letter Ok.l-10-2 of May 17th the Department is struck at once with the possibility of Trachoma among the Indians of the school under discussion.

This job was recommended by Mr. Inspector Barry. The work consists of connecting the furnace to the class room, which at present is heated by a stove with a very long stove pipe to the chimney, constituting a considerable fire hazard.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd.

I was absent at Vancouver in connection with the admission of Basil McLeod, alleged insane Indian of the Okanagan Band, to the Provincial Mental Hospital, and the fitting of an artificial arm for Tommy Christian, Indian of the Spellumcheen Band, when the new teacher arrived, and it was necessary for one of the staff to be at the school in order to turn over to the new teacher, the keys, records and supplies, and check things over generally, and as the school is seventeen miles from the railroad, it was naturally more convenient to take her along for this purpose.\n\nMiss Heelas has from time to time done a considerable amount of running around for the Department in her private car when I have been absent from Vernon elsewhere in the Agency, and provision for this contingency has always been made in my Estimates, there being no Constable here who would in the ordinary way attend to such matters, and this is the first time payment has been requested for her.\n\nUnder the circumstances, I would respectfully request reconsideration of the matter\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(James Coleman)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir:\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would kindly obtain from the Department authority to purchase materials for hot drinks for the children of the three Day Schools attached to this Agency, the amount authorized in the past being $5.00 per month for each School from November to March.\n\nI have received enquiries from the teachers as to whether it will be possible for the Department to provide small amounts for the purchase of Christmas prizes to be given out at the small entertainment usually held on the last school day before Christmas, as the children look forward to this so much.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(James Coleman)\nIndian Agent.\n\nC.C.

In building the school, provision has been made for this hot air pipe and an opening in one wall constructed. All that is required now is the necessary pipe, and register, and the work of installing these. The old heater in the schoolroom is not now satisfactory. It is smoking and needs a guard placed around it if it is to remain there. With extra desks when they are supplied, it will be in the way in its present position. There is a very long smoke pipe. In any case, this pipe should be cleaned out at once. I believe that there is much soot in it.

The exterior surfaces are in a very dry condition, the paint worn off, leaving the surfaces exposed to the weather elements. Due to this condition a noticeable shrinkage has taken place on west wall. Shingles are in fair condition but need repainting soon as their preservation is to be maintained. Foundation walls are showing full of hair line cracks allowing the penetration of moisture which in a short time will weaken the strength of the walls and permit spalling.\n\nMaterials needed:\n\n- Foundation walls - Concrete - 178 linear feet\n- Average height of 2' 6\" = 445 sq. ft., material needed for this surface, Cement Paint together with primer.\n- 1 gal. of paint and 2 gals of primer, colour gray\n- 1 gal. of paint @ $3.50 per gallon ----------------------$3.50\n- 2 gals Primer @ $2.85 --------------------------------$5.70\n\n- Walls - Siding - There is estimated to be 2350 sq. ft. surfaces on the four walls for which is recommended a coat application of suitable paint. Material necessary -\n- 7 gals. suitable paint @ $3.00 ---------------$21.00\n- 3 gals. suitable paint @ $3.10 ---------------$9.30\n\n- Sufficient white paint estimated in above quantity for two coat application in colour (white) for flashing eaves, window frames and trim, together with inside ceiling.\n\n- Roof - An estimated roof area of 600 sq. ft. over all.\n- 10 gallons shingle paint necessary for this surface, colour gray @ $2.75 ----------------------$3.00\n\n- Porch - Porch and four sets of steps\n- 1 gal. of deck and porch paint, colour gray, to each wall, two coats, 1 gal. @ $3.85 ----------------------$3.85\n\nBefore the painting of the shingles is commenced send replacement of roof ridge boards. Further send caulking of flashing surrounding the chimney. The repainting of all mortar joints.\n\n1 gallon of caulking @ $2.75 ----------------------$1.50\nINTERIOR: Interior walls plastered red, fir floors. The class room walls, the portion above the wainscoting to ceiling, are discoloured and owing to the texture or finish of the plaster, encourages and permits dust and dirt to cling to these surfaces. The floor surface is worn and splintered in places and has a dismal appearance. Two cloak rooms are in a similar condition to the class room. The teacher's quarters, upstairs and down, plastered walls, same texture as that of the class rooms and needs re-decorating.\n\nClass Room - Floor - 24' x 40' two cloak rooms 5' x 12'\nI recommend the painting of these surfaces, an application of suitable stain, followed by a protective coating of Varnish. Material required:\n3 gals. stain @ 4.00------------------------12.00\n2 gals. Varnish @ 3.25 per gal.------------6.50\n\nPlastered Wall Surfaces - Estimated 132 sq. ft. in school room and cloak rooms requiring 5 gallons of paint for two coats, colour Eye Rest Green, recommended, which affords the maximum light diffusion.\n5 gals. Paint @ 3.10 per gal.-------------15.50\n\nCeilings - Lumber (V Joint) - 1080 sq. ft. in Class Room and cloak rooms. Previously painted. Surface should be thoroughly cleaned (washed).

This surface shall be thoroughly washed, allowed to dry and given a one coat application of Varnish.\n2 gals. @ 3.25--------------------------6.50\n\nSufficient Varnish in the above has been allowed for the doors and window trim.\n\nLiving quarters - Two bedrooms - Living room and Kitchen.\nFloor areas - 560 sq. ft. Recommend the same material for these floors as the class room, requiring 2 gallons of floor stain @ 4.00 per gal.----------------------8.00\n1 gal. Varnish @ 3.25----------------------3.25\n\nWall Areas - 1440 sq. ft. This will require a two coat application. Recommended colours, mauve for living room and bedrooms, colour Buff for kitchen, all white ceilings. Materials required:\n4 gals. suitable paint, mauve @ 3.25------13.00\n1 gal. suitable paint, Buff @ 3.25---------3.25\n2 gals. suitable paint, White @ 3.25-------6.50\n\nCeiling requirements are included in the above. There is sufficient material allowed in above estimate to include staircase, which shall be given a two coat application of Varnish.\n\nTotal Material costs ------------------------$163.85\n\nMy estimates were intended to cover the exterior work only. It would depend whether the $250.15 balance over cost of material would be sufficient for labour as to how far the interior work could be carried out, if and when the work is authorized.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(James Coleman)\nIndian Agent.\n\nC.

Beatty of Vancouver, B.C. for $108.60 covering paint for the Okanagan Indian Day School as authorized in your letter of the 1st of August, 1936.\n\nYour letter indicated that preferably Indian labour be employed on this job and unfortunately it was not found possible to employ such labour during the summer recess, those capable being fully engaged with other work, and painting during the winter recess was out of the question on account of weather conditions, consequently the material was ordered in ample time to do the work during the Easter recess, but unfortunately instead of shipping the material from the Vancouver warehouse the paint Company sent it from Toronto and it arrived too late to undertake the work before the school re-opens and the material will have to be held until the school closes in July. This account is somewhat higher than the original estimate owing to Surcharge (Sales Tax) and that it was found necessary to obtain a sealing compound for the plaster walls as otherwise the cost of removing the old decoration off the rough cast plaster would have been prohibitive. It is expected that the cost of painting will be approximately $50.00.\n\nMessrs Beatty Limited were requested to forward receipted freight account and it does not appear that the attached Bill of Lading constitutes a receipt. I have requested that this be forwarded to me and on receipt it will be sent to you, but I deemed it advisable to forward the accounts owing to the close of the fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(James Coleman)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nC.\n**THIS MEMORANDUM**\n\nFor use in connection with the Form of Straight Bill of Lading approved by the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada by Order No. 7652 of 15th July, 1908.\n\nIs an acknowledgment that a bill of lading has been issued and is not the Original Bill of Lading, nor a copy or duplicate, covering the property named herein, and is intended solely for filing or records.\n\n**Company**  \nAgent's No.\n\n**Shipper's No.**\n\n---\n\n**at LEASIDE, (TORONTO) ONTARIO,**  \nfrom **THE TREMCO MANUFACTURING CO., (Canada) Limited**\n\nThe goods described below, in apparent good order, except as noted (contents and condition of contents of packages unknown), marked, consigned and destined as indicated below, which said Company agrees to carry to its usual place of delivery at said destination, if on its road, otherwise to deliver to another carrier on the route to said destination.

Hepworth covering a picnic lunch supplied in Vernon to pupils and former pupils of the Okanagan Indian Day School on May 12th, Coronation Day.\n\nI may say that all rural schools were invited by the City of Vernon to participate in the School parade and Coronation festivities. As the Okanagan Indian Day School is situated sixteen miles from Vernon, it was necessary to provide transportation and Mr. Que, one of the Chinese lessees on the Indian Reserve, kindly offered to bring all the children in by truck. Thirty-two children were provided with a picnic lunch, the City of Vernon providing all rural children with their suppers.\n\nI may say the children made a very creditable showing in the Parade and much favourable comment was heard.\n\nAs over 200 sandwiches were made, the cost per lunch per child amounting to only 13\u00a2, I would respectfully recommend payment of the attached account.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Jas.

Grist for labour painting Okanagan Indian Day School. When this work was undertaken it was found to be a much more difficult problem than anticipated due to the fact that all the plaster work in the building was extremely rough cast, very dirty and a great deal of it covered very badly with kalsomine, which was very hard to remove. Due to the sharp sand particles in the rough cast it was found that ordinary brush work would prove expensive as the brushes wore out quickly and it was hard to get satisfactory coverage. Consequently I supplied a paint sprayer at my own cost and the work proceeded satisfactorily except that the paint supply was found insufficient and it was necessary to secure additional paint locally to finish the job.\n\nThere has been some delay in closing out this matter due to difficulty in securing the accounts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Jas.

While a receipt for $2.41 was forwarded, the account slips amounted to only $2.16. There was an entry on the top of one of the slips reading, as follows:\n\n\"25\u00a2 white sugar owing\".\n\nPresent regulations are so strict that I regret that this small item cannot be paid, as it was not included in the proper place on the account slip. A cheque for $4.75 is being forwarded to Miss McDonald, and, in order to obtain payment of the 25 cents, it will be necessary to forward another account from the Hudson's Bay Company showing that they supplied sugar to this amount.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nR.

It is presumed that we will hear further from you with regard to the painting of the interior of this schoolroom. From personal knowledge, I agree with your recommendation concerning the possibility of opening a second school on the Okanagan Reserve at the head of the Okanagan Lake. There is a large centre of population near the mission church and a school there would eliminate the necessity of sending these children to the Kamloops Residential School and would therefore help to relieve the overcrowding at that institution. It is noted that you will have Mr. Indian Agent Barber investigate the possibility of having a well dug at this school.

Hoping this meets with your approval.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJAW: DKG\n\n\"We cover the Okanagan and Fraser Valley\"\nDepartment of Mines & Resources, Indian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Okanagan Indian Day School\nAgency Ref. #164\n\nWith reference to Okanagan Indian Day School and the remarks passed by the teacher, Sister Patricia in the letter attached, I would suggest that the Department authorize the installation of a new larger size furnace at a cost of approximately $350.00 installed. The old furnace, which was never satisfactory, being too small, has now reached the worn out and burnt out stage that makes it useless. I understand from the firm that installed it twenty-five years ago, that it was the only furnace available at the time it was installed and was too small for the building.\n\nI recommend that a wood-burning furnace be installed as it is not reasonable to have coal hauled 16 miles to the school when there is ample wood available on the reserve. I also request authority to purchase a new box heater at a cost of approximately $35.00 for use in the class room, it being required during the spring and fall and on rainy days for heating lunches, drying clothes and heat when the furnace is not required.\n\nThe remarks of the teacher regarding the condition of the class room is correct; the lighting is bad, the walls being a dark green and the ceiling requires fixing as also do the living quarters of the school and the extension of the building and one new set of steps is required at the girls' entrance.\n\nI attach hereto an estimate of the cost of painting the school inside and out which appears to me to be somewhat\nhigh, but the way conditions are at this time, everything is high and the cost of labour particularly so. Whilst it may be that I could purchase the material and pay the Indians wages for this work, I would advise that the Indians are all fully occupied in the vegetable fields and would not be available for the work during the busy summer season. I therefore recommend that this tender amounting to $11.00 for the full job be considered by the Department and that I be advised accordingly at the earliest possible date in order to get the job completed before opening of the school in September. If this tender is considered too high, then please authorize the work to be carried out to the best advantage so I will at least get the interior of the school painted by September.\n\nAlso requested is authority for the expenditure of $50.00 in the provision of new steps at the school entrance and mother minor repairs to the building. The steps are essential, one set having been removed as a hazard to the safety of the children.\n\nAttached list covers the requirements as stated above.\n\n(Alfred H. Barber)\nSuperintendent\nOkanagan Indian Agency\n| Item Description                                      | Cost   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1 new furnace (wood burning) installed @ approximately| $350.00|\n| 1 large box type heater @ approx.                    | $35.00 |\n| Painting interior and exterior of building           | $111.00|\n| new steps and general minor repairs                  | $50.00 |\n| **Total**                                            | **$1246.00** |\nJuly 28, 1948.\n\nMr. A.H. Barber, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Vernon, B.C.\n\nThe attached requisition has been received from Sister Patricia but has not been approved by you.\n\nWe are inclined to feel that the quantities of materials mentioned could be reduced.

We do not supply sufficient materials from this appropriation to enable certain garments to be made and given to Indians.\n\nBernard F.

In view of the expenditure involved, we would have preferred if you had forwarded your letter through the office of Indian Commissioner Arnell.\n\nHowever, in order not to delay the work unnecessarily, the following expenditures are approved:\n\n(1) New well and pump at a cost of $175.00 to $225.00.\n\n(2) Installation of a new furnace in the teacher's living quarters.\n\nIn this connection you should communicate with Indian Commissioner Arnell as he will no doubt be able to secure the furnace in Vancouver at the lowest possible price.\n\n(3) Purchase of a new box heater for the class room at a cost of approximately $35.00.\n\n(4) An expenditure of $225.00 for painting the interior of the building.\n\nWe are not prepared, at the present time, to authorize the expenditure for staining the roof and painting the exterior.\n\nBernard F.

C.\n\nRe: Okanagan Indian Day School\nYour File No. 10-11-L\n\nWith regard to the well authorized for this school I regret to advise that I have deemed it necessary to discontinue the digging of this well and have instructed the contractor to cease operations and to fill in the hole.\n\nI had authorized him to go down to a depth of 40 feet, and although this depth showed every indication of water for the last 20 feet, the gravel being saturated, no flow was reached and it would appear that possibly no water would be reached until the level of the lake was reached and this would have been probably 100 feet deeper and too deep to draw with a hand pump.\n\nThe condition encountered was amazing in that the site is 200 feet from the creek which has a good continuous flow and the terrain is of coarse gravel, and water in ample supply was expected at about 20 feet at the deepest. It would appear that the well spreads over a wide area through a deep strata or overburden of coarse gravel. The expenditure made in this regard is therefore a total loss which is very unfortunate.\n\n(Alfred H. Barber)\nSuperintendent\nOkanagan Indian Agency.\nOctober 13th, 1948.\n\nA. H. Barber, Esq., Indian Superintendent, Vernon, B.C.\n\nRe: Water Supply - Okanagan Bay School\n\nI have your letter of October 9th wherein you advise that although a well at the Okanagan Indian Bay School site was sunk to a depth of forty feet no water was secured. I also note that the well site is within 100 feet of a creek which has a fairly continuous flow. This stream presumably was the source of the water supply to the school in the past and it has occurred to me that providing the water is uncontaminated and volume and sufficient head are available the water supply problem for the school might be met by the installation of an hydraulic ram.\n\nInformation with respect to hydraulic rams is contained in a handbook of Practical Information on Irrigation published by the Provincial Department of Lands, a copy of which should be on file in your office. You will note from this handbook that a drop of five feet through a drive pipe of thirty feet would provide for a maximum lift of thirty-five feet and that by varying the length and fall of the drive pipe various lifts can be secured.\n\nWill you please investigate and report whether or not the installation of a ram at this point would be feasible and desirable.\n\n-En\n\nM.E. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOctober 19, 1948.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nWe are in receipt of your voucher No. 329 for $200.00 covering the cost of painting the interior of the Okanagan Indian Day School. On your voucher you quote authority letter dated July 27th.\n\nIf you review the contents of the letter of July 27th, you will note that the original quotation we received from Webster Brothers for the interior painting was $225.00 and this was the amount authorized in the letter mentioned.\n\nIt is very unusual for us to receive an account for less than the quotation and I would appreciate it if you would advise me if Webster Brothers are prepared to accept $200.00 in full payment of their account.\n\nBernard F.

Mr. Hatt's letter of July 15th is enclosed, together with tenders from Joe Gabriel and Webster Brothers which indicate that the improvements required, all of which should be carried out this year, will cost $2,150.00.\n\nAlthough it is unfortunate that no specific provision was made in the Estimates, the work is necessary and I would recommend that the Department endeavour to make funds available so that it may be proceeded with. It is hoped that with the appointment of a new Superintendent at Vernon, these matters will be attended to and that adequate provision will be made for any expenditures required.\n\nJ.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner\nVernon, B.C.\nJuly 15th, 1949.\n\nMr. W.S.

Please note that Webster Bros.' estimate was forwarded to Joe Gabriel and is included in his estimate.\n\nI have found it difficult to get a contractor who is interested in this work, as the school is approximately 15 miles from town and there is no electricity so no power tools can be used.\n\nHaving gone over this work carefully, I find it is all quite necessary, and am unable to recommend that any of it be left until next year. However, should it be possible to complete this work this year, no further repairs should be necessary for quite some time.\n\nWith regard to the well, $435.00 was spent on this before and no water was found. I feel it would be quite easy to pipe water from the Creek, but as yet do not know just what length and size pipe will be required.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(D.M.

They have over 20 children of school age and he assures me that the majority of the Indians are in favor of the proposition. The Indians when I was there last were just starting on a hunting expedition but will on their return duly sign a requisition in council assembled for a school. The only difficulty I foresee is the distance from the nearest white settlement which is about eight miles but that can be overcome by appointing a male teacher if the Department is prepared to build a school house and pay the teachers salary. I have the furnishings at Enderby and could have them moved if so desired but I am also very hopeful that the Spallumcheen Indians will in the near future be willing to have a school on the Reserve.\n\nKindly advise.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nMr. Agent Brown states that he has been requested by the Chief of the Inkameeo Band to apply for the establishment of a school on the Osayocs Reserve.\n\nThe census return shows that there are 20 children of school age and the Agent states that the majority of the Indians are in favour of having a school there. This is a small band, but a number of them are well-to-do, having considerable stock and making money out of their fruit, and I think they should show their interest in the education of their children by providing a building in which to hold the school. If they were willing to do this I would recommend that the Department pay the salary of the teacher.\n\nThere are no Indian schools in the Okanagan Agency and the white schools have objected to the Indian children attending.\n\nThe furnishings which were bought for Enderby are available and from the objections raised by the Indians at\nat that locality to a school I would not recommend the Department to expend anything for buildings.

As to her teaching she has not taught on the Reservation of my knowledge, but she has a good education, a good interpreter, and very bright and in my opinion should make an able teacher. The only objection I have in mind she was a little flighty, not vicious, when a girl. She is 26 years of age and a widow, was married to a Flat Head Indian.

The Chief, as spokesman for the Band, claimed that they were desirous of retaining John Norwood as teacher of their school, claiming that the scholars as well as the parents were delighted with him. They also claimed that the Reserve was some ten miles from the nearest Hotel, they did not anticipate any trouble from that source.\n\nThey maintain that if Norwood, who can speak the Indian language was permitted to teach the children for this season, they would be perfectly willing to have a white man carry on the work, which according to their statement Norwood is doing so well. After the meeting I visited the School and was surprised to find that the children were very much interested in their work and I also found several parents visiting the school. Before closing Norwood taught the children a Patriotic Song and then they adjourned for a game of baseball. Under the circumstances I am afraid it would do no good to interfere with the present arrangement as every member of the Band is in favor of retaining Norwood and would\nadvise that for the time being things be left as they are unless something should intervene which would necessitate interference.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nSecretary,\n\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 27, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant in further reference to the proposed new school for the Indians of the Osoyoos Band and enclosing a communication received by you from Chief Baptiste George stating that the Indians have appointed a negro, John Norwood by name, as teacher of their school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will not approve of this man being appointed in view of your statements concerning him and he should be at once removed from the reserve.

She was educated partly in a non-reservation school at Fort Shaw, Montana, after which she married a mixed blood by the name of McLeod, from whom she has been separated for some years. I do not know if she is divorced. Her reputation among the Indians of this reservation is that of one who is morally unfit to have anything to do with children and on that ground alone I could not possibly recommend her. So far as I know she has had no experience as a class room teacher or as a teacher of any kind, industrial, literary or otherwise, although I would not undertake to say that she is not qualified as an Industrial instructor. But her character is such that I know you would not care to employ her.\n\nVery respectfully,\n\n(Sgd.) J.M.

I found that though Norwood is himself illiterate, yet the progress of the Indian children who have been under his tuition for so short a time, has been marvellous. In reading, writing and arithmetic they have made splendid progress and for children who did not know a word of English they have done wonders. As the children advance it will be necessary to change the teacher but the Indians only requested to have Norwood until the children had learned to speak English.\n\nIt would perhaps be well, subject to approval, to have a change after the midsummer holidays. There were only two terms last year from April until June inclusive and from September until December 30th.

They cannot understand why the Government is offering to educate their children. They have often asked me to explain whether the Government wish to have his money returned at some future date either in cash or will they be obliged to give up their reservation for the payment of the education of the younger members.\n\nIf your office could write and explain this question I am sure that I will get more children to teach.\n\nThe Indian has to be convinced who is paying for the teacher at present.\n\nThe Chief here is anxious to have a good school situated here but the older members has caused us trouble. They are too suspicious.\n\nReport dated,-Feb. 6th, 1916.\nOttawa, February 20th, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nIn her annual report on the Cacovoa day school, the teacher, Miss C. Holcomb states that the greatest drawback to the progress of the school is caused by the elder Indians, who cannot understand why the Department is offering to educate their children. She further says that some of the Indians are afraid that they will have to give up their land in payment of the education of the children.\n\nOn your next visit to this reserve, you should hold a meeting of all the members of this band, and explain fully to them the Department's educational policy. The education of their children is costing them nothing and there is no reason for them not sending their children to school. There is no danger of their land being forfeited to pay for the cost of education.\n\nIt is hoped that your influence will engender a better feeling towards the school.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nJ. Robert Brown, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSummerland, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith School Report for the Inkhamep Reserve, Osoyoos School.\n\nThis unfortunately is the only school at present in this Agency so that no comparison can be made. The teacher appears to be very conscientious in trying to get as many children as possible to attend, but meets with the usual opposition. The school made a bad start by employing a negro named Norwood as its first teacher, and the children were learning English with a decided negro accent, but acquired nothing else in the way of education.\n\nSome of the boys are eager to learn and take much interest in their studies.\n\nThe teacher's chief complaint is the lack of housing. She is living in a tent which is unsuitable for winter and will not live with any Indians on the Reserve. I am endeavoring to have the Band put up a small house for her as they are well able to afford to do so.\n\nI have secured the names of 71 children of school age living at the Hall-of-the-Lake reserve near Vernon. They are widely scattered and three schools are really necessary, but for the present if two were started on the reserve it would cover the larger part of it. One difficulty would be the accommodation for the teachers, who would be white teachers I presume. At the North end of the reserve...\nthere is a settlement of white ranchers who would probably give accommodation to a teacher for the school at this end and the Council-house could be utilised as the School house. At the South end there is no building which could be used for a school and the distance would be too great for a teacher to live at the north end and teach at the south end of the reserve, and there are no white people near.\n\nWhile there are 71 children on the reserve, the proportion attending school unless compelled would be small, less than one half of this number, probably not more than 25 or 30 being likely to attend voluntarily.\n\nAt Penticton there is no difficulty either as regards the school building or accommodation for the teacher as both are available, and with the necessary authority of the Department the School could open after the summer vacation.\n\nAt Enderby we have the same conditions as at Penticton, but in view of the possibility of this Reserve being sold for 'Soldier Settlement' purposes, the matter will remain in abeyance at present.\n\nIt is therefore respectfully requested that instructions be forwarded to me to make the necessary arrangements for schools to be opened at Penticton and Head-of-the-Lake Reserves as outlined above, when a more detailed report could be made.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nAss't Deputy I Secretary\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\nAugust 2nd, 1919.\n\nMr. Mackenzie,\n\nNo letter of July 18th from Agent Hall and letter of July 21st from Inspector Negraw.\n\nBoth these letters refer to educational matters in the Okanagan Agency and reach the same conclusions. The situation is as follows:\n\n1. Inakeep Reserve,\n   School in operation. Agent is endeavoring to have Indians build small house for teacher.\n\n2. Head-of-the-Lake Reserve, (near Vernon).\n   71 children of school age. Unless compelled to do so not more than 25 or 30 would likely attend.\n\n   Owing to these Indians being widely scattered two schools would be required, and are recommended:\n   (a) North end of reserve, Council house could be utilized as school. Teacher could obtain accommodation with some of the white ranchers.\n   (b) South end of reserve, Establish school at Siwash Creek or Six Mile Creek. Building for school and accommodation for teacher would be required. Inspector estimates cost of suitable building at $500.00 or thereabouts.\n\n3. Penticton Reserve,\n   Both school building and accommodation for teacher is available. Use Council-house as school. Agent recommends opening of school at once and states it could be ready after summer vacation.\n\n4. Enderby Reserve,\n   As this reserve will possibly be sold for Soldiers' Settlement, both Agent and Inspector recommend that no action be taken at present.\n\nSpeaking about the situation generally, Inspector Negraw states:\n1. That R.C. church authorities are in favor of residential schools and appear to be opposed to Indian day schools.\n2. Both Agent and Inspector are agreed that if schools are established, compulsory attendance must be enforced.\n3. It is desirable, where possible, though not essential, that the teacher have knowledge of the Indian language.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I took up the matter with various day schools near enough to Reserves to permit Indian children to attend, and succeeded in nearly every case in obtaining their consent to take them in, Westbank Townsite School alone objecting. The Teachers encourage the Indians to send their children to school as it means extra pay for them, and it would appear that this arrangement is both satisfactory and economical, as it costs less than providing teachers and schools on the Reserves.

It appears that the Indians put up a building a few years ago and employed a negro teacher and paid him salary from money raised by themselves. As soon as the Department took over the school, the negro offered to return the money to the Indians, stating that he was paid by the Government, but the Indians refused in the majority of cases to receive the money back from him for fear, as Manuel Louie stated, that if they took government money for school purposes their reserve would be ultimately taken from them. It was explained to them that this was a nonsensical idea, as the people of Canada voted the money for Indian education and would not look to the Indians to repay the money in any form.\n\nI only mention this to show how ingrained their prejudice seemed to be and hence the difficulty in dealing with such unrepresentative Indians. I think that this school has now an attendance of 9 pupils and is maintained by the Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF.G. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\nOTTAWA, January 16th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, forwarding the December quarterly return of the Osoyoos Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is noted the teacher, Miss Hozier, closed the school for the Christmas holidays on December 16th, and had school open 49 days during the quarter.\n\nI am enclosing herewith two copies of Indian Day School Regulations, which will show the number of teaching days in the year, duration of each term and holidays allowed. I will be pleased if you will forward a copy to Miss Hozier for her information as to the holidays allowed and when each term ends. It is hoped that she will comply with these regulations insofar as possible.\n\nFull salary and bonus will be paid Miss Hozier for the December quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 1st inst enclosing two copies of Indian B.Y School Regulations which I do not appear to have received before, and to thank you for the same.\n\nWith reference to the date the Osoyoos School was closed for the Christmas holidays, I was responsible for this. I did not know there were any Regulations governing this, and when Miss Hunter inquired me to the proper date, I told her we would use the same dates for the Christmas holidays as the Public Schools in this Province.\n\nA copy of the Regulations has been forwarded to Miss Hunter for future guidance.\n\nThis teacher is not very satisfactory and for the past six months I have been trying to find another one. This School is very isolated and the teacher must of necessity live on the Reserve and there is no suitable house for her. Miss Hunter being of part Indian blood, she lives with a relative there, but few white women if any would care to do the same.\n\nThere are about 12 children living near enough to attend the School, and some of these come several miles which means that in Winter as soon as the snow gets deep they are unable to attend regularly.\n\nThe parents of the school children are anxious to have their children educated, while the other Indians resent having the School at all, so that it is kept up under difficulties, but as this is the only School in the Agency at present, I try to give it every encouragement possible.\n\nUp hitherto the School has closed at 3 p.m. in Winter and only 30 minutes allowed at noon. The reason for this is that it is very desirable that the children have time to reach their homes before dark.\n\nThis Reserve is mostly steep mountain, and there are no doubt cougars and bear also occasionally on the Reserve last year they reported a grizzly also, and although they emigrated, the children are no doubt nervous after dark.\n\nAs a further instance of the difficulties here, when visiting the School last summer I found the teacher and children trying to drive out a brood of rattle-snakes from under the floor of the School. They were able to go through the floor during school-hours and disturb them. 3 snakes were killed and 4 were in the School room and though they were not afraid of them it was necessary to clear them out, which was done. These incidents are irrelevant and are mentioned in explanation of any departure from the Regulations.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst Deputy & Secretary\nDep. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n(Supt.of Indian Education)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6405, File 834-1, part 1)\nOTTAWA, February 2nd, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 24th ultimo, regarding the closing of the Osoyoos Indian day school for the Christmas holidays.\n\nIn reply I beg to say with reference to the regulations for Indian day schools that these are intended to govern generally, the hours of opening and closing the schools, and the days to be taught. In special cases, like that of the Osoyoos school, the hour of closing each day is left to the discretion of the local agent. If you consider it advisable, under the circumstances mentioned by you, to make changes in the hours, you may do so.\n\nIt is noted that the present teacher is not giving satisfactory service, and that you are trying to secure another one. I will be pleased to receive the name and qualifications of the teacher you are able to secure to succeed Miss Hozier.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

Hall,\nVernon, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI regret having to write this letter but I am desirous of informing you of my decision. I trust, however, that you are not depending on me to take over the Tukwawaq School again or any other school for that matter as I do not care to teach any more.\n\nI must thank you though for all your kindness and assistance during the two and a half years of my teaching, and under the circumstances I have tried to make my work more satisfactory.\n\nIf you have occasion to write me regarding this subject, please address your letter to Fairview.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Mrs.) Gertrude Rogers.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith quarterly report ending June 30th, 1922, of the Osoyoos Indian Day School, Miss Gertrude Hosier, teacher. I also enclose this teacher's resignation for your consideration.\n\nIf the Penticton School is opened this year, I believe arrangements can be made for the children at Osoyoos to attend there, consolidating the two schools. It has always been a difficult matter to obtain a competent teacher for Osoyoos, as there is no proper school building or any accommodation whatever for the teacher, who must live with the Indians, as this reserve is remote from any white settlers.\n\nHowever, I will report further when I have investigated further into this matter. I was not aware until today that Miss Hosier contemplated resigning her position.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOTTAWA, July 28th, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, enclosing the June quarter return of the Osoyoos Indian Day School, and also the resignation of Miss Gertrude Hozier, the teacher.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the resignation of Miss Hozier is accepted.\n\nIt is noted that when the Penticton school is opened arrangements could be made for the children at Osoyoos to attend, and it is hoped that when the school at Penticton is ready satisfactory arrangements can be made for the children from Osoyoos to attend there.\n\nIt is also noted that you will furnish a report when you have further investigated this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nfor Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of the 23rd July last with reference to the possibility of having the Osayoos children attend school at Penticton. This has been found impracticable as the proposed Penticton school has not been built, and the temporary school is filled with Penticton children. I have not been able to locate a teacher for the eight or nine children at Osayoos in advance of the lack of any accommodation except for one who could live in an Indian house as previous teachers, being half-breeds, have done, and so far I have not been able to find a teacher of any description. It is unfortunate because the Chief of the Osayoos Band is the strongest supporter of education in the Agency and every effort is being made to have these few children educated.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.O.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, Dec. 13, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, regarding the school situation at Osoyoos. I note that it is impossible to secure a qualified teacher because of the boarding facilities, and that the best solution of the problem will be to combine this work with that of restriction when the new school is erected.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that a serious effort will be made to have included in the Parliamentary Appropriation for the next fiscal year an item in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B. C.\nJanuary 3, 1925.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Paret,\n\nReferring to the attached letter from Mr. Agent Ball, I wish to state that the Osoyoos Band have had a school on and off for the past two years. There are roughly ten children of school age. The school was closed the end of June, last, as we were unable to secure a teacher - lack of boarding accommodation was the chief reason for our failure.\n\nThere is a very old school building on the Reserve which is not suitable for any purpose. Of late, school has been held in the priest's house, which was given for the purpose. I am of the opinion that $200 or $400 will put this building in good shape as a school house, but, in addition, we will have to provide a small teacher's residence, if school activities are to be continued.\n\nSupt., Indian Education.\nOttawa, January 5, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter of the 19th ultimo, enclosing a cheque for $350 - an amount which was requested some months ago by the Osoycoos Band in order to paint their church. I have noted that it will be impossible to use this money for the purpose intended until a later date.\n\nWith reference to the suggestion that a portion of the band funds be used to build a small house, the Department is of the opinion that the old priest's home, which was given for the purpose, might be put in good condition for a small sum and that, if any building activity is undertaken, it should be a residence. You will remember that we could not open school this last fall, because there was no residence for a teacher.\n\nWill you make a recommendation to the Department, indicating whether or not a new school at Lenterton will cater to the educational needs of the children of the Osoycoos Band. If not, and if there are sufficient children to warrant the expense, consideration will be given to taking some of the Osoycoos Band funds - augmented, perhaps, by parliamentary appropriation - for the erection of a teacher's residence and, if necessary, a new school house.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nP. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B. C.\nMr. J. J. C. Ball,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been informed that I must make an application to you for teaching school on the Inukameep Reserve.\n\nChief Baptiste George has been looking for a teacher for quite awhile. I have volunteered my services and they were much pleased.\n\nI was born in Spokane Washington and am nineteen years old. I received my education at the Sacred Heart Convent, Ward Washington and the St. Joseph's Academy, Sprague Washington. I have completed three years high school.\n\nHoping that the information given will be met with approval at Ottawa and that my qual-\nifications as a teacher will be accepted. \n\nVery Truly Yours, \nMiss Helen E. Macdonald.\nOttawa, Jan. 23, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letters of the 11th and 16th instant, with reference to the Osayoos Indian Day School. I have noted your recommendation that no building activity be undertaken at this school until after the Penticton building has been erected. At that time it may be found inadvisable to continue any teaching operations at the Osayoos school.\n\nIn the meantime it would appear advisable to re-open the Osayoos Indian School, and, in reply to your letter of the 16th instant, I have to inform you that the Department approves of the temporary appointment of Miss Helen E. McDonald. It is noted that she has no professional qualifications; but, as we are unable to secure the services of a qualified teacher because of inadequate boarding facilities, the Department is willing that Miss McDonald should undertake the work. A salary of $500 per annum will be allowed.\n\nMiss McDonald should understand that she is responsible to you for the proper conduct of the school. Requisitions for classroom equipment should be forwarded through your office, in addition to quarterly reports showing the attendance, days taught, etc. Please inform her that her continued engagement up to the end of June, next, will depend upon the success of the school. The parents of children of school age in the vicinity should be informed that we look for a good attendance.\n\nPlease intimate the date on which Miss McDonald commences duties and inform the Department what building is being used for the instruction offered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nF. J. C. Hall, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B. C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith an application for the position of teacher at the Osoyoos Indian Day School.\n\nI received a wire from the Chief's son as mentioned in my letter of the 11th instant as follows:\n\n\"We have teacher she is starting next week\".\n\nAs stated therein I wrote for particulars from her and this application is the result. This girl knows conditions on the Reserve having lived in the vicinity since leaving school and is apparently willing to take up the work. There are eight children who will attend and I do not know whether they are going to use the building formerly used for this purpose, or a room in the Chief's house. Desks and material are already there since the resignation of Miss Gertrude Hozier after the mid-year term, 1922. I have been unable to secure the services of a teacher since that date.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo with reference to the temporary appointment of Miss Helen E. McDonald as teacher of the Osoyoos Indian Day School.\n\nMiss McDonald commenced her duties on the 5th ultimo and they are using a room in the Chief's son's house. This room is quite satisfactory and will accommodate possibly fifteen children. I always use the same room for holding meetings of the Band and have had as many as forty people in it. I do not know whether the Chief's son will allow this room to be used permanently or whether the arrangement is until warmer weather when the old building can be used. I will obtain this information on my next visit to the Reserve. I have not visited the school since it re-opened on account of the remoteness of this reserve and the expense of getting there.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir,\n\nI have received today the resignation of Miss Helen E. McDonald as teacher of the Osoyoos Indian Day School. She intends to take a normal course somewhere in the State of Washington.\n\nI was surprised to receive this resignation at this late date, giving me no opportunity of finding a successor.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.Y.C. Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Sept. 10, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, in which you advise the Department that Miss Helen E. McDonald has resigned as teacher of the Osoyoos Indian Day School.\n\nIn view of the small attendance at this school since last January, the Department doubts the necessity of re-opening the same. However, if you consider that it is necessary to have the school at this point re-opened, you may endeavour to secure a teacher. The salary allowed would be at the same rate as was paid Miss McDonald. In the event of your securing a teacher, you should forward to the Department her name, experience and qualifications.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\nOttawa, Dec. 12, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 30th ultimo, relative to the provision of a small school house and residence at the Oscocos Indian Day School. The Deputy Superintendent General has authorized the erection of a building, as indicated by the rough sketch which you enclosed. You may make arrangements with Mr. H. Parsons, the local contractor, to erect a plain, substantial building to be used for the purposes of a classroom and a teacher's residence. Mr. Parsons' rough sketch called for a building 26 ft. by 14 ft. The Department Architect suggests dimensions of 30 ft. by 16 ft., so that the living accommodation will be more adequate.\n\nPlease make arrangements with the contractor to have the building erected, under your supervision, on a proven cost plus ten per cent basis. All accounts will have to be certified by yourself, and proper time sheets should be kept for the labour employed. As a guide, the Department suggests to you and to Mr. Parsons that the total cost be between $850 and $900. The cost of the building will be charged to the interest at the credit of the Band.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nF.J.C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B. C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to forward the following request from Chief Baptiste George of the Osoyoos Band of Indians living on Inkameep Reserve, Osoyoos No. 1.\n\nThe Chief states that he spoke to you in Vancouver regarding the necessity of building a small school on his Reserve and he was advised to take up the matter through this office. He is practically the only chief in the Agency who has consistently supported my attempts to educate the Indian children of the Okanagan and we have had a school intermittently for several years on his reserve. This has been carried on under difficulties as the reserve is rather remote from white settlement. There is no suitable building and it has been difficult to keep a teacher more than a year. So far the teachers have been part Indian and have lived in Indian houses. For a school we have used successively an old disused church now fallen to pieces, the priest's house which is also in bad condition and no longer used by the priest, and more recently an upper room in the Chief's house which is entirely unsuitable from every point of view. At present the school is closed as no teacher will accept the position unless a building is provided.\n\nThere are only eight or ten children of school age who can attend so that a large building is not required. The Church on the reserve has recently been renovated and repaired by Henry Parsons, a contractor in a small way living at Oliver, B.C., the nearest settlement to the Reserve. This man did a satisfactory contract on the Church and was later engaged by the Chief to repair several houses on the Reserve; the priest, Father Carlyle,\nalso offering him a contract to build a chapel on his ranch. I asked Mr. Parsons to give a rough estimate for building a small school with two rooms suitable for living quarters and he has submitted the enclosed rough sketch which he would complete for $750. If some building of this description could be constructed on the Osayoos Indian Reserve, it would meet all requirements.\n\nWe appreciate the two schools granted to this Agency, one on Okanagan Indian Reserve No. 1 completed and opened last January and another at Penticton No. 1 Reserve upon which construction commences this week. The Okanagan School includes a teacher's residence and cost approximately $5,000 and the Penticton school probably $3,000 (although I have not yet received advice as to the amount of the successful tender).\n\nWe have been using a small building on Penticton Reserve for the past year pending construction and as it is only two miles from Penticton there has been no difficulty regarding the teacher. These three day schools have done very satisfactory work, and have had a good influence on the Reserves, and I hope to see provisions made for one on the Spallumcheen Reserve at Enderby and another on the Similkameen Reserve.\n\nFor some reason this Agency was overlooked in the provision of educational facilities, (probably on account of Indian opposition which was more imaginary than real once the schools were opened), and I considered it my duty to remedy this condition, if possible, and obtain for the Okanagan Indians at least a small portion of the educational grant to the province.\n\nI respectfully place these facts before you with a view to having a small school building constructed on Osayoos Reserve. It need not be of the usual type of day school building which is much in excess of the needs of this Band where the number of children will probably not exceed ten or twelve at any time. Request will be made later for the usual type of school both at Spallumcheen and Similkameen.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDuncan C.

G. S. Prapnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of 12th of December last authorizing the erection of a school building on the Osoyoos Reserve by Mr. H. Parsons, of Oliver, B.C.\n\nDuring the winter months Mr. Parsons made the doors, windows and as much of the building as possible at Oliver and has now been able to commence erection on the Reserve. The building is 75 per cent completed. He has asked this morning for a remittance on account as he has to pay for labour and part of the material. I would respectfully recommend that $400.00 be forwarded to him on account. Time sheets and accounts for material have been kept, and will be certified and forwarded, when the building is completed.\n\nThis building is quite a substantial one and compares favourably with the small Provincial schools in out-lying places.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that the day school with teacher's quarters on Osoyoos Reserve has been completed and payment for same will be requested under separate cover.\n\nThe Chief is anxious to have it opened immediately, as the children have been absent from school since June 30th last. I have secured the services of a teacher who will fill in until the end of next term, when the former teacher will return and take over her duties again. The name of this temporary teacher is Mrs. Alice Lakeland, who is competent and willing to teach at the salary usually paid at this school.\n\nAs a reply to this letter can not be received for nearly two weeks, and in view of the urgency of opening the school immediately, I have taken the responsibility of writing to her today requesting her to notify me of the earliest date she can commence her duties. If this does not meet with your approval, a telegram to this effect will be in time to cancel these arrangements.\n\nIt is also necessary to have some inexpensive furniture, etc. The two rooms are small and only a few articles are required which I will purchase under the same conditions, viz., cancellation of the order if it is not approved by you.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nI am confident this School is a very satisfactory piece of work. The chief of the Band stands alone among the Chiefs of this Agency in strongly supporting education and he is particularly pleased with everything. I have had the material and workmanship inspected by a disinterested party and he placed the value of the building at $250 above what it has actually cost. Although I had never met the contractor, Mr. Parsons, until about a year ago, I felt sure he would prove both honest and capable, and I have not been disappointed in the two contracts he has had. The Indians are also offering him private work, repairing or erecting houses, barns, etc.\n\nSubject, therefore, to your approval, I will supply the few necessary articles of furniture, advise the teacher that her services will be accepted temporarily, and re-open the school on April 1st, and if this is not approved, I respectfully request advice by telegram.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.O.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 25th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, informing the Department of the completion of the new day school and teacher's quarters on the Osoyoos Reserve, and requesting authority to engage a teacher for the balance of the present school year.\n\nIn reply I beg to confirm the following night lettergram of today's date:\n\n\"May engage temporary teacher for Osoyoos School also purchase inexpensive furniture for teacher's rooms.\"\n\nWe will approve of the appointment of Mrs. Alice Lakeland, whom you state to be competent to perform the duties as teacher, until the former teacher returns. We will allow Mrs. Lakeland salary at the same rate as was paid the former teacher, viz: $500 per annum, payable on a basis of ten teaching months in the year, supplemented by the bonus provided by law. You should arrange with Mrs. Lakeland to begin duties as early as possible in April, next. If she requires any school material, she should prepare a requisition and forward it through your office.\n\nRegarding the furnishings required for the teacher's living quarters, you may arrange for the purchase of the various articles upon you consider absolutely necessary, including a cooking stove, if required. If possible, competitive prices should be obtained, and the purchase made from the firm quoting the lowest price. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nKindly inform the Department as to whether Mrs. Lakeland accepts the position as temporary teacher, and, if so, the date on which she begins duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.

I have not seen the furniture yet, but believe this will be the most economical way of furnishing the place, as the cost of cartage to this reserve would bring the prices rather high on new furniture. However, until I have seen it and ascertained what prices she puts on it, I can form no opinion.\n\nI expect to visit the school early in April when I will report further in this matter.\n\nRegarding the school material, there may be sufficient to carry on for the present, but I will also look into this and see what further articles are needed.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(F.J.C.

I think it would be fair to give her $600.00 per annum to be paid in ten payments. I shall leave the matter entirely to you, as I have no applicants for a school of that kind at present.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) R.H.

H. Cairns, Inspector of Indian Schools, regarding the services of Mrs. Alice Lakeland, teacher of the Osyoos Indian Day School, and recommending an increase in salary for the next school year.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the continuing of the services of Mrs. Lakeland and will allow her an increase in salary of $100 per annum from the 1st of September, next. This will make her salary from that date at the rate of $600 per annum, which will be supplemented by the bonus provided by law. Payment of both salary and bonus is based on ten teaching months in the year. The continuing of the services of Mrs. Lakeland will depend upon the attendance maintained and the success which she achieves in the classroom. Please inform her of the increase in salary allowed, and arrange with her to be ready to resume duties when the school re-opens after the present summer holidays.\n\nI shall also be pleased if you will inform Mr. Inspector Cairns of the re-appointment of Mrs. Lakeland and the increase in salary allowed her.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

While the Department regrets that Mrs. Lakeland has found it necessary to resign her duties at the present time, her resignation is accepted.\n\nIf you consider that this school should be kept in operation, I shall be pleased if you will, after consulting Mr. R. H. Cairns, Inspector of Indian Schools, arrange for the appointment of a suitable teacher. As it may be difficult at this season of the year to obtain a teacher for this isolated school, it may be that you will recommend that the school remain closed until the beginning of the next school year, viz., September 1st, next. However, this matter will be left in your hands. If you engage a teacher, the name, qualifications and experience of the person secured by you or Mr. Cairns should be forwarded for the approval of the Department.

In this connection I have to request that you will endeavour to obtain the services of a suitable teacher in time to begin duties when the school re-opens after the present summer holidays. Please refer to our letter of March 11th, last, regarding this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. J. C.

Your letter of the 11th March last was not overlooked. Every effort was made to secure the services of a suitable teacher and although there were two applicants who have had considerable teaching experience and suitable in every way, they were not Roman Catholic. I spoke to Rev. Father Wagner of Penticton, B.C. who attends the Indians on this Reserve and he insisted on the school being closed unless a Roman Catholic teacher could be found and although he tried to find one and the other teachers, Miss Coughlan and Mr. Marsden assisted us, we were not successful.\n\nFather Wagner's predecessor and the priests at Bear Creek were willing on a previous occasion to see any teacher temporarily appointed rather than close the school, but Father Wagner is very obstinate in this respect and does not co-operate in any way and his objections in this matter have to be respected. The Chief, who it will be remembered, had the school built out of Band funds, is very anxious to see a teacher installed and recommended strongly one of those above mentioned.\n\nEverything possible will be done to re-open the school after the holidays.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.O.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nAgassiz, B.C., Aug. 10, 1929.\n\nMr. R.

Mrs. Lakeland resigned at that time and we were not able to fill the position till now.\n\nI have an application from Miss Mary Wadell. A copy of which you will find enclosed herewith. I regret that she has not had Normal training, but this is the best I can do.\n\nI respectfully recommend that the salary for the position be at the rate of $750.00 per annum and that the school be re-opened September the 1st.\n\nShe is somewhat young but I understand that she is well developed both mentally and physically.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.H. Cairns,\nInspector of Indian Schools of B.C.\nOttawa, August 18th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, enclosing copy of an application which you received from Miss Mary Wadel for the position as teacher of the Osoyoos Indian Day School, and stating the qualifications which she possesses.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, if the Roman Catholic Church authorities, under whose auspices this school is conducted, approve of the appointment of this girl, the Department will consent to her appointment, temporarily, with salary at rate of $75 per teaching month, her retention in the position, however, to depend upon the success which she meets in the work.\n\nWe are informing Mr. Agent Bull of the application of Miss Wadel, and of the necessity of obtaining the approval of the Church authorities for her appointment. Please take this matter up with the Church authorities, and inform the Department and Mr. Agent Bull as to whether they approve of the appointment of Miss Wadel, and, if so, if you have arranged with her to begin duties on September 1st, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.

Miss Wadel has no professional qualifications. She has completed her junior matriculation, and has also taken the Normal entrance course. We have informed Mr. Cairns that, provided the Roman Catholic Church authorities, under whose auspices this school is conducted, approve of the appointment of Miss Wadel, we will consent thereto, her retention in the position, however, to depend entirely on the success which she meets in the work. If she is appointed, the Department will allow salary at the rate of $75 per teaching month.\n\nMr. Inspector Cairns will, no doubt, take this matter up with you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th instant with reference to the appointment of Miss Mary Wadel as teacher at the Osoyoos Indian Day School. Mr. Cairns has sent me particulars of this applicant and in order that Miss Wadel, who is only 19 years of age, would be under no misapprehension as to the conditions on this Reserve I have sent full information as to distance from the nearest white family, and necessary isolation.\n\nMiss Wadel is therefore fully acquainted with the facts in advance. The Indians have promised to give her every assistance, and the Chief, Baptiste George and his family who live near the School are prepared to make her welcome to the School.\n\nThis is an easy school to handle as the children are all very keen to learn and their progress will be watched with interest. The conditions under which her appointment has been made are noted and will be reported accordingly.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant\n\n[F.J.C. Ball]\nIndian Agent\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nAt Osoyoos the medical officer had under observation what appeared to be small-pox, but later proved to be severe chicken-pox. All precautions were taken and vaccinations were general. The medical officer reports no other case so far. As a preventative measure the school was closed on the 24th.\n\nF.J.C. Ball\nIndian Agent\nOKANAGAN AGENCY\n\nMONTHLY REPORT FOR SEPTEMBER, 1926.\n\nI visited the three day schools in the Agency during September. At Osoyoos there is a full attendance but the Okanagan attendance is affected because so many families are away picking apples. Next week should see an improvement and the question of a change in the vacation period at the schools will be taken up before next year. The holidays commence and finish too early in the year to suit the Indian mode of life. At Penticton the school is temporarily at a standstill until their difficulties mentioned above are disposed of.\n\nF.J.C. Ball.\nIndian Agent.\nAt the small school in Osoyoos the attendance is good. On this Reserve the Chief, who is quite progressive and industrious, gives every assistance possible to make his school a success, whereas at Penticton the Chief is opposed to education, which seems to show his unfitness for the rank he holds. The Indians admit that the children who have attended these schools have done remarkably well in the short time they have been in operation and I do not think these temporary difficulties will have any material effect upon the schools.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSirm\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.J.C. Ball)\n\nIndian agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nNJSB/28\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith application from Miss Mary Wadell of the Osayoos Indian Day School for an increase in salary.\n\nMiss Wadell's services have been very satisfactory and I have been agreeably surprised that she has stayed on at the school so long. She lives in the two small rooms adjoining the school, the nearest white neighbour being eight miles away and she is entirely dependent on the Indians for obtaining supplies, mail etc., and during the winter months is more or less cut off for long periods on account of weather conditions. As Miss Wadell is still under twenty years of age this isolation must be somewhat trying, and as the position is difficult to fill on this account I would respectfully recommend the increase asked for if consistent with the regulations.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.O.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nFJOB:O.\nOttawa, January 27, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, relative to an application which you received from Miss Mary Wadell, teacher of the Osoyoos Indian Day School, for an increase in salary. In reply I beg to say that this application, which you stated you were enclosing, did not accompany your letter.\n\nThe Department will allow Miss Wadell an increase of $10 per teaching month from the 1st instant. This will make her salary from that date at the rate of $85 per teaching month. This increase is made in view of your recommendation that her services have been satisfactory and also taking into account the living conditions at this point. I shall be pleased if you will inform Miss Wadell of the increase in salary allowed her.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI hereewith beg to submit a report on my latest inspection of the above agency (Okanagan).\n\nSCHOOLS: I inspected the day schools at Osoyoos, and found the teacher most efficient and the Indians very pleased and satisfied with her work. Unfortunately, though, it is probable that she will be leaving at the end of this term.\n\nI shall be much obliged, therefore, if you will drop a line to the Indians concerned upon the various matters referred to. A short note either in the narrative or otherwise, with possibly reasons, will do. I ask this, in order that the Indians will see that their Agent and myself do place these matters before you, a matter that they are somewhat skeptical about, and one of the reasons why they talk such a lot about what the visiting Chiefs and delegates will do for them. In view of this sort, would I know, aid the authority of both of us, and as you know, I would not act this unless I saw the necessity for it, as I know it is only adding extra work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. S. Praynell,\nInspector of Indian agencies.\nOttawa, May 1st, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Pragnell, in a report on his recent inspection of the Okanagan Agency, states regarding his visit to the Osoyoos Indian Day School that he found the services of the teacher most efficient but it is probable she will be leaving at the end of this term.\n\nI have to request that you will ascertain definitely from Miss Wadell whether she intends to give up duties at the end of the present school year or not. If so, it will be necessary to obtain the services of another teacher to begin duties when the school reopens after the coming summer holidays. It would be advisable for you to consult Mr. Inspector Claims in the matter, and you should inform the Department of the action taken. If a new teacher is secured, the name, qualifications and experience should be forwarded for the approval of the Department. The salary allowed would depend on the qualifications which the teacher obtained possesses.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\nSir,\n\nRe Your File 164-11-1\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ult. with reference to the resignation of Miss Wadell as teacher of the Oscegoos Indian Day School. At the time of Mr. Inspector Pragmell's visit to the school Miss Wadell was not sure whether she would definitely decide to resign and I hoped that she would be able to continue. However, I have today received her resignation and have already made inquiries as to a successor.\n\nMr. Inspector Cairns arrives here tomorrow and I will take up the matter with him at that time.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.S.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nFJCB:C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of the 31st ult. (File 164-11-1) with reference to Mr. Inspector Pragnell's inspection of the Okanagan Agency in which he mentioned that Miss Wadel was leaving at the end of the term. I have again visited the school in company with Mr. Inspector Calmus and on this visit Miss Wadel stated that she was willing to stay as teacher for the time being and withdrew her resignation, so that this matter is adjusted for the time being.\n\nIn connection with the Inspector's report I have written him regarding the statement that the Municipality have been taking gravel from the Reserve for fifteen years. It was the Provincial Government which had been taking the gravel for many years with the consent of the Indians. The Municipality took a few loads last fall, but I notified them that they could not do so without permission and they made other arrangements. Colonel Pragnell will be writing you direct in this matter.\n\nI am glad that Miss Wadel has decided to stay as this is a particularly difficult school to find a teacher for as it is remote from the white settlement and in winter time is more or less cut off from the outside.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nFJCB:O.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Kiernan, the substitute teacher at the Seton Lake Indian Day School, I beg to inform you that Mr. Inspector Carman has recommended the transfer of Miss Mary Wadell to succeed him. Miss Wadell has been teaching the Osoyoos Indian Day School in the Okanagan Agency since September, 1925. The Department is approving of the transfer of Miss Wadell to commence duties at the Seton Lake School at the beginning of the New Year. The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $85 per teaching month. I have to request that you will give Miss Wadell every assistance you can in her work at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nOttawa, December 21st, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that on the recommendation of Mr. Inspector Cairns, it has been decided to transfer Miss Mary Wadell, teacher of the Osayoos Indian Day School, to the Seton Lake Indian Day School in the Lytton Agency from the 1st of January, next. Mr. Cairns has been informed of the approval of the transfer of Miss Wadell, and requested to take up with you the matter of obtaining the services of a teacher to succeed her at the Osayoos School. If you and Mr. Cairns consider that the teaching activity at this school should be continued, and if the services of a teacher are secured, you should forward the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated by you for the approval of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\nSir,\n\nFile 164-11-1\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st inst. regarding the transfer of Miss Mary Wadell from the Osoyoos school in this Agency to the Seton Lake school in the Lytton Agency.\n\nThis notice would have been a surprise to me had I not met Mr. Cairns in Vancouver two weeks ago and he told me Miss Wadell had applied for the transfer. I spoke to Miss Wadell after I had seen Mr. Cairns and she assured me she was returning to the Osoyoos school after the Christmas holidays, so I did not expect to hear anything further about it.\n\nMiss Wadell has been quite successful in the small Osoyoos school and seems to have the right temperament for the conditions under which the teacher must live. It is several miles from the nearest white neighbour with no means of reaching town except by chance Indian conveyance and on account of the isolation I did not expect her to stay very long as she is quite young, but she seems to have become accustomed to the Indians and the surroundings, and to be quite content as she has stayed two and a half years.\n\nWhile I should be very sorry to lose Miss Wadell from the Osoyoos school, I realise the fact that sooner or later she would wish to live in a more settled locality.\n\nI will ascertain from Mr. Cairns what arrangement is finally made as to the transfer.\n\nMr. William Marsden, teacher of the Okanagan school is still absent on sick leave, but when I saw him in Vancouver recently he said he expected to return to Vernon by March 1st. If Miss Wadell transfers, the temporary teacher at the Okanagan school could be transferred to Osoyoos when Mr. Marsden returns, meanwhile closing the Osoyoos school temporarily, much as I dislike doing so, if such arrangement would meet with your approval.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In this connection I now have to inform you that arrangements have been made to engage a teacher for the Seton Lake School as we understand that Miss Wadell intends to remain as teacher of the Osoyoos School until the end of June next. Both Mr. Inspector Cairns and Mr. Agent Graham of the Lytton Agency have been informed accordingly. It is hoped that Miss Wadell will continue as teacher of this school for the balance of the present school year, viz., June 30th, next. At that time the question of the exchange of teachers at Okanagan and Osoyoos Schools could receive consideration, if considered advisable by you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. E. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. J. C. Hall, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\nOttawa, August 10th, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nIt has been decided to transfer Mr. A. Walsh, teacher of the Okanagan Indian Day School, to the Osyoo Indian Day School.\n\nTo succeed Mr. Walsh, the Department is approving of the appointment of Mr. Bernard Neary as teacher at Okanagan. Mr. Neary holds an interim first class certificate for British Columbia, having been trained at the Victoria Normal School and Victoria College. In addition to two years College, he holds Physical Training and First Aid Certificates and, this summer, he is obtaining a summer school certificate for Indian and rural work. He has already had one year's successful experience in a three-roomed rural school.\n\nThe transfer of Mr. Walsh and the appointment of Mr. Neary are effective from September 1st, next.\n\nMr. Neary's salary will be at the rate of $90 a teaching month, less 10% for the current fiscal year.

Instead of his request to close the school a few days earlier than usual and reopen earlier in the fall, is concerned, I am of the opinion that such a course should have no detrimental effect on the school work, and considerable advantage would accrue from his studies at University.\n\nIf this permission is granted, I would request that cheque for his services up to June 15 next be forwarded to reach him by that date.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(James Coleman)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nDear Mr. Coleman:\n\nI would like very much to attend the Summer Session at Berkeley University, California, this year; unfortunately the course commences on June 25th so I am writing to ask you if the Department would allow me to close school on Friday, June 25th, so as to be able to get down there in time. If so, I could re-open school on August 20th which would give me two weeks of school in August, so that no actual time would be lost.\n\nMy main course would be the study of the American Indians and research work in the Museum of Anthropology, and also to get in touch with some of the Indian educationalists and study their new methods with regard to their day schools and their methods of reviving the native arts.\n\nWe have just received a prize list from the Royal Drawing Society in London at which some of our boys exhibited at their annual exhibition. Two sheets of decorative composition done by Ernest Baptiste, age fourteen years, was awarded one first class commendation, and the other second class commendation. At present these drawings are being shown at the Guildhall Art Gallery, London.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"Anthony Walsh\"\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith a copy of a letter addressed to Mr. Indian Agent Coleman by Mr. Anthony Walsh, teacher of the Inkameep Indian Day School, Oliver, B.C., together with Mr. Indian Agent Coleman's recommendation in the matter.\n\nShould the Department grant the permission requested by the above mentioned teacher no time would be lost by the pupils of the Inkameep Day School. Mr. Walsh is a very energetic teacher and is doing considerable work in connection with native arts. I consider that the course which he proposes to take at Berkeley University this year would result in greater efficiency in the schoolroom.\n\nI have pleasure in recommending that the permission sought for by Mr. Walsh be granted, and that the decision of the Department be communicated to the Indian Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H. Barry.\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nOttawa, May 8, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nAssistant Commissioner Perry has forwarded to the Department your letter of the 20th ultimo, with reference to the request of Anthony Walsh, teacher of the Inkaneep Indian Day School, to close the school on June 15th.\n\nIn view of your recommendation, you may inform Mr. Walsh that the school may close on the date mentioned. It is noted that he will re-open the school on August 20th.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJames Coleman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.

The majority of the drawings are \"snapshot\" in other words, recollections of what the draughtsman has himself observed, and the accuracy with which actual shape has been remembered is not less remarkable than the grace with which it is expressed, having regard to the age.\n\nAn outstanding feature of the work generally is the skill with which movement is delineated. Many examples of this are to be seen in the \"snapshot\" drawings and paintings that have been submitted.\n\nH.R.H. THE PRINCESS LOUISE, DUCHESS OF ARGYLL, THE PRESIDENT, has given great encouragement to the practice of \"snapshot drawing\" by awarding special prizes for the best \"snapshot\" work in the Exhibition. Her Royal Highness usually awards two prizes, one for girls and one for boys, but the work this year is so good that, as was the case last year, The Princess has presented an additional prize.\n\nThe PRIZES FOR GIRLS Her Royal Highness adjudged to:\n\nD. BARRETT (age 15, Luton, Red Book League) for pencil and brushwork drawings of animals in which the \"knowledge and observation of action are very good.\"\n\nD. COLLES (age 16, Parsons Mead School, Ashstead) for brushwork drawings of figures showing \"good movement.\"\n\nThe PRIZE FOR BOYS was awarded to:\n\nT. STERNDALE (age 9, St. Dunstan's School, Golders Green) for drawings of ships, a lighthouse, etc., in which there is \"good perspective and observation.\"\n\nMrs. G. F. Watts' Prizes.\n\nMrs. G. F. WATTS awarded her prizes as follows:\n\nPrize In Memoriam, G. F. Watts, R.A.:\u2014D. Barrett (age 15, Luton, Red Book League), for a sheet of \"snapshot drawings\" of ponies.\n\nNeedlework Book-cover Prize:\u2014B. Davies (age 16, Simon Langton School, Canterbury), for \"a beautiful bit of needlework.\"\n\nPictorial Posters.\n\nH.R.H. THE PRINCE OF WALES was very interested to see the pictorial posters which were sent in. His Royal Highness thought them very good indeed and considered that they show a high standard.\n\nVillage Signs.\n\nT.R.H. THE DUKE AND DUCHESS OF YORK thought that the Village Signs which they inspected, were well up to the usual high standard and that they were all so good, both in execution and design, that it would be difficult to pick out any particular one for special mention.\n\nTheir Royal Highnesses were very amused by the efforts of the small children and considered that the drawings by a child of three were particularly good for her age.\nSUMMARY OF THE JUDGES' REPORTS ON THE EXHIBITS.\n\nPictorial.\n\nTaken as a whole the work reached a high standard and was well up to the level of previous years. This was especially evident in the \"snapshot drawings\" of figures and animals where appreciative attention had been given to a single factor. The best of these were very good, excellent work was done in surface description and plant drawing, and the village signs were extremely well executed and carried out. In the landscape class there was a higher average and much of the work was most praiseworthy.\n\nSnapshot Drawings.\u2014The quality of the \"snapshot drawings\" of figures, animals and landscapes has always been outstanding but this year it was even better than usual. The figures were well observed, movement was accurately rendered and much of the work was very good. The rendering of movement was particularly good in the junior classes.\n\nAnimals.\u2014Animal drawing of animals who had devoted some of their time during the year to studies of nature, therefore increasing their knowledge of animals, were inevitably the best. A number of students showed an ability to make animals appear as they really have done but more attention has been given to serious study of details. The work of those who have studied animals such interest and was very well executed. It is essential that the animals be seen out of doors. Good surface description is essential and obtrusive outlining should be avoided.\n\nFigures.\u2014A number of figures were submitted by the pupils who received them. There was much good work; the general form was well observed and the figures were generally realised. Structural knowledge was lacking in many cases. Much of the work and the judges considered a greater number of detailed studies of parts. In a few cases the judges thought that a greater number of detailed studies of parts would have improved the work. The judges found a tendency to over-emphasise the outline and the drawing showed a tendency to over-emphasis of detail. A good deal of attention is paid to drawing the figure with the brush point, an admirable descriptive medium.\n\nPortraits.\u2014Portraits were submitted by a number of pupils. Greater success would be obtained if more attention were given to structural study, especially of the skull. Students of facial expression were highly commended by the judges and really good work is often likely to fail to receive recognition.\n\nLandscape.\u2014Some very commendable work was sent in and there were many examples of the highest quality. The judges were pleased at the attention given to tone, line and colour. It was pleasing to see the subject approached with such serious consideration as well as with a keen sense of observation. The judges found a number of very good candidates. The formation and movement of clouds is a good guide to the weather, and this should be considered when painting landscapes. Clouds overhead are nearer to the spectator than those on the horizon and should be drawn as though they were upright to the earth. In the rendering of trees some candidates set themselves too high and this detracted from the effect.\n\nOriginal Illustrations.\u2014Ambitious subjects were often attempted, and in a number of cases with considerable success. The judges thought that more attention should be given to expression and posture, suitable grouping and pleasant harmonious colour. A few candidates failed to secure their full effect owing to cramming too much into their compositions or confusing the eye. Originality and freshness of approach and execution are essential and sincerity is best secured by relying on ones own resources. The judges thought that more attention should be given to the suitability of the subjects selected, as the results of the examination test of the Society's Examination Committee. Some pupils tried to illustrate scenes which they were unable to draw. In such cases the subject should always be written on it when made.\n\nShading.\u2014Knowledge of light and shade is so essential to good painting that the judges wished to draw attention to the fact that wherever an object gives mercy, the silhouette should be dark and the object itself light. To convey the appearance of volume projection or recession is the main distinction of the art of shading. To convey the appearance of a close group it is important to deal with the dark parts correctly as with the lights which often seemed to receive an undue share of attention.\n\nStill Life.\u2014Still life work showed sensitive appreciation of tone-values and there were fewer drawings of complicated and uninteresting groups. It is helpful to pupils to give them a limited range of objects to arrange. Attention should be given to the arrangement of the groups they are to paint, as it heightens their interest and helps to keep them interested. In arranging still life groups the judges thought that successful students the group should be made up of not more than two objects, their colour should be harmonious and the light source should be clearly defined. The dark ground should be a subdued value of the main colour and help to increase its effect, and the details, tone and colour of objects placed behind should be kept in harmony with the overall effect of the picture and not appear too forward in the picture.\n\nSurface Description.\u2014It was pleasing to note the attention which this important subject, the rendering of drawing, was receiving. There was a large entry, the average of the work was good and much of it was excellent.\n\nDecorative Compositions.\u2014Many well planned and original designs were sent in. Some were rich and strong in colour, while others were weak and pale. The background harmonised with the subject as included to be crude or the background was not carefully thought out with respect to the covering of the main design. In designing a decorative composition the subject should be correctly interpreted and the general character of the plant should be preserved. Abstract and geometrical designs were also sent in.\n\nThe judges found difficulty in assessing this class owing to the lack in many cases of necessary information as to the purpose of the design. Where such particulars are not given the design often receives a lower award than it otherwise might gain.\n\nT. R. ARBETT, H.R.I.\nG. HARCOURT, R.A.\nD. RICHARDS, R.I.\nTHOMAS, R.A.\nJ.

TOWNSEND, R.B.A., R.D.S.\n\nPlant Drawing.\u2014A strong class with much good work both in pencil and brush. In some cases the pencil work was rather too fine and the hatching too heavy, and freehanding was sometimes overdone. Sensitive appreciation of colour was shown generally, though a few drawings were spoiled by heavy local colour or the use of colours which did not harmonise with the subject.\n\nMachines.\u2014Boys are so keenly interested in ships, engines, aeroplanes, etc., that their efforts are always welcomed by the judges. The work sent in reached, as their effort, a high standard.\n\nLettering.\u2014Some of the work was good, but other examples were marred by overcrowding. In some instances the work suffered from being too hard to read. Brown ink is encouraged and varying tone in the letters the best quality of process black ink should be used.\n\nOverseas.\n\nDrawings of overseas scenery, landscapes, plants and animals were sent in from many parts of the Empire. The work generally showed marked improvement, especially in the drawing of figures. Some capital \"snapshot\" drawings were received, the only life were recorded and the figures were very well drawn. The colour was generally good throughout, but greater attention needs to be paid to variations in local colour brought about by the effects of light.\n\nArchitecture.\n\nThe standard this year was distinctly higher. Less ambitious subjects were attempted but there were some very good examples of architectural subjects. The work was well planned and a commendable feeling for the quality of the material was perceptible in some of the drawings and some attractive small studies of details were received.\n\nVillage Signs.\n\nMrs. T.

It is easy because it is so natural, being the very process that the youngest child employs when he draws spontaneously; so fascinating because in its advanced form it involves some of the highest qualities of the mind and requires the co-operation with the eye and brain of the highest concentration. All its forms, simple, intermediate and advanced may be practised by children of from 5 to 6 years old onwards.\n\nBriefly it is drawing from recollection things observed by the draughtsman. Its value consists not merely in the fact that it is \"drawing from delight,\" but that this joy in drawing is obtained by stimulating and developing the intelligence of the pupils and training them to think of the \"why and wherefore\" of the things they see in everyday life.\n\nIt is sometimes thought that \"memory\" and \"snapshot drawing\" are the same thing under a different name. That is not so; there is a great distinction between the two. A memory drawing is not necessarily a reproduction of the observer's own mental picture; it may be a recollection of a picture or drawing by someone else.\n\nThe distinguishing characteristic of \"snapshot\" draughtsmen is the power of expressing movement in free flowing lines. The success with which quite young children are able to show movement and vitality in their drawings is often the despair of older and more practised draughtsmen who are unversed in \"snapshot drawing,\" for if you do not practise the representation of movement when you are young it is difficult to acquire the art in later years.\n\nA photograph of, say, a breaking wave or a moving figure or animal offers, back, life, yet a \"snapshot\" drawing by a mere baby may possess it. Why is this? A \"snapshot\" photograph and a \"snapshot\" by the eye record two different things. The photograph represents what occurs in a path of movement in an instant of time, and during that brief period the moving object is to all intents and purposes stationary, so that what you really get is arrested movement. A \"snapshot\" by the eye shows the path of movement itself. It is a broad generalisation by the draughtsman representing in a single impression a series of moments of movement.\n\nA moving object is part of a moving world; the universe is always in motion. Young people live in a world of moving things; they take pleasure in drawing them and if encouraged, attain remarkable facility and success in infusing vitality into their work. Many striking examples will be found in this Exhibition.\nTHE ROYAL DRAWING SOCIETY.\n\n(Incorporated 1892)\n\nPATRON\u2014HIS MOST GRACIOUS MAJESTY THE KING.\nPRESIDENT\u2014H.R.H. THE PRINCESS LOUISE, DUCHESS OF ARGYLL.\nFOUNDER AND ART DIRECTOR\u2014T. R. ABLETT, H.R.I.\n\n18, QUEEN ANNE'S GATE, WESTMINSTER, S.W. I.\n\nAnnual Exhibition, 1934.\n(Memorial to King Edward VII. and Queen Alexandra)\n\n\"Better than ever\" was the verdict of many visitors after seeing the 45th Annual Exhibition organised by Mr. T. R. Ablett, H.R.I.\n\nThe Guildhall Art Gallery, in which the Exhibition was held, by kind permission of the City Corporation, was crowded with visitors, the attendance averaging nearly two thousand a day. Many Heads of Schools and Art Teachers brought parties of their pupils to see the work, and a feature that excited special interest was a series of albums containing \"snapshot drawings\" taken from examination papers of schools connected with the Society in Africa, Australia, British Guiana, Canada, China, Chile, India, Japan, the West Indies, etc.\n\nA few selections from the many Press Notices are given overleaf.\n\nN.B.\u2014Early preparation for the 1935 Exhibition is recommended.\nSurprising Competence\n\nThe work reaches a surprising degree of competence, particularly the brush drawings of plants. Every work shown is worth looking at.\u2014*The Times.*\n\nA Revelation\n\nIf you want to see what youth can do, go to the Guildhall. The Exhibition is something of a revelation in its variety, ability and freshness.\u2014*Daily Telegraph.*\n\nStriking Originality\n\nWidespread attention has been attracted by the high standard of many of the children's drawings to be seen in the Exhibition. Why, it is asked, do children show such striking originality of design?\u2014*Morning Post.*\n\nA Splendid Exhibition\n\nIt is a fine exhibition, a splendid exhibition. There are drawings and paintings and needlework that will delight your heart. None of this problem picture, Cubism and \"What does this mean?\" I suppose the artist must know stuff. Just plain, straightforward pictures of men and women as we see them, ships that could conceivably sail, dogs that look as if they could bark, and cats that you would expect to howl o' nights. The vast majority of these drawings and paintings are the work of children. Little children. Frankly they are first-rate. Really first-rate.\u2014*Daily Mail.*\n\nFirst Step to Success\n\nOn the walls of the Guildhall Art Gallery hang hundreds of sketches full of action, phantasy and colour. Mr. Ablett, the founder of the Society, says: \"Encourage your child to draw\u2014even if it's only scribbling\u2014and you will help him up the first step to success as an engineer, airman, doctor, scientist, or whatever profession he chooses.\"\u2014*Daily Express.*\n\nGirls' Keen Observation\n\nHowever times may change, children's reaction to things is always much the same. Boys being chiefly interested in boats, engines and the like, tend to give us greater variety by following the latest inventions and sports with their pencils. I would credit the girls, however, with keener observation, which is the basic aim of the Society in its encouragement of \"snapshot drawing.\"\u2014*News Chronicle.*\n\nFruits of Snapshot Drawing\n\nHere are thousands of drawings from many parts of the Empire, most of them done by the Society's method of \"snapshot drawing\"\u2014that is, drawing from recollection after observation. The claim that this method stimulates the power of expressing movement in full-flowing lines is well sustained by the exhibits which achieve representation while avoiding copyism and that imitation photography which is still, in many quarters which should know better, imagined to be the artist's function.\u2014*Liverpool Post.*\n\nRemarkable Snapshots\n\nA high level has been reached this year, and the success in catching the movements of living subjects is more pronounced than usual. The snapshots from memory are remarkable.\u2014*Manchester Guardian.*\n\nValue of Drawing\n\nExhibits that fill two large galleries and many volumes of \"overflow\" efforts of only slightly less merit are ample proof of the value of drawing in helping young people to gain knowledge of the world about them, and in developing powers of observation and memory.\u2014*Birmingham Post.*\n\nWholesome Freshness\n\nThese very youthful artists not only draw and paint what they have seen with an accuracy that is remarkable, but succeed splendidly in giving a wholesome freshness to their work. In their sheer virility many of the efforts would do credit to older and more experienced hands.\u2014*Yorkshire Telegraph.*\nRealism and Action.\n\nSpontaneity and simple grace are the keynotes of the Exhibition. Particularly attractive are colour studies of horses at work and leisure, and to some of these has been imparted a note of realism and action not always coming within the ambit of the experienced artist's power of observation.\u2014Glasgow Herald.\n\nA Welsh Success\n\nFourteen year old Jean Cratchley of the Plymouth Preparatory School, Penarth, has carried off one of the chief awards. She has won Mr. Ablett's coveted prize for a series of brushwork plant drawings showing a remarkably sensitive appreciation of colour for one so young.\u2014Western Mail.\n\nIreland's Gold Star\n\nMuch is being made of the drawings by tiny tots and they are certainly extremely interesting but the really remarkable feature of the show is the high quality of what one may call the more \"adult\" works on view. It is all the more gratifying, therefore, that Ireland has carried off one of the principal awards in the Exhibition, a Gold Star for still life.\u2014Irish Times.\n\nTHE SOCIETY'S STUDIOS.\n\nThe Royal Drawing Society has Studios in which the figure can be studied, as well as painting, anatomy, the history of art and architecture, etc. Those wishing to become teachers in the Schools connected with the Society (over 2,000) are afforded practice in actual teaching. Instruction and criticism are given by experienced teachers.\n\nParticulars on application to 18, Queen Anne's Gate, Westminster, S.W. 1.\n\nW. & Co., Ltd.\u2014Q 40521.\nVernon, B.C.\nJune 12th 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI enclose herewith copy of the \"Report of the Royal Drawing Society's 45th Annual Exhibition of Drawings\" covering the Exhibition of the Society held in the Guildhall Art Gallery at London, England last April.\n\nThis is an important art society in England under Royal Patronage and I am pleased to advise that an Indian pupil, Ernest Baptiste (14 years of age) of the Indemooop Indian Day School secured one first-class commendation, two second-class and two third-class for two sheets of Decorative Compositions.

While it is a great blessing for which I am thankful it is difficult for me finance them and keep a home here too.\n\nI would like the Penticton school, should Miss Weydert decide to give up teaching in the future but I will be very happy if you will think well enough of me to let me have the one at Incaneep.\n\nPlease try to help me and I promise you I will teach for you with all my strength and ability.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Mrs.) Verle Moore.\nTo whom it may concern:\n\nThis is to say that Mrs Verle Moore is known to me and that I hold her in high esteem as an exemplary member of my parish.

McCaffrey, O.M.I., which you had let me have in March 1925 and which has since been on file here.\n\nPlease note that I no longer make any sort of recommendation with regard to the appointment of teachers in our Indian Day Schools. I understand that your best course would be to make a full application to The Secretary, The Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.

J.M. McCaffrey O.M.I., which I am detaching from my file here and forwarding with this letter.\n\nI had an interview with Mrs. Moore in Penticton late in the year 1935. She then stated that she was 37 years of age and held a Second Class Certificate having attended Vancouver Normal School. She last attended a Provincial Summer School in Victoria in 1930. Her two boys were at that time in the 8th and 9th Grades in Penticton. Mrs. Moore appears to know something of nurses work and has at one time had some First Aid training. She was very uneasy during our interview and did not greatly impress me. She is an old type teacher and would probably be better with the older children.

Barry,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nSCHOOLS:\n\nThese are all progressing as usual and doing good work. Penticton Day School has been provided with manual training tools and material and it is expected that this feature will add considerably to the value and attractiveness of the curriculum. A great deal of publicity has been given to some painting on buck-skin done by one of the pupils of Osoyoos School, this work securing the bronze medal of the Royal Drawing Society's annual exhibition at the Guildhall Gallery in London. The teacher, Mr. Walsh, is anxious to have this medal presented by the Governor-General at Vancouver when he visits the Vancouver Exhibition in August, also to have the boy working on handicrafts at this Exhibition. He has been given a prize by the Archbishop recently and he thinks it would be fitting for the Department to give some small token for his general application and attendance.\n\nJames Coleman,\nIndian agent.\nVernon, B.C.,  \nJune 11, 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nI have received a request from Mr. A. Walsh, teacher of the Osoyoos Indian Day School, for a small prize to be awarded to a pupil, Francis Baptiste, at the close of the school year in recognition of his excellent attendance record, as he has been absent only one and one-half days in four years. I believe an expenditure of $2.50 would amply cover the matter and would request authority for same.\n\nI would also advise that this pupil has attracted very considerable attention in the British and Canadian press by some art work forwarded by the teacher to the Royal Drawing Society's annual display at the Guildhall, London, where one article, a painting of the Nativity on buckskin, won the bronze star in the children's exhibition. As it is a British award and the Society is under Royal patronage the teacher is anxious to arrange, if possible, that the award be given by His Excellency, the Governor-General on the occasion of his visit to Vancouver this year. It is possible he may tour the Okanagan in which case probably it could be arranged without the expense of transporting the pupil to Vancouver.\n\nSome of the local Women's Institute people are anxious to have this boy demonstrate his work in buckskin and modelling at the Vancouver Exhibition, but at the moment I do not feel so sure about this. While the press and the British authorities have made a great deal of comment on the exhibits, I am inclined to the opinion that they have a rather vague impression as to the type of Indian executing the work, and there is a great difference between the nomadic Indian and the rather highly civilized type on Osoyoos Reserve with cars, radios, modern farming machinery and displaying on the surface very little difference from his white neighbor. While granting that his work has the great value of originality and novelty, in my opinion, it falls far short of what he is capable of performing. To visualize a half-naked aboriginal doing the work is one thing and to see a clean cut, excellent mannered and educated youth doing the work is another and might prove rather a disillusionment and consequently I would prefer to go into this matter further before making any recommendation involving expenditures.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6405, File 834-1, part 2)\nOttawa, June 18, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to one of the pupils of the Osayoos Indian Day School who has recently received a bronze medal for painting on buckskin.\n\nThe Department is pleased to learn of the success this pupil has achieved. I would point out, however, that it has not been our practice to allow any special prizes in cases such as this. To do so would form a precedent, which the Department is not prepared to establish at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJas. Coleman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\nREPORT ON OKANAGAN INDIAN AGENCY FOR MONTH OF MAY 1937.\n\nSCHOOLS:\n\nThese are all making satisfactory progress. The children of each of the three day schools entered the annual poster competition of the Latham Humane Foundation (an organization somewhat similar to our society of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) to which there were over 5,500 entries from all over the world. Each school secured several certificates of merit and one young woman at Penticton Reserve managed to get into the not very extensive prize list for a small award, which was very good considering the extent of the entries. This all came about by the Foundation inviting my personal entry but as I had no time I suggested that they might be interested in the Indian children's contributions with the results stated.\n\nJames Coleman,\nIndian Agent.\nINLAND AGENT'S REPORT ON OKANAGAN AGENCY FOR MARCH 1937.\n\nSCHOOLS:\n\nThese have all been visited during the month, with the exception of Osoyoos as I was on this reserve after school was closed for the day and the teacher was absent. The schools are all making progress and have been preparing posters for the Latham Foundation, an organization in California for the encouragement of protection of animals. The Foundation set aside a special class in their annual exhibition competition for the day schools of this agency. I did not have an opportunity of seeing the Osoyoos posters, but those submitted by the Penticton school were fairly good.\n\nJames Coleman,\nIndian Agent.\nOKANAGAN AGENCY INSPECTION REPORT NO. 12, May 14, 1937.\n\nINKAMDEP (OSOYOOS) DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThere were ten children in class on the date of my visit, out of a roll of 11. There were five grades, with 8th grade the highest. There was one boy who seemed good and exceedingly interested in science. The boy and girl in the 7th grade, too, were quite good as well. All the children were quite responsive to questioning and spoke up well. Things were nice and tidy, both inside and outside the school, and swings etc. had been built by the boys under the teacher's instruction. I think Mr. Walsh is doing quite creditable work here.\n\nGeo. S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nThe Inukameep School,\nOliver, B.C.\n\nJuly 22nd, 1939\n\nJ. E.

The seminar is to be held at the University of Toronto from September 4-6, 1939.\n\nProfessor MacIlwraith, the Canadian Director of the Conference, wishes me to read a paper on the start and development of Indian art at Inukameep, and lead a discussion as to the possibility of future expansion of this type of art among the Canadian Indians.

C.\nDear Dr. Barbeau,\n\nI venture once again to trespass on your time because a small group of those really interested in our Indians came at my invitation to meet Mr. Anthony Walsh of the Inkameep Indian School near Oliver, to see some striking illustrations of the latent artistic gifts of the children in that school and in particular the remarkable paintings and cravings of a lad of 19, Francois Baptiste, of which a selection is being sent to Lady Tweedsmuir by Her Excellency's express wish, that she may bring them before the Director of Art at Ottawa. Further, Mr. Walsh gave a most interesting demonstration of sign language, and of legends as acted by these children and told us that you know his school and have made thirty records of their songs.\n\nWe are forming a small Committee with the hope of furthering Mr. Walsh's valuable experiment in affording to Indian children opportunities to revive these latent gifts, and wonder whether you can add to our information on the subject from your personal knowledge. We have two main objectives: to spread among other Indian Schools in this Province a knowledge of Mr. Walsh's pioneer work with a view to arousing the interest of their Principals, and through the Provincial representatives of the Federal Government secure essential and sympathetic support to the movement. We realise time and perseverance must be our allies, but suggestions from so experienced an expert as yourself cannot but be of very material help.\n\nI am, dear Dr. Barbeau,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nAlice Rawchill\nYoung Indian Talent As Brilliant By\n\nBy CONSTANCE\n\nA little over five years ago a young Indian boy attending school at the Inikanep Indian\n\nFRANCIS BAPTISTE\n\nSchool near Oliver, B.C., started drawing pictures for his teacher, Mr. Anthony J. L. Levesque. He thought at that time that his artistry would receive such high awards and noteworthy praise as it has done in Canada and\nYoung Indian Makes Name As Brilliant B. C. Artist\n\nBy CONSTANCE SEELEY.\n\nA little over five years ago an European. The teacher recognized the artistic work of his young pupil and sent some of the pictures to be exhibited in Eastern Canada. Later the boy went to London where they were exhibited at the Royal Drawing Society and received honorable mention. The artist's name is Francis Baptiste and he is now about 19 years of age. He has distinguished himself as a Canadian to attain the honor of having one of his pictures, \"Indian Boys in Training,\" acquired by the Royal Drawing Society for its memorial collection.\n\nHAS OWN STUDIO.\n\nIn 1939 Francis Baptiste was sent to Santa Fe, New Mexico, to study Indian art. At first the boy was very homesick, and he found difficulty in adjusting himself to the new life. He soon recovered, however, and his mixing with young artists stimulated his interest and for a long time he was producing pictures with a new and inspired aspect. Upon his return to Canada, Baptiste, Chief Baptist George, who was so interested in the boy's work and so pleased with what he had accomplished, so many awards, built him a studio of his very own. His studio is situated on the Inkameep Reservation, and Francis is continuing his work in his native surroundings.\n\n\"Indian Boys in Training,\" was selected out of thousands to be taken to the Empire Exhibition, where it was viewed by the King and Queen, and in the summer of 1938 it was exhibited at the Empire Fair in Glasgow.\n\nMANY PRIZES.\n\nAnother picture, \"Canadian Nativity,\" was painted on birch skin. It was awarded the bronze star in 1938 at the exhibition of the Royal Drawing Society in London, then came a copy of this picture which placed in exhibit in Toronto and Montreal, where it received high praise from art critics. In 1937 Francis received a silver star for his picture, \"St. Francis and the Birds.\" Both his pictures were offered to one of the companies competing in the Dominion Drama Festival and were accepted.\n\nA portfolio, portraying the life of the Okanagan Indian, ancient and modern, and to which Francis has contributed much of his artistry, was exhibited at the famous Clzek Juvenile Art Centre in Victoria when he was nine. Later this was sent to Prague, where it was shown at several schools.\n\nFor five years now, Francis has contributed much to the realms of art, and he is unique in that he and one would never think that so many honors could have been acquired by a boy who likes to paint and draw.\nPRIDE OF RACE IS ENCOURAGED\n\nAnthony Walsh, Teacher at Inkameep Indian Reserve, Describes Native Art\n\nA fascinating talk about what is being accomplished in restoring and developing among the Indian children of the Inkameep Reserve near Merritt, in the Okanagan Valley, love and understanding of their own traditions, legends, poetry, dances, songs and history was given by Mr. Walsh to an interested group gathered in the lounge of the Windermere Hotel yesterday to hear Anthony Walsh, teacher at the Inkameep School.\n\n\"Developing Indian Pride of Race\" was the subject of Mr. Walsh's address. He approached the discussion of Indian native art from this angle, opening his talk with a delightful \"composite\" story of the Nativity written by his native pupils and with some symbolic pictures which revealed the religious nature of the people.\n\nIn the first part of his address, Mr. Walsh described the Indian settlement, which consists of about 105 people. Although not far away, Mr. Walsh was almost isolated until two months ago controlled, so far as internal management was concerned, by the old chief who was in his ripe age of ninety. Fishing, hunting, the management of small orchards and garden furnishes all they needed for food and clothing. Before he died the old chief said to Mr. Walsh, \"Teach these young people to be good men and women before all else, showing his deep concern for the future.\n\nSKETCH OF EACH CHILD\n\nMr. Walsh then gave a sketch of each child in his school indicating the stage of maturity and artistic ability of each, and their unconscious inheritance of native culture. As an illustration of his work he gave the pupil who brought in the largest collection of Indian songs he had heard a copy of a book containing a full list of the Inkameep melodies. Living very close to nature the boys and girls were naturally observant and small birds\u5f15\u8d77\u4e86and a lot of interest in his schoolmates as well as his teacher by faithfully illustrating the Ojibway songs he had picked up while following his father's plough over the field.\n\nAlthough the Indians follow the curriculum set by the Government, Mr. Walsh makes sure that the children have fifteen minutes daily to creative work when the individual abilities of each boy and girl are given free expression and encouragement, with special anxiety to bring out any characteristically Indian art or ornamentation. During both the poetic and dramatic instinct of the children he gave two plays, written by himself and performed entirely by the Indians, masks being worn in lieu of special costumes.\n\nMr. Walsh was introduced by Miss Alice Ravenhill, well-known Victoria authority on British Columbia Indians, who was present, and among the interested members of the audience was Major L. Bullock-Webster, of the community drama branch of the Department of Education.\nIndian Boy's Work Attracted Many\n\nEvidence that the exhibition of paintings by a young Indian artist, held last week at the Windermere Hotel, aroused very genuine interest is shown not only by the large number of daily visitors amounting in all to upwards of 500, but by the satisfactory sale of half the exhibits. These included horses, full of action and vitality, studies of other animals, such as squirrels and skunks, mountain sheep and deer, and a variety of most attractive birds, including an eagle and wild geese, quail and blue birds.\n\nThe black and white illustrations prepared by the youth for the forthcoming publication of the attractive and naive \"Tale of the Nativity,\" were also on view. This \"tale\" was written by the teacher by the children on the Inkameep Reserve, near Oliver. It is of this reserve that this lad has spent his 29 years, among surroundings which have inspired the form...\nOttawa, October 30, 1940.\n\nDear Mr. Walsh:\n\nI have been very much interested in the work you are doing at the Inkameep school and at different times have thought of writing you. However you will understand better than most people just what happens to correspondence when one is trying to promote Indian handicraft.\n\nI am arranging a display and sale of goods produced on Indian Reservations, at Winnipeg from November 15 to December 24. I shall be staying at The Hall hotel, Winnipeg, and if you have any beadwork or other articles which you would like to send in, I shall be happy to endeavour to sell them. I think it advisable to have everything sent to the hotel, as it will not be mixed with other goods. Our method is to bring in on consignment, at wholesale rates, the different types of work produced. As my main object in the East is to get Indians off relief, our basketry etc. should really come under the heading of \"Home Industries\", rather than \"Handicraft\". I feel sure that any of the work done under your supervision would add greatly to the effectiveness of our display. If you could send in, for example, one or two dozen pairs of mocassins of assorted sizes, please send with them a wholesale price list at which prices I would consign them to the Hudson's Bay Company and they would be re-marked for retail.\n\nI wonder also if the young Indian artist Sis-hu-lk, would care to consign any of his work.\n\nAnthony Walsh, Esq.,\nThe Inkameep School,\nOliver, B. C.\nI presume he would need to state the price he would require for each piece and then I would add 10% or 15% to his asking price. I do not mean that we would need to confine ourselves to beadwork or pictures, but I do not know whether you have pottery or other types of work done in your district.\n\nMr. Hoey showed me a letter received from Miss Ravenhill recently. She must be a wonderful old lady.\n\nWith best wishes, I am\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHandicraft Section.\nIndians Tell Tale of Nativity\n\nThe Tale of the Nativity, as told by the Indian children of the Inakameep tribe of the Okanagan, has been published by the Committee to Promote the Revival and Development of the Ancient Gifts of the Native Tribes of British Columbia, in an effort to see these ancient tales of the true Canadian story again in life.\n\nAnthony Walsh, in charge of the Inakameep school, many years ago saw that these Indians possessed dormant artistic gifts, and that with their revival they would contribute greatly to Canadian art and culture. He realized that these innate abilities, artistry, craftsmanship and dramatic talent of the Indians were dormant, until today the results are apparent in all their work.\n\nIt is only those who are most progressive who progress the farthest along the artistic path is a young lad, Sis-hulk, whose drawings and paintings are known throughout Canada. A tribute to their excellency lies in the fact that an entire exhibition, containing only his animal pictures, drew much interest and attention in Victoria, when they were exhibited at the Windermere Hotel here last June, and in that they are still remembered by the Royal Family, who viewed them in 1914 after their exhibition by the Royal Drawing Society in London. This young artist has also done illustrations for the Lieutenant Governor and Mr. Hamber, and many other well-known local people, the Inakameep version of the Nativity shown being one. It is the story of the birth of Christ and His early years, as adapted by these Indians to their own environment and civilization.\n\nThroughout the tale the charming, simple folk-lore of typical Indian stories is evident.\n\nThe money derived from the sale of the book will go to remuneration of Sis-hulk for his artistic contributions and to the advancement of the natural talents of these peoples.\n\nA. M. D. Fairbairn, private secretary to His Honor Lieutenant-Governor Hamber, sent a congratulatory letter to the editor and wished Sis-hulk every success in his future career. Another letter from Mr. Fairbairn, Secretary of the Department of Welfare Training, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, commends the book and its illustrations.\n\nSis-hulk... Illustrates book.\nOttawa, January 29, 1925.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn the administration of Indian Affairs one of the most important problems confronting the Department is the repression of intemperance among Indians on the Reserves. In view of the peculiar character of the duties of Indian Agents and particularly, moreover, as they are frequently obliged to act in a magisterial capacity, it is essential that they should themselves be above reproach and that they should observe the strictest propriety in their personal conduct in every respect. So serious is the view taken by the Department with regard to this subject that any well-founded reports of inebriety will result in immediate suspension and probable dismissal.\n\nIt should be understood that this letter is intended for the advice and guidance of all Indian Agents and that no personal application is intended.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOur Indian Culture\n\nRecently I had the good fortune to hear a lecture by Mr. Walsh upon the work he is doing among the native children at Inkameep, B.C. Mr. Walsh said little in the conventional sense, what he did was to act out five short folk plays written for his pupils and nothing like all folk literature does, of bears and birds, sun, wind and earth, the oldest ties man has with his world.\n\nMr. Walsh is more than a teacher; he has the restrained yet kindling fire of an artist. A man who is keen and aware of the work he has labored at untiringly for the last ten years. He believes implicitly in the tradition and nationalism of the Indians and has dedicated himself to the work of showing this ancient people their worth and to the white man for what they are, a race endowed with an art, and a history that are unique.\n\nIn these native children he has studied closely and when he knows so well, he has discovered a natural poetry and humor, a sense of music and rhythm of the dance. The larger aim of his work is to raise the status of Canada's finest settlers by teaching them how to develop their native culture and so adjust themselves to the difficult conditions and demands of a white man's world.\n\nHe spoke of his first meeting with the chief, a spare figure of dignity with flashing black eyes and an ancient dignity. When he was about to begin teaching the old man said earnestly, \"Mr. Walsh, I want you to teach my people how to meet the world upon its own terms.\"\nHEAR YE!\nHEAR YE!\nHEAR YE!\n\nSeventh Annual National Folk Festival\n\nConstitution Hall\n\nApril 25, 26, 27\n\nSponsored by THE WASHINGTON POST Folk Festival Association\nProgram\n\nThursday Afternoon April 25\n\nSinging Games From Tennessee\nBy a group from the Tennessee Mountains, Fred Colby, Leader.\n\nShip To My Land\nPaw Paw Patch\nStraight Through The Door\nFour Leaf Clover\n\nCumberland Gap (Fiddle Tune)\nIn our country, the ancient British, Spanish, French, German, and Negro have distinctive place in the life of the people.

Chanteys were the work-songs of the sea.\"\n\nWar Songs\nBy Memorial Church Choir, Army Medical Corps, Washington, D.C.\n\nYankee Doodle\nOld Gray Mare\n\nThe melody of the \"Old Gray Mare\" is said to have been written especially for the \"Old Gray Mare Troop,\" Old West Virginia Troop, the first regiment of the United States to be organized in the Civil War. The most popular Lincoln campaign songs in the North were \"Yankee Doodle\" and \"Old Gray Mare.\" Both were sung by soldiers in camp and on the march during the war. After the war was sung by civilians and became a popular song on national occasions.\n\nJohn Brown's Body\nHinky Dinky, Parker-Yan\n\nThese songs are known in England, Germany and Sweden as early as the 18th century. They are a drinking and drinking song. It probably originated in America in the close of the century as a Methodist camp-meeting song, and a drinking song.\n\nHinky Dinky is the outstanding favorite of the English pub songs. The tune and verse structure are similar to those of the British Army for many years. The Melody is said to have been originally in the sense that new words were added to it. Some authorities trace the tune back to the old French song \"La Belle Jardiniere,\" known as early as the sixteenth century, while others say that the Pope, just quoted, is the generally held.\n\nTaps\nStar Spangled Banner\n\nMany songs, not distinctly folk, also have folk melodies, religious and patriotic songs as well as others.

Some enter on an invitation basis, selected either because of their outstanding competition at local and regional festivals or because of their travel expenses or are sent to Washington for the first time by the State Education. None receives pay for his participation.\n\nOnly one full rehearsal has been held. The performers have studied performance of professional standards and have been instructed to perform as they would in their own environment. They are not to take part in a formalized program but to present themselves as they would in their own communities but to have a good time and to enjoy themselves. It is to be a festival in the true sense of the word, a festival for everybody, marking for both spectators and performers a new experience.\n\nOver the seventh successive year, a presentation by the Kiowa Indians, famous for their paintings and carvings will open each of the four evenings of the festival.

The Eighth Annual National Folk Festival will be held in the nation's capital May 1, 2 and 3, 1941, under the sponsorship of the Washington Post Folk Festival Association.\n\nOBJECTIVE\n\nThe objective of the National Folk Festival is to bring together annually the varied racial groups from the different sections of the United States, with their characteristic folk expressions for a people's holiday and merry-making. In addition to the joy the Festival gives to participants and audiences, it reflects the social life and traditional customs used since early days. Through the inter-change of distinctive folk-songs, music, drama, dance, and folk arts, it offers an opportunity for greater understanding and better understanding and more tolerance which should result in stronger national unity. It hopes to create consciousness of the richness of our traditional folk-art, the basic art, which would undoubtedly help to inspire classic art built on these roots.\n\nWHAT THE PROGRAMS INCLUDE\n\nThe programs include folk-song, music, dance and other traditional expressions handed down orally and traditionally, presented generally by rural people who have been their guardians. They reflect the age in which they were used. A National Folk Festival is a twenty-five-year-old age which has told its different stories and has reached by modern civilization. The best possible example of survival by groups that could work out a way to get to the festival have been included. But as chances become less and less auspicious for survival, efforts for revival seem necessary. At the Seventh Festival it was no longer possible to present some of the survivals which appeared on the program of the first festival in St. Louis. The participants who knew the songs traditionally were too old to come. So a few groups with revivals or with dances taught, have been accepted. Though the programs especially feature rural folk, some urban groups have been admitted because the American square dance and other traditions are needed and used by city dwellers as well as rural folk. Many people who now live in cities know and love folk-song music and dance because they are of rural birth and background.\n\nINCENTIVE FOR COMMUNITY FESTIVALS\n\nThe chief interest of the National Folk Festival Association was, at first, the development of an annual National Folk Festival, to show a cross-section of the folk-expressions of the major racial groups which have contributed most to the folk-life of the United States.\n\nAt the beginning, community folk festivals were held only in the state or region where the National Folk Festival was presented in connection with the development of its program. For these festivals the best representatives were sent to the National. As time has passed, we have seen the importance of them for their own value to the community. We have encouraged festivals regardless of participation in the National. We have recognized the part the traditions of old and new Americans can play in community and national life. The National Folk Festival can serve only a limited number of participants since it is held only in one city each year and lasts only three days. The community festival arouses in each community an interest in and appreciation of the deeply-rooted, basic cultures peculiar to that community. It offers many a chance to participate and even more the opportunity to witness performances. It gives the community an additional cultural leisure-time activity, which costs little money and can be carried on by local leaders.\n\nFor several years there has been a growing interest in community folk festivals, especially among rural leaders, many directly or indirectly given incentive by the National Folk Festival. Those mentioned below have been directly influenced.\n\nBefore the first National Folk Festival in St. Louis in 1934, eighteen community festivals were held in the Arkansas and Missouri Ozarks with May Kennedy McCord, of Springfield, leader. Prior to the second Festival in Chattanooga in 1935, regional festivals were held in four different sections of Tennessee. Fred W. Colby of Nashville, Tennessee, has carried on...\nthe work throughout the state since then. Preliminary to the third event at Dallas in 1936, thirty community festivals were held in Texas, and four in Missouri. Also in that year, four Indian festivals were held in different sections of Oklahoma. In connection with the festival in Chicago in 1937, several festivals were given in Illinois and Wisconsin.\n\nIn the last three years, as a result of interest created by the National Folk Festival in Washington, a number of schools in the District have had school festivals of one kind or another. Six thousand and one school children have attended each festival in Washington, with the result that teachers and students have become more aware of the various traditions. Delaware has had a state folk festival for three years; Upper Marlboro, and Prince George's County, Maryland; Virginia, the University of West Virginia, and other communities have presented local festivals. The annual Mountain Song and Dance Festival at Asheville, North Carolina has been carried on for the past fourteen years directed by Beacon Lamar Lunsford, member of our National Executive Committee, and pioneer in the folk field. Pennsylvania has had state folk festivals in addition to numerous community ones under the direction of George Korson of Bucknell University, also a member of our National Executive Committee. A California folk festival was staged in 1939 at the Golden Gate Exposition by M. J. Pickering, Business Manager of the National Folk Festival.\n\nThe interest created in many communities has continued, and festivals are regularly held in a number of places though not in all where they have been begun. Most of the leaders have set up and insisted upon definite standards. In such instances the work has gone forward. But where the leaders did not stick to genuine folk traditions, the plans have fallen through. It is our hope this year that many more leaders in different communities throughout the country will make plans for annual state or community folk festivals and that they will hold to the best in the traditions of their communities.\n\nEXPERIMENT IN NEW MEXICO\n\nLast year, in connection with the United States Coronado Cuarto Centennial, in New Mexico, as Supervisor of Folk Festivals, I had the opportunity, in cooperation with Arthur L. Orme, of the University of New Mexico, of proving what could be done under proper conditions. Two hundred folk festivals were held in the various Spanish-American and Anglo communities with a few Indian festivals on the Navajo reservation.\n\nState-wide Educational Program Carried on For Six Months. If the folk festivals in New Mexico had been planned purely as entertainment, quickly arranged and soon over, they would have made no imprint on the state, but being thoughtfully planned and executed after a period of six months preparation, many of the traditions, which otherwise would have passed from the scene, were realized for continued use.\n\nThe state-wide plans were made in the fall of last year, through the cooperation of teachers and community leaders in most of the schools and communities. After Christmas the plans were put into operation and continued until spring, when the festivals began.\n\nSchool Plans. The music teachers in schools taught the folk-songs of New Mexico, as a regular part of the music course. Physical education directors emphasized the folk-dances. Legend and folk-tales were featured in the class room. Many projects were worked out by teachers of different departments to make the students of the state more conscious of the charm and worth of the traditional heritages of the Indian, Spanish-American, and Anglo. In a number of cases, the teachers had the students collect legends, tales, superstitions, etc., to record for future use. Through this plan new impetus was given to the use of the rich folk legacies. New appreciation was felt of the privilege of living in a state with three sets of folk-traditions, expressing three philosophies of life.\n\nThere can be no doubt that the state taken as a whole still has more survivals of traditional expressions, and they are more generally used in everyday life than any other. Yet modernity is taking its toll even there. The Coronado Cuarto Centennial Folk Festival program came at the logical time to give new impetus.\n\nCommunity Activities. In many communities \"set-togethers\" were held for several months for the adults. Teachers in the community, and people generally, came together to learn folk-dances or singin'-games. Leaders who knew them taught others or if all knew them, they enjoyed a weekly evening of folk-dancing. By the time spring had come many had learned again the dances that were giving way to newer forms which did not serve as well.\n\n\"Old-timers\" met each week to live over early days in New Mexico.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6405, File 834-1, part 2)\nthrough telling the \"tall\" tales. Legends which were slipping out of the memories of those of the older generations and had not been taken up by the new were given new life.\n\nThe 16th century Spanish-American folk-drama of the Miracle and Morality variety was revived. This type of traditional drama has served as New Mexico's \"Little Theater.\" It met the need which professional drama could not meet in a state of isolated communities. It has been used since the Spanish-Americans came into the region in the early 17th century. In many communities where they were ceasing to be done, they were again presented through the incentive given by the state-wide interest in the return to the traditional.\n\nThough good roads now bind together the isolated communities of the state, the Spanish-American in New Mexico is still economically bound to the soil. Until that condition is radically changed the traditions will be needed. No other form of recreation can take the place of the deeply-rooted folk-traditions which have served the state for four hundred years.\n\nNew Mexico Plan Logical for Other States or Communities. Similar plans could be carried on in many states or communities, differing according to the needs. Many contend that we are a standardized nation. We are in many ways. We are making too much of an effort to make alike each community, rural or urban. Individual differences and needs should be recognized. There are still many rural communities besides New Mexico where actual living conditions have not changed much with the rapidly advancing civilization around them. There are communities who organized recreation through the National Recreation Association, City Recreation Departments or Extension Divisions of State Universities have not been able to reach. In some communities where these plans reached, often their splendid programs fail to utilize the leadership and natural heritages of the folk of the community. Frequently leaders do not fully realize the possibilities of such programs. A part of the program for rural recreation surely should be one which stresses the importance of the inherent dignity of rural culture, as well as one emphasizing the fine points of urban culture. It should prepare rural folk for more joyous living, by utilizing their own resources.\n\nDuring the National Recreation Association Congress in Cleveland last October, I attended the discussion sessions where rural culture and recreation were discussed. In every meeting there were those who were making use of folk expressions. But always there were those who felt that stressing the use of folkways, folk art and dance was going back to the \"horse-and-buggy\" days. They did not recognize how much older than that is folk-culture. They did not think of it as the fountain source and well worth the return for inspiration and refreshment. These genuine natural expressions are as greatly needed now as when our pioneer forefathers used them as they cut their way through wildernesses to establish houses here. We are pioneering again searching for better ways of life in a civilization much more complex than our fathers found here. We need simple, wholesome recreation to help us keep our balance in these confused times, more, perhaps, than early colonists needed it to lighten the load and offset the prosaic, monotonous days of early trail-blazing.\n\nThe community festival is a logical way of giving a needed recreational activity, of utilizing and dignifying rich heritages to serve a definite need now generally felt.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE OF PROGRAM\n\nIf the traditional expressions existing in the United States had no roots in the past, no possibility of life in the future, the joy that comes through their use today would be sufficient reason for national and community folk festivals. But there is value to the folk-traditions in addition to present recreational worth. There is more to the folk-song than the tune of it, more to the folk-dance than its form, more to the myth than the story it tells. In our traditional expressions are recorded the social life of early America, and the growing, changing life for America. They reflect the \"living history\" of our country, the struggles and joys we have shared together in establishing a new nation. Through them we glimpse the life of native lands from which our peoples have come. They reach far back into the days of unrecorded history and tell us the customs and beliefs, the longings and desires of those days.\n\nWe cannot blind ourselves to the fact that the foundations of our basic cultures should be projected into the future because their forms are fundamental. Our cultural and social life, for rural and urban people, will be less rich if we lose them. As they have served the past and are used in the present, so will the future need them. They should not be blown away with a changing civilization.\nThis is a significant age of transition between an older, simpler America and a new, more standardized, uncertain one. If our traditional expressions are to be continued into the future, a conscious effort must be made. The chances are that many will not be continued as an unconscious art, as they have been in the past. The machine age and industrialism have brought an end to many folkways and traditional customs in other countries. The folk-lore of every nation passes through three stages. In the first, it is in its prime. No outside influence has touched it. In the second, it is on the down-grade because of outside influence, but it still has vitality to respond to stimulus. In the third, there is no life upon which to build revival. We are in the second stage today.\n\nWe cannot expect these expressions to survive in their purest forms when conditions that brought them into being, or went then alive thus far, radically change. The isolated communities in their purest form are now connected by radio, good roads and automobiles with the outside world. Rivals in other forms of entertainment have appeared where once the traditional alone held sway. So a new attitude toward them must be taken if they are to remain to enrich the soil from which they spring. They must be emphasized in order that survival may continue longer and revival come sooner, while there is a \"living\" pattern to go by. While they are vital forces in our lives they should be incorporated in the roots of our culture.\n\nWe are thinking much about conservation of forests, wild life, and land. Land can be restored, forests brought back, but once life has gone out of the people's stories, songs and dances, the intimate reflections of their deepest sentiments and feelings, they cannot be restored to their original form. Perhaps some day in the future, folk-ways shall have given way to standardization, man will try to piece together the fabric of song, dance, and legend, better to understand life today. But the spirit will be lost. Now, while the traditions endure, is our opportunity.\n\nSince there is at present, almost the first general interest in traditional heritage in the United States, we should take advantage of the situation and make organized efforts to preserve them, as we are trying to preserve our forests, wild life and land. Scholarly work in collecting and recording is necessary for history and invaluable to leaders of folk groups, but it fails to pass on the vital spark which oral transmission gives.\n\nWith old ways of life breaking down in many lands, the United States has a vital part to play as guardian of European heritages. Unless the attitude in Europe changes, and if we continue our democratic way of life, they is the place where they must be preserved. Many of the nations of the Old World with civilization much older than ours have had revivals at one time or another, but usually after living forms had passed. Fabrics had to be pieced together from records and books. The original spontaneity was gone. We should not make this mistake.\n\nCOLLECTING FOLK-MATERIALS DATES BACK TO ANCIENT DAYS\n\nInterest in collecting traditional materials of the folk goes back, we know, as far as the \"Vedas\", and has come on down, with great gaps, through the time of Christ to the present day, each collection reflecting certain periods. Until modern times however only comparatively few scholars were attracted to folk-lore, though earliest literature made use of the lore of the folk which had been handed down orally. As printing facilities became better, the traditions which had long been transmitted by word of mouth found their way more and more to the written page.\n\nThere has gradually developed a widening of interest in folk-lore in all countries. Among some of the European countries, especially Scandinavia, in the early 17th century, started collections and established museums of folk materials. It was not until the middle of the 19th century that folk-lore really attained the status of value as a science recognized by scholars generally in western Europe and America. In 1846 the term \"traditions\" or \"popular antiquities\" became \"folk-lore,\" then came the coinage of the word by Thomas, of England. This new word \"folk-lore\" was more usable, more living. No doubt it played a part in opening the way for continued interest in traditional forms, then would have been possible through the use of \"antiquities\" which seems to have no connection with the present.\n\nSCIENTIFIC AND LITERARY INTEREST IN THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS.\n\nDuring the latter part of the last century, through incentive given by the scientific methods laid down by the Brothers Grimm, of Germany, folklorists from England, Germany, France, Scandinavia, America and other\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6405, File 834-1, part 2)\ncountries have made comparative studies analyzed and classified myths, legends, folk-tales, superstitions, music and dance. The chief concern of many of the immediate followers of the Grimm Brothers was to trace the history of the human race through scientific study of folk-lore. There was no other way except through archaeological findings to open the closed doors of the past.\n\nOther scholars in these countries, for more specific literary purposes, have analyzed, classified and collected the folk material. Generally they have it with materials from purely the literary standpoint, with no thought of putting them back into circulation, or making them serve a purpose except for those interested in literary pursuits.\n\nSince the turn of the present century, however, there has developed a steadily growing interest in collecting folk expressions among musicians, dancers, and lovers of folk-tales for their own value. These later collectors are interested in making use of them or making them available to others. Just as scientific and literary interest in folk-lore spread in earlier days throughout western Europe and America, at about the same period, so this more recent humanized approach came to the different countries.\n\nMORE RECENT GROWTH OF INTEREST\n\nCecil J. Sharp, of England, had vision beyond collecting. He saw value in folk-lore for social purposes, and recognized the need for revival since many of the original forms had ceased to exist in England. He was a musician as well as a literary man. His collections, with music for songs and directions for dances, made in England and America about thirty years ago, and his interest in teaching started a revival in England which spread to the other European countries and reached America. His contribution was teaching and \"showing\", as well as collecting.\n\nThe first collections of British ballads and folk-songs in the United States by Child, Kittredge, Randolf, etc., others included texts of traditional ballads collected and discussed from the literary standpoint with little or no music. More recent collections have been made covering the traditional associations of the Indian, British, Spanish-American, German, French and other Old World heritages, also Negro, lumberjack, cowboy, miner, sailor and other New World creations, which have contributed to American folk-life. Many of the first collections here were not made with any idea of continued use as folk expressions.\n\nWithin the last ten years, however, there has been an increasing interest in usable songs, music and dances, including music for the songs, directions for the dances, as well as myths and tales for use. Music teachers, physical education directors, rural sociologists, recreation leaders and others, have begun to draw upon these sources for materials. Even anthropologists and scientific folklorists are beginning to humanize their approach. This broadening of interest has not only been in evidence in our country but in Canada, Mexico and some of the South American countries as well as in Europe.\n\nDuring the last ten years there has been a tendency on the part of the peoples of many nations to return to the simple fundamentals of folk-song, music and dance. National or international folk-festivals have been held in England, Sweden, Hungary, Germany, Russia, Canada, Mexico and Bolivia, as well as in the United States. The National Folk Festival preceded most of those mentioned. In 1935 I attended the International Folk Dance Festival in London. The objectives were much the same as those of the National Folk Festival, comparative study, recognition of social values, and creating better understanding through interchange of folk-dances. There was such recognition of the value of these objectives among the European countries that the majority of the governments of the participating nations officially sponsored the groups.\n\nAs a new group after group moved across the stage of Royal Albert Hall with their characteristic dances I thought, \"That color! What strength! What simple natural grace! Here they represent sixteen different countries. In my land they are all part of one nation over which the Stars and Stripes wave. What opportunity is ours!\"\n\nIMPORTANCE OF FOLK TRADITIONS TO NATIONAL LIFE\n\nWe feel that the National Folk Festival, which has sunk its roots deep into American soil, has a part to play in national life if war comes to our doors. Battles are not won by battle-ships or airplanes alone. The spirit of the people counts. With a foundation in the various communities already laid, we feel that we can do much in helping our people hold their balance \"behind the lines.\" We can play a part in \"defense from within.\"\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6405, File 834-1, part 2)\nWe are being guided in many ways now by successes and failures of nations in the present European struggles. At first dictators paid no attention to the folk expressions. Hitler, however, has made use of the traditional expressions of Germany through his youth program for ten years or more. He has bound together the German youth into new soldiers, through folk-song, music and dance. They have played an important part in helping him build up a strong national and racial consciousness and pride. Hitler has been a broad sympathizer philosophy. It has been the opposite of what should be the ideal use of folk traditions in a democratic nation. But his plan does show the strength of folk expressions as the ties that bind.\n\nRussia has had somewhat similar programs, with the same general objectives. Both Germany and Russia have used the traditional expressions or revivals as propaganda to develop totalitarian states. The dictators recognize the sentimental approach which folk expressions give them.\n\nCzechoslovakia and Finland Used to Strengthen Loyalties. The folk traditions of Czechoslovakia kept alive the spirit of the country for four hundred years during its dismemberment before the nation was again united after the World War. The fighting spirit of the Finns owes a debt to traditional ties that gave them common ideals and purposes.\n\nEngland Saw the Need in Governing Peoples of Diverse Cultures. England's scientists saw the value of traditions a number of years ago. One of the earlier scientific folklorists, Taylor, writing about 1870 and speaking of England said: \"She who rules over vast territories of infinite diversity...of all stages of culture cannot possibly govern without taking into account the motivating powers that actuate them.\" Folklorist Hartland, Taylor's English contemporary, said: \"That a waste of precious human lives might have been saved in our manifold dealings...if we had been acquainted with their mode of thought.\" Since that time, efforts have been made by scholars and scientists in our country, as well as in others, to understand the individual characteristics of various peoples which are best expressed through folk traditions.\n\nTRADITIONAL TIES UNITE THE AMERICAS\n\nINVITATION TO OUR NEIGHBORS\n\nUntil very recent times we looked to Europe for our cultural and economic patterns. The startling events in Europe have made us see the wisdom and the necessity of developing cultural and economic relations with nations in this Hemisphere. At least we are opening our eyes to see that we are really related and tied together through strong bonds.\n\nSince its beginning, the National Folk Festival has included on its program many of the traditions common to Canada, Mexico, South America, the Islands and the United States. We recognize that many of the traditional expressions in the United States bind us to these countries as well as to Europe. Recognizing the value of strengthening ties and interchange of traditional heritages, last year the Territory of Hawaii was represented on the Festival program through the cooperation of Dr. Martha Beckwith of Vassar College Folk-Lore Foundation and Miss Alice Brown of Honolulu, Hawaii. This year we are eager to have South America, Mexico, Canada and the Islands send guest groups to the Eighth Annual National Folk Festival. This offers a logical medium for interchange between these countries.\n\nThe common ties of language and traditional customs are the strongest ones that we have with Canada, Mexico, South America and the Islands. Strong are the language and traditional ties of the English, French, Scotch and other stocks common to America and Canada. Invaluable in understanding Mexico and South America are the Spanish language and Spanish-American traditions which have existed on what is now United States soil for four hundred years. The \"Good Neighbor\" policy should begin at home. When we really come to recognize, appreciate, and claim as our own the cultural heritages of our own national family with its varied stocks, it will be much easier to establish genuine cultural relations with kinsmen in other countries.\n\nThe Cultural Division of the State Department and the Pan American Union have broad programs for developing better cultural relations between the Americas. The National Folk Festival is most concerned with the folk traditions and their cultural significances to our own country. However, we feel that with the development of appreciation of our own folk heritages and the insight into the distinctive character of each group, will come a better basis for understanding our neighbors whose presentations we are eager to include on this year's program.\nIt is high time for the United States to recognize the worth of folk traditions in democratizing our peoples, in creating better understanding, more tolerance, and stronger national unity. Few nations, if any, have as many living folk expressions as we have and none has the variety which our many racial groups give us. Each group within our borders has its own peculiar temperament, its own distinctive quality and philosophy of life. Inherent characteristics are expressed in folk-song, music, dance, legend, folklore, etc. An intelligent use of these traditions now would undoubtedly go far in making possible a richer cultural life in peace times, and a more united front in the emergency of war.\n\nIf totalitarian states have found the folk traditions of value in developing esprit du corps; if Czechoslovakia, Finland and other countries in peace as well as war-time have found joy, strength and spirit in them; if England has recognized the importance of traditions that express racial temperament, prejudices and traditional ways of life in governing her people, is it not well for the United States with its many groups of diverse philosophies of life, which may be used for well or woe, to consider well its folk traditions? May this not be a way to understanding and unity?\n\nFrom the vantage point of the mid-twentieth century, we see many significances in the individual differences of our peoples which we could not have seen earlier. Time had to give us perspective. If the white man in early days had better understood the Indian's nature...but then, he could not until he glimpsed it in his age-old ceremonials through which his soul speaks. If we had known the burdened soul of the Negro in bondage...but then, we could not until we heard his soul cry through his spirituals, which grew out of that burden. If we had become better acquainted with our Spanish-Americans whose traditions have roots four hundred years old on what is now United States soil...but it took a world crisis to attract attention to them. As last we are beginning, along with other older nations, to understand that folk traditions are not just \"relics of an outlived\" past. They are vital today.\n\nNATIONAL FOLK FESTIVAL ASSOCIATION\n\nPaul Green, President\nSarah Gertrude Knott, Founder and Director\nHomer P. Rainey, Vice-President\nM. J.

You may have heard of his work having been exhibited in London, Paris etc. Her Majesty, the Queen, purchased one of his pictures during the London exhibition.\n\nWe are very proud of the fact that Mr. Antony Walsh, the teacher on the Inkameep Reserve, has recently received an invitation to attend the \"Washington Post National Folk Festival\" at Washington D.C., together with a small number of his talented young pupils.\n\nWe should very much like to see Canada represented at the forthcoming Festival were it possible to finance the undertaking. There is good reason to believe that Mr. Walsh's creative work based on old Indian traditions, is quite unique, as is the extraordinary talent manifested by the Inkameep Indian Band in general.\n\nHowever, before taking any further action we would ask you to kindly let us know whether this project would meet with your approval. We have already explained to Miss S.G. Knott, Director of the National Folk Festival at Washington that it would be necessary to obtain your approval before the offer could be considered.\n\nWe shall greatly appreciate your reply informing us as to your views in this matter.\n\nYours truly,\nOkanagan Society for the Research and Revival of Indian Arts and Crafts.\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary pro tem.\nAir Mail\n\nThe Hon.

I can state without hesitation that I have nothing but words of commendation for the work in which your organization is engaged, and I feel confident that the Eighth Annual Folk Festival, to be held in Washington May 1, 2 and 3, will prove of more than ordinary educational and inspirational value to the people taking part therein.\n\nI regret to state, however, that existing regulations make it almost impossible for us to seriously consider allowing Mr. Walsh, of the Inkameep Indian Day School, to visit Washington and take part in your festival of this year.\n\nSince the outbreak of the war, we have been limiting travel on the part of Civil Servants to a few excursions that cannot be avoided without impairing the efficiency of our service. In addition to this, we have discouraged travel to the United States, in the hope that by so doing we could conserve funds and thus enable the Government to make greater war purchases in your country. An exception, of course, might be made in the case of Mr. Walsh, but it is exceedingly -\n\nMiss Sarah G. Knott,\nDirector, National Folk Festival,\nSuite 101, Munsey Building,\n1229 E Street Northwest,\nWashington, D.C., U.S.A.\nexceedingly difficult to make such exceptions without at the same time creating dissatisfaction amongst other members of the service, who feel that the work in which they are engaged is of equal or even greater importance than the work in which Mr. Walsh has been so successful. In view of all the circumstances, therefore, it will not be possible for Mr. Walsh to visit Washington this year. It is scarcely necessary, however, to add that when normal conditions are restored we should be glad to again review your invitation carefully and sympathetically. In the meantime, may I thank you very heartily for the courtesy and thoughtfulness that prompted you to remember us in this connection and to extend the invitation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nFeb. 25, 1941\n\nEighth Annual National Folk Festival,\nWashington, D.C., May 1, 2 & 3,\nre- Representation from Canada\n\nI send herewith a letter (Feb. 20) addressed to the\nMinister by Miss Sarah Gertrude Knott, National Director of the\nEighth Annual National Folk Festival, Sponsored by Washington\nPost Folk Festival Association, Suite 101, Munsey Building,\n1329 E. Street, Northwest, Washington, D.C., together with the\nmaterial mentioned therein and received under separate cover.\nI quote briefly the request:\n\n\"This year we are inviting Canada, Mexico, South America\nand some of the Islands, to send guest groups. .........\"\n\n\"This year we heard through Frederick Koch, of the\nUniversity of North Carolina, who gives a course each summer\nin playwriting at Banff, or the work of Anthony Walsh at\nInkamoot. We know from what Mr. Koch has told us and from\nmaterial we have had which shows the splendid work of\nMr. Walsh, that he is doing a genuinely outstanding job\nthere. We are eager to have him bring a small group to the\nNational Folk Festival to represent Canada here. We know\nthat we shall have to have your approval to do this\".\n\n\"Will you please let us know if you would give us\nyour approval of the plan?\"\n\nThe correspondence is referred to the Department\nfor the necessary attention.\n\nEnclos.\n\nLr.\n\nPurpose & Aims of Assn.\nDr. McGill\nCopy of Washington Post.\nFor attention of your Branch.\n\nW.J.F. Pratt\nPrivate Secretary.\nFebruary 20, 1941\n\nMr. T. A. Crearer  \nMinister of Mines & Resources  \nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Crearer:\n\nWe are holding the Eighth Annual National Folk Festival in Washington May 1, 2 and 3... I am sending you under separate cover a program of last year's Festival and a Statement of Aims, from which you will see what we are trying to do.\n\nFrom the program you will see that twenty-seven states and the Territory of Hawaii were represented last year. This year we are inviting Canada, Mexico, South America and some of the Islands to send guest groups.\n\nWe feel very sure that the National Folk Festival in the last seven years has done much in bringing about better understanding, more tolerance and stronger national unity through an interchange of the folk traditions that express the inherent characteristics of us all, so this year, since there is such need for us to understand our neighbors to the north and south, as well as those in the other America, we have invited these groups.\n\nEach year for the last seven years we have opened our program with the Indian presentations from the United States. We have had on the programs during these years, the Kiowas from Oklahoma, the Mescalero Apaches, the Zunis, the Navajos, the Sioux, The Blackfeet and Cherokees.\n\nWe have had the cooperation and confidence of Mr. John Collier and many others in the Indian office here.\n\nThis year we heard through Frederick Koch, of the University of North Carolina, who gives a course each summer in playwriting at Banff, of the work of Anthony Walsh at Inkameep. We know from what Mr. Koch has told us and from material we have had which shows the splendid work of Mr. Walsh, that he is doing a genuinely outstanding job there. We are eager to have him bring a small group to the National Folk Festival to represent Canada here. We know that we shall have to have your approval to do this. When you have looked over the material which I am sending, will you please\n\nCONSTITUTION HALL, MAY 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 1941\nlet us know if you would give us your approval of the plan?\n\nThe National Folk Festival is not a commercial organization. It is a cooperative, cultural, educational one, as you will see from this letterhead. It would not be possible for us to have a budget large enough to pay the expenses, even of the groups who come from the widely separated communities of the United States. This has been done for the last seven years by civic and educational interests in the state or community from which the group comes. We have found that Chambers of Commerce, tourist associations, etc., are often interested because it calls attention to their particular community and shows that they have a part to play in the cultural folk life of the United States.\n\nI had a letter this morning from Mrs. Daisy C. Miller, Box 2, RR 1, Oliver, B.C. She is interested in cooperating with us in working out plans, but first we must await your approval.\n\nOf course, the Indian traditions are of great importance to Canada, as well as to the United States. Their traditions, of course, are most ancient and are most real. The Indian office here and the Indians themselves have felt that it is a good thing, as they take on the white man's civilization for them to recognize and appreciate the splendid racial background which they have. Their history and their background is, of course, told only through their traditions. We believe that many of the people of the United States understand the Indians better since they have met them as audiences in the National Folk Festival. They have felt the deep significance of the Indian tradition as they have never felt it before.\n\nWe think that Mr. Walsh is especially forward-looking in doing creative work based on the old Indian traditions. We have long believed that such a thing should be. In our Country we do not know of an instance comparable to what we think Mr. Walsh is doing at Inkameep, so we would be proud, indeed, to have him on our Festival.\n\nAll good wishes.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSARAH GERTRUDE KNOTT\nNational Director\n\ncc: Mrs. Daisy C.

Crerar, Minister of Mines and Resources, has been passed on to me for consideration and reply.\n\nI am sending forward, for your information, copy of a letter dated March 4, 1941, and addressed by me to Miss Sarah G. Knott, Director of the National Folk Festival. The subject matter of this letter, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nThere is little that I can add to the opinion expressed in my letter to Miss Knott. Under existing regulations it is difficult, indeed I might say almost impossible, to secure the funds necessary for excursions of any kind to the United States. We are all deeply interested in the work Mr. Walsh has undertaken and accomplished at the Inukseep School and very proud of the success of his pupils, particularly Sis-hu-lk. Under ordinary circumstances, therefore, it would be a pleasure and a privilege to permit this teacher to visit Washington. I am convinced, however, that in view of the decisions reached here from day to day, in the case of applications of citizens to visit the United States, it would be very unwise to grant permission to Mr. Walsh to attend this year's Folk Festival. As I intimated to Miss Knott, however, when conditions again become normal, there is no reason whatever why this request cannot be again sympathetically\n\nMiss Daisy C. Millar,\nBox 2, R.

(RG 10, Volume 6405, File 834-1, part 2)\nFolk Festival Will Reflect New Spirit of National Unity\n\nBy Sarah Gertrude Knott\nFounder and Director,\nNational Folk Festival\n\nIN these days of suspense abroad and anxiety at home it is easy to understand the upsurge of interest in all things American. This new nationalism, whether it finds an outlet in popular patriotic song or in the products of American dress designers, represents a return to the roots of our fathers taken for granted in times of peace but sought as a refuge when trouble comes. Then the veneer of sophistication wears thin, the superficial class barriers disappear and the foundation stones upon which our land was built stands revealed. We find that Americans under pressure from a totalitarian foe are strangely similar to Americans under pressure from civil strife, as in the 1860's, and from tyranny, as in 1776. And so, even while we prepare to defend ourselves against future threats, we bend our thoughts irresistibly drawn to the people and the customs of the past.\n\nThus the eighth annual National Folk Festival, opening May 1 at Constitution Hall, seems to come at an unusually opportune moment. The thousands of Washingtonians who have attended the festival during its three previous presentations here will, we hope, welcome its return.\n\nA People's Holiday\n\nThose unfamiliar with the festival idea, we feel sure, will enjoy this unique opportunity to hear and see authentic folk events and performances. May 1, 2 and 3, the varied racial groups who gather each year from many parts of the country for this people's holiday. Through the interchange of distinctive folk songs, dances, myths and music comes a better understanding of our greater tolerance, which should result in stronger national unity.\n\nThe songs and dances included on the programs are presented for the most part by rural folk who have been their guardians. But because no concerted effort was made until recently to preserve, the folk arts and traditions may die out with the gradual spread of movies and radio into rural areas. Where survival seemed unlikely, efforts for revival became necessary. So it is that the festival occasionally accepts the contributions of groups who have revived some rural folk expressions.\n\nFestival leaders realize the value that the American square dance, for example, can have for city dwellers. We need simple, wholesome recreation, and we keep our balance in these confused times, more, perhaps, than early colonists needed it to lighten the load of trail-blazing.\n\nUNTIL recent times we looked to Europe for our cultural and economic patterns. At last we are opening our eyes to the necessity of developing national relations in this hemisphere, to whom we are bound by ties stronger than mere geography. Since the beginning the National Folk Festival has included on its programs many of the traditions common to Canada, Mexico, South America, the islands and the United States. Each year the Territory of Hawaii was represented on the program. This year the festival organization is eager to have other neighboring folk groups join us.\n\nWe are being guided in many ways now by the successes and failures of nations involved in the European struggle. Hitler has made use of the traditional expressions of Germany through his youth program. Folk song, music and dance have played a part in the attempt to build up national and racial pride. Much as we may hate the use to which he has put them, we must admit he has shown the strength of folk expressions as the ties that bind.\n\nEsprit de Corps\n\nTotalitarian states have found the folk traditions of value in developing esprit de corps. And democratic nations like Czechoslovakia and Finland found joy in them, during peace as well as in wartime.\n\nFROM the vantage point of the mid-twentieth century we see many significances in the individual differences of our peoples which we could not have seen earlier. Time had to give us perspective. If the white man in early days had better understood the Indian's culture\u2014but that he could not see\u2014slipped him in the age-old ceremonials through which the Indian's soul speaks. If we had known then the potent soil of the Negro in bondage\u2014but that we could not until we heard his soul cry through his spirituals, which grew out of that burden. If we had been better acquainted with our Spanish-Americans, whose traditions have roots 400 years old in what is now United States soil\u2014and yet it took a world crisis to attract our attention to them. At last we are beginning to understand that folk traditions are not just \"relics of an outlived past.\" They are vital today.\n\nSince there is at present a general stirring of interest in American folklore, let us take advantage of the situation and make organized efforts to preserve our cultural heritage as we are trying to preserve our forests, lakes and wildlife. Scholarly work in collecting and recording is necessary for history and invaluable to leaders of folk groups, but it fails to pass on the vital spark which oral transmission gives.\n\nLiving History\n\nThere is more to the folk song than the tune of it, more to the folk dance than its form, more to the myth than the tale it tells. In our traditional expressions are recorded the life of early America and the growing, changing later America. They reflect the living history of our country, the struggles and joys of the people together establishing a Nation. Through them we glimpse the life of foreign lands from which our people came. Without them our social life will be less rich if we lose them. As they have served the past and are used in the present, so will the future depend on them. They should not be blown away with a changing civilization.\nSalonika\u2014Battleground Of Many Wars\n\nBy Carl C. Cranmer\nAssociated Press Staff Writer\n\nNew York, March 8\u2014With the German advance through Bulgaria to the Greek frontier growing, signs of British-Turkish preparedness for Balkan eventualities, the ancient Greek city of Salonika again may become the scene of decisive events.\n\nThis old city, founded in 315 B.C. and originally named Thessalonica after a sister of Alexander the Great, has been ruled by Greeks, Romans, Saracens, Normans, Emperors of Armenia, Venetians, and Turks, and was bequeathed for by Slavs, Bulgars and Germans.\n\nIt was from Salonika that the Allies launched their blow on Sept. 1915, which ended in the first break in the front of Germany's lines\u2014the capitulation of Bulgaria on Sept. 6.\n\nWhen the British and French expeditionary force landed there on Oct. 5, 1915, an army of 150,000 was assembled\u2014a tug boat a 50-mile line reaching from the Vardar river on its left to the Gulf of Thessalonica, on the opposite side of the Dardanelles Pass.\n\nOnce a border which worried the French and British then would be easy today, however. Their purpose in landing was to rush the Serbs. But by the time they had arrived in force the Serbs were beaten, and driven from the mainland to the little island of Corfu.\n\nAlthough most of Hitler's prepa-\n\nThe War in Review\nHighlights of the 78th Week\n\nA BIG QUESTION MARK stretched across Europe's sizzling Balkans last week as the world awaited Adolf Hitler's next move. Out of the swirl of events came many rumors, little fact.\n\nAcross Bulgaria streamed trainloads of German troops and \"blitz\" equipment moving south to positions along the Greek and Turkish frontiers. As Bulgaria's Parliament nodded, hailed the Axis pact, Britain brusquely broke off diplomatic relations with King Boris' government. Soviet Russia strongly rebuked Sofia for allowing Hitler to occupy its territory and thereby threatening \"extension of the war.\"\n\nThe Greek spotlight shone on Anthony Eden's visit to Athens. Britain's foreign minister, accompanied by Imperial Army Commander Dill, hustled over a conference table with Greece's leaders to work out joint Allied policy in the Balkan crisis. At conference's end both nations tersely proclaimed \"complete agreement on all points of the situation.\" Meantime, Greece hastily reinforced strategic points along the Struma River, gateway from Bulgaria to the vital Greek Aegean port of Salonika.\n\nTurkey sat precariously on the fence as Hitler sought to cut Ankara from its ties with Britain. To the Turkish capital flew five special German emissaries with an urgent message from the Fuhrer, offering German \"assistance\" to the Turks. Turkey's press looked coldly on the proposal. The Turkish navy, meanwhile, shut tight the Dardanelles to all ships except those with special permits and manned coastal batteries around the Straits.\n\nHard-pressed Yugoslavia, the last neutral Balkan nation, grimly watched war come to its doors. As Nazi troops wheeled through Bulgaria, Hitler called Regent Prince Paul of Berchtesgaden and \"invited\" Belgrade to join the Axis. Britain's diplomats were also busy in Yugoslavia, seeking to learn promptly when that country stood in the swiftly moving Balkan drama.\n\nIN THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN the R.A.F. and the Luftwaffe swapped blows across the Channel. The British sowed their heavy bombs on Cologne and the\nPAST PARTICIPANTS\n\nINDIAN MUSIC AND CEREMONIAL DANCES: the Tiguas of El Paso, Texas; Kiowas, Norman, Oklahoma; Cherokees and Creek, Tahlequah, Oklahoma; Cherokees, Sequoyah Indians, Tahlequah, Oklahoma; Cherokee, the Cherokee Reservation, Chickasaws, North Carolina; Sioux, Ft.

McGill\nDirector, Department of Mines & Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. McGill:\n\nI greatly appreciate your letter of March 4th. We so greatly appreciate your interest and are glad you think the work we are doing is of value.\n\nWe deeply regret, however, that you feel that an exception to the general rule cannot be made in the case of Mr. Walsh. Of course, we understand full well how it is to break a rule. As you say, there will be so many others who will feel that the rule ought to be broken for them. However, if there is ever justification for breaking a rule, we feel that this is one of them. Mr. Walsh has begun a plan in Canada that seems to me to be very far-reaching culturally. As important as are the immediate necessities which confront us all in our war-time activities, we absolutely believe that we cannot look just to the present. We must look to the future. If activities like the National Folk Festival, and like Mr. Walsh's plan, have to give way now to the immediate necessities, the chances are that somehow during the struggle which probably faces us we are likely to lose our spirit to carry on at this significant transition period between the old ways of life and the new in Canada and the United States.\n\nThen we do believe, as we said in our previous letter, that this gesture of goodwill between Canada and the United States is an extremely important one, since our Festival is held in the Nation's capital and since it has its roots in every state in the United States, the coming of this group from Canada to our country would have genuine significance.\n\nI do not know how it is in Canada, but I know that in the United States we are just coming to properly evaluate the Indian traditions which are, after all, the only history book which we can read to find out about the first Americans. In our country I know the Indian traditions are giving way to the white man's civilization, but they are so basic and fundamental, not only for us here in the United States, and you in Canada, but for people everywhere, that surely Mr. Walsh's idea of using these traditions in a creative way is one of the ways, at least, to carry them down into the future.\n\nCONSTITUTION HALL, MAY 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 1941\nfuture.\n\nI do not know of any such splendid plan in our country as Mr. Walsh has. We are so eager to take advantage of the work he has started there to give incentive to people in the United States to see the possibilities of what could be done here.\n\nI have just had a letter from Mrs. Daisy C. Miller, Secretary of the Okanagan Society for Research and Revival of Indian Arts and Crafts, which was formed last week. The coming of this group to meet our Indians in the United States would no doubt give interest to further work along this line.\n\nMrs. Millar and a number of people in the community of Oliver are interested and are cooperating with Mr. Walsh in his plan to get to us.\n\nWe believe this goodwill tour from Canada to the United States has so many significances that I cannot put them all on paper, but I know from the tone of your letters that you will understand.\n\nMrs. Millar has been in touch with Mr. Crearer. Won't you please get together and reconsider the idea of giving permission to Mr. Walsh and to us to have him with us?\n\nGreetings and all good wishes from all of us.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSARAH GERTRUDE KNOTT\nNational Director\nOttawa, March 14, 1941.\n\nDear Miss Knott:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of March 11, in which you ask us to review and reconsider your request that Mr. Anthony Walsh, teacher at the Inkameep Indian Day School, be permitted to take part in the National Folk Festival to be held at Washington May 1, 2 and 3.\n\nI may state that immediately following receipt of your letter of February 20, the desirability of having Mr. Walsh visit Washington was very carefully and very sympathetically investigated, in the light of existing events and regulations. The conclusion was reached at that time that in view of all the circumstances it would be almost impossible to grant this request.\n\nMiss Daisy C. Millar, Oliver, B.C., renewed this request in a letter to the Minister dated March 6, 1941, and again the matter was reviewed and considered. You can readily appreciate how difficult it is for the officials here and for myself to refuse this permission, for a number of reasons. First of all, we believe that the work in which Mr. Walsh is engaged should be encouraged in every way possible. Secondly, we believe the program arranged by your organization is comprehensive and of more than ordinary cultural and inspirational value. Then again, we are anxious at this time that everything\n\nMiss Sarah G. Knott,\nDirector, National Folk Festival,\nSuite 101, Munsey Building,\n1529 E Street Northwest,\nWashington, D.C., U.S.A.\nwithin our power should be done to bring about the closest possible co-operation between the people of Canada and the United States. In view of these reasons, the requests which first reached the Minister have been considered with unusual care and from every possible angle.\n\nWe are confronted with the fact, however, that for economic and other reasons, a number of requests from Canadian citizens who desire to visit the United States are refused daily. Each one of these applicants feels that from the standpoint of health or for some other reason he has a peculiar claim on the sympathy of the Government. Refusals, therefore, always result in a certain amount of dissatisfaction, and I am convinced that from the standpoint of Mr. Walsh's work and his future usefulness in the Indian service, it would be very undesirable for him with a group of his pupils to make the trip from Oliver, B.C., to Washington this year.\n\nIt has occurred to me that if it is the intention of your organization to organize regional festivals in the western States at any time, it might be comparatively easy to have Mr. Walsh visit the States of Oregon or Washington. I am, however, submitting this thought wholly by way of suggestion.\n\nMay I embrace this opportunity to express the hope that your festival of this year will be successful and satisfactory in every sense?\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nHarold W. McGill Esq.\nDepartment of Mines and Resources.\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI thank you for your \"Airmail\" letter which reached me on the 19th inst. I read with interest the copy of your letter to Miss Sarah G. Knott, Director of the National Folk Festival.\n\nI fully appreciate your remarks as regards the inadvisability of issuing permits for excursions to the United States under existing regulations, and concur that we must await more favourable conditions.\n\nDisappointment at the children not being able to demonstrate their wonderful talent under the leadership of their teacher Mr. Anthony Walsh, is lessened by the fact that you see no reason why, when conditions again become normal, this request cannot be again sympathetically reviewed, and my associates will be greatly heartened by this intimation.\n\nLooking forward to the time when I can write you again on this subject,\n\nI remain, Yours very truly,\n\n(Mrs.) Daisy C. Millar.\nApril 18th, 1941.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to apply for your permission to bring nine children from the Inkameep Reserve to Victoria for the opening of Thunderbird Park on May 24th.\n\nThey would be taken care of by Mr. Anthony Walsh, their teacher, and we will make suitable provision for their meals and sleeping accommodation, and look after their other expenses. They would all take their meals together, but the girls would sleep at Loretto Hall, which is operated by the nuns, and Mr. Walsh and the boys would have suitable accommodation elsewhere. I have not found just the right place yet, but it will not be difficult to do so.\n\nThe purpose of the visit is to show the Indian plays this group have evolved from tribal legends. The City would arrange for the plays to be given in Thunderbird Park. The party could either return on the night boat on Saturday, or at 2 p.m. on Sunday, which would be in time to catch the train in Vancouver.\n\nI would appreciate an answer as soon as convenient.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"L.

Copies of correspondence relating to the matter are attached for your information.\n\nThe expense involved in connection with the trip would be borne jointly by the Oliver Drama Society and the Provincial Government. As satisfactory arrangements will be made for the proper care and protection of the children while absent from the Reserve, and as it will only involve the closing of the school for two days, I would recommend favorable consideration of the proposal and would appreciate a reply by air mail.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

He states the expense of the trip will be paid by one-half being subscribed by the local Oliver Drama Society, the remainder to be cared for by Major Bullock-Webster.\n\nThe children would attend school on May 22nd which is an authorized holiday - Ascension Day - and would leave Penticton that evening at 10:00 p.m., arriving in Victoria on the afternoon of the 23rd, returning from Victoria on the afternoon boat on the 25th, arriving Penticton early on the 26th, and reaching home at Inkameep the same morning. No schooling will be lost except that possibly the children will be too tired from travel to attend school on the 26th.\n\nA copy of a letter received today from Mr.Walsh, also letter from Reverend Father Collins stating his views, are attached hereto.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nEnclosures:\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Alfred H.Barber)\nIndian Agent.\n\nMajor D.M.MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nThe Inkameep School,\nOliver, B.C.,\nApril 26, 1941.\n\nDear Mr. Barber:\n\nI am writing to you with regards to the possible visit of some of the Inkameep school children to Victoria for 24th of May celebrations.

I shall get down there on Monday, May 5th and will remain until the work is complete. The boys are quite willing to get on with the work.\n\nI have no objections to the Inkameep children going down to Victoria. I think it will be a fine thing for them. I should like proper supervision of them while down there, and I feel Mr. Walsh will do his part. We tried the same thing from the Kootenay Indian Res. School and the experiment was not successful because the Indian boys and girls were put up by the white families in Nelson. They were made far too much of and were a source of continual trouble on their return.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) P.J.

Bullock-Webster, Director of School and Community Drama, Victoria, in which permission is sought to bring nine children from the Inkameep school, in your Agency, to Victoria, for the opening of Thunderbird Park on May 24th. Such an arrangement would, of course, necessitate the closing of the school for a few days. Mr. Walsh would be in charge of the party from the time the children left Inkameep until their return.\n\nYou might discuss the matter with Mr. Walsh as soon as possible and secure from him information as to the length of the time the school would be closed and also the arrangements made for the care, comfort and protection of the children, during their absence, and payment of the full expenses involved.\n\nIt would also be appreciated if you would acquaint the local Missionary of the Church under whose auspices the school is being operated with the proposal and secure his reaction.\n\nOnce your report with recommendation is received here the matter will be referred to the Department, as any arrangement involving the closing of the school or absence from duty of the teacher in connection with such matters must be submitted for Departmental approval.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

M. Mackay  \nIndian Commissioner for B. C.  \nP. O. Box 70  \nVancouver, B. C.\n\nDear Major Mackay,\n\nMr. John Atwood, at present employed as a teacher in the Kamloops Indian Residential School, has asked His Excellency, Bishop Johnson, to recommend him for the position of teacher in the Inkameep Indian Day School. As Bishop Johnson is not acquainted with Mr. Atwood, he wired me asking me to act in his stead in this matter.\n\nIf it is in order, therefore, I am pleased to nominate and recommend Mr. Atwood for the position. I knew him some years ago when we were attending the same college in Nova Scotia, and only renewed acquaintance when he came here this fall. He is a Catholic, a man of good moral character, and is giving satisfaction in his present work. I would say his age is around forty. He is a married man.\n\nNo doubt Mr. Atwood will send his teaching qualifications to you when he makes his formal application.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nE. Q. Jennings  \nAux.

I have 7 years University at Dalhousie in Halifax; all but 6 of my subjects for a B.A., and have a degree of B.B. This is my first experience at teaching, but from all indications appear to be doing quite well.\n\nMy wife was teaching at North Bend, but has the misfortune to have her jaw broken by a dentist and will have to stop teaching. It is for that reason only that I have any desire to leave Kamloops, as, since she is now incapacitated, I wish to be with her to help.\n\nEnclosed Reference: Bishop Jennings, Kamloops.\n\nJ.

Rev. E.Q. Jennings, Auxiliary Bishop of Vancouver, nominating Mr. Atwood for the position.\n\nI would recommend that Mr. Atwood be appointed to this vacancy.\n\nD.M.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 2nd instant which reached me today, the Department approves the appointment of Mr. John Atwood as teacher of the Inkameep Indian Day School. Salary will be allowed him at the rate of $80.00 a teaching month, plus bonus. You should have him complete the usual forms when he begins duties.\n\nApparently Mr. Atwood is very anxious to learn our decision because I have a telegram from him this morning stating that it is imperative that he know at once what we have decided to do.\n\nR.A. Hogg,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nYour letter of January 5th advising of the approval of the appointment of Mr. John Atwood as teacher of the Inkameep Indian Day School reached this office on January 7th. On the same date Mr. Atwood wrote to me advising that as he had not received a reply to his wire to the Department regarding the position he had accepted an offer to teach in the white school at Hope. Mr. Atwood's services are therefore not available to the Department and his appointment to the Inkameep school should be cancelled.\n\nThis office endeavors to deal promptly with applications for positions in our schools but despite this and the fact that the Department does not delay in taking the necessary action, it usually takes a week to ten days to get a decision. In this particular case Mrs. Atwood called at the office on January 5th regarding the application of her husband for the Inkameep school and I assured her then that I had no doubt whatever but that Mr. Atwood would receive the appointment. It is just possible that other reasons influenced Mr. Atwood in his decision to accept the position at Hope.\n\nMiss Mary Wadel who formerly taught at the Inkameep school intimated a few days ago that she was interested in the appointment at Inkameep but at the time Mr. Atwood's application was before the Department and I was obliged to advise her accordingly. Miss Wadel is at present on Gambier Island and it will take a few days to get in touch with her, but in the meantime I should appreciate being advised by air mail if the Department will approve of her appointment to the Inkameep school if she secures the required nomination from the church concerned.\n\nD.

I am anxious that you should send forward a copy of this report to Major D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C., Box 70, Vancouver, B.C., if you have not already done so.\n\nI was particularly interested in your reference to the Inkameep Indian Day School. This was the first information I had that the teacher's residence at this school was in an unsatisfactory condition and that the teacher had experienced difficulty in keeping it comfortably heated. I am today communicating with the Indian Commissioner in respect to this matter. I should hasten to add, however, that a comfortable residence for the time being would not be likely to secure for the school a fully qualified teacher. As a matter of fact, a number of our Indian day schools, even in the better settled districts of Ontario, have remained closed during the year for the simple reason that we have not a sufficient number of teachers in Canada to keep all our schools open and in operation in this critical period. It is my hope, however, that we shall be able to take steps in the immediate future either to remodel the Inkameep School or to erect a new school building.\n\nI am sending forward herewith, for your\n\nMr. Albert Millar,\nPresident,\nOkanagan Society for the Revival of Indian Arts & Crafts,\nOlive r, B. C.\nOttawa, April 13, 1944.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP. O. Box 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nRe: Inkameep Indian Day School\n\nThe Minister is in receipt of a report from Mr. Albert Millar, President of the Okanagan Society for the Revival of Indian Arts and Crafts, which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"Since Mr. Walsh resigned from the Inkameep Indian Day School at the end of 1942, the school has remained closed except for a very short period. In September, 1943, a teacher was appointed in place of Mr. Walsh, but he resigned shortly afterwards. He gave, as his reason for leaving, the unusually small and uncomfortable living quarters, lack of water facilities and fuel, means for reasonable lighting and the urgent need for an adequate heater for both school and living quarters. Being familiar with these quarters, I must admit it is difficult to understand how the Indian Affairs Branch can expect a qualified teacher, who has perforce to spend so much of his time away on a reserve, to live in such very primitive conditions as those existing at Inkameep.\n\n\"The parents are worried about lack of educational facilities for their children, and they do not wish their youngsters to be sent away to residential schools. Apart from the fact that the children have lost over 18 months' education, we should remember these abnormal times provide as many distractions for young Indians as for young whites. There is a pressing need for a fully qualified teacher, sympathetic towards Indians and with a knowledge of their traditions and cultural background, who is willing to provide scope for the development of their latent talent for native art\".\n\nIt would be very much appreciated if we could\nhave a report on conditions at the Inkameep School. This is the first intimation I have received that the living quarters were unsatisfactory and that difficulty had been experienced in keeping the building comfortably heated. When submitting a report, would it be possible to secure an estimate of the cost of remodelling the present building together with any repairs that may be necessary to the school itself. If, in your judgment, a new school should be built at Inkameep, would you in your report indicate the type of school, dimensions, living accommodation for the teacher, approximate cost, etc.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMarch 29/44\n\nMr. D.W. MacKay  \nIndian Commissioner B.C.  \nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. MacKay:\n\nI would nominate Mr. Benjamin C.

He also secured a first-class in the Honours School of Natural Science, specializing in Chemistry and Radioactivity.\n\nI am hopeful that these academic achievements will be blended felicitously with the ability to impart a knowledge of the practical arts so necessary in our day schools.\n\nWith kindest personal regards,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Nelson\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nYour File 164-11-1\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of March 29th, approving the temporary appointment of Mr. Benjamin C.

Widdowson as teacher of this school, effective April 17, 1944, at a salary of $90 a teaching month. I attach T.D. 1 form, cost-of-living bonus form and copy of letter of appointment. Staff questionnaire will reach you shortly.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\nA. H. Barber, Esq., Indian Agent, Vernon, B.C.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your report of the 17th instant with reference to the resignation of Mr. P.J. Kiernan as teacher of the Inkameep Indian Day School and to enclose herewith copy of his resignation which has been forwarded to the Department from which it will be noted that he closed the school on the 11th instant.\n\nIt will be noted from his letter that the reasons given for his resignation were lack of fuel and dissatisfaction with living conditions. He complained that the furnishings of the school left much to be desired, particularly in regard to the bed, there being no pillow, two very thin grey blankets and a mattress that has rotted, apparently having been used by the Indians when this school was not occupied. Also, that the cook-stove needs some repair as it lets the ashes fall out on the floor creating a fire hazard and that the sill of the school door has become so worn that the snow blows through the gap.\n\nThese complaints are substantiated by your report above referred to and it is not understood why the supply of fuel at this school should have become depleted to the extent that when the teacher returned from his leave there was not more than twelve hours supply inside the school and nothing but a few large knots outside. It should be realized that in the Interior where wood is depended on for fuel that the opening of the fall term at this school should see one full school year's supply of wood on hand at the very least in order that it may be seasoning fit for use and it is astonishing that the condition complained of and admitted should have been allowed to develop. If the Baptiste family showed signs of delay in the supply, the services of another Indian family should have been sought or, failing this, the white dealer in the locality approached in the matter.\n\nIt is noted that you requisitioned the Department for mattresses, etc., for this school in October, but you should be aware that such requisitions should be passed through this office and it is probably for this reason that the matter has not been dealt with by the Department. You should make out a complete requisition and re-submit this with local quotations to me in duplicate.\n\n(over)\nIn respect to the proposed enlargement of this school, I am of the opinion that as this will be one of the first schools that will be replaced when the building program re-opens that no alterations should be made unless it becomes much more evident than it is at present that this is necessary. If any enlargement was required, I would consider that the classroom itself is much more in need of alteration than the living quarters which, while admittedly are small, could be much more comfortable and attractive than they appear to be at present. There is, no doubt, a necessity for reflooring all the rooms in this building and you should secure the cost of having this work done and adjoining a small porch with door to the classroom door in order to prevent the wind blowing directly on the pupils when the door is opened in the winter. Meanwhile, it would appear to me that renewal of the door sill would remove a great deal of the condition complained of by Mr. Kiernan. In regard to the cook-stove, I do not understand why the purchase of this was left to Mr. Walsh. It is evident that his choice was far from satisfactory and that before long a more adequate cook-stove will be required. The matter of repainting the interior of this building is one on which you should report, submitting estimates of the cost of material and labour. It is presumed that you will endeavour to trace the two Coleman lamps and have them repaired and put into working condition.\n\nRegarding the water supply for this building, if it is not found possible to develop any system immediately by way of digging a well or piping the water from the spring mentioned, it may be possible to install a small wood \"V\" or metal flume from the spring. I understand that there is also another spring a short distance north-east of the school on the hillside which may be worth developing and possibly it could be brought into use at a low cost.\n\nUnless Bishop Johnson has a nominee for the position as teacher at this school, there is no one in sight at the present time, teachers being at a premium, and for this reason we have had to put up with some very inferior individuals for these positions, but this should not deter you from proceeding to investigate and deal with the requirements of this school in respect to furnishings, equipment, repairs, alterations and water supply, bearing in mind that extensive alterations are not indicated in view of the temporary nature of the structure. This would also apply to having on hand an adequate supply of wood seasoning for the time it will be required which we hope will be in the near future.\n\n(over)\nIn respect to locating the school at some other point, it would be necessary for you to make a survey of the number of children of school age and pre-school age at the village at Osoyoos Lake, the present location of the school and the village around the Church in order that the largest number of children will have the least distance to travel.\n\nWhen a new teacher takes over this or any other of your schools, please have an inventory made of all the equipment, school books and material and have the teacher sign the same, checking it over with him when he leaves the school or commences the summer holidays if there is any likelihood of his not returning. In this manner, you will not only have a check on Departmental property but will also be kept fully informed as to the amount and condition of the furnishings and thus prevent complaints and discussions such as we have had in recent weeks in this connection.\n\nKT\n\nD. W. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOkanagan Indian Agency,\nVernon, B.C.,\nJanuary 17, 1941.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter No.215-10-9177 of December 22nd ultimo and 215-10-95 of the 8th instant together with copies of correspondence with Mr. Albert Killar, Oliver, in respect to conditions at Inkameep Indian Day School, I now advise that I visited Inkameep Day School on January 12th instant arriving about two p.m. with the intention of interviewing Mr. Kiernan in regard to conditions at the school and to go over the contents and furnishings of the school with him. I found three boys playing outside the school who informed me that the teacher had gone to town the previous evening and had not returned. I entered the school with a pass key and found the school and quarters in a very untidy state. Towels from the hooks on the walls were on the floor, books, pencils, etc., under desk, a pile of rubbish and debris from the wood behind the heater and I would say the place had not been swept for several days. The living quarters were little better. There was not more than twelve hours' supply of fuel inside the building and nothing but a few large knots outside.\n\nI went over to see the Chief, Narcisse Baptiste, and saw his son Charlie who confirmed the fact that the teacher had not returned from town the previous night. I returned to the school and waited for the Chief who was driving cattle up from the lower place. When he was finished feeding he came over and I spoke to him regarding his failure to have the wood delivered to the school as he was asked to do and usually does each year, although at his leisure. He stated that the boys had all been too busy with the cattle but that Charlie had been bringing in a few blocks until they could get the supply cut. I told him that this was not good enough. The teacher was there to teach their children and they were paid to supply the wood and if they did not they could not expect a teacher to stay or to rustle his own wood. He replied, \"perhaps we have been too busy and were going to get the wood as soon as we could at times but the teacher told me he was not coming back after Christmas\". I told him to get four cords cut and delivered at the school at once and stated he would get the boys at it the following day.\n\nI suspected from the attitude of the Chief and his son Charlie that there was something more behind the situation than I had gathered.\n\nOn returning to Oliver, I made enquiries for Mr. Kiernan, thinking he might be sick or something, but failed to locate him, but ascertained that he had stayed at the hotel the previous night and had stated he would be in again that night. I left a message for him to telephone me at Penticton as soon as he came in.\n\nThe following afternoon, Thursday, he telephoned me at.......\nat Penticton and informed me that he was leaving and was just going out to the school to get his belongings and I arranged to see him in Penticton the following day at which time he stated he could not possibly return to the school and was leaving for Vancouver that evening, and regretted not having given a month's notice.\n\nI suggested that he call at your office in Vancouver and he agreed to do so. He also stated that he had tried to speak to the Chief in Oliver that day and the Chief had walked away from him after saying the boys were cutting wood today. On my asking if he had had any trouble of any kind, he replied \"No, but perhaps the children had gone home and told their parents something I may have said which they did not like\" and said he had told them that he was running the school and not their grandmother (the Chief's wife). This may have had something to do with his failure to get any co-operation from the Indians.\n\nIn the evening I wired you as follows:\n\n\"Teacher at Inkameep School resigns and left for Vancouver apparently difficulty over fuel and general conditions etc. I found school closed on thirteenth and he informed me today could not continue and will call at your office. Will forward my report as soon as possible.\"\n\nI would state before dealing with conditions at the school that Mr. Kiernan, whilst I believe he may be a very good teacher, was, in my opinion, totally out of his element at this school and did not appear to make any effort to make himself as comfortable as possible under the circumstances and I would say was not the type to care for himself in a way that it was necessary for a bachelor in such a situation. I noticed that there were no blankets on the bed, only a thin rug of some kind, and I asked him if this was all the bedding he had. He replied it was and that he used his overcoat and dressing gown and a piece of buckskin he found to help out as he did not think he should have to supply his own bedding.\n\nI have to advise that requisition was made for a new mattress, two blankets, floor rug and an easy chair and same was forwarded to the Department from this office on October 4, 1943, and October 15 and no word has been received from the Department to date.\n\nInkameep Day School was built by the Department in 1924 at a cost of $947.00, size 30'x16', this includes the class-room, approximately 20'x16', and teacher's quarters\u2014kitchen 8'x9' and bedroom 8'x9'. There are three doors in the kitchen, one opening directly outside, one into the bed-room and the other into the class-room, with one window. The kitchen is furnished with a very small cook-stove with a fire-box that will hold one small stick of wood. It is actually five inches wide and totally inadequate. This stove was requisitioned for\nand purchased by Mr. Walsh in 1940. There is an old kitchen cabinet of a sort badly in need of a coat of paint; one very old and dirty wash hand stand, which should be thrown out; one old table, size about 30\"x20\"; one set of six shelves, home made. The floor is covered by an old congoelum rug purchased in 1941, but worn out. There is one old wooden armchair. The bed-room is furnished with an old, single, iron bed, a very dirty mattress, a very old dresser with broken mirror, and a congoelum rug in fair shape on the floor. Both the kitchen and bed-room are very cramped, there not being space in the bed-room for a chair, whilst there is not room for two chairs in the kitchen, and whilst Mr. Walsh kept the quarters very neat, although very cramped, he appeared to be quite satisfied. These quarters were very dirty when I called on Mr. Kiernan and he did not appear to have made any effort to improve them in any way. However, the condition of the floor must be overlooked in the winter time as there is no porch at either the classroom or kitchen entrance and one steps directly out of the snow into the room, carrying snow or mud.\n\nThe lighting is furnished by a two-burner coal-oil lamp. However, there are two Coleman lamps at the school which I have not seen, but have just recently been informed that Mr. Walsh put them in the attic (?) as he could not keep them in mantles which broke every time the door opened.\n\nThe water supply is very bad, being carried over in pails from the well at the Chief's house two hundred and fifty to three hundred yards away, or from a spring up the hill almost the same distance.\n\nAs these quarters are at the present there is no comfort whatever, but they could be improved a great deal by the throwing out and replacing of most of the furniture now there and most certainly a new mattress will have to be supplied. As to bedding, I am of the opinion that the teacher should furnish this and feel that most would prefer to do so. However, this may also be necessary.\n\nThe partition (wallboard) between the kitchen and bedroom should be removed, thereby making a fair sized kitchen and an addition built on for a decent sized bed-room and a porch screened with wire for the storing of fuel in the winter and to sit on in the summer. Some cupboards for storage could also be built on the veranda facing twelve feet on to the length of the school would provide the additional space. A porch and cloakroom should also be built at the school entrance. At the present snow and mud are carried into the classroom. Also when the door opens the full effect of the whole outside enters the building.\n\nThe floor of the classroom is badly worn and very thin and should be renewed. It is impossible to keep it clean and sanitary in its present condition with the wide cracks and the wide space around and under the door requires sacking be shoved against it to keep out the draught.\n\nTo sum up the whole situation, it must be admitted that the living quarters are very small and cramped, the furnishings.......\nfurnishings are old and there is no upholstered easy chair for the teacher's use and a new mattress is required for the bed. Some teachers would be able to make the place far more cosy and comfortable than others and would requisition for such things as paint, a quart of which used on the furniture would make a great difference.\n\nThe water supply is the greatest inconvenience and it does not seem possible to get the Indians to co-operate in digging a well. In fact they hire white men to dig their own. In my opinion it may be difficult to locate water at the school site and the cost of digging and cribbing a well may be high, say $3.50 per foot. In view of this I believe it would be far better to move this school to a new position approximately one-half mile north where water could be obtained from Inkameep Creek by pipe direct to the school. At the same time the school should be enlarged to provide better quarters, a new floor laid and a porch built.\n\nI would refer you to Mr. Coleman's letter of July 21, 1936 addressed to the Assistant Indian Commissioner, which covers the water situation at the school very fully. However, in my opinion I believe it would be better to move the school closer to Inkameep Creek.\n\nWith reference to your enquiry of 18th March, 1941, and November 4, 1943, re furnishings, etc. at this Agency's day schools, I have to advise that this return was made to you on November 16, 1943.\n\n(Alfred H. Barber)\nIndian Agent.\nVernon, B.C., Sept. 12th, 1917.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter No. 115-16584 of the 2nd instant and No. 115-16587 of August 17th and attached letter received by you from Mr. and Mrs. Forbes regarding the non-attendance of several children at Inukseep Reserve to Kootenay Indian Residential School.\n\nI have been away from the Agency on statutory leave of absence which accounts for the delay in my acknowledgment.\n\nI will be visiting Inukseep Reserve during the coming week and will report on the reasons for the non-attendance of the ladies' children at Boarding School. Although I am not of the opinion that the reason is that the Indians on the Reserve have the impression that there has been no opportunity of a teacher for the day school since the petition of Mr. Welsh that none will be held and the children will have to go to the residential school.\n\nMr. Welsh did not say so, but I believe that the existence of these children at Osoyoos was the reason of his resignation. However, if the time they went I would not sign the applications for admission until I had interviewed them and obtained their reasons for their desire that the children go to Osoyoos. I then thought some wrote in the application did not like me when visited their children \"to learn something and not to send so much time at play and amusements\".\n\nIf there is a teacher available for the Inukseep Day School I am not in favour of these children being returned to Osoyoos and will apply to the Department for their transfer elsewhere. However, as there is no applicant at present I will see the parents regarding their request.\n\nRegarding Emily Jack, she is with her parents who have been living at Brandon, Ont., since early in May or end of April, I am informed, are attending school there.\n\nThe question of children of Joseph Shalhoun attended Creston Public School and I believe they are still there although they had three days to travel to Osoyoos, crossing the Shalhoun River on foot. Their mother, Mrs. Shalhoun today bought a piece of land across the River and, I understand, the children have kept at home for a day and, as stated, have attended the same day school.\n\nI will advise further in this regard after my visit to Inukseep Reserve.\n\n[Signature]\n\n(A. Alfred H. Barber)\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nReplying to your letter of the 13th instant (file 41203-1) with reference to the report of the Okanagan Society for the Revival of Indian Arts and Crafts, I would advise that this is practically a branch of the similar organization in Victoria, B.C., until recently under the Presidency of Miss Ravenhill. Both of these came into being under the inspiration of Mr. Walsh, former teacher of the school at Inkameep.\n\nAs you are aware, Mr. Walsh had no professional qualifications and no great ability as a teacher but was an outstanding publicist and towards the end of his stay with us was putting on a one man platform show, including Indian dances, songs and narratives that had quite an appeal with the local uninformed intelligentsia. Eventually the increasingly unbalanced curriculum at the Indian school overtook him and some of the parents transferred their children to Cranbrook Indian Residential School, complaining that they were receiving no worthwhile education under Mr. Walsh, shortly after which he resigned to take a position in the Legion Auxiliary Services at Alberni, where he continues to interest himself in our affairs. This is probably the background of Mr. Millar's present interest in the matter. Mr. Barber's letter of September 11, 1943, will show why some of the children were transferred to Residential School.\n\nThe writer was Indian Agent for this Agency from 1930 to 1939 and is familiar with the situation and the building. The building is a simple frame 20' x 30' structure that was erected during the incumbency of Mr. Indian Agent Ball about 1922, at a cost of about $1,000.00 which it is understood was borne by the Band. The building was improved about 1932 by shingling the exterior to keep out the wind, and a garage-wood shed put up for the convenience of the teacher, this being later converted into a \"studio\" by Mr. Walsh.\n\n(over)\nAttached is a plan of the school on which has been noted the improvements suggested by Mr. Barber after the school has been moved to another location. While admittedly the living quarters are cramped and the building was listed for early replacement at the time new construction was ended by the war, all teachers previous to Mr. Kiernan, who took over in September 1943 and resigned during the Christmas recess, managed to make themselves very comfortable indeed. I would also point out that none of the teachers at this school had professional qualifications, apart from Mr. Kiernan who was unsatisfactory, and yet we were paying them a salary of $90.00 a month, with the small quarters complained of and fuel, at a time the locality covered by Mr. Millar's organization were paying teachers salaries somewhere in the neighbourhood of fifty dollars, without quarters. In addition to this, we were paying $10.00 a month for janitor work. No complaints were received as to conditions until Mr. Kiernan resigned and he made none to the writer when he visited the school in October 1943.\n\nThe outstanding problem at this school has been lack of water supply. A study of this problem was made by the writer in 1936 but shortly after this plans were made to induce several of the Chiefs grandchildren who were married with fair sized families to move from his house near the school and establish themselves in their own homes about a mile north of the school, when it was contemplated the school would be moved to this new community center. This, however, was complicated by a fairly large group being in residence about a mile and a half south of the school and the fact that the proposed dispersal was slow in getting started. A careful survey of school age and pre-school age children and their location is indicated before any considerable expense is incurred in moving or remodelling the present school or building a new one. Meanwhile, some essential work could be undertaken such as renewal of the floor and addition of a porch to the class room entrance.\n\nIt is evident that almost all of the furnishings are now in need of replacement. The Department stated in their letter of April 3, 1944, (file 164-11-8) in this connection that it was no longer supplying mattresses or blankets to these schools. It is possible for teachers to provide themselves with blankets, but it is considered that taking in a mattress to many of these isolated schools presents a problem that few candidates for employment would undertake during these times when competition of the white schools for these teachers is making it difficult to even hold those we have. It is felt that the Department might reconsider the decision in respect to mattresses.\nThe newly appointed teacher, Mr. Widdowson, is a married man with one child and without professional standing or previous experience. Whether he will be retained depends on his success during the balance of the term. If the school is to be moved or replaced, extensive repairs should not be undertaken until this is done. If it is to remain in temporary use in its present location, the porch and flooring could be attended to during the summer vacation and perhaps the addition of an extra room considered at that time. A rough estimate of the cost of these including labour would be:\n\n- Floor ........................................ $70.00\n- Porch ........................................ $80.00\n- Addition ...................................... $300.00\n\nIn addition to this I would recommend supply of the following furnishings immediately at an approximate cost of $250.00:\n\n- 1 Kitchen table\n- 3 Chairs\n- 1 Easy chair\n- 1 Cook stove\n- 16 yds. Linoleum\n- 1 Kitchen cabinet\n- 1 Single mattress\n- 1 Bureau\n- 1 Dresser\n- Necessary pans and kitchen equipment.\n\nFor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nKT\nEncls.\nVancouver, B.C.

MacKay,\nCommissioner for B.C.\nOkanagan Society for the Revival of Indian Arts and Crafts\n\nOLIVER, B.C.\n\nApril 24th, 1944.\n\nMajor D. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay,\n\nThank you for your letter of the 17th inst., advising this Society a teacher had been appointed to Inkameep. When in town last week, one of the Indian Mothers came up to me and told me a new teacher had arrived and they all liked him very much.\n\nYesterday, I went with some Members of this Society to visit the school, where we met Mr. Widdowson, his wife and young son 10 years old.\n\nI assure you that Members of this Society and Indians on the Reserve are delighted with this appointment and we trust your Dept. will see its way clear to improve the living quarters and water supply at the School. Without wishing to intrude and with the earnest desire to be of assistance, I offer the following suggestions:\n\nWATER SUPPLY. The well mentioned in former correspondence is no longer used by the Indians for domestic purposes. I was told by the Indians they do not consider it fit to use. The nearest good water is from a spring situated about 2,000 feet from the school. The approach is up a fairly steep ravine and it takes about fifteen minutes to fetch a bucket of water from this source.\n\nI enquired of the Indians as to whether there was a possibility that this source of water would dry up, and was told that as long as the \"nkameep Indians can remember, this source has never been known to run dry.\n\nI suggest that a one inch pipeline be laid from the spring to the school. This would furnish an adequate supply for:\n\na. For the schoolchildren as washing and drinking water.\nb. Domestic water supply for the teacher.\nc. Irrigation water for the school and teacher's garden.\n\nIf water, even in small volume were available for the cultivation of a vegetable garden, which apart from its...\nobvious utility, would make it possible to include in the school curriculum lessons in practical gardening. For these Indian children this would be a very important subject and would interest their parents as well.\n\nTeacher's quarters.\n\nI further suggest the possibility of re-conditioning the present schoolroom to serve as a kitchen-living room for the teacher and to build on an entirely new school-room to accommodate some 20 pupils.\n\nIf this addition were made so as to utilize the existing blank wall of the building, it would save expense.\n\nIn that case, instead of putting a new floor in the present schoolroom, I suggest cementing down a fairly good quality linoleum; not only would this be more hygienic and easy to keep clean, but it would be the least expensive in the long run.\n\nDo you not consider that sufficient timber could be cut on the reserve to furnish the lumber for this addition to the school and to defray the expense in connection with the building and water-pipeline?\n\nI feel sure the Indians could be prevailed upon to co-operate, especially as they are so very keen on having and keeping a Teacher in residence.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPresident.\n\nCopy to R.A. Hoey Esq.\nCopy to A. Barber Esq.\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nI thank you for your letter of the 13th inst., enclosing the last Branch Report and other circulars, as sent out to the Indian Agents.\n\nRegarding the third par. of your letter; I agree that even quite modern accommodation at Inkameep would not necessarily ensure the appointment of a fully qualified teacher. At the same time a more suitable dwelling and water supply would facilitate the retention of a teacher, (even though he might be a man not specially trained for that particular type of instruction) who, if appointed, could certainly do a good deal towards instructing and guiding the young folk at Inkameep.\n\nAs you are not familiar with prevailing conditions, I do not think I can do better than to give you a copy of a letter I wrote on this subject to Commissioner McKey at Vancouver, on the 14th December last, and his reply:\n\n\"When I had the pleasure of speaking with you in September I was impressed by the keen interest you take in our Inkameep Indians. Mentioning this fact to Members of the Council, it was decided I should communicate with you in the following matter.\n\nWhilst the Council of this Society wishes to express its gratification at the appointment of Mrs. Klaaren to the position of teacher at Inkameep Indian Day School, it feels the accommodation provided for the teacher leaves much to be desired. To say that it is primitive is to put it mildly, most of the ranchers in this district have far superior accommodation for their casual labour.\n\nIn case you are not acquainted with the facts, I would point out that the teacher's quarters consist of two - so called rooms - a bedroom approximately $8'6\" \\times 6'$ and a kitchen approx. $8'6\" \\times 8'$. In the latter there are three doors and a window. In the bedroom there is a bed with a worn-out and not very clean mattress, one makeshift table. There is no room for any other article of furniture.\n\nThe kitchen has a cookstove, a rickety table and three rough wooden shelves. One dilapidated wooden chair serves for both schoolroom and teacher's quarters. The floors are rough and have no covering and the only means for artificial lighting for both schoolroom and teacher's quarters is a small, old-fashioned single wick coal-oil lamp. The bedroom is unheated. The only heater available for heating the schoolroom and teacher's quarters is of the smallest and cheapest type that requires constant attention. For this reason it is impossible to maintain a steady temperature either in the schoolroom or teacher's quarters. The schoolroom door opens directly on to the range, consequently in zero weather the room becomes intolerably cold and I have seen snow drift right into the classroom. The same remarks apply to the teacher's kitchen.\n\nA new floor is badly needed in the schoolroom, the present floor is not only very rough, but there are wide cracks which are full of accumulated dirt; this is definitely not hygienic.\"\n\"The most important thing in any public institution is the water supply. In the case of this Iroquois School, the source of supply is from an old hand-dug well situated some considerable distance from the school. This well has not a pump and it is open at the top; therefore it is in no way protected from dust and dirt; moreover, since the Indians also use this well to meet their domestic requirements and the water is drawn up by means of a bucket, the condition of this water supply can be left to the imagination.\n\nI feel sure you will agree with the Council's suggestion that a comfortable living room be added to the teacher's quarters. It would not cost much to add another room and to furnish it with proper table, easy chairs, etc., and to furnish floor covering and a proper modern lamp. At the same time this is done, the schoolroom could be thoroughly reconditioned.\n\nIt must be remembered how isolated the Iroquois School is, and that the seven miles of road, or rather dirt track into Oliver, is certainly a problem, because, during the fall and winter months, it becomes a quagmire and is closed to traffic. When a teacher has to go to Oliver he has to walk. This is a further reason for asking that he be provided with some of those comforts every human being is entitled to.\n\nThe present living quarters tend to make a man feel, not only depressed, but what is worse - degraded.\n\nThe work this school has turned out has caused favourable comment in Canada, the U.S.A., and in Europe, probably more so than any other school of its kind in R.C. For this reason we would like to see the pupils and the teacher of the Iroquois Indian Day School encouraged to give of their best.\"\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely\n\nSigned, Albert Miller, Pres.\"\n\nTo this letter, I received the following reply dated the 22nd, December, 1943.\n\nDear Mr. Miller,\n\n\"Acknowledging your letter of the 14th, i.e., re conditions at Osoyoos Indian Day School, I would advise you that I have asked Mr. Barber for a report on the questions raised by you.\n\nMeanwhile, it would appear that there has been considerable neglect of this school in recent years by the teachers as, while space will not permit of more than the most simple furnishings, it was always considered reasonably comfortable and there have been no previous complaints. The two living rooms were covered with linoleum very shortly before Mr. Walsh took over, but for some reason he hasn't fit, apparently, new ones on the back boards. The table and chair may be somewhat rickety in respect to legs, but they were substantial and there were, at least, three chairs. It should impose no hardship on the teacher to reach into the classroom for a chair when necessary. With the publicity this school receives for its handicrafts it is surprising the teacher couldn't have provided himself with something better than three rough shelves. The former Agent gave the School a small set of book shelves from his own furnishings. There were two Coleman gasoline lamps in the school as well as a coal oil lamp for night use. If the floor is now dirty with dirt embedded in the cracks, it would appear to be a reflection on existing housekeeping; particularly as the teacher is away on business for janitor service for the classroom for which he may employ Indians or do the work himself. In respect to the stove, this has previously been found adequate by the teachers, one teacher keeping the windows permanently open for about a foot at the...\"\nbottom, covering the opening with cotton to prevent drafts.\n\nMr. Kiernan was given very full details of conditions at this school before he accepted the appointment and that it was situated some seven miles from Oliver. I understand that the Indians have been extremely cooperative in giving the teachers lifts to and from town. Our officials and others have gone in and out of this Reserve at all times and seasons for years and have found no great difficulty due to mud except for a few days in the spring and then only at one spot.\n\nMr. Kiernan was fully advised regarding the domestic water situation and that the customary source of supply was a short distance behind the school. When Mr. Inspector Coleman visited this school in October last he asked both Mr. Kiernan and the Agent to explore the possibilities of having a local man dig a well at the school if Indians could not be found for the work. If the Indians of this Reserve need this Branch to defray the cost of educating their children and find teachers at a time when they are very scarce I am sure you will agree that they themselves should be prepared to give some co-operation in such matters as this. We have schools vacant elsewhere with more commodious quarters, or where the school is close enough to a town to make teacher's quarters unnecessary, to which Mr. Kiernan could be transferred and Osayoos School closed until such time as building material and funds are available. Despite the favourable comments from outside, the fact remains that some of the parents were sending their children to Residential School on the grounds that this local school was not providing the children with the education they expected of it. In the event of its being closed the remaining children would also be transferred. Perhaps it would help here that provision has been made in the post-war program of worthwhile works for a new school with teacher's quarters to replace the existing accommodation.\n\nYour letter does not disclose what representations Mr. Kiernan may have made to the Indian Agent in respect of these problems. Certainly none were made to the Inspector of Agencies other than a discussion of water supply, which originated with the Inspector. However, on hearing from the Indian Agent I will write you again. Yours faithfully,\n\nsigned, D.M. MacKay, Indian Comm.\"\n\nTo this letter I replied as follows:\n\nJanuary 3rd, 1944.\n\nDear Mr. MacKay,\n\n\"Replying to your letter of the 22nd December, I am pleased to note you have asked Mr. Barber to report on the conditions of the Osayoos Indian Day School, as raised by this Society.\n\nFor fear of prejudicing even that poor case our Indians appear to be entitled to, I will refrain from commenting on the remarks contained in the fourth paragraph of your letter pointing out other condition under which the Inkameep teacher might operate and in which event the Osayoos School could be closed,.... and in the event of its being closed the children would be transferred to Residential Schools. All I would say is that this is hardly the answer this Society expected from the Indian Commissioner for B.C. in charge of our Indian wards of the Canadian Government.\"\nIs it not a fact that the Allies, including this Canada of ours, are fighting to uphold among other things, justice and equitable treatment to all persons and minorities, and it is the individual and minorities that go to make up Canada. The responsibility for the future good conduct and well-being of the citizen is, to a large extent dependent on the attitude of those placed in authority over him.\n\nSo one should ask oneself, how should I feel being expected to give good service as a teacher in an outlying district in circumstances such as those existing at the Inkomeep Indian Day School? Then I would ask myself - How could I like my children to be educated in surroundings and under conditions such as prevail at Inkomeep? Could I conscientiously answer that I would be satisfied especially being aware of the fact that neither the teacher or the individual child is in a position to alter the situation.\n\nThis, I believe is the test each individual in authority should put to himself when meting out something to those dependant on his sense of justice and equity.\n\nOn one point, I would make myself clear. If the teacher is expected to clean the schoolroom floor, I might mention that I have never seen it so well scrubbed or the schoolroom so tidy. But even those in authority cannot expect a teacher to take a chisel and rake out the accumulated dirt of years from cracks of nearly 1/4\" separating each board. And supposing he did so, with what would he refill the cracks?\n\nRegarding the Indians doing something for themselves; In the first place, as wards of the Government they are not expected to do things for themselves, and yet, I seem to think it was the late Indian Chief who, at his own expense built the Inkomeep Indian Day School as it now stands, because he did not wish the Indian wards to grow up illiterate. Since that time, some twelve years ago considerable progress towards more ample and more hygienic schoolrooms has been witnessed elsewhere, except at Indian Schools, especially the Indian Day School at Inkomeep where a few little native children have shown to the world the wonderful latent art and cultural background waiting to be developed so as to contribute something worthwhile to Canada and yet there seems the desire to throttle this inherent beauty through sheer neglect.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSigned, Albert Miller, President.\n\nI might mention that I received no further communication on this subject from Major D.M. MacKay.\n\nFor your further information I enclose copy of letter I am mailing to the Commission today, from which you will note the suggestions I make for meeting the immediate requirements of the School. In order to save time, I am sending a copy of this letter to both Major D.M. MacKay and the Indian Agent, Mr. A. Barber at Vernon.\n\nBy the way, I did not notice any of your admirable little booklets \"The Beaver\" at the School, were some sent there, I am sure they would prove interesting and instructive to the pupils.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nAlbert Miller,\nPresident.\n\nP.S. A copy of the Annual Report to which reference was made at the time I wrote the Commissioner & the Board.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI am in receipt of a copy of Mr. Indian Agent Barber's report for the month of April in which he refers to the appointment of Mr. Widdowson as teacher at Inkameep Indian Day School, stating that he arrived, with his wife and child, on April 16th. Mr. Barber also states that he \"cannot understand three people being recommended to live in accommodation which is somewhat cramped for a bachelor\". This would no doubt leave the impression with the Department that some person other than Mr. Barber, presumably this office, advised Mr. Widdowson that the accommodation at the school was sufficient for three people. This was not the case. Mr. Widdowson was given detailed measurements of the classroom and two rooms comprising the quarters at this school by the Inspector of Agencies and I personally informed him that the accommodation was very small. Since arriving at Inkameep, Mr. Widdowson wrote the Inspector informing him that he found things exactly as described except that the rooms were one foot larger than the measurements given. It was my understanding that Mr. Widdowson's wife and child would visit him but not that they would take up residence.\n\nThis man was appointed on a temporary basis, subject to indication that he was capable of teaching a small Indian Day School.\n\nFor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, May 3, 1944.\n\nDear Mr. Millar:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of April 24 and to thank you for the information contained therein.\n\nI am today communicating with Commissioner MacKay, requesting him to do everything humanly possible to make the living quarters at the Inkameep School reasonably satisfactory to the recently appointed teacher.\n\nI have reviewed very carefully the correspondence on file in respect to the Inkameep School, and I am convinced that a fully modern school, with ample accommodation for a teacher, should be built as part of the Government's works program in the immediate post-war period. In the meantime, Commissioner MacKay will undertake certain minor repairs and purchase the furniture that appears to be necessary. It would be appreciated if the Indians themselves, in this critical period, took the steps necessary to secure an adequate supply of water for the school.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to state that your personal interest in this matter is very much appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.

M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nRe: Inkameep Indian Day School.\n\nMay I refer to a letter dated January 17, 1944, received by you from Indian Agent Barber. In this letter Mr. Barber states:\n\n\"I have to advise that requisition was made for a new mattress, two blankets, a floor rug and an easy chair, and same was forwarded to the Department from this office on October 4, 1943, and October 15, and no word has been received.\"\n\nI have made a careful study of the files and have discovered a requisition dated September 20, 1943, asking for mattresses, blankets, easy chair, etc., at the Inkameep School. This requisition was apparently sent in with another requisition for textbooks, classroom supplies, etc., and was evidently overlooked by the officials here. I have been wondering if it would be possible to persuade Indian agents, in the future, to send in requisitions for textbooks and classroom supplies and the furnishings for teachers' residences on separate forms, and perhaps in separate envelopes. I agree with you that requisitions for furnishings, repairs, etc., should be sent to your office.\n\nI am frankly a little disturbed at the condition of a number of our Indian day and residential schools. We have had a number of resignations during the last two or three months, and unless we can do a great deal more than we are doing now to keep these buildings and teachers' residences in a good state of repair, additional resignations are likely to reach us in the immediate future.\n\nThere is -\nThere is, as you know, an acute shortage of teachers throughout the Dominion. Principals of normal schools and educationists generally believe that this shortage is likely to continue for perhaps a decade. If such is the case, the competition for teachers in the future is apt to be very keen and unless the salaries paid by this Branch and the accommodation provided compare favourably with the salaries paid at white schools and the accommodation available in white centres, I am afraid we are likely to secure what might be termed the dregs of the teaching profession during the decade ahead of us. We have altogether too many teachers lacking professional standing in our schools at the moment.\n\nWould it be possible to have Indian agents report on the condition of these buildings and not wait until the president of some Indian Handicraft Society reported their condition to the Minister? It would appear that we require a new building at Inikamep, which should consist of a spacious classroom, full basement accommodation and a teacher's residence. In the meantime and until such a building is constructed, I am anxious that you should do everything humanly possible to make the living quarters at this school reasonably comfortable.\n\nR. A.

For your information, I wish to state that the Corona Readers have been adapted as the textbooks in the Catholic schools. I might add that these readers are the only Canadian Catholic readers on the market. They have been revised and compare very favourably with other sets of readers. Along with these, the Department sends supplementary reading material. Readers are sent out in groups of six. This will allow the teacher to diagnose the reading ability of the pupils, grade those with the same difficulties together and teach them in groups of six. You will readily understand this system. I am, therefore, sending some Highroads and some of the new Work and Play Books. It is difficult for me to say when you will receive these as shipping conditions today are very unsettled.\n\nI wish to draw your attention to the fact that textbooks are only tools and should not have too much effect on the methods of teaching.

Also the water is now piped to the school door from the spring 1000 feet away. The school reopened on October 1st. However, it was closed from October 16th to 26th inclusive owing to the teacher, Mr. Widdowson, having to go to Vancouver where his son was ill. Many of the Indians of this reserve are still away and the attendance is poor, being an average of about seven pupils.\n\nThe teacher, in my opinion, is hardly suitable for teaching young Indian children, although no doubt very capable in his own line.\n\nA. H. Barber.\nIndian Agent.\nDecember 28, 1944\n\nDear Mr. Hagg,\n\nFurther to my letter of Dec. 4th, I have to say that I have now received from the Macmillan Co. their list, with extra publications of the Work-Play series recommended by our Provincial Inspector of Schools. They are very good, and quite in line with the views I have discussed with you in my previous letters. But the expense is very great.\n\nI am writing a formal application through the Agency for a single set that I can examine, and from which I can determine what may be required for the Indians' children. But I will quite understand if the expenditure is undesirable or the cost of rent. This single set will be about $25 (less post) and if the school was equipped with the series, the immediate future expense would be about $75, quite apart from subsequent expenditure on larger grades. Therefore, though, in the children do not take any interest in their work (having been spoiled by excessive housework and recreation), I would not expect any great result to communicate with the Superintendent.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Michael O'Reilly.\n\nMr. A. H. Barber,\nVernon, B.C.\nocadqobpge\nnmhuy\nijlt\nkfrsvwxz\nDear Mr. MacKay,\n\nI have been doubtful as to the form into which I should throw the remarks which I have to make on the improvement of Indian education; but have finally decided to write them in the form of a letter, which you can have transcribed in any way which you may wish if they are to be transmitted to Ottawa.\n\nThe first point which I should like to make is that, just as in white education the city school with a class room for each grade may be taken as normal, in Indian education, the small school with several or all grades at work in one room under one teacher must be taken as normal. This means that, although one wishes to depend as little as possible upon the textbook, there must be long periods of time when the teacher is occupied with other grades, in which the pupil must of necessity be left largely to textbook or work-book; blackboard work for any one grade is in the same way only possible for a small part of the total school time.\n\nAgain, I must criticise the present policy of the Branch to depend upon the Provincial textbooks. In the present state of Indian education there is far more in common between the needs of the Indians in the several provinces than there is between those of Indians and whites within the same province. Leaving out of the question differences of psychology between peoples of different colour, there remain two factors of far-reaching importance:\n\nFirst, very few Indian children have any intellectual background, such as most white children have; second, English is a foreign language, and it is an inefficient proceeding to use the same textbooks as are used for children to whom English is their mother-tongue.\n\nThe teaching of arithmetic requires special textbooks, with the directions to the pupil in very much simplified language. One notices in present-day arithmetic texts an unfortunate tendency to use complicated and difficult words in place of simple and readily understood ones. That is unfortunate in any case, with Indians doubly so. There are many books available in which the distribution of arithmetical facts is good enough, but need rewriting as to the English used to convey the facts, to bring it down at least two grades in its comprehensibility.\n\nApart from Arithmetic, it is my view that the whole of the necessary subjects for the first three grades\u2014which are by far the most important\u2014could and should be embodied in a single course roughly corresponding to Reading. All that need be taught in the way of Social Studies, and the elements of the scientific knowledge...\nof things, could be included in a judicious choice of pieces for inclusion in the readers. That will of course mean that the readers will have to be larger than at present. The plan of Macmillan's New Work-Play Books is as good as any that can be devised; but the bulk requires increasing, and the reading matter adapted to the needs of the Indians.... This, by the way, does not mean that they should be about Indians, or be interlarded with \"Indian\" words derived from the languages of all but or quite extinct tribes of the East; but that they shall be about topics to a large extent those that appeal to Indians, such as animals and riding; a considerable proportion of the authentic fairy tales of the near East (which possess these interests, would seem to be indicated). In fact, for the real education of the children, the environment should be rather that of which we wish to inform the children, and not their own, with all that it implies of resistance to civilised ways. The illustrations also, should attain to a high artistic level (here again the Work-Play Books may be referred to approvingly) as Indian children are apt to use the illustrations in their readers as artistic raw materials; it would also be as well that the technique of the drawings should be such as to help in this way (that is to say, not involving the use of light lines and washes) and that the range of subjects should include a great quantity in which bathing scenes are depicted, or some related subject which would provide the excuse for giving the children plenty of unconscious instruction in the anatomy of the human body. (When teaching I have suffered considerable discomfort from the ignorance of the children in this matter.)\n\nI would further suggest that the use of these readers should be made compulsory in all Indian schools; and that religious interests should be represented by the permission and encouragement of religious bodies to provide supplementary readers of considerable bulk (if desired), planned to fit in with the general scheme of the main readers. The provincial interests could also be represented by a further series of locally provided supplementary readers.\n\nAnd I would in addition advocate the provision, at each grade level, of \"home readers\" which would be given to the children to take home with them, which might lead to a gradual raising of the level of the homes themselves. Here also, religious and provincial supplementaries would be invited.\n\nIn all the readers I would suggest that uniform system of lettering be insisted upon, such as I have written out upon the enclosed sheet. As it is to be presumed that the readers for the first three grades would be reproduced photographically, there\nwould not be the slightest difficulty in setting the words done for reproduction along with the drawings. It is further to be desired that at the first level only those capital letters should be used whose forms are identical with those of the small letters, other capitals, and also forms of some of the small letters which in letterpress are different from those in the attached alphabet being introduced gradually.... The merit of the attached alphabet lies in the fact that the proportions of the letters are given a definite rationale, which appeals to the logical Indian mind. Thus the O is an exact circle, the C is derived from it by drawing the circumscribed square and its diagonals; a good many letters are based upon it, and it is taken as the measure for the width of most of the other letters.\n\nI was myself surprised at the speed with which the children at Inkaneep, who had never before been introduced to a properly constructed alphabet, took to this one and marvellously increased the neatness of their work at all grades.... For this can well be taught as a preliminary to writing, which in my opinion should not be expected of Indians too soon.... It would be a great advantage to have properly ruled paper for practicing lettering, and reducing the size with the increasing age of the pupil, such as is unfortunately not done at all in Canada. The cost would be trifling.\n\nTo turn to practical life, I would like to see the Indian customs used as a basis for the teaching of cleanliness. There is no reason why the Indians should not be told - as it is the truth - that their own sweat-house method of keeping clean is superior to our European methods. But that for European clothes they should turn to European methods. I would advocate the adoption of uniforms which, as Government property, the Government could insist upon being kept clean, probably by a laundry class of the dirtiest snirt-and-shorts for the boys and short frocks for the girls, with not too much extra piled on for the winter, would be in addition conducive to health.\n\nI am aware that much of this would involve the outlay of considerable amounts of money. But in the rehabilitation schemes which are now rife, I understand that money is going to be spent anyhow, and I consider that some such scheme as I have outlined (and as to any part of which I could of course supply further details) would be very productive or good.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In view of Mr. Widdowson's very brief experience teaching in one small Indian school and his lack of training in pedagogics, it is unlikely that the Department will regard the report as sufficiently authoritative to warrant much consideration.\n\nApart from the above, it is pleasurable to note Mr. Widdowson's continued interest in Indians.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Inkaneep Indian Day School\n\nReference your 10-11-2 (164) of February 23rd.\n\nI have noted the contents of your letter and also that of Mr. Sampson. It would be indeed unfortunate if we were to close this school, as at one time it was one of the best day schools in British Columbia.\n\nI realize that it has deteriorated greatly, and will await with interest Mr. Sampson's report on present conditions. I am attaching the pupil forms which we use when doing a survey on a condition such as exists on this Reserve.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nApril 10, 1950.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Inkameep Indian Day School\n\nI enclose herewith results of a survey recently made by Mr. Superintendent Sampson in connection with the above-mentioned school. It will be noted that there are sufficient pupils to justify the operation of a one-room school on the Inkameep Reserve. The very unsatisfactory operation of this school during the last four or five years is undoubtedly due to our inability to secure and retain a competent teacher. It is felt that the unsatisfactory living conditions at the school and the acute shortage of qualified Catholic teachers are the main factors in our difficulty in securing suitable teachers and it is hoped that it will be possible to construct a new school at Inkameep during the current fiscal year.\n\nMr. Davey recently visited this reserve with Mr. Sampson and came to the conclusion that the existing site is the most suitable location for a new school.\n\nW.S. Arneil\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMarch 14th, 1950.\n\nW.S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nAttention of Mr. R.F. Davey, Inspector of Indian Schools\n\nRe: Inkameep Day School\n\nFurther to our recent discussion about this school, the following information is submitted:\n\n(a) There are currently 12 children available for attendance at this school.\n\n(b) The 6 children in attendance at Omak School could attend at Inkameep if the school is opened. They were sent to Omak early in the term when it was thought the school was not going to operate.\n\n(c) There are four children at Kamloops Residential School who apparently have no reason for not attending the Inkameep School, as there are other children in the family who are living at home and the family circumstances are more or less normal.\n\n(d) There are 13 preschool children and 13 children who will be discharged during the next six years, so attendance will apparently remain about the same.\n\nOwing to the distance from the public schools in Oliver and the difficult road over which children would have to travel, it does not seem practical to entertain the idea of\ntransporting the children from the Reserve into the Oliver schools, although the School Board has signified their willingness to accept these children.\n\nThe present school building at Inkameep is inadequate for our purposes, both as to living quarters and classroom. The original construction was very poor, there having been no insulation applied, with the result the school is hot in the summer and cold in the winter; both the school and the living quarters are far too small; the lighting is very poor, there being insufficient window area; the water system is impractical in its present state owing to improper installation.\n\nOwing to the impossibility of carrying out practical improvements to the existing building, it is strongly recommended that a new building, including living quarters and inside sanitation be constructed, and that a new water system be installed which will provide adequate storage and proper insulation of the pipes from freezing.\n\nWith regard to the water supply, the Indians inform me that spring from which the school has been drawing water is open all year round and that the water is of good quality.\n\nR.H.S. Sampson,\nSuperintendent,\nOkanagan Indian Agency.\n| Year | Surviving Children | Potential Enrolment |\n|------|-------------------|---------------------|\n| 1933 | 2                 | 1                   |\n| 1934 | 2                 | 1                   |\n| 1935 | 2                 | 1                   |\n| 1936 | 2                 | 1                   |\n| 1937 | 2                 | 1                   |\n| 1938 | 2                 | 1                   |\n| 1939 | 2                 | 1                   |\n| 1940 | 2                 | 1                   |\n| 1941 | 2                 | 1                   |\n| 1942 | 2                 | 1                   |\n| 1943 | 2                 | 1                   |\n| 1944 | 2                 | 1                   |\n| 1945 | 2                 | 1                   |\n| 1946 | 2                 | 1                   |\n| 1947 | 2                 | 1                   |\n| 1948 | 2                 | 1                   |\n| 1949 | 2                 | 1                   |\n| 1950 | 2                 | 1                   |\n\nIndian Affairs.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.,\n\nInkameen Indian Day School.\n\nWe have read with interest Inspector Davey's survey on the above school and it seems evident that there is sufficient population to warrant the operation of a small school.\n\nWe suggest two alternatives:\n\n(a) The conversion of the present school into a teacherage or into a proper classroom. If it can be converted better to a full classroom then we can erect a small teacherage. From Mr. Sampson's letter of March 14 it seems that it would be better to convert the present building to a proper teacher's residence by putting in proper installations and carrying out other improvements. Then we could provide a prefabricated one-room school which would provide proper classroom facilities.\n\n(b) The provision of a standard one-room school and teacher's residence as per plan 888.\n\nI attach Construction Project Report Forms to be completed and forwarded here in due course.\n\nBernard F.

I hope to look in on the Inkamoose School and will endeavour to contact some of your former pupils. I will bring back what news I can, of their progress.\n\nYou will be interested to know that we are now building a new school after having overcome many difficulties.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nDear Bernard:\n\nThank you so much for your note. I was glad to know that you'll soon be in your new house, and thus escape moving before the coming of the hot weather. It is only now that we are getting warm weather in these parts. From the top of the Mount, I've been watching throughout the last week, the trees assuming their green clothes. It was a marvelous experience to watch the change of colouring from day to day. I'm fascinated by the Mount, because six minutes' walk takes me away from the rush of the city and I'm in peaceful surroundings as in the Okanagan.\n\nSince I last wrote to you, I've done much writing. My three-act play on St. Noel Chabanel, 'Triumphant Failure,' is now ready for printing. I've just received a letter from the head of Dramatics Dept at Penn State College, (We were at Band together for a couple of years.) He states,\n\n\"Sorry to have kept the enclosed manuscript so long, I have read it with great interest but have been hoping to get a little more time to write you concerning it. I am truly hardly competent to judge it. It does not follow the usual pattern of a play\u2014it is episodic with a broad sweep\u2014almost a movie scenario. But I believe it will be very moving if performed well. I am wondering whether your Catholic patrons will like the bitter note at the ending. Despite any faults the whole consent has a kind of magnificence about it. And I wish you very much luck with it.\"\n\nWith regards to the bitter ending, it brings out the point that for the time being the Church is crushed, but of course we know that She returns. Non-Caths find it very hard to accept failure.\n\nI've also completed a short story, an hour-long radio play, 'Symphony of the Plains,' and am now at the tail end of a one-act. It is about very serious matters, but is turning into a comedy. There is a wonderful old gal, Nora Connolly, who has taken the bit in her teeth and is running away with the show, so I'm having quite a time between chuckles, trying to keep her in her place.\n\nLast Friday night I did a show for the Montreal Branch of Fed of Can Artists. There were a wonderful audience, but as they have no funds, there was no remuneration in cash. Wasn't there some gal named Marie Antoinette who stated, when she heard people were starving and bread was called giving them oats? Well, I also need bread, but in place of cake, got a beautiful picture by an artist of Montreal who made many studies of the Caughnawaga Indians. I also got a script accepted by the International Service of the CBC, but it is going to be nip and tuck whether I can scrape up enough cash to keep me going through June.\n\nOn July 2nd I became manager for the Montreal Summer Theatre at Loyola College. I'm also to have charge of experiment children's productions. As they are starting from scratch, I'll just be getting a pittance. But it will bring me in touch with people of influence with the Cath Schools Commission, and may\nlead to some part-time work with Eng Cath schools. And who knows\nis this is successful, there may be an opportunity of part time\nwork teaching Indian art and drama at Caughnawaga.\n\nAll my friends and associates have run into some kind\nof trouble or other, either personal, family or business, so our\nprojects have had to be postponed.\n\nI hope that Betty, the youngsters and yourself\nare all well, and that the number of headaches in the Department\nare diminishing.\n\nI see little likelihood of visiting Ottawa, because\nits a case of cents these days, not dollars.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\nOmak Wash\nSept 16-19\n\nDear Mr. Ball,\n\nReceived your letter and your request of explaining why I have resigned so sudden as teacher of the Sekameep River School.\n\nI am sure that you have been Indian Agent long enough to know how hard it is to deal with the Indians when they are anger at you, and also that the word of the priests is law to them.\n\nThis where my trouble started with the Sekameep Indians when I married outside of the Catholic Church. I heard before I reached the Reserve that I was going to be put out of my position if necessary by force. I was ordered out of one house in fact for the same reason. I want you to know that I am married by law and have my papers to show for same.\n\nUnder these circumstances I am sure you will find it in your heart and also Mr. McPhail to forgive me. I didn't mean\nto be harsh to you nor the office, but I just wanted to \"beat\" the Indians in their intentions & making an object of daughter of me among themselves and the white-people. I have never complained nor complained what I had to bear in the last two years trying to educate my people.\n\nAt the time I saw you at Cowell I fully intended returning to work, or else I would have told you differently. It was at the latter part of August when I found out on my way to Sukamoo what the Indians thought of my marriage, which they claimed we not been married at all.\n\nMany of the members would not speak to me when I reached the Reserve. I spoke to Chief Peter and told him that I was giving up my work, and went on to Pembina and call up Mr. and Mrs. McGrady's office which I failed to find either one of you there.\n\nThanking you for your past kindness and interest in me. Yours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChristina M. Miller\nOctober 2nd September-1919\n\nSit,\u2014 527921\n\nYour File 470825/5.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith the resignation of Christine McLeod teacher of the Osoyoos Day School as requested in your letter of the 11th ult. This is dated September 16th but has only reached the office today.\n\nI have recently learned that Christina McLeod was married and divorced several years ago and has now re-married. The Superintendent of the Colville (Washington) Indian Reservation has known her 20 years and she has always borne an exemplary character. Since her re-marriage the Indians have objected to her returning as teacher though they have doubtless been influenced by the priest, Father Bellot, who might also use his influence to prevent so many Indians living together without being married at all either by law or by the priest, and I have called this state of things to his notice several times. He is strongly opposed to the Osoyoos or any other day school, as he plans to start an Industrial school at Penticton where all the Reserves shall send their children and their maintenance to be paid for by the Department. This is quite impracticable as the majority of the Indians will not allow their children to leave the reserve and the expense to the Department would be out of proportion to the education given.\n\nI have continually worked for more\nschools on the Reserves and always meet with stubborn opposition from the older members of the Bands and there is no doubt that this opposition is instructed and not natural.\n\nFather Bellot was formerly in the Stuart Lake Agency B.C.\n\nI am making every effort to secure the services of another teacher for Ocoyoona Indian Day School and will report when successful.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nAsst Deputy & Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, July 27, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Inspector Cairns, in a recent report on his inspection of the Osoyoos Indian Day School, states that an old building which stands near the church building is used as a class-room. It will need considerable repairs to make it comfortable for the winter.\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough to state who owns the building in which the school is conducted and also state what repairs are required to place it in a comfortable condition and the probable cost of the same. You should give this matter your early attention, in order that, if this building is the property of the Department and it is decided to have the repairs made, they can be carried out before the cold weather sets in.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFred J. G. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nExtract from report of Inspector Cairns on the Osayoos Indian Day School, report dated June 7, 1920.\n\nAn old building which stands near the church building is used as a class-room. It will need considerable repairs to make it at all comfortable for the winter. It will do all right for Summer. There is plenty of opportunity for play. There is one toilet. When they want a drink they go to the stream near by.\nOttawa, October 5, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant enclosing the resignation of Christine Holcomb as teacher of the Osoyoos Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that her resignation is accepted. It is regretted that she was unable to get along satisfactorily with the Indians and the missionary.\n\nIt is not the intention of the Department to open a residential school at Penticton, and it is therefore, desired, if possible, that you will obtain the services of a suitable teacher at an early date to take up the work at the Osoyoos Day School. As requested in official letter of the 11th instant, the name, age and qualifications of any applicant which you receive for the position should be forwarded for the approval of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nFred J. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 27th ult., regarding repairs to the school at Inkameep, I beg to advise that the building used as a school is really the priest's house close to the church and is the property of the Band. It is a 12 x 15 room and the priest never uses it. The school building proper is a much larger building near by, but for several reasons has not been used. The foundations have rotted and it is in a dilapidated condition, but the real reason is that it is too close to the graveyard, some of the graves being within a few feet of the wall and it was claimed that the children are nervous and afraid to enter the building.\n\nThe priest's house, now used as the school, requires new flooring and the ceiling repaired, and the whole work would need lumber to the value of $75.00 to make it comfortable for winter. This lumber could be obtained from the Provincial Irrigation Works within five miles of the school and the Indians promise to haul it and repair the building without further expense.\n\nNext year there will be a large quantity of lumber available when the big ditch is completed and I would suggest that the present building be repaired to make it habitable for the coming winter, but advantage taken of the opportunity to\nbuild a rather larger and better school building next year when the irrigation lumber becomes available.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 3, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo regarding the repairs required to be made to the building used for school purposes at the Osyocas Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the repairs mentioned by you being done to this building, in order to make it habitable for the coming winter and the lumber required for the purpose may be purchased from the Provincial Lumber Works at a cost not to exceed your estimate, namely\u2014$75.00. It is noted that the Indians will haul the lumber and make the repairs to the building without any expense to the Department. You should arrange with the Indians to have these repairs completed at an early date and the house used for the school made as comfortable as possible. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the lumber required.\n\nThe question of erecting a new school building next year will receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFred J.

(RG 10, Volume 6406, file 834-5, part 1)\nJanuary 3, 1925.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Pallet,\n\nReferring to the attached letter from Mr. Agent Ball, I wish to state that the Osoyoos Band have had a school on and off for the past two years. There are roughly ten children of school age. The school was closed the end of June, last, as we were unable to secure a teacher - lack of boarding accommodation was the chief reason for our failure.\n\nThere is a very old school building on the Reserve which is not suitable for any purpose. Of late, school has been held in the priest's house, which was given for the purpose. I am of the opinion that $500 or $400 will put this building in good shape as a school house, but, in addition, we will have to provide a small teacher's residence, if school activities are to be continued.\n\nR.F.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSir \u2014\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant and in reply would say that the Priest's house on the Osoyoos Reserve is constructed of hewn logs and on account of its age is quite unfit to be used for any purpose whatever. Permission was granted by the Department last year to expend $75.00 on it to fix it up, but it was found that nothing could be done on account of the unstable condition, and the amount was not applied for.\n\nThe members of the Osoyoos Band are widely scattered at present. Not more than eight children of school age reside in the vicinity of the settlement so that it is not desirable to build a substantial residence and school on this Reserve. I would suggest however that a building quite good enough for a combined school and residence could be erected locally for about $500.00. This would be a plain frame building large enough for ten or twelve pupils and two rooms for a teacher. On account of the remoteness of this Reserve from white settlements, I do not think we shall ever be able to obtain a white teacher and it would not be advisable to put up any substantial building where the school population is not likely to increase but rather diminish. The proposed new school at Penticton will probably be large enough to accommodate the Osoyoos children, although the Osoyoos Band have not taken kindly to the idea so far. In any event the temporary school located in the Priest's house at Penticton is filled so that no effort has been made to have the Osoyoos children brought over to Penticton. I believe the best plan will be to hold over the building of any school at Osoyoos until after the Penticton School is completed. It may be that when they see a substantial\nschool building on the Penticton Reserve the parents of the few who have attended at Osoyoos in the past will be willing to bring their children over.\n\nI have just received a wire from the Chief's son, at Osoyoos, which reads as follows:-\n\n\"We have teacher, she is starting next week\".\n\nI have written for full particulars about this teacher and have asked her to make an application to the Department for the position as the information contained in the telegram was very meagre. The teachers who have taught school on the Osoyoos Reserve so far have been half-breeds who lived with the Indians and where such teachers are available and satisfactory, this is the best arrangement and, I believe that this new teacher will also prove to be a half-breed. Previous teachers have either lived in one of the Indian houses or put up a frame with tent roof and have been quite satisfied, although a white teacher, of course, would not live under these conditions throughout the year.\n\nI do not know what building the Osoyoos Band intend to use in future as a temporary school. The last time I visited the Reserve the Chief's son said he might use a room in his house as the only children attending school at present were his family and near relatives.\n\nI hope the new proposed school at Penticton will be commenced as early as possible.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, January 3, 1923.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter of the 19th ultimo, enclosing a cheque for $350 - an amount which was requested some months ago by the Osayoos Band in order to paint their church. I have noted that it will be impossible to use this money for the purpose intended until a later date.\n\nWith reference to the suggestion that a portion of the band funds be used to build a small house, the Department is of the opinion that the old priest's home, which was given for the purpose, might be put in good condition for a small sum and that, if any building activity is undertaken, it should be a residence. You will remember that we could not open school this last fall, because there was no residence for a teacher.\n\nWill you make a recommendation to the Department, indicating whether or not a new school at Penticton will cater to the educational needs of the children of the Osayoos Band. If not, and if there are sufficient children to warrant the expense, consideration will be given to taking some of the Osayoos Band funds - augmented, perhaps, by parliamentary appropriation - for the erection of a teacher's residence and, if necessary, a new school house.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The Deputy Superintendent General has authorized the erection of a building, as indicated by the rough sketch which you enclosed. You may make arrangements with Mr. H. Parsons, the local contractor, to erect a plain, substantial building to be used for the purposes of a classroom and a teacher's residence. Mr. Parsons' rough sketch called for a building 26 ft. by 14 ft. The Department Architect suggests dimensions of 30 ft. by 16 ft., so that the living accommodation will be more adequate.\n\nPlease make arrangements with the contractor to have the building erected, under your supervision, on a proven cost plus ten per cent basis. All accounts will have to be certified by yourself, and proper time sheets should be kept for the labour employed. As a guide, the Department suggests to you and to Mr. Parsons that the total cost be between $550 and $900. The cost of the building will be charged to the interest at the credit of the Band.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nF.J.C.

(RG 10, Volume 6406, file 834-5, part 1)\nI beg to refer to your letter of December 12th last authorizing the erection of the Osayoos Indian Day School with two rooms as a residence.\n\nThis work has been very satisfactorily completed along the lines suggested by the Department's architect of a building 30' x 16'. The work was handled by Mr. Henry Parsons and one assistant and time sheets for the labour are attached. I also enclose all shipping bills and itemized accounts for inspection. The building is a very substantial building on concrete piles and has met with the approval of the chief of the Band.\n\nAs will be seen by the statements, the total cost is $947.50. I tried to have the cost kept below $900.00 and would have done so except for the painting, the expense of which was overlooked in figuring out the cost of the building with Mr. Parsons.\n\nWithout extra expense, I have had this account checked over by an architect friend and he states that the prices are as charged on work in Penticton and vicinity. Labour is charged at 70\u00a2 an hour both by Mr. Parsons and his assistant. This also is the wage paid at this point.\n\nThe work has been carefully and conscientiously performed by Mr. Parsons, and it is regretted\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nAss't Dep. & Sec'y....(2)\n\nthat the estimate was slightly exceeded.\n\nIf, after due examination, the accounts are found satisfactory, I respectfully recommend that the balance of $547.30 due to Mr. Parsons be forwarded to him.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Fred G.

(RG 10, Volume 6406, file 834-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, August 30, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your Os. 1-10-1 of the 21st instant, with reference to painting and repairs to the Osayoos Indian Day School. You may cover the siding with tar paper and shingles, as recommended in your letter. Then, one coat of shingle stain should be applied to both roof and walls. I note that the total cost in this connection, including windows and doors, will be approximately $225. You may also tint the interior walls, or, if you consider it advisable, decorate by painting. Further, you may erect a woodshed, at an approximate cost of $100.\n\nI note that this work can be done by Indians, under the supervision of the teacher, and that the materials will be purchased by yourself. The accounts for materials should be properly certified by yourself and forwarded to the Department for payment. You may apply, when timely, for an accountable cheque, with which to pay labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nFor Secretary.\n\nJames Coleman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B. C.\nSir,\u2014 Re Painting Osoyoos Day School File 164-11-5.\n\nReplying to your letter of June 27th, I beg to advise that I have inspected the Indian Day School on Osoyoos Indian Reserve No.1 and by measurement find that this building is 18'5\" x 30' x 10', and, in my opinion, of very poor construction, being little more than a rather badly built shack.\n\nThe outside appears to be common siding nailed direct to the studding and the inside three-ply cottonwood veneer applied direct to studding. The outside siding has shrunk rather badly and, in places, it is possible to insert the fingers. The veneer lining had been put on so badly that it forms very poor protection and the result is that the high winds prevalent in this district blow clean through the school.\n\nIn view of this condition, I would recommend that the outside be covered with tar paper, and shingled on top of the siding, which if properly done would give a weatherproof building. The total cost of this work, with one coat of shingle stain to walls and roof, should not exceed $200.00 with an additional $25.00 for windows and doors. I would also strongly recommend interior re-decoration at a cost not to exceed $75.00, the inside being unpainted except the strips holding veneer panels and the whole being in a very dingy condition.\n\nFor a paint job alone, I estimate the cost not to exceed $225.00 for outside work, and $75.00 for interior, or a total of $300.00 in all; but apart from the roof, I do not consider the outside worth the expenditure in its present condition, other than from a decorative viewpoint; particularly, as there would be very little difference in the comparative costs. I would further suggest that paint and material be purchased by the Department and not by the individual performing the work, ensuring first-class material. As the Indians of this reserve are rather above the average in intelligence, and they have done excellent paint work on their own houses, I believe we would secure a perfectly satisfactory job to have one of them do the work under the supervision of the teacher, Mr. Grist, and, if this was done, we would eliminate a daily taxi charge for a sixteen mile return trip.\nfrom the nearest town, which would run quite high and would, of course, be charged to the job. I can personally undertake to see that the work is completed in a good shape.\n\nThis school also requires a woodshed, there being no outbuilding whatever, apart from latrines. The cost of this will not exceed $100.00, if authorized.\n\nThis school has been giving me considerable cause for thought on account of low attendance and high costs per pupil, and I have advised the Indians of this Reserve that every child of school age and within reasonable distance of the school must attend. I do not wish to recommend closing the school for the reason that the majority of the Indians are very keen on keeping it open, this school being the first in this agency, and, I understand, originally opened by the Indians themselves at their own expense, but with the present average attendance, it appears to me that it would be better to run the school for three days per week, and utilize the services of the teacher in the Similkameen for part time, as they have been calling for a school there for the past two or three years.\n\nI am reporting fully on this matter in a separate letter, and would appreciate your instructions in regard to both subjects. I have deferred the painting of Osoyoos School until such time as Mr. Grist returned, in order that we would have a check on the work.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(James Coleman)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nJC/DH.\nOttawa, June 27, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Perry, Assistant Indian Commissioner for British Columbia, in a report on his recent visit to the Osoyoos Indian Day School, suggests that the school building be painted on the outside, in order to preserve it.\n\nIn this connection I have to request that you will furnish an estimate of the cost of painting the exterior of this building. Please also state how you would recommend that the work be carried out. Could you arrange for the purchase of the paint and other materials required and for the labour? Our funds for the present fiscal year are limited but, if the painting of the building would not involve too large an expense, favourable consideration will be given to authorizing the work after full information is received from you as to the cost, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJames Coleman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\nSir:\n\nThe Indian day school at Osoyoos was visited and the work of the teacher Mr. Grist, and of the children was examined. We found that good results were being obtained here. We addressed the children who were clean and intelligent.\n\nIt is thought the school building should be painted outside in order to preserve it.

(RG 10, Volume 6406, file 834-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, March 2, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th ultimo, enclosing a requisition for material for use at the Osayoos Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the following: 1 mop with handle; also 125 feet wooden strips and one gross wood screws, for fastening school desks in pairs, as recommended by Mr. Inspector Barry. You may also arrange to have the work carried out in fastening the desks to the wooden strips. It is noted that the labour, cost and haulage of the material will be approximately $5.\n\nRegarding the gasoline and coal oil asked for, I have to say that, while in the past these supplies have been allowed, I would request that you state whether the oil and gasoline are for the teacher's use in his residence or for lighting purposes in the school. As our funds are limited, the question of authorizing the purchase will be considered when we have your reply as to the use for which the above is required.\n\nRegarding the Inspector's recommendation that a fire extinguisher be supplied, I have to say that it is not the policy of the Department to provide fire extinguishers for use at Indian day schools.\n\nWe are not prepared to authorize the supplying of toilet paper.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

In any event, the teacher has been notified that these will not be furnished after the close of the present fiscal year, and it is unlikely that further requisitions for same will be received.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(James Coleman)\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, March 14, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, regarding the requisition which you forwarded from the teacher of the Osoyoos Indian Day School for gasoline and coal oil. In this connection it is noted that supplies of this nature are mainly for the teacher's quarters, with occasional use in the classroom on dull winter days.\n\nYou may supply one 4-gallon can of either the gasoline or the coal oil for use in the classroom when required. However, the Department cannot continue supplying either coal oil or gasoline for the teacher's own use in his living quarters. After you have made the purchase of the 4 gallons authorized, you should forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred. It should not be necessary to supply any further quantity for lighting the classroom for a considerable length of time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

You might obtain and forward, for the Department's consideration, an estimate of the cost of piping the water in the manner suggested by the Inspector. The matter will then receive further thought; but, at the present time, I am not in a position to state whether or not funds will be available for the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nActing Indian Commissioner,\nBox 686,\nVictoria, B.C.\nEXTRACT from Inspector Barry's Report on his inspection of the INKANEEP INDIAN DAY SCHOOL on February 15, 1934. - Original on File 164-11-6.\n\nThe water supply is not sufficient in that it is from a small surface spring and is little more than seepage. It would be an advantage if this water could be piped a distance of about 400 yards from the little spring to the school. I do not suppose that there is any money for such a purpose at the present time.\n\nEXTRACT from letter of Asst. Indian Commissioner Perry, dated March 2nd, 1934, enclosing above report. Original on File 164-11-6.\n\nIn the event of the Indian Agent not making such requisition, however, it is considered advisable that a suitable fire extinguisher should be provided for this school as a means of fire protection in view of the hazard called to the Department's attention by Inspector Barry.\n\nIn regard to the small water supply for this school, an item could be included in the Estimates for the fiscal year 1934-35 under the heading of B.C. Special Vote either under Medical or Irrigation if this item is approved by the Department; the Agent to be asked to submit an estimate and give the necessary particulars of the spring referred to by the Inspector. We have certain water rights in this reserve and I feel we should do everything possible to see that this school is supplied with suitable water particularly in view of the other favourable conditions reported to exist at this school.\nOffice of the OKANAGAN Indian Agency,\n\nFebruary 26th 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 5265, amounting to $5.00 in favour of S.O.

They were sending an exhibit of handicraft made by the pupils to an exhibition of handicraft held in Vernon, and I understood that this exhibit was very favourably commented on. Part of it was pottery work. This school has also exchanged handicraft with a school in Czecho Slovakia.\n\nOne small improvement that should be done at this day school is to pipe the water from its source, a spring a little way up the hill back of the school, down to the school building. This is necessary from the health point of view, instead of the children and the teacher having to take their water out of the creek flowing near the school, which the cattle also use. However, as the teacher lives at the day school, it would be a great convenience to him, which should receive consideration. In addition I might say that this spring runs all the time, but the creek itself dries up about the beginning of July, and it means quite a climb up hill to get water after the creek has stopped running.\nSir:\n\nRe: Your File No.164-11-5\n\nReplying to your letter of the 5th instant regarding Mr. Inspector Fragill's report regarding water for Osopos Day School, I would advise that I provided for an expenditure of $385.00 in my 1935-6 Estimates for this purpose.\n\nUnfortunately, the spring is not so close to the school as would be gathered from the Inspector's report; as it is about a quarter of a mile up a rocky gulch where excavation would be difficult. The water supply amounts to only a mere trickle during the summer months, but the school is closed during that period. The only other supply is about a mile distant and difficult to bring to the school. Sinking a well would be problematical, owing to rock formation, an Indian well nearby being dry most of the year.\n\nIt might be possible to curtail the expenditure somewhat and the cost would be kept as low as possible.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(James Coleman)\nIndian Agent.\n\nJO/DH.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, June 18, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, regarding the water supply for the Osceola Indian Day School and giving an estimate of the cost of installing a pipeline from a spring located about one quarter mile from the school.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department will have no funds this year to cover the cost of having this work carried out. A note has been made to provide the expenditure - approximately $385.00 - in our Estimates for the next fiscal year. Before incurring any expenditure, however, the Department would require to be definitely assured that there would be an ample supply of water obtained from the spring and also that the pipe could be installed in a manner to prevent freezing in winter. It is noted that the result from the sinking of a well would be problematical, owing to rock formation. You might furnish full information with your estimates for the next fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJames Coleman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon,\nB.
