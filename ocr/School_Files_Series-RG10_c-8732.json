It is being held together by truss rods at present, and as the Department have promised this school for several years, every effort should be made to have it built this year.\n\nAnything you can do to bring about the erection of a new school in this village will be greatly appreciated by the Indians and myself.\n\n(M.S. Todd)\nIndian Superintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Cape Mudge Indian Day School\nYour File 805-5 (E)\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of July 19th, I am enclosing for your information a memorandum from District School Inspector Davey wherein he suggests that, of the various plans referred to, No. 865, with minor changes, would be most suitable. Please note that these minor changes are proposed only if they will not involve any delay in advertising for tenders. I would recommend that immediate steps be taken to advertise for tenders for the erection of this school, as it is essential (reference Mr. Todd's letter of July 26th attached) that replacement of the existing building be made this year.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosure.\nJuly 26, 1949.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Cape Mudge School\n\nI have examined plans 890, 862 and 865 and consider that the last of these, plan 865 is most suitable for Cape Mudge.\n\nThe living quarters could be left unfinished as we already have a teachersage which will serve for five years or more at this point.\n\nI suggest that the partitions forming the boys' cloakroom could be omitted, giving additional length to the class room. The doors forming the entrance to the class room would then be placed to open into the boys and girls entrance halls. The store-room and bathroom on the base floor level could serve as cloakrooms. I suggest these modifications only if they will not involve any delay in the advertising for tenders. I feel that this plan with the modifications suggested would provide excellent facilities for the primary grades which are to be enrolled.\n\nR.F. Davey,\nDist. School Inspector.\nOttawa, July 12, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nCampbell River Indian Day School.\nCape Mudge Indian Day School.\n\nIn accordance with the recommendation of the Joint Parliamentary Committee that Indian children, wherever possible, be educated in association with other children, our field officials have been carrying on negotiations with various provincial departments of education.\n\nThese talks have been particularly successful in British Columbia where we have our own School Inspector, Mr. Davey, a former provincial department of education official, has been able to make considerable progress in having Indian children admitted to provincial schools. The total of such children now enrolled in these schools has risen to 435.\n\nFor some time Inspector Davey has been in discussion with the Campbell River School District concerning the two new provincial schools being erected at Campbell River and on Quadra Island (near the Cape Mudge Reserve). Please find attached a complete memorandum from him, clearly outlining the situation at each of these schools insofar as it concerns the Indian children who might be educated in them. As these are children of the United Church faith, there will be no objection from local missionaries to the proposals outlined by Inspector Davey. A summary of his suggestions is as follows:\n\n(a) Campbell River - size of school 21 rooms including library, home economics and industrial arts.\n\nCost of school - $485,999 plus 6% architect's fees and $61,961 equipment.\nWhite enrolment - 439  \nIndian enrolment - 17  \n\nEstimated contribution from Indian Affairs  \nBranch on basis of enrolment - $18,700.\n\n(b) Quadra Island Provincial School -\n\nSize of school & rooms (superior)\n\nCost of school, anticipated $96,310  \nand equipment at 11,634.\n\nTransportation - one mile walk to bus and  \n5 mile trip by bus.\n\nWhite enrolment - 72  \nIndian enrolment - 23  \n\nEstimated contribution from Indian Affairs  \nBranch on basis of enrolment - $30,000.\n\nYou will note Inspector Davy recommends that we  \ncontinue both our small one-room schools as primary and kindergarten  \nrooms. I concur in his recommendation as too often the first two  \nyears of school are taken up with teaching these Indian children  \nto speak English. Mr. Indian Commissioner Arnell has recommended  \nthat the Department make a contribution towards the capital costs  \nof provincial schools at both Campbell River and Quadra Island.  \nI concur in his recommendation and would request that he be  \nauthorized to prepare an agreement to be entered into with the  \nCampbell River School District, along similar lines to the draft  \nagreement attached hereto.\n\nActing Director.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6386, File 805-5, part 2)\nJuly 19, 1949.\n\nMr. W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, British Columbia.\n\nCape Mudge Indian Day School.\n\nReference your 6-11-3 (156) of July 11\n\nThe matter of co-operation with the Campbell River School District has been referred to the Minister's office and we will write you when a decision has been reached. We are pleased to note that you are prepared to advertise for the construction of this building. Under separate cover, we are sending you the following plans:\n\n(a) Plan 865 - including basement, plumbing and lighting.\n\n(b) Plan 890 - one-room school with no teacherage.\n\n(c) Plan 888.\n\nPlan 865 is designed for erection where hydro is available. However, it could be adapted for use with a D.C. lighting set. Would you please advise which of these plans will be the most suitable for your requirements.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Cape Mudge Indian Day School\n\nOur requirements at the above mentioned point will be adequately filled by the construction of a one room school without teacherage, to accommodate Grades 1, 2 and 3. The remaining Grades can attend the Provincial School on Quadra Island. It is therefore in order to advertise for the construction of this building if suitable plans are available. It is understood that such plans are now in the course of preparation.\n\nInspector Devey considered the possibility of adapting Plan No. 888 as suggested by Mr. Neary in his letter of June 22nd in connection with our requirements at the Chehalis Indian Day School, file No. 806-5 (E). Mr. Devey noted that these plans made no provision for plumbing and feels that in view of the fact that the Cape Mudge Village is one of our most progressive that the school should be in keeping with the housing on the Reserve. He would prefer to wait for the completion of Plan 890 if this makes provision for plumbing and lighting and would not prevent the completion of the school before the end of the fiscal year.\n\nIn Mr. Neary's letter referred to above he stated that a set of the preliminary drawings were being forwarded to this office. Unfortunately these apparently have not been received and although they are no longer required for the Chehalis school, the building of which has been deferred, I shall appreciate receiving a set of the sketch plans to be used in considering construction at Cape Mudge.\n\nW.S.

ARNEIL\nINDIAN COMMISSIONER FOR B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of Plan #865 received direct from Ottawa, and I have been advised by the Commissioner's Office this is the plan they have recommended for the new Cape Mudge Indian Day School and that tenders are now being called for.\n\nUpon perusing the plan recommended I note it includes one classroom and a modern teacher's residence as part of the structure. This will give us two modern teacherages for a one-roomed school, as we now have a fully modern, partially furnished teacherage at Cape Mudge Village. The present teacherage is a modern five-room cottage, present value about $7,000.00. The present teacherage has a good cement foundation, well-built and in a good state of repair with the exception of needing some inside decorating, a new chimney and minor repairs to plumbing. Most of the materials for these repairs have been purchased by the Department and are on the ground ready to proceed with the work. The cost of these repairs would be roughly $400.00. Two years ago the Department put a new roof on this building and painted the exterior as well as part of the interior. We own an excellent lot, fully improved on which the teacherage is located; and I am wondering if the Department has forgotten this teacherage exists when providing a second teacherage for a one-room school.\n\nHad I been consulted and asked for a recommendation, it would have been as follows, keeping in mind the future requirements of this fast growing village:\n\n1. Present teacherage - repairs to same to the extent of approximately $400.00, as indicated above. The present building will accommodate two teachers.\n\n2. School - modern two classroom structure with full basement and oil-burning furnace to heat building, electric lights and full plumbing.\n\nThese recommendations based on the following facts:\n\n1. Attached hereto list of school-age children.\n\n2. Attached hereto list of preschool-age children.\n\n| Term   | Children enrolled, grades 1-8 | Village children to attend school, grades 1-8 |\n|--------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| 1949-50 | 43                            | 43                                          |\n| 1950-51 | 47                            | 47                                          |\n| 1951-52 | 48                            | 48                                          |\n| 1952-53 | 56                            | 56                                          |\n| 1953-54 | 62                            | 62                                          |\n\nI am informed Inspector Davy intends to have all children from Grade 4 up attend Quadra Island White School. To reach this school from Cape Mudge Village the children have to walk a very difficult, steep trail through the forest for approximately two miles. In good weather this would be excellent exercise but for most of the term the weather is very miserable with heavy rains and snow. There are no roads through\n\np.t.o.\nthe Reserve where transportation could be made available. In this respect I am thinking of the children's health, particularly the younger ones.\n\nI understand Inspector Davey's desire to have the Cape Mudge children attend Quadra Island White School is for the beneficial effect it will have through mixing with White children. I am thoroughly in accord with this general policy wherever possible but we must not be misled by such splendid ideals or motives no matter how good they may be if they are not economically sound. I also understand the School Board are considering building a new Quadra Island School. Experience has proven to us that the tuition grant being charged by local School Boards has increased, in some cases to the point where it would more than pay the Department to operate their own schools. There is no set tuition fee. Each School Board bases the tuition fee charged the Department on their actual costs of operation; and if the Quadra Island Board provided with the construction of a new school, we can anticipate that our tuition fees are going to be just as high if not higher than Courtenay, which is $163.00 per pupil per year. According to our census, based on Inspector Davey's policy of sending all children from Grade 4 up to Quadra Island School, we would have to pay grants to this school as follows:\n\nTerm 1952 - 53 Grades 4 - 8, 33 children @ $163.00 each = $5,379.00\nTerm 1953 - 54 = 34 = $5,422.00\nTerm 1954 - 55 = 34 = $5,422.00\n\nThis village is growing and will continue to do so. As I analyze the known facts I am thoroughly convinced the Department should erect a two-room school, and even with two classrooms, Grade 8 could be sent to Quadra Island if the Department felt it was wise, and still save money by operating two classroom school in Cape Mudge. I have always recommended to Inspector Davey that there should be a two-room school at Cape Mudge for the reasons indicated above.\n\nThis report is being made to furnish the Department with present as well as future requirements, and is based on local facts and knowledge after years of experience as Superintendent of the Kwawkwehtl Agency. I felt this information should be given you when I was not consulted as to requirements, but whatever the Department decides to do will be appreciated. My only desire is that we have a proper school at the earliest possible date.\n\n(W. S. Todd)\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nEnc.\nAIR MAIL\n\nSeptember 12th, 1949.\n\nMr. W.S.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nBFN/HHM\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Cape Mudge Indian Day School\nYour file 805-5 (El)\n\nWith reference to Mr. Phelan's letter of Sept. 12th, District School Inspector Davey has carefully read Supt. Todd's letter of September 1st with regard to the proposed new school at Cape Mudge, plan 865, and has provided me with a memorandum dated September 24th, a copy of which is attached.\n\nIt is considered that the classroom accommodation afforded by plan 865 is adequate and will likely be adequate for some time to come and although the teacherage accommodation provided by the plan is not essential at the present time it will be required in the near future if such accommodation is to favourably compare with the housing standards of the Cape Mudge village.\n\nYou will note Mr. Davey's comments with regard to the Quonset buildings. He is presently enroute to the Williams Lake Agency where at Quesnel the local School Board have a Quonset type school, and following his return in about one week he will report with regard to the suitability of such a building on the Cape Mudge Reserve and until his report is received I would suggest that the question of construction at this point be left in abeyance.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nSeptember 24, 1949.\n\nRe: Cape Mudge Indian Day School\n\nI refer to Mr. Todd's letter of September 1st to the Department concerning the new school at the Cape Mudge Village and Mr. Neary's letter of September 19th.\n\nAs Mr. Todd knows, arrangements have been made to admit grade 4 and above to the Quadra Island School, and this will provide accommodation for the primary grades a number of years. It is quite practical for the senior group to attend the Provincial school as outlined in my memorandum dealing with the suggested agreement with the Campbell River School Board. I have walked over the trail referred to in Mr. Todd's letter, which is only one mile instead of two, and I consider that it would be too difficult for the primary children only.\n\nWith regard to the cost of educating our children in Provincial schools, it is assumed that it is the Department's policy to provide in our schools the same educational standards as prevail among the white schools. If this is to be the case undoubtedly our costs will equal those of the Provincial Department.\n\nMy reason for recommending plan 865 with the attached teacherage was that this plan is apparently the most suitable available. I understand that Mr. Arneil has visited the teacherage at Cape Mudge and is of the opinion that it will have to be replaced in five or six years, and consequently, the added expense of the attached teacherage is justified on these grounds.\n\nThe proposed use of a quonset building at a saving of approximately $7,000 is something which I feel should be considered with caution. One of these buildings of different design is being erected at Ucluelet and several Provincial School Boards are experimenting with them. However, I have not had an opportunity to see one in service and I am not in a position to comment on the suitability and appearance of this type of construction. I shall have an opportunity to see one of these buildings in use in a Provincial School District during\nmy trip to Williams Lake and Stuart Lake next week. This will give me an opportunity to see the building in use and to secure information regarding its suitability. As you are aware, the Cape Mudge Village is the finest from the standpoint of the quality of the housing that we have in British Columbia. It would be a mistake to construct a corrugated iron building among such a group of houses unless the general appearance has been improved considerably by the use of windows and the one front flat wall surface.\n\nI believe that the Department would be well advised to defer proceeding with the construction of a building until I have had an opportunity to see how successful the school board experiment has been.\n\nA.F. Davey,\nInspector of Indian Schools in B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Cape Mudge Indian Day School\nYour file 805-5 (E.1)\n\nFurther to my letter of September 26th, District School Inspector Davey has returned from the Williams Lake district and in his memorandum of October 6th attached, reports with regard to Quonset school buildings and recommends against the erection of a Quonset building on the Cape Mudge Reserve for the reason stated, with which recommendation I fully concur.\n\nMr. Neary's comments with regard to the tenders received on a standard building at Cape Mudge as compared with the cost of such a building in Eastern Canada, are noted, and while I cannot see why there should be such a great difference in the cost here and in Eastern Canada, as the tenders received were submitted on a competitive basis, it would appear to indicate that material and labour costs must be higher here.\n\nSince writing the above Mr. Neary's letter of October 11th, in which it is suggested that both tenders on Plan 865 be rejected, has been received. This no doubt would be the proper thing to do if it were not for the fact that construction at Cape Mudge has already been postponed for a number of years, or if we had some other proposal which would provide suitable classroom accommodation at a more reasonable cost, but otherwise it is felt that in spite of the exorbitant cost the lowest tender on Plan 865 should be accepted.\n\nWe are opposed to the use of a Quonset building at this point, as stated above, having in mind the type and standard of home construction in the village and also the\nfact that on Quadra Island and at Campbell River the Province is proceeding with the construction of modern buildings costing at the rate of over $20,000 per classroom.\n\nElimination of the proposed use of Quonset building and the rejection of the tenders on plan 865 leaves us with only one alternative if construction is not to be postponed for another year and that is the erection of a prefabricated \"Multi-Flex\" building of the same construction as the new schools at Pemberton, Metlakatla and elsewhere. We are confident that Prefabricated Structures can supply us with a single classroom, complete, erection of which we can arrange on a firm price basis for amounts in each case sufficiently low as to obviate the necessity for an Order-in-Council, but having in mind the absence of any reaction from the Department to our recent submission covering the proposed erection of prefab. schools in the Skeena Agency we hesitate to spend our own time, Contractors' time and the Company's time on such a proposal without some indication from the Department that it will be given consideration.\n\nTo summarize the situation briefly, this office would not recommend:\n\n(1) Postponement of construction for another year.\n\n(2) The erection of a Quonset building.\n\nWe would recommend:\n\n(1) That consideration be given to the erection of a single prefabricated classroom designed in such a way that it can be easily added to if necessary, or:\n\n(2) If this is not approved, acceptance of the lowest tender on plan 865.\n\nW. S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOctober 6, 1949.\n\nMemorandum to: Indian Commissioner\n\nRe: Cape Mudge Indian Day School\n\nOn my recent visit to the north, I had an opportunity of examining the one room quonset school recently constructed for the Quesnel School District at Alexandria, B.C. A number of pictures were taken of this building, prints of which are attached herewith.\n\nI feel that this is an excellent building for our isolated reserves where the cost of standard construction is almost prohibitive. However, in the case of Cape Mudge, where there should be no difficulty with normal construction, I feel that the Department would be well advised to use their standard plans. The Cape Mudge reserve is the finest that we have in B.C. with regard to housing and general appearance. Indeed, I am sure that it compares with white communities of a similar size. It will be apparent from the pictures that the quonset type school will not add to the attractiveness of the village. I am sure that no house-holder would welcome the establishment of such a school in close proximity to his home. I might add that I had the opportunity of visiting the School Inspector, Mr. W.H. Grant of Prince George, in whose district this school is located. He informs me that he is very pleased with this building and that the school district plans on using more of them in the isolated communities. The Inspector mentioned that provision has been made for an addition and, consequently, the northern wall has been temporarily installed so that the addition of a second classroom might be effected with a minimum of difficulty. This will explain the facing of the children so that the light comes over their right shoulders,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6386, File 805-5, part 2)\nrather than the left, as is standard practice. I assume also that when the addition is erected, the chimney will be faced, rather than left exposed, as it is at present.\n\nThe classroom arrangement is very convenient, there is ample cupboard room and excellent lighting.\n\nThe Department will recall that we are building in the West Coast Agency at Ucluelet, a school with this type of construction, and in spite of the favour which the quonset buildings have met with the Provincial School Board and Inspector, I still feel that the Cape Mudge School should be one of standard construction. Next year we will have had an opportunity to discover what faults there are, if any, with this type of building. In the case of Cape Mudge reserve, the factor of appearance should also be considered.\n\nR. F. Davey,\nInspector of Indian Schools for B. C.\nOctober 29, 1949.\n\nMr. W. S.

Wright the new teacher at Cape Mudge School informs me that at the last school at which she was teaching on Skeena River that the Department supplied her with a house and also with a stove, and she has asked that the same accommodations be provided for her at Cape Mudge. There is a small cottage of two rooms at Cape Mudge available for five dollars per month, and a stove should not cost more than $20.00.\n\nIn this Agency up to the present time all accommodation has been supplied by the Missionary Society who supplies the teacher, and without taking the matter up with the Department I was not prepared to give any decision when this house was asked for. Would you kindly advise me whether this can be done in the case of Miss Wright. I am going to Cape Mudge in a few days and hope to examine the school while there but from her report it shows that there are fourteen children enrolled and 13 in attendance. Some of these children come from Campbell River and are being kept by the Indians at Cape Mudge in order to keep up the average of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept., Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In making the purchase of the stove you should be guided by the requirements of the War Purchasing Commission and obtain prices from a number of dealers and purchase the stove from the one quoting the lowest price. You should also forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, for the expenditure incurred, with the quotations received by you from the various dealers.\n\nMiss Wright, the present teacher, met with much success while she taught at Kitsegukla, and it is hoped that there will be a good and regular attendance of Indian children at the Cape Mudge School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

You have raised the question, at her instigation, of a teacher's residence at this point.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that in certain instances the Department has erected a teacher's residence for the use of the teacher at an Indian day school. At this time it is impossible to incur any expense in connection with the matter, but, on receipt of further information from you, we are prepared to place an item in our Estimates for the next fiscal year. Mrs. Howard suggests that we purchase the building that is now being rented, as a residence. Would you write the Department, advising us if this house would be suitable, what price would have to be paid for it, and, if it is unsuitable, give an estimate as to the cost of erecting a building that would meet with the requirements. We would also like to know if a good boarding-house is available for the teacher at Cape Mudge.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nSir,\n\nBy the last mail I received a letter from Mrs. Florence Howard, the teacher at the Indian Day School at Cape Mudge, in which she asks that the Department provide a permanent house for her use or that of any other teacher who might be at Cape Mudge. I am enclosing a copy of her letter and I should be very glad to have an opinion from you on this matter. I have been informed that in other agencies houses have been provided for the teachers although it has not been done at the expense of the Department in this agency. If it is the custom to provide these houses I would be very glad to look into the expense of a house etc. If the Department would look favorably on the plan I think it would not entail very great expense but I shall be guided by your experience before taking any steps.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6386, File 805-8, part 1)\nQuathiaski Cove, B.C.\nOct. 21st, 1921.\n\nMr. Holliday\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been wondering if the Dept. would consider buying the house they are renting for the teachers' use; and fixing it up comfortable for a permanent home. They do this on other reserves where I have taught and it is always much easier to secure teachers for schools where there is a comfortable home for the teacher's use. As you know we are right in the open with no fence, and cattle tramp around at all hours, rubbing on the house and drinking our rainwater. During the recent storms the rain beat in and the wind blew a lot of paper loose and the house swayed dreadfully owing to being all open underneath. There would not be very much expense attached to renovating; a lean-to kitchen at the back would be all the extra room necessary; a front porch, fence and outside finishing is all that is necessary. If the Department will consider this proposition I will go ahead and cultivate a flower and vegetable garden and try to get the people interested in doing the same. I never lived anywhere before without being able to have flowers and vegetables of my own growing. I like to have flowers especially in cases of sickness among the people. It is no use for me to preach garden cultivation and improvement of homes to the people unless I practice it myself first. I am here to help the people and here to stay as long as my services are satisfactory. I do not see any reason why we should not have an excellent attendance here and a good school for there are lots of children growing up. I find the people here a class well worth helping. Will you kindly put this matter before the Dept. I have never yet known them to turn a proposition down that would be helpful to the work.\n\nHoping for an early reply.\n\nYours sincerely\n\n(Signed) Mrs. Florence Howard.\n| DATE | DETAIL | AMOUNT |\n|------|--------|--------|\n|      |        | $13.00 |\n\nI hereby certify that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that all expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Scott,\nNo. 102 for $2.50 in favor of the Quathiski Carving Co.,\nNo. 103 for $10.00 in favor of Sam Lewis.\n\nIn connection with the first mentioned voucher I beg to state that when I was last at Cape Judge Mr. Scott informed me that in order to make the house habitable for the teacher he had bought a small outfit consisting of two beds, springs and mattress, some building paper and a little lumber and some furniture which he thought the Department might be induced to pay for. I told him that I intended taking up with the Department the question of a house for the teacher and if he would after making the supplies forward the vouchers I would send them or to the Department and leave it to their discretion as to whether or not it should be paid.\n\nIn connection with Voucher No. 102, $2.50 of this amount which included linseed oil, turpentine and varnish was used on the teacher's house and the balance was for the school. In connection with Voucher No. 103 it is for rent for the house for two months. The owner of the house, Sam Lewis, has agreed to make certain repairs necessary but has not the money available so the account for rent is sent in now instead of at the end of the year.\n\nIn your letter of Nov. 9th you ask for some information with regard to the building now being occupied by the teacher. It is very suitable for her requirements although small and is conveniently located both with regard to the school and to the beach. There is no other residence with any white people in it nor more than three miles from the Rev. R. C. Scott, the Methodist missionary, lives on the reserve about 100 yards from the place occupied by Mrs. Howard but they are not prepared to take in boarders, although Miss Wright, the last teacher stayed with them for some months. When I next go to Cape Judge I will ascertain from Mrs. Lewis what value he puts on the house and whether he would be willing to sell.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is only in cases where the teacher's residence is the property of the Department that we supply a small quantity of furnishings for the teacher's use.\n\nWhen Mrs. Howard resigns, or if the school should be closed for any reason, there would be no place to store any furniture which is the property of the Department.

Whereas our people have taken the lead in abandoning the Potlatch in the Kwagulth Agency, and have indicated their sincerity by surrendering their dance masks and Potlatch paraphernalia, and are destroying the old potlatch dance houses; and\n\n2. Whereas our people are increasing in number, and the average attendance at school has increased this year and will be larger next year; and\n\n3.

(RG 10, Volume 6386, File 805-8, part 1)\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nI have been expecting to hear the result of your interview with the Superintendent of Education, hope we are to have a more comfortable home before next winter.\n\nI knew that Mr. Cairns was pleased with my school, I hope for much greater success this year. I have worked hard to build up the work & the people are greatly interested. I have devoted all my time to the work here as I feel that is the only way to be really...\nsuccessful. Out of school hours I visit the homes where care for the sick, beside having my sewing class for girls, night-schools, social evenings for the people, I am planning a domestic science class for the women this fall which should be a great help to them & when our people return home from their summer's work there will be Sunday school to organize & always take the services when our missionary is away. I have been kept so busy that I have had no time to try to earn anything out of school hours & find at the close of the year that I am in debt & have had to borrow $50 to meet my payments. Our first year of course was the hardest, having to start housekeeping & also having so many Dr bills to meet; still living is very high here & I find my salary insufficient for our needs. I thought there was no harm in writing to you stating the facts & if you feel you can recommend\none for a raise it would be a great help.\n\nI would rather be free to devote all my time to the work but if I cannot meet expenses I will have to give up some of the extras I have undertaken & try to earn the balance necessary in some way.\n\nI am glad Mrs Ferrier is so much better & hope that you are enjoying good health also.\n\nHoping to hear from you soon.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMrs Florence Howard\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nI wrote last mail through the Agent to the Dept., asking for a range, dresser, three common chairs, one rocker & a toilet set for the teacher's residence at Cape Mudge. The dresser, chairs & toilet set now in use belong to the Mission house & should be returned as they will soon be needed.\n\nThe above mentioned articles are all we need at present and the cost would be about $109.95 freight extra.\n\nThe articles I have offered to donate to the house are as follows.\nLarge table & tapestry cover.\nRound centre table & cover.\nTwo 2 storey plant stands.\nUpholstered cosy corner.\nThree upholstered seats.\nOne upholstered armchair.\nBookcase; woodbox.\nTwo corner cupboards.\nTwo washstands.\nWardrobe, dressing table.\nKitchen stool.\nIroning board.\nClothes horse.\nPantry fittings.\nAladdin lamp (value $15.00)\nKitchen lamp.\n\nThe furniture is all well made, stained & some upholstered.\nI will let you know about the time it is sent as a recommendation from you will be sure to help. I think the men will build the house gratis as they are very anxious to have me stay.\n\nYou have likely heard of the stirring times we have had re - Potlatch trial surrendering of all the potlatch goods. I will be able to send a few snaps of the masks etc surrendered when I have time to print some. The enclosed show the nice lot of children I have of school age & there are quite a number growing up who will replenish the School later on.\n\nThe people are greatly interested in the school. I hate living here but have a hard time financing matters as living is higher here than anywhere I ever lived before. Hope Mrs. Ferrier is keeping well.\n\nKind wishes to you both.\n\nYours,\n\nFlorence Howard\nDear Sir,\n\nI have visited this place in connection with my itinerary and in looking over the work I find one feature on which you might take note when you meet Mr. Cairns, spoke tome when I met him about the great improvement in the school since Mr. Howard took charge.

I would be of the opinion however that the work should be done as early in April as possible so that it would be completed before the fishing season begins.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Dec. 15, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that this Department is endeavouring to make provision for the erection of a teacher's residence at the Cape Mudge Indian Day School during the coming fiscal year. We wish to take advantage of the offer made by the Indian Band during the past summer. A Resolution, which was forwarded to the Department by the Methodist Church Authorities, read that members of the Band would supply all needed labour for the erection of the said teacher's residence and arrange for the transportation of materials from steamer landing to the building site. The Band also agreed to release a site for a teacher's residence, as long as such site was used for missionary or other educational purposes.\n\nIt has come to my attention that it is only at certain seasons of the year that it would be convenient for the Indians to proceed with this work. I shall be pleased to receive a report from you, intimating to the Department when action in connection with the teacher's residence would be timely.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing you Moucher No. 116 for $112.55 in favor of David Spencer Ltd., Vancouver, B.C. This was to cover a stove and some furniture for Mrs. Florence Howard, the teacher at Cape Mudge. The authority is your letter of Sept. 8, file 156/6/8.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nFebruary 1, 1923.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nMr. Scott:\n\nAt the Cape Mudge Indian Day School, in the Kwawkewlth Agency, Mrs. Frances Howard has been giving excellent service. This teacher has been living in a cottage, for which the Department has paid a rental of $6.00 per month.\n\nMr. Agent Halliday, a year and a half ago, recommended that a small teacher's residence be provided - the matter was postponed because funds were not available.\n\nIn August, last, there was presented to the Department a petition signed by certain members of the Cape Mudge Indian Band, asking that the sum of $1200 be provided for the materials and furnishing of a teacher's residence. The members of the band agreed to supply all needed labour and to arrange for the transportation of all materials. Further, they are willing to grant a site for the teacher's residence.\n\nThe Rev. Arthur Barner and the Rev. T. Ferrier both urge the provision of such a building.\n\nThere is included in the Main Estimates, 1923-24, an item of $1200 in this connection. Mr. Agent Halliday was requested to ascertain when the men of the band would be available for the purpose of erecting the building. His report is now to hand and, as he has mentioned the first of April, I will be pleased to have your authority to direct our representative to purchase the materials, after securing competitive prices, and to proceed with the building operations.\n\nMr. Orr states that a sketch, or plan, for a small building of this type is not required. Mr. Halliday should secure the services of a competent carpenter, and time sheets could be kept in connection with his labour. Such a man could supervise the work of the Indian band.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, Feb. 5, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 42 of the 20th ultimo, with reference to the erection of a teacher's residence at the Cape Mudge Indian Day School. I have noted that building operations should be commenced about the first of April.\n\nI have to inform you that funds will be available during the coming fiscal year for a teacher's home. You are authorized to complete arrangements with members of the Band for the necessary labour and for the provision of a proper site. In this connection, I have to refer to a resolution made by the Cape Mudge Indian Band, last summer, which reads in part:\n\n\"We humbly petition that the Department of Indian Affairs would grant the sum of $1200.00 for the erection and furnishing of a teacher's residence at Cape Mudge Indian Village. Further, should our request be granted we covenant and agree (1) to supply all needed labor for the erection of the said teacher's residence, as well as the transportation of materials from point landed by steamer to the building site, and (2) to grant to the Department of Indian Affairs one-half acre of land as a site for the above teacher's residence, so long as it shall be used for missionary or educational purposes.\"\n\nIf you are of the opinion that a competent carpenter should be hired to assist the members of the Indian Band and to supervise their labour, I would be pleased to have your recommendation, without delay, so that the necessary instructions may be issued to you regarding the keeping of time sheets, etc., if such a man is to be employed.\n\nWill you ascertain what quantities of lumber, cement, hardware and other materials are required, and secure competitive prices. Submit these to the Department, with a rough sketch of the proposed residence.\n\nKindly give this matter your early attention, so that the work can be commenced while the members of the Band are available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Mclean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6386, File 805-8, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, March 13, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 42 of the 3rd instant, with reference to the new teacher's residence at the Cape Mudge Indian Day School. I have noted the enclosed design, suggested by Mrs. Howard. The Department Architect is of the opinion that this dwelling would cost considerably more than the funds available; and I am enclosing, for your attention, plans of a residence that is considered suitable for the purpose.\n\nPlease secure competitive prices for the lumber, cement, hardware and other materials that will be required, and submit these to the Department. If it is necessary to engage a competent carpenter to supervise the labour of the members of the Indian Band, please make a recommendation, and instructions will be given to you regarding the keeping of time sheets, if such a man is to be employed.\n\nI have noted that the Indian Band will surrender a half acre of land and that the site has been selected. The design suggested by Mrs. Howard is being returned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nWith reference to your letter of February 5th I beg to advise you that I have just returned from Cape Mudge where I was engaged in overseeing the erection of a concrete cistern for the water supply at Cape Mudge and while there I went into the question of the suggested new building for a teacher's residence. The Indians said they would be ready to do the work at any time after the middle of April between then and the middle of June.\n\nI talked over the plan of the suggested building with Mrs. Howard, the teacher, and she had obtained a book of designs and had selected one called Dixie XVI. I find on checking it over with a scale rule that this building is 24 X 34 with three porches or verandahs attached to it. Her idea of this particular building was that she thought there should be three bedrooms so that there might be a spare room for anyone coming there. It was further suggested that the house instead of being shingled outside should be covered with rustic with tar paper in between and the inside should be lined first with shiplap and finished with beaver board with the exception of the kitchen which should be done with V joint or beaded flooring. I am forwarding you the design but I have not yet gone into the estimates of the material but think that the building is rather larger than what is necessary but I am submitting it to you for approval of otherwise. I would suggest that whatever building is erected should be on concrete footings or concrete pillars. The ground is level and the pillars need not be more than a foot high. Kindly return the sketch whether approved or not and if this is not approved if you will send a sketch of what the Department would consider a suitable building I would immediately proceed with the estimates of the material etc. The Indians are quite prepared to give a surrender of one-half acre of ground and the site has been selected.\nThe house will be connected with the new water system just being installed.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDebtor to Miss F.

Ltd., Vancouver, is accepted, and you may arrange with them to forward the building material as mentioned in their tender, a copy of which you state you have retained. It is noted that the price quoted by them for this material is $969.43, F.O.B. Wharf, Vancouver. You should request this firm to forward the material freight charges prepaid, and to also forward to you their account in duplicate covering the cost of the material, together with a receipt for the freight charges paid. When the material has been received at Cape Mudge you will be good enough to certify these accounts and send them to the Department in order that payment can be made.\n\nYou should arrange for the labour required in erecting the building in accordance with the plan that was sent you in official letter of March 13th, last. The labour of the Indians in erecting the building should be given gratis. If it is necessary, however, to secure a carpenter to supervise the work, you may engage the services of a competent man to oversee the work. Proper time sheets should be kept showing the days he is employed, and the rate of payment he receives. Only the regular rates for the locality should be paid the foreman and labourers. The work is to be carried on under your supervision, and you will see that the building is properly erected and that a good and serviceable job is done.\n\nThe building should be erected on the site which has been selected on the half acre of ground which the Indians have agreed to surrender. You should obtain a surrender from the band for this half acre, which is to be used as a site for the residence. A description of the land by metes and bounds should be included in the surrender, which should be signed by a majority of the male (adult) members of the band.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear from you as to the date the building material arrives, and the arrangements you have made with the Indians for the labour, and whether you have engaged a competent carpenter to oversee the work or not. Again, when the building is completed, you should furnish a full report descriptive of the work.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay,\nB.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The cost should not exceed your estimate of approximately $8.75 per roll. It will be necessary to obtain competitive prices before making the purchase, and the wire should be obtained from the firm quoting you the lowest price.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

This Department will supply the material and the Indians will do the work of putting up the building gratis.\n\nOur Agent sent an estimate of the material required to 10 dealers and invited them to tender for the supply of same. The only firm who quoted on all the material required was the Farmers Mutual Lumber Co., Ltd., Vancouver, and our Agent, who checked up the various quotations received, states that the price submitted by this firm is cheaper than dividing the order up among the other firms who only quoted on part of the material required. Owing to the difficulty in arranging for delivery at Cape Mudge, which is an out of the way point, it is considered advisable to make the purchase of the entire quantity of material from the one firm, in order that arrangements can be made for shipment.\n\nThe correspondence and quotations received are attached hereto, and I shall be pleased if you will authorize purchase from the Farmers Mutual Lumber Co., Ltd., at the price quoted by them, vizt $969.43, F.O.B. Vancouver, and forward your Minute accordingly.\n\nAUTHORIZED\n\n15-4235\n\nAPR 26 1923\n\nF. H. Pickett,\nAccountant & Purchasing Agent.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the construction of a residence for the teacher at Cape Mudge I am enclosing herewith two tenders which have just reached me in connection with it but I have no reason to alter my recommendation sent in the last letter.\n\nI have just had a letter from the teacher taking exception to the fact that in the plans of the building there is no provision made for a bathroom and I have been asked to bring this matter to your attention, as there is a good water supply at Cape Mudge it would not seem to present any great difficulty in adding a bathroom at the back of the building in the form of a lean-to and certainly would be a great convenience to the teacher. No provision has been made for the material but that could be obtained afterwards.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nApril 19th, 1923\n\nESTIMATE FOR SUPPLYING\nMaterial for Teacher's Cottage at Cape Mudge.\n\nDAVID SPENCER LTD.\nVancouver, B.C.\n\n| Item Description                        | Quantity | Unit Price | Total   |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------|------------|---------|\n| 100 Sacks Cement                       |          | $100.00    |         |\n| 1100 Bricks for Flue                    |          | 30.00      |         |\n| 3 Tiles 6 in. salt glazed               |          | 2.70       |         |\n| 1 Barrel Lime                           |          | 3.50       |         |\n| 5 Gals.

This necessitated one extra window in the cottage and two small single sash windows, one each for bath room and pantry and as in the original estimate there were three doors short they were also included in this account. As the Farmer's Mutual Lumber Company, Limited, had been supplying the rest of the material and their prices were considered lower than any of the others I gave them this additional order which has been filled at the same rate as the rest.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nW.

She asked me about getting reimbursed for the money that she had paid out but I told her that as the Indians had promised to do all the labor that I could not send in a voucher for the labor but as she had paid for material I would forward a voucher and recommend that it be paid. The receipted bill is attached to the voucher.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nW. H.

My wife and I had to make steps lay some flooring, do all the outside painting (roof included) & all the inside staining & varnishing.\n\nWe started early in the year to clear the lot & it looked pretty hopeless.\nThe time covered with brush or small trees, stumps & stones but by staying with it working very spare minute out of school hours & most of vacation we now have it laid out in lawn, gravel walks, flower beds, small park & good sized kitchen garden.\n\nThe Dept provided wire for fencing & lumber for a woodshed but it was just lying out in the weather & would have been yet if I had not bought posts & hired a man to put up the fence & framework of the shed. I only let him do the work we could manage, we put on the siding, did all the finishing & painted the shed to match the house.\n\nThe place is greatly admired & I am hoping our people will soon live up their places to look more homelike.\n\nMr Halliday says the Indians promised to provide fence posts & do the work but it came at a time when they were all logging & water fishing & if I had not gone ahead as I did the house would still be unfinished with no improvements around.\n\nWill you kindly take the\nI am glad all the hard work is done for I do not feel as tho I could stand much more of it. I am looking forward to a helpful time at the meetings I have planned for mothers, boys, & girls this winter. I shall give instruction in sewing & cooking to the women & girls.\n\nBest wishes to you & Mrs Ferrier. Sincerely Florence Howat\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier, M.A.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed is a letter from Mrs. Florence Howard,\nCape Mudge, containing snapshot of her home.\n\nMrs. Howard asks for $48.00 for material and labor in connection with improvements she has made to her place. Personally I think this is a very moderate amount considering all the work and time that has been spent on her home and grounds. She has made a very beautiful spot here, entirely under her own efforts and I believe it will prove a very good example to the Indian people in showing them what can be done.\n\nI would appreciate very much if the Department would make a grant at least covering this actual expenditure of money on her part.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

She states she has for disposal 1 inlaid linoleum square, 9 x 12; 1 printed linoleum square, 9 x 12; 6 sets double curtain rods; 3 pairs white curtains; 3 rayon panels and overdrapes. She states that these supplies have recently been purchased and fit the floors and windows. She also states the value to be $45.25, but that she would sell them for $35.\n\nIf you consider that the above supplies would be required by the teacher who will succeed Mrs. Howard, you may forward a voucher, in duplicate, properly certified, in favour of Mrs. Howard covering the purchase at the price mentioned.

He is being informed that, if he approves of the purchase, he should forward a properly certified voucher in payment of the amount for which you will sell the furnishings. Our funds for the balance of the present fiscal year are entirely assigned and it would not be possible, if the purchase is made, to make payment until after April 1st, next, when our new appropriation will be available.

However, I find that in February, 1925, 225 feet of vitrified tile pipe at a cost of twenty-three cents per foot was laid. Time has shown that this is at least one hundred feet too short to affect its purpose properly. At the same time, I am convinced that the damage done to this pipe has been caused by Indians depositing their logs for fuel purposes on the beach and not taking reasonable care to avoid damaging this pipe. Unless some extensive alteration is made involving the pipe-line being buried deeper, it is quite possible that this damage will occur again in a very short time if this matter is not given the necessary attention and the repair work carried out.\n\nIn my opinion it would not be necessary to replace the whole of the pipe, but only that portion which extends over the actual beach and which hitherto has been exposed. For this purpose I would suggest that a box pipe would be more suitable as although this portion of the pipe could be sunk a little deeper, it would probably only be a matter of a year or so until it was washed clear. I would therefore recommend that an outside sum of one hundred dollars be applied for to cover the cost of having this work done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.G./T\nC.C. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst.

This would not cost a great deal and would be much more satisfactory and sanitary than the previous arrangement.\n\nThe Indians have agreed to build this and instal it themselves, providing the Department will supply the material, so the only expense would be some two inch planking, and I am asking that authority be given to have this work carried out. It would cost approximately $10.00 to purchase the required material to build this, and I would ask that you approve of this and have the necessary authority forwarded.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(M. S.

In encouraging instruction in arts and crafts in Indian schools in British Columbia you should impress on those interested the importance of the articles made being useful as well as ornamental.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nExtract from Inspector Barry's report on the Cape Mudge Indian day school visited on February 16, 1939.\n\nI believe that in the next fiscal year an effort should be made to introduce arts and crafts into this school by having the girls taught the carding of wool and all that must be learned with regard to the making of Cowichan woolen goods, and the boys taught the carving of small totem poles with hand knives.\n\nIndians are I believe available for such instruction and as recommended in my report the sum of $100 should cover the total expenditure for a year under this heading. The school is certainly ready for this sort of work now. It should however not be started till October 1st 1939 and close for the academic year on March 31st 1940.\n\n(Sgd.) Gerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B. C.\n\n20th Feb., 1939.\n\nThe recommendation of Inspector Barry that provision be made for the amount of $100.00 for instruction in arts and crafts at this school (such arrangement to commence in October of this year) is concurred in.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd.)

In encouraging instruction in arts and crafts in Indian schools in British Columbia you should impress on those interested the importance of the articles made being useful as well as ornamental.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nExtract from Inspector Barry's report on the Cape Mudge Indian day school visited on February 16, 1939.\n\nI believe that in the next fiscal year an effort should be made to introduce arts and crafts into this school by having the girls taught the carding of wool and all that must be learned with regard to the making of Cowichan woolen goods, and the boys taught the carving of small totem poles with hand knives.\n\nIndians are I believe available for such instruction and as recommended in my report the sum of $100 should cover the total expenditure for a year under this heading. The school is certainly ready for this sort of work now. It should however not be started till October 1st 1939 and close for the academic year on March 31st 1940.\n\n(Sgd.) Gerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B. C.\n\n20th Feb., 1939.\n\nThe recommendation of Inspector Barry that provision be made for the amount of $100.00 for instruction in arts and crafts at this school (such arrangement to commence in October of this year) is concurred in.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd.) D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\nMrs. Jack Nakmakim,\n\nPay to\n\nAddress...

At the present time there are some thirty children of school age residing there; and owing to the fact that the boarding schools in the vicinity are full to their capacity these children cannot obtain admission thereto. The Department will no doubt note that in my estimate for the coming year provision was made for the continuance of the school at Tsawassen Reserve, where there is a considerable amount of school material stored, but owing to the fact that a number of the parents and children on this reserve are absent therefrom it is very difficult, if not impossible, to secure a sufficient number of pupils to justify the reopening of the school. I would, therefore, respectfully recommend to the Department that the grant included in my estimate for Tsawassen School be transferred to Chehalis, where I believe I can secure a building from the Indians free of charge, suitable for the purpose of conducting school at present.\n\nTrusting that the Department will favourably consider this recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 14, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo with reference to the request of the Chief and members of the Chechulie band for the establishment of a day school on their reserve.\n\nIt is noted that you recommend that the grant included in the estimates for the Tsewassen school be transferred to Chechulie.\n\nBefore the Department can authorize the establishment of this school, you should secure from the Indians a written statement that they will be willing to furnish a suitable building, free of charge, for school purposes, as the Department has no funds at its disposal for the building of a new school this year.\n\nYou will be good enough to give this matter your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

These Indians, as on previous occasions, expressed a very strong desire to have the school open and are willing to supply a building 25 ft. 16 x 10 ft. high, and also a house in which the teachers could reside for the present. The buildings referred to will require to be repaired; the one in which it is proposed to hold school will need a new floor, relining from the wainscoting up to the ceiling, the roof repaired, and the building throughout cleaned up and painted; the total cost of this will be as shown on the attached statement. In addition to the above it will be necessary for the Department to provide school desks, as there are none at Tsawassen School, belonging to the Department. The dwelling in which the teachers are to live requires slight repairs, a thorough cleaning, kalsomined or painted.\n\nThe Indians at the meeting referred to, expressed their willingness to do all the work in connection with the repairs to both buildings, but stated that they have not the means with which to buy the articles required.\n\nIn view of the fact that the number of children of school age on this reserve is 34, and that the parents are desirous of having a school established, I would respectfully recommend that the buildings referred to be put into proper condition.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\ncondition for the purpose for which they are intended, the\ndepartment supplying the material at a cost of $74.15,\nand the Indians to do all the work, and that this school be\nopened as soon as possible.\n\nTrusting that the Department will favor-\nably consider the proposals herein set forth\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclosure:-\nIndian Agent's Office,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nFebruary, 29th, 1916.\n\nSir:\n\nChehalis Reserve\n\nThese people are very desirous of having a day school established on their reserve, and as there is from 35 to 40 children of school age available I trust that it will be possible for the Department to favourably consider their request.

C.\nMarch 29th, 1916.\n\nPeter Byrne Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster B. C.\n\nDear Sir-\n\nHaving come to my knowledge that the Indian Department intends opening up a day school at the Chehalis Indian Reserve in this Province, I beg herewith to tender my application for the position of teacher to the above school.\n\nI have had an English College education, and for a good many years past have been following the profession of architecture in this country, having had the honor of being elected a Fellow of the Royal Institute of Architects of Canada soon after the inauguration of that body.\n\nThough not a school teacher by profession, I have had a good deal of experience in directing pupils in their studies of the above work in its various branches. I may also state I am qualified to take over the physical directorship of the children, in such exercises as drill, dumb-bells and Indian clubs etc., as well as, horticultural studies, in practical fruit growing with the Indians of more mature years.\n\nMy wife, who has had several years experience in teaching in England, and who held the position of matron on the Gordon Indian Reserve in Saskatchewan some years ago, would assist me in the school with the girls and the children. In fact it is our intention, should this application meet with your approval, to both take an active interest in the village outside the actual school hours, with a view of bettering the existing\nliving conditions of the people by trying to instil in them a fuller realization of their responsibilities as human factors.\n\nAs regards remuneration, in view of the fact that a good deal of our time will be devoted to the welfare of the Indians outside the actual school hours, I should be glad if the Department could see its way to paying the maximum amount usually allowed for the work of the teacher, and to my wife for taking over the work as a matron of the village, such a sum as the circumstances of that office permit.\n\nTrusting you will be able to give me a definite reply at your very earliest convenience,\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG10, Volume 6387, File 806-1, part 1)\nReferring to Departmental letter of the 20th ultimo, No. 487553, I beg to enclose herewith application for the position of teacher (at the school to be established on the Chehalis Indian Reserve), received from Mr. Marsden, and also application from his wife for the position of Matron; together with recommendations from the Rev. Dr. Wm. P. O'Boyle, and Rev. J. Welsh, O. M. I., which speak for themselves.\n\nIn view of the fact that Mr. Marsden appears to be a man of learning, and Mrs. Marsden has had previous experience amongst the Indians as Matron of the Gordon School, and also considerable experience as a nurse, I would respectfully recommend that their applications be favourably considered by the Department, as I fully believe that they are very capable for such work, and that they will devote their time to the best interests of the Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nEnclosures:\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 22, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant enclosing an application for the position of teacher at the school to be established on the Chehalis Reserve from Mr. Marsden, also an application from his wife for the position of matron, and recommendations from the Rev. Dr. Wm. P. O'Boyle and the Rev. J. Welsh, O.M.I.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will be glad to accept the services of Mr. and Mrs. Marsden as teacher and matron respectively of this school and will pay them a joint salary at the rate of $900.00 per annum from the time they take charge.\n\nYou may purchase the material required for repairs to the buildings to be used for a school-house and a teacher's residence, upon condition that the Indians do all the work in connection with these repairs, and the cost of the material should not exceed the estimate forwarded with your letter of the 28th of February, last, viz.- $74.15.\n\nYou may also purchase fifteen of the double desks that have been removed from the public school in Vancouver and the cost of these desks delivered at the school should not exceed your estimate of $21.50.\n\nAs soon as the school building and teacher's residence are ready for occupation Mr. and Mrs. Marsden should take up their duties in connection with this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, August 14, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th and 5th instant applying for the transfer of Mr. and Mrs. J. J. Moroney, teacher and matron of the Homalco Indian Day School, to the new school at Chehalis and enclosing applications from George Bruce and his wife for the positions of teacher and matron of the Homalco School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as you state in your letter of the 13th ultimo that Mr. and Mrs. Harden, who were appointed to take charge of the Chehalis school after the holidays, have decided to remain at Shuswap, the Department approves of the transfer of Mr. and Mrs. Moroney to the Chehalis School and of the appointment of Mr. and Mrs. Bruce to the positions of teacher and matron of the Homalco School at the same salaries as their predecessors received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

(RG10, Volume 6387, File 906-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nFor the information of the Department I beg to report that I visited Chehalis School on the 15th ultimo. The work in connection with this school is progressing in a very satisfactory manner, but as yet it is all preliminary, hence there is very little to report, further than to state that the parents, particularly the Chief and a few progressive members of the tribe, are taking a keen interest in the welfare of this school.\n\nMr. & Mrs. Moroney, teacher and matron, who with their long experience amongst the Indians of the North, will, I am sure, give every satisfaction to the Department in their new field of labor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nChehalis Indian Reserve,\nHarrison Mills, B.C.\nSept. 4th 1917\n\nP. Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent, New Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI should esteem it a great favor if you would bring before the Indian Department the great hardship inflicted upon me and my family by the small salary allowed. The price of food and coal for transportation both by rail and gasoline boat to our nearest market town was not nearly nothing at the end of the year but cut into the little reserve of funds which so careful husband we have saved in last years.\n\nI discussed the matter of salary with the Inspector on his last visit and he quite agreed with me that the wages are altogether inadequate. If the department will only follow me in the particular herein given I feel quite sure that something in the way of a substantial increase will be given.\n\nThe Chehalis Reserve is located eight miles by gasoline boat from the Harrison Mills Station. I have to purchase all my stores from Vancouver. A sack of flour (90lbs) costs me seven dollars (the freight on same by P.R. adds another 40 cents about). I must then hire a gasoline boat which cost me sometimes $2 and sometimes $2.50. So that by the time I get my supplies to the Reserve I have paid between forty-five or five-and-a-half cents per pound. I have to buy everything at market rates in the old house in which we live, has no provision suitable for cultivation. I am, consequently unable to raise any green vegetables or potatoes which I should certainly be able to do if the war had allowed us to have the new buildings which I understand were to be erected when I was charged from Chehalis House to Chehalis.\n\nAt this stage there are four children who are of school age. The average attendance during the March-April-June term was 27 and these children are taught in a building too small...\nto admit the full attendance of those entitled to come to school. When it is considered that a good day school properly taught and further when the department are aware that the teacher, his wife and two children have to spend eleven months practically isolated I think that my application for a substantial increase of salary will meet with success. I have two children, one of school age but until the small salary of fifty dollars a month I fear that my daughter will have to do without whatever education she can obtain at home.\n\nIn conclusion, I would suggest that the department pay me the same as the teachers of Indian schools in the north viz. #50 per month. This I think would be a fair increase. I have taught in the Indian Schools now over thirty years; I was teaching for twenty years in Australia in the secondary schools and for several years in Ottawa's Business College in Vancouver. If the Department want any further information as to my ability to handle the duties I would refer them to the present Principal Mr. Craig as to my success as a teacher of white students as to my success as a teacher of white students in Canada. If a reference to the Principal of Ottawa's Business College is all that is necessary.\n\nI trust that you will bring the matter of an increase to the attention of the Department.\n\nYours, dear Sir,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.J. Moroney\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit herewith communication received from Mr. J. J. Maroney, teacher of the Chehalis Indian Day School, who has been in the employ of the Department in the position which he now holds, as teacher for the past four years. He first started at Homalco Indian Day School, Church House, after which the Department consented to his transfer to Chehalis where he opened a new school, which I am pleased to report is a great success. He is a man well qualified for the position which he holds, and in addition to his qualifications as teacher, he has the happy facility of being able to work with not only the children but with the parents, in fact all the Indians on the Reserve seem to think a great deal of him.\n\nIn view of the isolated locality in which his school is located, and the additional cost of transportation thereto, high cost of living etc., I would respectfully recommend to the Department that, if it were possible that he receive an increase in salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Sept. 21, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th instant enclosing a communication from Mr. J. J. Moroney, teacher of the Chehalis Indian Day School, in which he requests an increase in his salary.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will increase his salary by $50 per year, from the first of the school year, thus paying him at the rate of $650 per year for his services. The Department is unable to make him any further increase in his salary at the present time, as, owing to the war, there are no funds from which to provide a further amount.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B. C.\nExtract from December quarter Return of the Chehalis Indian Day School. Original on 487353-2.\n\nThe attendance at the school continues to be most satisfactory. The children have progressed rapidly, and have shown great anxiety to second the efforts of their teacher in every way. I am pleased to report that the older children continue to show very good ability in grasping arithmetic, a good test indeed of their brain power.\n\nThe parents are quite keen in most families about the progress of their children.\n\nOn two occasions it was necessary to dismiss school early owing to fearful storms in the Fraser Valley and along the Harrison River. The storm did fearful damage and, as the building at present used for a school is only an old frame Indian house built more than thirty years ago, needless to mention it was highly dangerous to keep the children in. The school groaned and creaked and the chief and myself decided that we had better let the children go. With such a fine body of children, it is a great pity that the Department cannot see its way to do something to improve conditions on this reserve both for the children and the teacher.\n\nJ. J. Maroney\nTeacher.\nREPORT OF INSPECTOR CAIRNS ON THE CHEHALIS DAY SCHOOL.\n\nIn view of the increased cost of living and the expense incurred in bringing in supplies and also taking into consideration the long experience of Mr. Maroney as a teacher and the very efficient work that he does, I would respectfully recommend that he be paid the sum of $720.00 per annum.\n\nDate of Inspection, May 2nd, 1918.\n\nPresent Salary, $650.00 - Received $7 more last fall.\n\nAttendance on day of Inspection, 13.\n\nAverage attendance for Dec 31st, 1917, 26.4\n\n\" \" for March 1918, 25.8\n\nLength of service in the school, Fall of 1916.\n\nInspector's Reports, Very satisfactory.\n\nJ.J.

(RG10, Volume 6387, File 806-1, part 1)\nOttawa, July 2, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Inspector Cairns, in a report on the Chehalis Indian Day School, recommends that the teacher, Mr. Maroney, be given an increase in his salary.\n\nIn view of this report the Department has decided to grant Mr. Maroney an increase of $50.00 and he will be paid at the rate of $700.00 per annum from the first of April, last. You will be good enough to inform him accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the application of Mr. Moroney, teacher of the Indian school on the Chehalis Reserve, for an addition to his salary, I beg to say that he is now paid at the rate of $700.00 per annum, and his wife is in receipt of a salary of $300.00 as field matron. There is no doubt that, owing to the high cost of living and the isolated locality in which this school is situated, his present salary is not more than sufficient to allow him a bare living.\n\nMr. Moroney has been in charge of this school ever since it was opened, in October, 1916, and Mr. Inspector Cains, in his last report, which was made on the 16th ultimo, says, \"Mr. Moroney is an excellent teacher. He is very practical and it is marvellous what progress these pupils have made since the school was opened. He is gentle and kind in his treatment of the pupils, thus winning their confidence. Mrs. Moroney is the field matron. She nurses the sick, teaches the mothers sanitary laws, and instructs the girls in sewing, etc. If all our day schools were doing as efficient work as this one, the Indian educational problem would appear less formidable. The teacher is the greatest factor in the problem\".\n\nMr. Moroney has maintained a high average attendance since he has had charge of this school and for the last year it was 65% of the enrolment, in spite of the influenza which visited this locality.\n\nWe are paying much higher salaries at some of the other schools in British Columbia, which are not giving as good a return either in attendance or progress.\n\nAt the Skwah School, for instance, there is an enrolment of only 19, with an average of 12, and the salary of the teacher, Mr. Grimshaw, was increased from $600.00 to $750.00 in the June quarter, 1918 and again increased from $750.00\nThere is no comparison between the efficiency of these two teachers, Mr. Moroney being by all odds the best. Mr. Cairns, in his last report on Mr. Grimsby's school, which was dated the 9th of April, last, states as follows:\n\n\"The senior pupils are very shy. It is difficult to get them to answer questions. The teacher's manner and his methods do not tend to bring out the best from the pupils. The senior pupils read and spell fairly well, but they cannot do much in arithmetic. They can do the simple rules but fail in the application of them. A class of juniors were learning to read, spell, write and to count. The teacher seemed to take particular pride in these juniors. He wanted me to note how well they did. I failed to see anything remarkable in their work \u2014 just ordinary work. I am convinced that the school will not reach a high standard under Mr. Grimsby. He knows nothing of methods. Then one must in sizing up the situation remember that the people are not at all progressive. The teacher is neat and orderly. He keeps everything tidy. He has many admirable characteristics.\"\n\nI think it would be well to give Mr. Moroney every encouragement possible in the way of salary, as I am doubtful if a teacher who would give as good satisfaction as he is giving could be obtained.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG10, Volume 6387, File 806-1, part 1)\nChehalis Reserve,\nHarrison Mills, B.C.,\nApril 29th, 1919\n\nS.G. Scott, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIt is with great reluctance I address you but necessity forces me thereto. I am after receiving my salary for the Jan.-March term as teacher of the Indian Day School at Chehalis. The Inspector Mr. Roth claims was here ten days ago, and we discussed the matter of salary and he seemed rather surprised to find that the increase given me had been so paltry.\n\nI have been almost five years with Indian Schools. On July 21st, 1914, I went with my family to the Homalosin Reserve, Church House. We paid all our expenses to that place upwards of twenty-five dollars. We received payment that year for only the month of September. At the end of the year, I mentioned the fact of some adjustment but was just too understand that no such adjustment could be made.\n\nOwing to the extreme loneliness & isolation of the place & the distance from a doctor, the Department transferred us to Chehalis, where I opened a new school, a most promising one under most discouraging circumstances. For almost three years we have labored here. Last year my wife and I with no assistance from any doctor had to handle fifty-five cases of influenza, living in a two-roomed shack in the midst of the village. I am grateful to Providence that we were able to do some good among this people both from a health & educational point of view. We have two children and the only thing that buryed us up to remain on the elusive promise, economically held out was the elusive promise, economically held out that we should have proper conditions in the near future. I am pleased to say...\nthat we seem to be about to realize the hope of improvement & this I am sure is due entirely to yourself, in response to an appeal made by Mrs. Moroney last November.\n\nTo come to the point, I think it only just that an adequate salary should be paid, should a man's record warrant it. I think I may refer you with confidence to the records of this school and the one at Komaiko. For four years the department paid me the salary of fifty dollars per month. Last year after several appeals an increase of fifty dollars was given; then in response to a recommendation of the Inspector another fifty dollars was added.\n\nThe increase of the cost of living is so great that and the fact that I have to keep two freighters on all groceries, one from Vancouver to Harrison Mills and then the hire of a gasoline boat from Harrison to the Reserve, makes it impossible to obtain the things which every worker is fairly entitled. The freight on my last order of fifty dollars worth of groceries amounted to four dollars.\n\nI should consider it a very great favor indeed if you would do something to help us to tide over these hard times by recommending some increase purely due to people who are interested in what is really a great work viz - the uplift of the poor Indians of the West.\n\nTrusting I have not trespassed too much on your patience,\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nvery respectfully yours,\n\nJ.J. Moroney\nOttawa, May 14, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo applying for an increase in your salary as teacher of the Indian school on the Chehalis Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the funds at the disposal of the Department will only admit of an increase of $50.00 being given you, which will make your salary at the rate of $750.00 per annum. This increase will date from the first of April last.\n\nMrs. Marsden is in receipt of $300.00 for her services as field matron and you have been given a bonus at the rate of $150.00 for the past fiscal year, which is being extended to the 30th of June, next. This will bring your combined salaries up to $1150.00, in addition to which new living quarters are being provided for you, which will be ready for occupation by the end of this month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. J. Moroney, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nChehalis Indian Day School,\nHarrison Mills, B.C.\nOttawa, May 14, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Mr. J. J. Moroney, teacher of the Chehalis Indian Day School, in which he applies for an increase in his salary.\n\nMr. Moroney is being informed that the Department will grant him an increase of $50.00, making his salary at the rate of $750.00 per annum, and that this increase will date from the first of April last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward, herewith, a communication received by me from Mr. J.J. Moroney, teacher of the Chehalis Indian Day School, making application for an increase in salary, the letter speaks for itself.\n\nIf it were at all possible, I would respectfully recommend that Mr. Moroney receive an increase, as he is one of the most competent teachers in this Agency, and has the largest school attendance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nChetah's Reserve,\nSturgeon Mills, Oct.\nDec. 30, 1907\n\nDear Mr. Byrne,\n\nYou might bring before the Department the necessity of increasing my salary.\n\nI am now nearly six years with the Indians and during that time the price of living has more than doubled. The freight paid on provisions and the board have run into six dollars when I got up my winter supply of provisions. This fact together with the expenses incurred with two growing children makes my present salary totally inadequate. I understand that there are other teachers with schools not so large as mine, who are within easy reach of stores and transportation who are receiving a much greater salary than mine. In strict justice consideration should be given to the position of the teacher's place, and due allowance made. These teachers, of course, are not getting more than their due.\n\nI trust that you will place this matter before the Department as one needing urgent attention.\n\nI am, dear Mr. Byrne,\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.J. [Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG10, Volume 6387, File 806-1, part 1)\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nMr. J. J. Moroney, teacher of the Chehalis Indian Day School, has applied to Mr. Agent Byrne for an increase in salary. His application is on file hereunder.\n\nMr. Moroney has been in charge of this school since October 1st, 1916, the date on which it was opened. He began duties at a salary of $600.00 per annum, which was increased to $650.00 on July 1st, 1917, to $700.00 on April 1st, 1918, and to his present salary of $750.00 on April 1st, 1919. He has also received a bonus for the past two years at the rate of $150.00 per annum. His wife acts as field matron and is in receipt of $300.00 per annum for her services. A teacher's residence and school building were built there this summer.\n\nThis school has an enrolment of 37 children, with an average attendance of 24. The parents are interested in education and, therefore, the attendance is regular. Mr. Inspector Cairns states that Mr. Moroney is an excellent teacher, that the pupils have made good progress under his instruction and that he has won the confidence of the parents and children. He has an Australian teacher's certificate and has taught for 26 years. This is his sixth year in the employ of the Department.\n\nMr. Moroney bases his request on the increased cost of provisions and the expense incurred in having them brought to the school, which is in an out of the way place, and it is both difficult and expensive to bring in supplies.\n\nWe are paying salaries of $900.00 to several teachers.\nteachers in British Columbia, and Mr. Moroney is as competent and as well qualified as the teachers who receive the higher salary. Mr. Agent Byrne, who forwards his request, recommends that Mr. Moroney receive an increase.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG10, Volume 6387, File 806-1, part 1)\nOttawa, January 15, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant enclosing a communication from Mr. J. J. Moroney, teacher of the Okanagan Indian Day School, in which he applies for an increase in salary.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Moroney is now being paid a combined salary and bonus at the rate of $900.00 per annum and his wife receives $300.00 as matron and $150.00 bonus, a combined salary for Mr. and Mrs. Moroney of $1,350.00 per annum. It is considered that Mr. Moroney is being very fairly treated as regards salary, which compares favourably with that paid to the teachers in other Indian day schools. The Department, therefore, cannot make any further increase in his salary at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nOTTAWA, August 15th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram of the 12th instant, regarding the salary and bonus due Mr. J.

So I have never seen a doctor in the Reserve during my seven years among them, I cannot write from experience.\n\nNow the point of this is, that the fact that Mrs. Moroney receives a salary excludes me from receiving the maximum allowed to teachers. We have two children, one eleven the other seven who must receive some advanced education, I would certainly ask you to take this matter into your own consideration. It is a serious matter for a man to devote seven years of his life to such a work and suddenly get the impression that either the time and effort have been wasted or that his labor is not appreciated by his superiors.\n\nOur expenses here, merely to obtain food, are very great. In addition to the high price of food we have to pay two and a half dollars for boat hire every day. Last Christmas, we went for our provisions, and owing to the violence of the wind and the force of the rapids we could not get back and our expenses on that occasion to obtain forty dollars worth of supplies amounted to over dollars more had to return and stay at Starvation Creek. Even to obtain my mail it cost me about a dollar and a half. Also the Indians refuse to receive some little donation for their trouble.\n\nWhat difference we greatly in what we have now\u2014less money saved than when we endured the service, though we have lived very thriftily, and necessarily save in the matter of clothes. Whilst older employees of the government received substantial payment of amounts of wages, nothing was given to me, at any rate, though I always think that teachers of good standing who have such an intimate knowledge of these Indians, so myself should be regarded\nI must apologize for the length of this letter, but I have had experience of your sense of justice on a previous occasion, when you granted Mrs. Moroney's request for a new cottage, and I have been encouraged both by my Agent and by the Protector to write to you personally. In taking up this work, I did so at the earnest request of the priests as they were anxious to give the Indians a chance to have someone of experience to deal with them. It was not because I wrote off these efforts I made, but from a humanitarian and educational aspect, I have derived great profit from my work among them, and I trust that there has been some good effected by our stay among the Indians.\n\nAssuring you of my sincere regard,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

F. McKenzie,\nActing Assistant Deputy & Secretary.\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nThis accident has been a very serious loss to me. I have had to wait in Vancouver at great expense; have had to travel to N.Westminster at my own expense and pay for long distance calls over this unfortunate delay. Now it is asked that I declare solemnly that I lost the cheques, and am asked to provide two bondsmen who will indemnify the government for a loss for which I am in no way responsible. Should think that the ones should rest on those responsible for the loss of the cheques.\n\nI do not wish to injure anyone, but I must protest at the unfortunate delays\u2014a delay that has inflicted a serious pecuniary loss upon me. The salary is small enough to a man with a family in these hard times and it is truly a hardship when one has to incur such a heavy expense in collecting what should only entail the cost of registering a letter.\n\nThe correspondence on such matters be on file in the Indian Office will substantiate my statement given above.\n\nDwelling that the matter will be cleared up soon, and apologizing for my long but necessary statement.\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nJ.J. Moroney\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been requested to sign an affidavit and to provide bondsmen for salary and bonus due to me for June quarter. These cheques which had been lost somewhere were never received by me and I could not sign the document which refers to the cheques as being lost by me.\n\nAt the end of July I wrote to Mr. Agent Byrne informing him that I had received neither salary nor bonus for June quarter. He replied that he could not understand the matter but he expected that the cheques would turn up any day.\n\nOn August 13 or thereabouts I wrote again but received only a short reply that he could do nothing in the matter. Thereupon I went next day to New Westminster and talked the matter over, and he wired you that my cheques had not come. He received a reply that they had been forwarded with the other teachers' cheques. It was then remembered that a cheque had been sent to N. Westminster from Ottawa which should have been forwarded to Alert Bay, and it was thought that my cheques had been sent there. Later it was discovered that some record existed that the cheques had really come to N. Westminster but everything after that seems hazy.\n\nOn Aug. 23rd I swore to an affidavit that the cheques had never been received by me, but the wire to you from Agent Byrne seems to assert that I lost the cheques, whereby...\nDECLARATION.\n\nDOMINION OF CANADA,\nProvince of British Columbia,\nNew Westminster Indian Agency.\n\nI........Joseph John Moroney.......do solemnly declare that I did not receive Cheques Nos. 732 and 1705 for the sums of $187.50 and $45.00 respectively, being salary and bonus for June Quarter, 1921.\n\nTHAT I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true and having the same force and effect as if made under oath, and by virtue of the \"Canada Evidence Act\".

Am forwarding Moroney's declaration the above effect. Please send duplicates at once he needs the money.\"\n\nConfirming the above wire would say that on July the 15th a number of cheques reached this office together with a slip showing that Cheques Nos. 732 for the sum of $187.50 in favour of Mr. J.J. Moroney, June Quarter Salary, and in a separate envelope bonus cheque No. 1705 for the sum of $45.00 in his favour were received here. On the same date we also received cheques in favour of Rev. J. Duplanil, C.M.T., and one in favour of Mr. J. Vivian Lord, Principal of the Alert Bay Industrial School; the latter was forwarded to its destination by registered mail. About the same date all these cheques were sent out to the parties for whom they were intended but I regret to state that Mr. Moroney's have not been received to date.\n\nOwing to the scarcity of stamps and my absence from the office on that date these cheques were sent out and not registered so the Clerk informs me, hence it is difficult to trace the letter.\n\nThere are only two Post Offices between this office and Mr. Moroney's address, so a letter mailed here goes direct to Harrison Mille, where Mr. Moroney receives his mail. Under the circumstances I am really at a loss to know what has become of these cheques.\n\nI am forwarding, herewith, declaration made by Mr. Moroney.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Departmental Letter dated the 23rd inst., dealing with the loss of Mr. J. Moroney's salary and bonus cheques.\n\nIn reply would say that I saw Mr. Moroney and he refused to sign any bond of indemnity claiming that the cheques had never been received by him.\n\nI am really at a loss to know what to do in the matter, as it is doubtful if these cheques will be recovered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 9th, 1921.\n\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo in which you state that Mr. Moroney, whose salary and bonus cheques were lost, has refused to sign bonds of indemnity in connection with the issue of duplicate cheques. Mr. Moroney's refusal in the matter is, no doubt, due to a misunderstanding on his part of the obligations entailed by the execution of bonds of indemnity.\n\nThe action which he is requested to take is the course which is usual to follow in cases of this kind.\n\nKindly inform Mr. Moroney that by the execution of the bonds, as requested by the Department, he will not incur obligations other than that if the original cheques are found and cashed by him after he has received the duplicates, he will, of course, become responsible to the extent indicated by the bonds of indemnity, but if the cheques are found and cashed by a third person, Mr. Moroney will not be held accountable.\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B. C.\nThe two cheques which were lost namely; 732 for $187.50 and 1708 for $45.00 are still outstanding, and in all probability will never be found.

Of myself I do not wish to\nwrite as the reports are before you. My\nwife, however, has done even better\nwork than myself and the records\nof the dept. will show. The report of\nour probable disappointment has had\na very depressing effect on her, as the\neducation of our two girls has to a\ngreat extent to be neglected. Though\nboth are well advanced for their ages\nthe necessity of competition and the\nneed of association with children of their\nown ages are painfully brought home\nto us when we visit town for a month\nat midsummer.\n\nI would urgently ask that you would\nuse your great influence, and persuade\nby your feelings as a parent, to give us some relief. We have naturally tried to get some employment in the Sept. that would enable us to do justice to our two little daughters.\n\nMr. Carson, the Inspector, promised me faithfully to bring this matter before you in your recent visit to the west; but he informed me, the other day, that he had no opportunity of doing so. Both he and late Agent Mr. Peter Byrne, often spoke of doing something about the needs of our girls, and I believe men- tioned the fact in the testimonials I forwarded to the C.S. Commission with my application.\n\nIn conclusion, I beg you to do what you can to help us, as this caring anxiety about our children is more wearing than all our other duties.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nJ.J.

Should any vacancy occur in the future you will have an opportunity of applying and I shall be pleased to keep you in mind.

Moroney for an increase in salary for himself and his wife, as Teacher and Field Matron, respectively, at the Chehalis Indian Day School, I beg to state as follows:\n\nMr. Moroney receives a salary at the rate of $800 per annum as Teacher, plus bonus at the rate of $150 per annum. Besides, he receives $50 for Janitor services - a total of $1000. His salary was increased from $750 to $800 from the first of April last, on the recommendation of Mr. Inspector Cairns.\n\nMrs. Moroney performs the duties of Field Matron for the Chehalis Reserve. She receives salary at the rate of $480 per annum plus bonus during the present fiscal year of $94.48 - a total of $574.48. Together, they receive a combined salary of $1574.48. Besides, a teacher's residence is provided, consisting of four rooms.\n\nMr. Moroney has a High School Teacher's Certificate for Melbourne, Australia, Senior University Certificate, Adelaide, South Australia and Science Certificate, Sydney, Australia. He has had over 25 years' teaching experience, 7 years of which have been in Indian schools in British Columbia.\n\nThe highest salary we pay in B. C. is at the rate of $900 per annum for teachers having qualifications equal to at least Second Class Certificate. The Inspector states that Mr. Moroney is doing excellent work. We might increase his salary up to the highest allowed in B. C. viz.: $900 per annum, but I consider that he and his wife together are now receiving a good living rate of remuneration and a house to reside in.\n\nMr. Moroney's letter is attached herewith.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG10, Volume 6387, File 806-1, part 1)\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSir:\n\nHerewith I enclose a letter from Mr. J. J. Moroney, who has charge of the Indian Day School at Chehalis, B.C. He thinks that when we consider the length of service in our Indian work that he should be receiving the maximum salary for a teacher at an Indian Day School; viz., $900.00 per annum. This is the tenth year for Mr. Moroney, as teacher of an Indian School. He does excellent work in the classroom. The pupils under his tuition have made and are making rapid progress. Mr. Moroney has a teacher's certificate for the Australian Commonwealth. He has had about twenty-five years experience as a teacher. He is in excellent health and is about fifty years of age.\n\nConsidering all the facts of the case I have no hesitation in recommending to the Department careful consideration for the application of Mr. Moroney. I think that Mr. Moroney should receive an increase of $50.00 for the current year, at least.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Schools of B.C.\nChehalis Reserve,\nHarrison Mills, B.C.,\nAugust 1, 1923.\n\nR.H. Cairns, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Cairns:\n\nAs you are aware, we have been most anxious to get a change from Chehalis to another school where it would be possible to give our children a chance to attend school. During the last year or more, we have written to head-quarters and while the replies have been sympathetic, nothing has come of our representations.\n\nIt is not for me to enlarge upon our services, as our reports to the Department can be consulted, and as you can bear witness to my work now going on for the term of years. However, our children are of school age, and this year we shall probably lose one of them at a boarding school, as any further delay would be disastrous to her chances of obtaining any education worth while. As this will be a heavy drain upon our resources, I must ask your help in securing from the Department an increase of salary which will bring mine on a par with other teachers. I cannot see why I am not receiving $75.00 per month the same as teachers who are within easy reach of towns. Here we have to obtain our ordinary groceries costs us one third dollar a year. Last year, a visit to a dentist to have a tooth drawn cost me twenty-two dollars. Further the price of food in these country stores is nearly fifty per cent higher than in the city of Vancouver.\n\nI mention the facts stated above to give the Department some idea of what a great drain it will be upon us to send our daughter to a boarding school. The increased asked will be some aid towards solving the problem. At present I am receiving $800.00 per annum. The additional $100.00 is I think justly due after nine full years of service.\n\nI feel sure that I can rely on your support and I trust that the Department will see its way to help Mrs. Moroney and myself to provide for this absolute necessity. It will be a fearful wrench to us to have to separate ourselves from our child, but it must be done at any cost.\n\nWith kind regards from all,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(sgd) J.J. Moroney.\nOttawa, August 12, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your night letter of yesterday's date, recommending that Mr. Maroney, teacher of the Chehalis Indian Day School, be transferred to the Skwah School.

You are entitled to some arrears in salary - something less than $70. These arrears could not be paid without the formalities of an Order in Council, because of the time that has elapsed; and I consider the best method of dealing fairly in your case is to increase your salary by $50 a year or so earlier than such increase would have come to you in the natural course of events. Mr. Indian Agent Daunt is being informed that your salary as from the first of April, next, will be at the rate of $900 for the ten teaching months, plus any bonus allowed by law.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. J. Moroney, Esq.,\nChehalis Reserve,\nHarrison Mills, B. C.\nR. T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFor nearly ten years, I have been engaged as teacher in Indian Day Schools. On joining the Department in July, 1914 I was paid for the actual days the school was open during the September term. The understanding was that at the end of the school year I should be paid the balance to bring up the year's salary to $600.00. Several times I asked the Indian Agent, Mr. Peter Lyne, now deceased, to have this matter adjusted and he usually promised that he would take it up with the Department; he never did so. The change which has been introduced in the payment of teachers has brought this omission again to my mind and I should feel really obliged if you would give it consideration and have it settled.\n\nWhen taking up this work, I had the impression that by devoting myself to work among the Indians, by learning their languages, and by studying their ways, I should equip myself for a better position. I worked devotedly for seven years before asking for an Agency. Though not successful in attaining this object, I was not discouraged until lately; now it seems that my chances of promotion are very meager. I have two children who must receive education and I have had to part with one. She is now at the Nanaimo Convent. The other, almost ten, will also have to go. This is a great deprivation to myself and to Mrs. Moroney, and the expense involved is exceedingly great. I trust then, dear Mr. Ferrier, that you will not be unsympathetic to my request.\n\nAt all times Mrs. Moroney and I have done our best to improve the Indians, both children and adults. The education of the Indian children has been a very serious matter with me, and the reports of the Inspector will show that I have not been an unfaithful servant of the Department.\n\nShould you be able to help us in any way we shall be very grateful, indeed.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.J.

I have noted your remarks and the claims presented in the copy of Mr. Moroney's letter to you.\n\nIn reply I am pleased to state that the salary of Mr. Moroney, as from the last proximo, will be at the rate of $850 for ten teaching months, plus whatever bonus is allowed by law.\n\nWe are informing Mr. Moroney and Mr. Indian Agent Daunt accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Cairns, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\n402 Holden Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nChickalos Reserve,\nNarrow Mills, B.C.\nJuly 1st, 1925\n\nDear Mr. Durant:\n\nThe Chilliwack School is now vacant by the death of Mr. Grinnell. I should feel obliged if you could effect my transfer to that school from Chickalos.\n\nThe Department must know that we have been an isolated reserve for the last twelve years. I think that we should be given this school. At present we have to send our two children away to Kamloops to school at very great expense. This could be obviated by our being stationed at Chilliwack, as the school is not far from the Reserve. One child is in second year High School, the other in Entrance Class.\n\nOf course, it would not be feasible unless the change also carried with it Mrs. Morin's position, as after twelve long years in the service she is not\nwilling to sacrifice her position; nor could we afford it, as the salary of teacher is, as you know, small, and the intervals of pay- ment of same unnecessarily long.\n\nWe should be very grateful if you would bring our claim before the department, and urge this transfer for us. Dr. Scott in a letter to Mr. Moroney promised that he would do what he could when an occasion should arise; this time has now come when the promise can be carried out.\n\nTrusting that we shall be successful, with kindest regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.J. Moroney\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the appointment of a teacher to succeed the late Mr. W.H. Grimshaw, at the Skwah Indian Day School, and concerning which, I understand, you have already been communicated with by Mr. W.E. Bitchburn, Indian Commissioner.\n\nI should be glad to know at an early date what action has been taken in this direction. Mr. Moroney, the teacher at Chehalis, would very much like a transfer to Chilliwack, and as he has spent about twelve years in exceeding many of the way stations, he is really in a sense entitled to this consideration. The difficulty is, however, that Mrs. Moroney is Field Matron on the Chehalis Reserve, and at the moment no matroncy exists at Chilliwack. To transfer the Moroneys to Chilliwack would really be a financial loss, unless it were possible to open a matroncy there.\n\nI may say that this move would be a very good one. The Chilliwack Indians and more particularly those whose children attend the Skwah Day School, are a very polite lot indeed in every sense of the word, and a Field Matron of Mrs. Moroney's calibre would do more than anything else to straighten them up in their home life.\n\nI knew the Chehalis Reserve in 1912 and 1913, before the Moroneys went there, and a more drunken, debauched camp it would be hard to find; now all that is changed, and it is mainly attributable to the influence exerted by the teacher and matron over them. The Moroneys also have two children of school age, one of whom is attending High School, and it would mean a great deal to have the educational facilities offered by the City of Chilliwack at their door.\n\nWould it be possible, therefore, to transfer Mrs. Moroney's matroncy with her to Chilliwack, and to create a temporary matroncy at Chehalis until the end of the fiscal year, when the position might be made permanent? An early reply will be much appreciated, as it is necessary to have some definite action towards the appointment of a teacher before the end of the current month.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a communication received from Mr. Moroney, and which explains his position very clearly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O.W.

As to my educational qualifications, I passed through the higher grade at the National School of my home town in Quebec, where I subsequently took a college course with marked success. On coming to Canada I continued my studies and acquired thorough knowledge of the methods of teaching in the educational institutions. Previous to my coming to Canada I had four years' experience as assistant teacher in one of the National Schools.\n\nI am a married man with a wife and three children. She has a thorough knowledge of house-work, is a first-class dressmaker, has studied elocution and ballasthetics, is exceptional, industrious and patient and fully qualified to teach along these lines.\n\nIf appointed to the position I shall always be governed by your instructions and faithfully promise to discharge my duties in such a satisfactory manner as to gain the merit of your approbation.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour most obedient servant,\n\n(signed) J.J.

In this connection I beg to say that Inspector Barry has been advised of the department's wishes that he should notify Mr. Agent Daunt and arrange to have the latter accompany him to the school when it is being inspected.\n\nCharles C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, November 29th, 1932.\n\nSir,-\n\nWith reference to your 15/35861 of the 29th of July, last, enclosing Inspector Barry's report regarding his visit to the Chehalis Indian Day School on June 22nd, I beg to say that, following the receipt of this report, the teacher was written. He has replied at some length, stating the difficulties with which he has to contend on this reserve.\n\nWhen Mr. Inspector Barry next visits this school, he should notify Mr. Agent Daunt and arrange to have Mr. Daunt accompany him to the school when it is being inspected.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes.\nActing Secretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\nChehalis Indian Day School,\nHarrison Mills, B.C.\nAugust 23rd, 1932.\n\nI beg leave to acknowledge receipt of your communication of the 10th inst., having reference to a report made to the Department by Inspector Barry in connection with his visit to this school on June 22nd, last.\n\nFor your information I beg leave to point out that when Mr. Barry visited the Chehalis School in February 1931, he was very well satisfied with the progress of the Indian children. Indeed, he went so far as to say that they were good. They were \"good\" as far as the word can be employed in connection with the progress and development of Indian pupils. And this must have been so for verbal compliments are seldom bestowed by Inspectors on teachers. His report, no doubt, is still on file and we may have occasion to examine it and previous reports within the next three or four months.\n\nIt will be recalled that for two years previous to Mr. Barry's appointment there was no Inspector of Indian schools. Still Mr. Barry admitted that the children were efficient and doing well in their studies. Does it not then seem strange that as soon as the Inspector came on the job that I would have neglected my work. If such should be the insinuation behind the Inspector's report, I deny it and brand it as a colossal untruth. Teachers are just as honorable and truthful as are Inspectors, and many of them have much greater ability, a whole lot more practical experience and understand the mentality of the Indian child.\n\nComplaint is made according to your letter that I failed to carry out certain \"valuable suggestions\" and did not put into practice \"demonstration lessons\" which the Inspector explained in \"considerable detail.\" It is surely news to me that the Inspector made any suggestions at all, valuable or otherwise. It seemed to me to have been the other way about and that our method of imparting simple lessons to the children was looked upon by him with favor. I only wish he had made some good suggestions for we\ncan use them here to advantage. I just wonder what was the nature of the suggestions he had in mind?\n\nIt is quite true the Inspector gave three or four demonstration lessons, which I shall take the liberty to briefly explain: Stepping to the blackboard, Mr. Barry drew pictures of three chairs and asked the children what the pictures represented. Next he gave three or four examples in the combination of addition and subtraction\u2014very good lessons, too, but nothing that we had not learned in our infancy thirty years ago. This ended the demonstration lessons upon which so much stress has been laid. Both lessons did not take more than ten minutes. If this is what Mr. Barry calls \"considerable detail\", both words must have taken on a new sense of meaning in recent years.\n\nThe Inspector, I suppose, did not go to any pains in particular when making his report to explain how he tested out and came to the positive conclusion that the suggestions he claims to have made were not carried out by me. It is a tendency with people not to make explanations if they have some definite purpose in mind which they do not wish to convey. It might, therefore, be as well to clear up this point now. When Mr. Barry visited the school in June, there were three children present. The rest of them were out digging roots in the woods and picking berries in order to get something to eat. Two of the children are in the Infant Class and the other pupil in the Third Class. It is certain that the two Siwash urchins in the Infant Class were too young to understand anything except the very simplest and plainest language. The boy in the Third Reader was examined in two subjects\u2014he read six lines from a page of the Third Reader and made a few figures on a sheet of paper. This completed his examination. There were no questions of any kind asked him. Mr. Barry said, the boy was ready for the Fourth Reader. Now where do the valuable suggestions come in? They don't, for the very sound reason none were made.\n\nIn regard to the reading charts, the Inspector reports there are none on hand. This is serious, indeed, so serious that I am inclined to think that Mr. Barry has made a mistake in this connection and has got this school mixed up with some other school. There are eighteen charts in use here, supplied by Messrs. MacMillan Co., Toronto, several years ago. These charts or tablets measure 24 X 18 inches each, and are made of heavy cardboard. If you have any doubt about this I shall be glad to bundle them and send them by Express for your inspection.\nIt may be that these are not just the sort of charts Mr. Barry has reference to and that I misunderstood him. If such should be the case I am sorry and the sort of chart he has in mind ordered. True enough the charts we have on hand are old. In this school we take good care that the property of the Department is looked after with care, and nothing is ordered unless it is absolutely essential and can be used to advantage. But to say that there are not any charts in the school is a mistake.\n\nThere are no children in the world who are taught with so much care and given such consideration as are Indian children, and there are no other children in the world who respond so poorly. Every lesson is explained so thoroughly that a visitor to an Indian school might surmise the teacher was giving an exhibition of his or her skill. And this care, patience and thoroughness goes on every day, but alas, it goes for naught. Teachers may explain and expound and give the very best that is in them, but they can't be expected to bridge the void left by Nature in the Indian child's receptive brain. Memory they have not, and the germ of impulse of intelligence insofar as educational matters are concerned has not been born in them. There are a few exceptions, but the exceptions are so rare as to arouse and excite curiosity. But even in an Ape jungle exceptions will be found. The Indian child as well as the Indian adult admit they are not bright and that it is difficult for them to learn. And here we are dealing, as perhaps you know, with one of the lowest type of Indian, the very fungus of the Indian race. Lazy, shiftless, indolent, liar, all stomach and cunning. I wish Mr. Barry went among them with his suggestions. According to some of their own spokesman they intend to remain as they are. Civilization to them they state would mean taxation, and while the country supports their children at the Boarding Schools there is no valid reason for them to embrace civilization or go to any trouble to improve their condition.\n\nSchool does not worry either the young or the old\u2014it is the least of their worry. Of course if they did not have a school they would kick. With this attitude in mind and these notions held by most of the adults and imparted to the youngsters, don't you think in all fairness that it is quite a struggle for teachers to handle them. Very few people other than Indian Agents, realize the many things a teacher on an Indian reserve has to contend with, and if he does not understand them he may just as well get out. It is dubious if Mr. Barry has been long enough in the service of the Department to understand their weakness and mentality.\nNevertheless, the teacher is blamed for their imperfections, looked upon as a sort of rag, and put on the \"spot\" if an Indian child in his twilight stage of civilization does not answer some question he has either forgotten or never before heard.\n\nHere the average Indian child attends school for about five months in the school-year. It is not reasonable for Inspectors or for anyone else to expect that a child, even a white child can accomplish as much or absorb as much in five months as in ten months. We have on our Roll Book children who have only been to school four days in the Quarter, others ten days, twenty-five days and thirty-six days during the same period. When the Inspector comes along he does not take this important phase or relation into consideration when making his report to the Department, but it counts against the teacher when it should not.\n\nThere are several other things which dove-tail into our work and retards progress in the schools. Two instances among many will serve as examples at this time:\n\nSixty per cent of the poor devils here have T. R. in one complex form or another and many of them have other chronic ailments. About October they begin to spit and hawk, sneeze and splutter and this condition lasts throughout the winter and spring months. Then, too, their houses are just dreadful. Not alone are the houses dilapidated but they are also germ infested. This is not mentioned to arouse the sympathy of the Department to build them new houses, no, indeed, for they are well able to build their own houses and there is plenty of material on the reserve. But they will not build\u2014 for the reason that while this miserable appearance is kept up, they believe visitors and tourists to the reserve will have pity on them, and that the condition of their houses is proof to all and sundry how unjustly they are treated by the Department of Indian Affairs. It is a song with them. The worse feature about it is that visitors often believe it\u2014 until they are otherwise informed. You will appreciate that children living under such abnormal conditions, with health impaired and low, sluggish vitality, are not apt to be bright or very anxious to learn.\n\nI wish to thank you for your letter and appreciate the help you offer. I shall be always glad to carry out any instructions of my superiors. Though you may be very certain Mr. Barry will recommend my dismissal on his next visit. His last report is quite obvious.\nI am\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. W. Burns.\n\nJ. D.

The teacher here does not teach the children right. Children that has been going to school since he came here are not further advanced in class, but our children never learn pieces or songs, nor can't have concerts or holidays same as other Indian day scholars. All you hear at recess is Indian songs sung by the children. Furthermore the teacher's son told some of the boys here that his father would send him to high school, and the mayor also said that Mr. Wilson was going to be teaching school without high school education, and the matron here does not do any of what she ought to do. We want our children to learn right, and learn what other good chilcotin children learn. We want them taught their children, and we want them taught how to read and write, and we want them taught how to take care of the sick, and we want them taught how to take care of the house if anyone is sick.\n\nThe ladies,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG10, Volume 6387, File 806-1, part 1)\nOttawa, August 10th, 1932\n\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your No. 1-2 of the 30th ultimo, with reference to the teacher of the Chehalis Indian Day School. The Department is, also, in receipt of Inspector Barry's report regarding his inspection of that school on June 22nd, last.\n\nThe Department is not considering making any change in the teaching services at this school at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. O'M. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B. C.\nSIR:\u2014\n\nI have received a long letter from Mr. J.W. Burns, teacher upon the Chehalis Reserve, complaining of an inspection made by Mr. Barry, School Inspector, on the 22nd instant.\n\nI know nothing of the circumstances of the case, but I gather that Mr. Barry was most indignant that only three children were present at the School, and consider it only fair to point out to the Department that the Indians have to earn their living, and that the entire Band are away picking berries and taking part in the other seasonable work in the Fraser Valley. In this they compete with Indians from the surrounding Agencies, and our hands are full with these visitors until after hop-picking. If the Department wish to support Mr. Barry and have us keep the children off the Reserve to attend school, they must be prepared to issue steady relief to the parents in lieu of the wages they are prevented from earning. This view of the case is, of course, well known to anybody with any knowledge of Indians, but it is apparently beyond the experience of our School Inspector.\n\nThe Inspector further enquired what duties the Teacher performed upon the Reserve in addition to teaching, and upon being told that he watched the Relief and kept a general eye upon the conditions and happenings, Mr. Barry is said to have told him that these matters were not merely my duty and not for him to perform. Now I wish to point out that I have only one man besides myself to cover all the Reserve comprising the Agency, that the Agency is for the most part in a thickly settled area, and that there is no two week period in the year when we have not rentals or dues of some sort to collect, and if I cannot make use of officials resident on Reserves, I must ask the Department to furnish me with more staff. It in no way detracts from the efficiency of a teacher to attend to these local matters, in fact a teacher who controls the Indians of a Band is much more likely to successfully hold down the job than one whom the Indians discover has no standing or powers in the Agency.\n\nMr. Burns has always handled the Chehalis Indians well. If he goes, and the class of men who would appeal to Mr. Barry succeeds him,\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nhim, I must of necessity handle the Relief from here, which will cost a great deal more, as I cannot check up on it. The Indians will run wild, as they are remote from police control. I have already lost a first rate Teacher and Field Matron at Chilliwack, through the instance of this inexperienced man, and that is District which is swamped with outside Indians throughout the summer months. The Department are going to find this out in increased hospital charges and relief charges, to say nothing of our own increased travel expenses.\n\nI understand also that Mr. Barry was horrified to find that Mrs. Burns, the Field Matron, is not a hospital nurse. Surely the Department do not expect to obtain the services of an H.N. for $40.00 per month. Also is Mr. Barry inspecting all branches of the Service or is he supposed to confine his very limited intelligence to the Schools?\n\nI trust the Department will carefully weigh this man's reports before taking any action which may later be found not in the best interests of the Service.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O.N. Daunt\nIndian Agent\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith copy of a petition received at this office from the Chehalis Indians in the New Westminster Agency in regard to their school teacher. I have sent copy of this petition to Mr. Indian Agent Daunt, New Westminster. Perhaps the Department will be good enough to refer to the reports of Captain G.H.

I now wish to advise you that I have sent copy of your letter to Mr. Indian Agent Daunt at New Westminster so that he may know what your proposals are. I would request, however, that you write to Mr. Daunt directly as Indian Agent tendering your resignation at the end of June when the school closes for summer holidays. It is presumed that Mrs. Burns will leave with you. Perhaps I should point out that this Department could not guarantee in the circumstances to continue Mrs. Burns' services after June 30th at Chehalis as the Department may wish to place another married couple there to carry on the work. A copy of your letter of April 5th has also been forwarded to the Department at Ottawa for its present information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP/KD.\n\nChas. C. Perry,\nAsst.

Burns, Indian Day School Teacher at Chehalis, in which he states that as he is to be appointed to a more remunerative position in the service of the government, he begs leave to say that he intends to leave Chehalis about the middle of July, next, and trusts that the Inspector will have no objection to this arrangement and that he will carry on his present duties until the end of June when school closes for the summer holidays. A copy of the letter is sent herewith. Inspector Barry has replied to Mr. Burns' letter advising him that he has referred the matter to me. I have written to Mr. Burns and copy of my letter to him is sent herewith and will be self-explanatory.\n\nKindly advise me when you receive Mr. Burns' resignation and whether or not Mrs. Burns expects to be leaving also.

They are all on the Reserve this time of year, so should send their children. From May to December, most of them will be off at distant points, and the children will be with them, so it is difficult to see what a teacher can do with them.\n\nThey have also complained of the medicine furnished by the Department, and say it is half water.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O.N.

In connection with this report, I would refer you to official letter of November 28, 1932, and your reply of December 12, 1932.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC. C.

W. Burns, teacher of the Chehalis Indian Day School. Mr. Perry states that a copy of this letter has been forwarded to you, and, no doubt, you will report to the Department.\n\nWith regard to the teacher at this school, I would refer you to your letter of June 30, 1932, and official reply of August 10, 1932.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. O'N. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster,\nB. C.\nMore attention was given here last year (1933) to the cultivation of the soil than in previous years, and a fair crop of potatoes and vegetables was raised. Fish and game was plentiful during the winter months and there was no scarcity of food. Despite this, however, the usual urgent requests for relief were sent to the Indian Agent that the Band or the \"boys\" were in great distress. When moan wails and groans of this kind go through, they take every precaution I will not hear about them, knowing that I am much opposed to recommending relief when employment can be found, or when they quit their jobs or spend their earnings foolishly. I trust you'll be able to gather from the two following paragraphs whether this Band was entitled to more relief during the past winter than was given them. A few cases taken at random will serve as an example of what I mean:\n\nA member of the Band who had been away from the Reserve for the past seven years, last August quit his job at $4.00 a day and drew back wages to the amount of $300.00, and went picking hops with his wife and family for a dollar a day. He then returned to the Reserve and got one of the last three new houses just finished. He has now left the Reserve for his old job and won't again return for years, except on occasions when there are relief distributions. He has two children at St. Mary's Mission Residential School.\nSeveral members of the Band left here for the salmon fishing last June. One of them showed me a statement of his earnings for three weeks. It amounted to $529.00. The other five fishermen also made quite a sum, and all of them were back from the north in time to pick hops. The man who made the $529, bought guns and a mighty gramaphone, expensive clothing, while his wife bakes for the household in a stovepipe. Two of the other men - father and son drank the most of their's at Vancouver. The son had come out of the North Vancouver Indian Residential School where he had spent eight years.\n\nBefore the Indians had returned from the hopfields, I was asked by a logging contractor in the neighbourhood to send him five Indians to cut shinglebolts- the job he said would last all winter. I went round from one to another, but none of them wanted to work- not they. It was not worth while. Very soon the Government would no doubt issue Special Relief- $20. a head as it xxx had done the year before. Special Relief is the thing- very fashionable, indeed. It is no longer asked for, but demanded. In a short time it will develop into a racket and as the idea spreads and takes hold it will become a menace. The huge order given last year to this Band of cadgers has already complicated matters to some extent. Depending on a similar order this winter only a few of them cured any fish last fall for winter use as had been the custom in the past.\nThey have been in a sulky mood for sometime, chiefly about relief. They have pointed out time and again for the past two or three months that in the Lytton Agency the Indians get anything they require for the asking of it, such as clothes, shoes, twine for nets and even potatoes, besides monthly rations. True or otherwise this information has stirred up the passion of our Siwash warriors, and the fame and generosity of the Lytton Agency resounds heavenward from every lip, while our Agency has neither pull nor power with the Tyees at Ottawa. To show that they were in earnest in this matter Isaac Mack explained that his brother Enice Mack who lives on the Seabird Island Reserve, wrote not long since to the Lytton Agency for net twine and that he was supplied with six balls. Along with this he was given on request clothing, shoes and other things to the value of $26.00, and that he is also getting monthly rations. Numerous stories of this description have excited and raised the temper of our Band, and, you know it is quite interesting to deal with a horde of jealous Siwashe whose minds are regulated by the rise and fall of their stomachs.\n\nIt is noticed that the Indian Residential Schools in this section of British Columbia are turning out an exceptional class of young Indians, that is to say if indolence, laziness and uselessness can be said to be \"exceptional\", we have\na number of them here who have spent years at Residential Schools. When they return to the Reserves they are soft, fat and flabby. \"A fat boy\" as the Principal of an Indian School told me a few years ago, \"is a good advertisement for an Indian Boarding School,\" and so it is. But when they return to the Reserve they are lost. Day after day they stroll up and down in twos and threes with their hands thrust deep into their trousers pockets. When this exercise gets dull they take to football and visit other Reserves and relief camps to show their skill and how accomplished they are in this great pastime. Work or thoughts of work brings on giddiness, but that rarely happens for they seldom take any chances on going to work. Anything different can't be expected after spending eight, nine or ten years in comparative idleness with everything provided for them. Consequently when they come out they are like goldfish taken from a pond and exposed to the mercy of the sun. I am not referring to the \"boys\" here in particular, other Reserves have their \"walking boys\" too. Some of these fellows have learned shoemaking and carpentry, but nobody has ever seen them repair a shoe or drive a nail, and the art is soon forgotten like everything else they had been taught.\n\nThe girls are not a whit different. Their houses are dirty and untidy. Still they have qualifications worthy of mention, which is costing the Department substantial sums annually. I am\nreferring in this instance to the numerous letters they write to M. D. for all sorts of medicine: wintergreen, camphor, eucalyptus and anything else they can swallow or rub into themselves, not because they want it, but because its free and obtained for the asking. Of course this is not the sort of report the School Inspector would likely send you in regard to the braves the Residential Schools are turning out year after year, but some inspectors are very, very ignorant and are nothing more than floating ornaments and knew next to nothing about Indians. But here on the different Reserves we see them as they actually live, they are just clowns. There should be only one Residential School in the whole of British Columbia, one where Indian orphans would be taken care of.\n\nIn regard to relief: when there is a Special Relief issue they sit down and eat and eat and held high festival until its gone and not a tap of work is done. In order to remedy this abuse they should be put to work on the Reserve and earn the amount they are to receive in relief. In this way a certain amount of improvements can be made, and I feel sure if the Department desire that something like this might be done, it will be done.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nCANADA\n\nOffice of Inspector of Schools,\nP.O.Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAssistant Indian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nApril 6, 1934.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith a letter which I have received this morning from Mr. J.W. Burns, teacher at Chehalis Indian Day School, together with my reply.\n\nI do not understand from Mr. Burns' letter just what action, if any, he has taken to inform the Department of Indian Affairs of his intention to resign his position of teacher at Chehalis. In the ordinary way this teacher should have sent forward his resignation to the Department through Mr. Indian Agent Daunt at New Westminster. The matter is further complicated through the fact that Mrs. Burns is acting as Field Matron at Chehalis, and no mention is made of her intention to resign.\n\nI have therefore to request that you will take any steps you consider necessary in this case.\n\nYou will recall that I reported unfavourably on this school twice, and that since then there has been at least one letter of complaint from the local Indians.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Daunt informed me some time ago when we met in Chilliwack that there had been complaints from the Indians with regard to Mr. Burns' teaching. At that time I asked him to inform the Department of Indian Affairs of these complaints, and I need hardly say that I am very glad indeed to hear that Mr. Burns is being moved from this school, as nothing could possibly be done to advance the education of the local Indians till a properly qualified teacher was placed at Chehalis.\n\nAs I am leaving for the Ross early in May, and till then my time is very fully occupied with inspection itineraries to Alert Bay, and the West Coast, an inspection could be made of the Day School at Chehalis still near the end of June, and it would seem to me to be far better to allow this teacher to relinquish his appointment without further inspection. I shall however make a note of the necessity of carrying out an inspection at Chehalis early in the next school year, when a new teacher has taken up the work there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGerald H.

Mr. Perry has also forwarded copy of his communication to you of the 7th instant.\n\nPlease advise the Department as soon as you receive Mr. Burns' resignation.

Barry, District Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C., has received from Mr. J.W. Burns, Teacher of the Chehalis Indian Day School, New Westminster Agency, who announces his intention to vacate his position as Indian Day School Teacher at Chehalis at the end of June, next, when the school closes for summer holidays. Although Mr. Burns has not mentioned his wife who is Field Matron at Chehalis Reserve, it is presumed that it will be expected that Mrs. Burns' services will also terminate otherwise there appears a possibility of difficulty arising with regard to accommodating another married couple whose services may be engaged by the Department to carry on the work at Chehalis. It is my opinion that the resignation of Mr. Burns should be accepted as there is considerable indication that his services have not been all that could be desired.\n\nI have requested Mr. Burns to write to Mr. Indian Agent Daunt making formal resignation through the Indian Agent and asking him to make the situation clear to Mr. Daunt as to the position of Mrs. Burns. Mr. Daunt will report in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas. C. Perry,\nAsst.

Sir:\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 27th of May regarding the teacher of the Chehalis Indian Day School, the Department is now in receipt of Inspector Barry's report regarding his inspection of the school on the 15th ultimo. For your information, I quote from Mr. Barry's report as follows:\n\n\"I am glad to be able to report that the teacher, Mr. Burns, appears to have made an attempt to follow out the suggestions made to him at my last inspection here, June 13th, 1935. While he is not a trained teacher, and the children do not make the same progress as they might with a modern highly trained instructor, he is rendering good service to the Department in a variety of ways. He is certainly not afraid of the local Indians as he will not give in to their, at times, foolish requests to loan money, etc., but they are making an effort to have him removed. Mrs. Burns appears to me to be a fine type of woman as Field Matron. I would therefore ask the Department to write the Chief of these Indians a very stiff letter and request that their children attend school regularly, and that the Indians cease their foolish efforts to get rid of a Teacher and of a Field Matron who have given splendid service to the Indians and their children.\"\n\nThe Department does not intend to make any change in the teaching services at this school during the coming academic year and we would appreciate any assistance you can give in having the Indians send their children to school regularly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. M. Patterson, O.M.I.,\nMission City,\nB.C.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF INSPECTOR G. H. BARRY ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE CHEHALIS INDIAN DAY SCHOOL. (Date of Inspection June 18, 1936).\n\n- Original on No. 153-12-1 -\n\nNAME OF TEACHER: Mr. J. W. Burns. Age 45.\n\nThe teacher has made and in fact is making an attempt to follow out all suggestions made at my inspections. The number of children attending the school is small, but the teacher and Mrs. Burns, the Field Matron, are I feel certain doing very good work here.\n\nThe Indians have tried in the past to borrow money from Mr. Burns he tells me, and on being refused have attempted to get rid of this teacher.\n\nWhile I was carrying out my inspection a letter was placed in my boat which I found on my return to the launch to start for Harrison Hot Springs. The Indian concerned asked the launchman to give the letter to me, but did not have the courage to wait to speak to me. Possibly the best thing I could do with this particular letter would be to destroy it, as it appears to have been sent to me by the man who was refused a loan of money some time ago. I am copying it into this report and attaching the original for the information of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nI am not relying to it myself, and would ask the Department to take any action they think best. This report will be I hope a sufficient answer to the charges made in the Indians' letter. If the children attended school regularly the progress would of course be more rapid, but I am satisfied that the teacher is doing his best here.\n\nCOPY OF LETTER LEFT IN LAUNCH.\n\nChehalis, Harrison Mills, B.C., March 28/36.\n\nOn March 5th last a general meeting of our Chehalis Band with their Reserve Council was held. It was unanimously agreed to apply to the Indian Department for a change of teacher for our Indian Day School for the following reasons:\n\nThe children attending school will do so only under compulsion as the claim that their teacher is not giving them proper attention during school hours.\n\nThe parents are sure that these children should make more progress in their school than they have been making.\n\nThe parents are also certain that their children are not taught as they should be covering the subject of each grade thoroughly, before promotion to a higher grade.\n\nAs this teacher has been here for over ten years we do think he can change his method to suit us.\n\nThe Indians of our band are quite willing and anxious to do their part in educating their children, but we are asking the Department to give us a capable Instructor who will take a deeper interest in the progress of our children and our own welfare.\n\n(over)\nSeveral times we wrote to the Department but we have not received any reply to our letters. We spoke about the matter when Dr. Stone was here. We would be very glad if a reply is forwarded to our Chief in acknowledgment. Chief Michael Peter\n\nPer Wm. A. Harris.\n\nIn conclusion I may say that Mr. Burns exercises good control in his school, and that I am pleased with the progress of the school during the past year. The general standing of the school may be classified as \"Satisfactory\".\n\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF MR. INSPECTOR BARRY DATED JUNE 18, 1936, ACCOMPANYING THE ABOVE REPORT.\n\nI am glad to be able to report that the teacher, Mr. Burns, appears to have made an attempt to follow out the suggestions made to him at my last inspection here, June 13th, 1935. While he is not a trained teacher, and the children do not make the same progress as they might with a modern highly trained instructor, he is rendering good service to the Department in a variety of ways. He is certainly not afraid of the local Indians, as he will not give in to their, at times, foolish requests to loan money, etc., they are making an effort to have him removed. Mrs. Burns appears to me to be a fine type of woman as Field Matron. I would therefore ask the Department to write the Chief of these Indians a very stiff letter and request that the children attend school regularly, and that the Indians cease their foolish effort to get rid of a Teacher and of a Field Matron who have given splendid service to the Indians and their children.\n\nMr. Burns asked me to try to get him a transfer to another Indian Day School. In my reply I pointed out that nominations for such positions as may be vacant lie in the hands of the Roman Catholic Church, and that it is to the Authorities of that Church he should apply. I would, however, ask the Department to keep Mr. Burns' request in mind should there be a suitable opening for a Teacher and field matron. The Department is I believe aware of the good services rendered during the ten years or so that Mr. Burns has been at Cheballa.\nOttawa, June 4th, 1936.\n\nRev.

The information contained in that letter has been carefully noted.\n\nYou might discuss the matter with Inspector Barry when he next visits the school and, if you consider it necessary, you should again report to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. O'N. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nSIR:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated the 9th instant, File No.155-12-1, enclosing a communication from the Chehalis Indians, requesting a change in school teachers.\n\nIn this connection, Inspector Barry will be visiting the School some time next month, and I will take the matter up with him.\n\nI may say that on the occasion of the last inspection I accompanied Mr. Barry, who expressed himself pleased with the general conduct of the School, particularly taking into consideration the difficulties under which Mr. Burns labours.\n\nThe Chehalis Indians move out when the rhubarb appears at the end of April, and are rarely back before November. This means that most of the children have only the Winter months at School, and if the Winter happens to be inclement, even this brief period is considerably curtailed. Under these circumstances I fail to see how the Indians can expect a teacher to do more than Mr. Burns has been doing with the School.\n\nAs a matter of fact I think the real cause of the petition is that I have been frowning on the practice of admitting children from Reserves with a Day School to our Residential Schools, as we are unable to find space in these Institutions for all those children without educational facilities at their homes. The Indians would like to shelve the responsibility of the upkeep of their families onto us, and as long as they have a Day School on the Reserve, they find it difficult to do so.\n\nI am returning the communication you forwarded to me.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O.M.

Please let me have a report regarding this letter, and, when replying, you should return it for our file.\n\nIn connection with this teacher, I might refer you to official letters of April 5th and April 17th, 1934, and your reply of April 23rd, 1934. Inspector Barry's last visit to this school was in June, 1935, at which time he stated that satisfactory work was being done. It is quite possible that Mr. Barry will be visiting this school in the near future.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nEncl.\n\nA. O'N.

Burns, teacher of the Chehalis Indian Day School.\n\nCareful consideration has been given to the contents of your letter, and it has been decided to allow Mr. Burns to continue at Chehalis for the academic year 1934-35.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. O'H. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster,\nB. C.\nSIR:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters of April 5th and 17th, respectively, File No.153-12-1, in connection with Mr. J.W. Burns, teacher at the Chehalis Indian Day School.\n\nUnder date of April 9th, I also received from Mr. Perry, Assistant Commissioner, a copy of a letter addressed by Mr. Burns to Mr. Barry, School Inspector, in which he resigned his position as teacher from the 30th of June. Mr. Perry informed me that he had written to Mr. Burns telling him to submit his resignation through this office, and instructed me to report to him when I received it.\n\nAs I had no reply from Mr. Burns I wrote again on April 16th, and have today received the attached letter. I am sending you the original, as Mr. Perry appears to have passed the matter on without waiting for it, and I am sending him a copy.\n\nYou will note Mr. Burns wishes to cancel his resignation if possible. As this is a matter altogether outside my province, I leave it entirely to the Department.\n\nI would, however, point out that this man has had a very unpleasant position for nine years. The Reserve is isolated in so far as there is no road system out of it and he is entirely dependent upon the Indian boat transportation. There are no Whites for society, so he and his family are completely marooned in the midst of rather unpleasant Indians. He has consistently done his duty towards the Department as he saw it, and it is only fair to him to say that I think he looked after Departmental interests well. It is certain, after the inspection made by Doctor A.L. McQuarrie, Medical Superintendent, and myself, that the Indians did not suffer from want, although they were not allowed to run riot with our charity.\n\nMr. Burns is also blamed for the tightening up on the drug expenditure at Agassiz and the prohibition of promiscuous calls on the doctor. As an employee of the Department, I hold that any information he thinks of interest it is his duty to pass on.\n\nSo far as his qualifications as a teacher are concerned, this is a matter for the School Inspector. I would like to point out, however, that these Indians are away from the Reserve from May to December and no teacher can therefore do very much with them. When Mr. Inspector Pragnell visited the Reserve with me on November 26th,1932, we found only five children there, but these five thoroughly understood their work as far as they went. This would seem to imply\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG10, Volume 6387, File 806-1, part 1)\nthat Mr. Burns is not such a poor teacher, if given a chance.\n\nThe attitude of these Indians is no doubt partly influenced by the presence in the District of four Government Relief Camps, the inhabitants of which fish along the river and come in contact with the Indians. These men live splendidly on a higher scale than most taxpayers, have their clothes and tobacco found for them and $7.50 per month in cash. This, with plenty of leisure to play around fishing is a poor example to the local Indians, who would very much like to have the same treatment. There are, of course, a number of exceptions of local Indians who are educated, encouraged on by firebrands such as Mrs. Richard Felix Joe, William Harris and a few more, the whole Band soon becomes rebellious and unappreciative of the services they are receiving. When Indians are in that frame of mind, it is a mistake to cater to them, as they will not be satisfied, but keep pressing for more all the time.\n\nI would, therefore, recommend to the consideration of the Department closing the School for a year or two anyway to bring the Indians to their senses; otherwise, any teacher appointed will be up against the same thing.\n\nThe Pemberton Indians with a membership of about 320 have been asking for a school for years. They have 78 children of school age of whom 54 are taken care of in St. Mary's Mission Residential School leaving 44 on the Reserve without educational facilities. The Chehalis School and Cottage need repairing and it is possible that the cost of these would fit up temporary premises at Pemberton if the Department were inclined to transfer the teacher provided such accommodation could be found. We badly need a Field Matron at Pemberton also, as it is over sixty miles from the nearest doctor. It would be much better policy to endeavour to place a teacher and Field Matron at Pemberton than to carry on the Chehalis School either with Mr. Burns or a new teacher.\n\nI am very sorry for the Burns family. They have had a difficult time and will have a more difficult one if he loses his position, as it is not easy for a man getting on in years to obtain work these times. They have four young children, two of whom they have had to send outside to educate, so I do not think they have much money saved to face the world with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O'N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\nChehalis Indian Reserve,\nHarrison Mills, B.C.\nApril 19th, 1934.\n\nA.O.M. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letters of April 9th and 16th in which you inform me that Mr. Perry, the Assistant Commissioner, desires my resignation, originally submitted to Mr. Barry, School Inspector, to be turned in through you, I wish to say that I would like to recall that resignation if possible.\n\nAt the time I wrote it, I was feeling very badly at the attitude of the Indians and I was under the impression that another position was available. I find now that this is not the case and as I have a young family, it is a serious matter to be without work.\n\nIn connection with all this trouble, I would like to say, that the Indians blame me for the action of the Department in putting a check on their medical expenditures at the Agassiz Drug Store, and in calling the Doctor to the Reserve. I have of course never had anything to do with this, as the whole matter was raised and handled without my knowledge.\n\nThey also blame me for not giving them wide open Relief and point out that on the Chilliwack Reserves everyone is getting Relief. I know nothing of what conditions may be like at Chilliwack but I do know that Mrs. Burns as Field Matron will not recommend Relief where it is not needed and I will not recommend Relief where young men quit work to come home and loaf.\n\nI am also suspected of keeping the Agent posted on Reserve affairs, but I think this is part of my duty as an employee of the Department. The Indians do not like having any official who has been long enough with them to know them thoroughly, for then they cannot put anything over.\n\nAn Indian on the Reserve has told me that what they would really like is to have the school closed down, as they think that the Department would then be forced to take their children and place them at Mission to be fed, and clothed. They do not realize of course that Mission is up to strength and there is no room there for more pupils.\n\nWith the removal of the Field Matron also, there would be no drug supply on the Reserve and they think that they would then be entitled to call the Doctor whenever they wish and get all the drug store medicines they want. As it costs I think $20.00 every time the Doctor comes to the Reserve and there is a great difference in\nin the cost between Departmentally purchased drugs and local prices, this would cost the Department a great deal of money.\n\nThis Reserve has always been a wild one as it is difficult of access and the Indians are pretty much left alone. My crime with the Indians has not been my teaching, but the suspicion that I am responsible for them not receiving more Relief and other disciplinary measures. Anything I have done has been in the interests of the Department whose employee I am and in accordance with my duty, so I submit that the Department should protect me now.\n\nAs I said before the care of my family will be a serious matter if I lose my position, but to be candid, I think the Indians should not get a new teacher. I do think I could do useful work for the Department on some other Reserve, where the children attend school regularly enough to learn something. At Chehalis they are mostly away from May to December, so no matter what a teacher's qualifications may be, he has no proper chance with them. I have always tried to see that they thoroughly understood what they did learn and in this I think Mr. Inspector Pragnell will bear me out.\n\nI would respectfully request that I may be given a chance on some other Reserve, if there is no such opening I am willing to face it out, but I would be very glad to have the opportunity of a transfer.\n\nI would also add that the old custom of the teacher and Field Matron on the Reserves taking an active part in relief issues, because of their intimate knowledge of conditions, which while absolutely correct and economical from the Department's point of view, has been the real cause of all this trouble and I would ask that in future the Reserve officials be relieved of this. It will cost the Department more money and work hardship on many cases who need temporary assistance but it will keep the Teachers and Field Matrons clear of much trouble. This particularly in our area where there are four Government Relief Camps, the inhabitants of which the Indians meet and listen to.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This letter will be self-explanatory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.

In the ordinary way this teacher should have sent forward his resignation to the Department through Mr. Indian Agent Daunt at New Westminster. The matter is further complicated through the fact that Mrs. Burns is acting as Field Matron at Chehalis, and no mention is made of her intention to resign.\n\nI have therefore to request that you will take any steps you consider necessary in this case.\n\nYou will recall that I reported unfavourably on this school twice, and that since then there has been at least one letter of complaint from the local Indians.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Daunt informed me some time ago when we met in Chilliwack that there had been complaints from the Indians with regard to Mr. Burns' teaching. At that time I asked him to inform the Department of Indian Affairs of any such complaints. I need hardly say that I am very glad indeed to hear that Mr. Burns is being moved from this school, as nothing could possibly be done to advance the education of the local Indians till a properly qualified teacher was placed at Chehalis.\n\nAs I am leaving for the Nass early in May, and till then my time is very fully occupied with inspection itineraries to Alert Bay, and the West Coast, no inspection could be made of the Day School at Chehalis till near the end of June, and it would seem to me to be far better to allow this teacher to relinquish his appointment without further inspection. I shall however make a note of the necessity of carrying out an inspection at Chehalis early in the next school year, when a new teacher has taken up the work there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H.

Now he has to have two at least live with friends in Chilliwack to attend school there. A small boy is ready for school next September and the cost of the board for these children takes a large part of his salary.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nExtract from Inspector Barry's letter to Major MacKay dated April 9, 1941.\n\nMr. Burns has been here for the past sixteen years and I should like to see him given a transfer to another school, if possible to the Skwah Indian Day School near Chilliwack should the teacher there be moved at the end of the academic year.\n\nIt is important that Mr. Burns be placed where he can have his young children educated. At the moment several of his children are boarding in Chilliwack to attend school there and the expense is considerable.\n\nMr. Burns is neither a trained or certificated teacher nor does he understand modern methods. He has done his best to follow out the main points of method suggested during a number of inspections. He does understand the Indian viewpoint and has done much for the local Indian people outside his work in the actual classroom. He would be well qualified to improve the existing state of things on the Skwah Indian Reserve, and would, I believe, be a success there. He is anxious for such a transfer, particularly to a place where Mrs. Burns could be a Field Matron.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 18, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt has been decided to increase the salary of Mr. J.

(RG10, Volume 6387, File 806-1, part 1)\nThe following is an extract from the Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31st, 1941, from Mr. J. W. Burns, Teacher of the Chehalis Indian Day School, Harrison Mills, B.C.:\n\nOriginal Report on 1941-1P-British Columbia.\n\nQues. What community work is done by the teacher - apart from regular school work - Give details?\n\nAns. Fifteen years ago this reserve was one of the toughest and most degraded, down-at-the-heal reserves in British Columbia. Today it is one of the best regulated in the Province. No drinking, morals fairly good, 15 out of 24 houses compare favourably with the houses of whites throughout the Fraser Valley in regard to cleanliness and furniture. The old Indian customs and way of life are finished here. Indian basketry should be discouraged - it has made slaves of their women and children, ruined their health and encouraged laziness in their men-folk. Here the so called \"Art\" is passing out rapidly. Basketry work of Indian women who have T.B. should be disinfected as the cedar strands are pulled through the mouth of the basket maker.\n\nQues. Do the parents show interest in the education of their children?\n\nAns. None. They have no appreciation for anything they do not pay for. Indian schools will always be a sort of joke with the average indian until he pays for their up-keep.\n\nQues. Is mid-day meal served?\n\nAns. No. Indian children are better fed here than white children. It will pay the Indian to remain a parasite while he is hand-fed by the Department. We do not want the \"midday-meal\" racket started here.\n\nQues. Is there a regularly appointed janitor, and if so, state name?\n\nAns. No janitor. Here, we dispensed with janitor service at the outbreak of war. The boys do the work.\n\nNOTE: They are not interested one way or another in the war. They refused point blank to contribute as little as one cent toward the war effort, though several of them are earning from $1200 to $2000 a year.\nNEW WESTMINSTER, B.C.\nNovember 2nd, 1942.\n\nSir:\n\nNo Teachers being available for the Chehalis and Katzie Indian Day Schools, these have not operated during the month. It is to be hoped that a Teacher will be found for, at any rate, the Chehalis Day School, as there would be a good attendance there, most of the Indians having work in Logging Camps within reach of the Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nA.

These are all in fair repair, except Katzie. This latter School has been closed for two years, and most of the windows were broken by boys. We boarded them all up, so no further damage is possible. The roof is also in poor condition, and we stopped actual leaks with such material as was on hand. The desks were all shipped to Skeena Agency in January. Both Chehalis and Skwah Schools should be painted and redecorated, but it is impossible to interest people in submitting tenders at the present time. When there is more work available in the cities and towns than can be attended to, no workmen are anxious to go out in the country on jobs. The buildings will really come to no harm until after the war, but they should certainly be attended to them.\n\nA. O'N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON NEW WESTMINSTER AGENCY FOR THE YEAR ENDING 1944-45.\n\nSchools: Three Day Schools have been operated throughout the year, viz: Pemberton, Chehalis and Skwah. The fourth school at Katzie Reserve has remained closed, and the desks have been shipped to the Skeen Agency.\n\nA. O'N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\nChehalis Indian Day School: This school is in charge of Mr. J.M. Goettler, who previously taught at the Kamloops Residential School. This school has done very well during the year. Out of twenty-four pupils on the register an average attendance of about eighteen was maintained. The teacher is popular with the Indians. Most of the men of this Reserve are continually away logging at points as far distant as Texada Island, but they are getting away from the Indian habit of taking the whole family with them when they leave home, and as a result their children are receiving an education.\n\nA. O'N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nApril 13th, 1945.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nYour File No. 215-9-57.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter, dated April 12th, enclosing a copy of the School Inspector's report on the Chehalis Indian Day School.\n\nSo far as Home Economics and Industrial Arts are concerned, as well as Social Studies, Health, Science, etc., I do not know how far Mr. Goettler is qualified to impart knowledge in this respect. He is, however, a good old time teacher, who is bringing the children along in a very satisfactory manner otherwise, and we are lucky to have him at the present time.\n\nRegarding the medical examination of the pupils, we are dependent upon the services of Doctor W.H. Craig, of Agassiz, who is not on a regular salary, but is paid by the visit, for each of which, to Chehalis, a fee of $12.00, is allowed. He is a very busy man, and will not go in there, except for some urgent call. I would suggest, that if the Travelling Nurse can be spared from her recruiting duties for Coqualeetza Hospital, she should be sent in to check up on these children.\n\nA.O.N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\nApril 16, 1945.\n\nA. O'N. Daunt, Esq., Indian Agent, New Westminster, B.C.\n\nYour File 1-8-D\n\nReplying to your letter of April 13th, 1945 re Chehalis Indian Day School, I would advise that the Inspector of Schools pointed out in his report of the 23rd ultimo that the teacher, Mr. Goettler stresses fundamentals. A great deal of educational water has flowed under the bridge since he first commenced his teaching career and it is felt that he should be encouraged to keep abreast of modern pedagogies. It is unfortunate that the attitude of some persons employed in our schools is that procedures common in rural schools thirty or forty years ago are good enough and they will exert no particular effort to keep themselves in touch with present day trends which tend to make the work far more interesting to the pupils than the old-fashioned methods. In any event the Department is anxious to promote the teaching of Home Economics, Industrial Arts, etc., in our schools.\n\nIn respect to medical examination of the pupils I would point out that a recent departmental circular calls attention to the necessity of vaccination and no doubt the usual check up was given the children at that time. It is possible Doctor Barelay would wish to have his T.B. tests applied at the same time and may wish to secure Nurse Gerry's services for the job. She could not, of course, vaccinate without Dr. Craig's instructions, nor could she properly take the place of the Doctor in making an examination of the pupils. As the Reserve is situated about one hundred miles from Vancouver there would be little difference in actual cost of visitation by the doctor or the nurse. Your further advice will be appreciated.\n\nFor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nTo whom it may concern:\n\nThis is to certify that Mr. J.M. Goettlet, Teacher at the Chehalis Indian Day School, was a patient under my care from April 9th./45 to the 13th./45. This patient had very bad teeth with pyorrhoea. Under general anaesthetic total extraction of teeth was done in the Chilliwack Hospital by his Dentist, Dr. J.A. Barber.\n\nDated at Chilliwack, B.C., this 24th day of April, 1945.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Saskatoon\nOct. 1, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Gillett,\n\nI must apologize for not writing sooner, but I really haven't been in a position to do so. The night before Mrs. Gillett was leaving, I was stricken with a bladder condition, and was rushed to Mission Hospital. The Dr. there Dr. McCure wouldn't touch the case and advised the services of Dr. Woods, specialist of Medical Dental Bldg., Vancouver, who performed an operation. After leaving hospital I came on back, and contracted a \"flu,\" and am now under care of Drs. Campbell & Myers of the Avenue Bldg., Saskatoon. In fact this is the first morning I have been down town.\n\nAccording to the Dr.'s verdict I should not do anything for a couple of months.\nIn view of this I am mailing you the keys to Chehalis.\n\nAs there never urge but a few days in Sept. I hope after my service of three years you will be able to grant me sick leave for Sept. at least.\n\nHave you anything that would be suitable for me say at the beginning of the year?\n\nIn order not to keep Chehalis closed if you can get a teacher you may accept this as a resignation.\n\nWith kind regards to Mrs. Gillatt and Miss Dyne, I am,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Goettler, Teacher of the Chehalis Indian Day School.\n\nI cannot understand Mr. Goettler's attitude in not notifying us before this date of his illness.\n\nI saw him on the 17th of August at Chehalis Reserve, and he definitely stated he would re-open the School on the 4th of September. Not having heard anything to the contrary, I assumed he opened it, hence the reason I reported in my report that Mr. Goettler resumed duties in September.\n\nMr. Goettler's remarks on sick leave and resignation will be noted. I have written him to give us a definite resignation, and also not to cash his cheque if it is received until further advised.\n\nMrs. Goettler left Chehalis Indian Reserve on the 30th of August.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEncl.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am forwarding Mr. Indian Agent Gillett's letter of October 5th and letter dated October 1st from Mr. J.M. Goettler, from which it will be noted that due to illness he was unable to open the Chehalis Indian Day School on September 4th and will not be able to resume teaching for some time. In order that we may secure a replacement I would recommend that Mr. Goettler's resignation be accepted and that such period of sick leave as is permissible under regulations be approved for Mr. Goettler in view of his length of service with the Department. In the event that sick leave for the entire month of September cannot be approved the Agent will be asked to secure from Mr. Goettler his salary cheque for the month which will no doubt have been forwarded to him.\n\nFor D.

Langdale as a replacement for Mrs. Green and notes that she has had no elementary teaching experience in Canada. We have had considerable difficulty in the past with teachers holding English certificates in that they do not seem able to adapt themselves to teaching Indians. I would hesitate to recommend that Miss Langdale be classified as a Grade 3 teacher but would suggest that she only be classified as a Grade 2 teacher until she has met the following qualifications:\n\n(a) Attended the British Columbia Department of Education Summer School and taken at least two courses there preferably in primary and elementary teaching techniques.\n\n(b) Had one satisfactory inspection report from Major Davey.\n\nOur experience has been that it is very difficult to down-grade a teacher from Grade 3 to Grade 2.\n\nBernard Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n| Central Registry | P.A. or B.F. | Date | Initial | Reference to | For Remarks | Initial | Date |\n|-----------------|-------------|------|---------|--------------|-------------|---------|------|\n|                 |             |      |         |              |             |         |      |\n|                 |             |      |         |              |             |         |      |\n|                 |             |      |         |              |             |         |      |\n\n(If purpose for which referred cannot be expressed on one line, add minute to file, and enter here \"With Minute\")\n\nDO NOT WRITE BELOW THIS LINE\n\nIndian Affairs.

Burns, Esq.,\nTeacher, Chehalis Indian Day School,\nHarrison Mills, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Burns:\n\nI wish to thank you and your wife for the kindness that I received from you during my visit of March 6th. When I engaged these boys to take me over in their boat I had no idea of providing them with meals. However, they seemed to understand the ways of the country and made themselves very much at home.\n\nIn the matter of school supplies, I hope you will leave nothing undone so that the Readers and other books will be immediately ready for use. May I say that it would be well for you to keep a fairly good supply of school material on hand. As soon as your school material arrives kindly let me know. I recommended that twelve single desks in due time be sent to this school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.H. Cairns,\nInspector of Indian Schools of British Columbia.\nApril 19, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, enclosing a requisition for school material and desks for the use of the Chehalis Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that an order has been forwarded to the Government Stationery Office to send to the teacher's address the classroom supplies considered necessary, with the exception of the slates. You may purchase and have delivered 12 slates.\n\nThe teacher has also asked that kalsomine be supplied, as he states the school needs kalsomining. You may purchase the quantity required for the purpose.\n\nRelative to the 12 single desks and teacher's desk required to replace the old double desks now in use, I beg to say that the Department will approve of the supplying of the number of single desks and the teacher's desk asked for, also a teacher's chair, if same is required. It will be necessary for you to obtain competitive prices for the supplying of the desks, and you should request the following firms to quote a price F.O.B. the nearest freight or shipping office to the school:\n\nJ. D. Meekison, Esq.,\n1142 Homer St.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nTait Pipe & Foundry Co. Ltd.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nClarke & Stuart Co.

Parnell, Esq.,\n829 Powell St.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nPlease place the order with the firm quoting the lowest price. You should see that the right sizes are supplied to meet the requirements.\n\nAfter the desks have been delivered, you should forward vouchers, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred, also accounts covering the cost of the slates and kalsomine.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\nEXTRACT FROM ANNUAL REPORT OF MR. J. W. BURNS,\nTEACHER, CHEHALIS INDIAN DAY SCHOOL, FOR\nTHE FISCAL YEAR ENDING MARCH 31, 1927.\n\nThe building is in good condition, but it\nneeds to be reshingled and painted.\n\nThere is no garden conducted in connection with\nthe school, but the people would appreciate one.\nA suitable garden could be cleared and fenced for\nabout $150. I believe a garden in connection with\nthe school would be remunerative in many ways.\nThe men are good and reliable workers when employed\nby others, but at home otherwise. The soil is\nfairly good; but very little clearing has been done.\nThe population of the Reserve is 110.\nOttawa, May 30th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nThe teacher of the Chehalis Indian Day School, in his report for the year ending March 31st, last, states that the school building requires to be reshingled and painted. He also states that there is no garden conducted in connection with the school, but that the people would appreciate one and it would be remunerative in many ways. He further states that it would be necessary to have some ground cleared and fenced for the purpose.\n\nPlease forward a report regarding the work required to the school building, also state whether you would recommend that gardening operations be conducted at this school. The cost involved in any repairs and painting to the school building and the fencing of a garden should be stated. In connection with the garden, it is considered that it would, no doubt, be too late this season to carry on this work, but consideration might be given to the preparing of a suitable garden plot for this activity next summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to inform you that again this year Field Matron M.H. Burns, of the Chahalis Indian Reserve, New Westminster Agency, reported that there is a great shortage of water in the wells at the school and the teacher's residence and as a result of this I wrote to Mrs. Burns asking whether or not the problem could be solved if the wells were dug some feet deeper and if so, to forward a tender for the work.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Dunnt, of New Westminster, has now reported that an Indian named Edward Leon will dig the well five feet deeper and box it in for the sum of $30.00. The Agent has recommended that a pump should be installed in this well which will cost approximately a further $20.00. I respectfully ask, therefore, that authority be given to have the well dug and a pump purchased and installed. Mr. Burns, the school teacher, does not consider it necessary to have two wells at present as during the season when water is short, the children can obtain it from the teacher's residence.\n\nWill you kindly give this matter your serious consideration and let me have a reply at as early a date as possible?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOffice of the NEW WESTMINSTER, B.C., Indian Agency,\n\nAugust 7th, 1929\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 244, amounting to $18.87 in favour of National Drug and Chemical Co., Ltd., VANCOUVER, B.C., for Drugs supplied to Chehalis Indian Day School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. dated\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O.N.

The Department is already acquainted with the fact that the cottage is in a bad state of repair. There are several leaks in the roof and unless it is put into condition before the rains of winter set in the plaster will fall off in the affected spots and stained by seeping rain water in other places.\n\nThe School roof leaks so badly along the south side of the building and about the chimney that during the heavy rains of a couple of weeks ago, I had to make repairs of a temporary nature so that the walls and floor would not be spoiled or stained.\n\nA new woodshed is needed, but all I require to make one is a couple of thousand feet of third grade boards for the roof. The walls would be constructed of logs and this would be of no expense to The Department.\n\nIf The Department would be so good as to supply material to the value of about $45.00, I believe the School, cottage and woodshed could be put into such order of repair that no further expenditure would be necessary for three or four years. At present prices a lot of material can be got for the sum asked for. There is a good deal of work attached to this, but I'm willing to co-operate and do the best I can if The Dept. will only supply the material. I have already done a lot of work about the place that I have not even mentioned: gates and hinges. An underground pipe system to carry water from the house. A few months ago I had a growth of young scrub trees cut down and removed that endangered both the cottage and School.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. W. Burns\n\nA. O'N. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent, New Westminster, B.C.\nSIR:-\n\nI beg to forward you herewith a Requisition received from Mr. J.W. Burns, Teacher of the Chehalis Indian Day School, requesting that kalsomine and lumber to the amount of approximately $45.00 be supplied for repairs to the School and Cottage at that Reserve.\n\nIf the necessary articles are supplied, Mr. Burns is willing to do the work himself, and the request appears very reasonable. I would, therefore, recommend that authority be given to expend this amount as indicated.\n\nIt is probable that not more than $35.00 will be spent, but I should like authority for an additional $10.00 to cover emergencies.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O'N. Daunt.\nIndian Agent.\n\nEncs.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 18, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, enclosing a communication which you received from the teacher of the Chehalis Indian Day School requesting that kalsomine and lumber to the amount of approximately $45 be supplied for repairs to the school building and cottage.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of you incurring an expenditure not exceeding the above amount in the purchase of the materials as mentioned in the teacher's letter. If a reduction in this amount can be made, I shall be pleased if you will do so. It is noted that the teacher will perform the labour without cost to the Department.\n\nPlease forward an itemized account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the material.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

PERRY, ASSISTANT INDIAN COMMISSIONER, DATED DECEMBER 12, 1932.\n\n---\n\nOn the 28th of November, we proceeded by motor boat to the Chehalis Reserve, and I inspected the day school there, which is under the charge of Mr. Burns.\n\nThe roof of this school leaks, particularly towards the chimney end, and this, despite the fact that everything possible has been done to try to patch it, the Indians having done good work on the roof. However, I believe that the roof is rotten all over, probably not having originally been properly built to withstand the constant downpour of rain. The only satisfactory remedy is to entirely relay the roof. If left much longer, the plaster in the interior will come down.\n\nI also visited the teacher's residence, where Mrs. Burns, the field matron, was confined to the house with Flu. Everything was neat and tidy, but this roof, too, needs renewal.\nOttawa, December 30, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Perry, Assistant Indian Commissioner, has forwarded the report of Mr. Inspector Pragnell on his recent inspection of the Chehalis Indian Day School. The Inspector draws attention particularly to the condition of the roof of the school and teacher's residence. He states that the roof leaks, especially towards the chimney end, despite the fact that everything possible has been done to try to patch it. He is of the opinion that the roof was probably not properly built to withstand the constant downpour of rain and that the only satisfactory remedy is to entirely relay it, as, if left much longer, the plaster in the interior will come down. He reports, further, that the roof of the teacher's residence needs renewing.\n\nI have to request that you will have a thorough examination made of the roof of the two buildings and report regarding the repairs or work considered necessary to place these buildings in a satisfactory condition. You should state in detail the work required, the approximate cost of any material necessary and the labour in this connection. Our funds are extremely limited, but, if the cost involved is not too high, it is possible that the amount can be provided. Please state at which time of the year you would recommend that the repairs be carried out, if authorized. The Department will expect to hear from you in the near future regarding the above matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. O'H.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA.O'N Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nOttawa, July 3, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received the report of Mr. Inspector Barry on his recent inspection of the Chehalis Indian Day School. The Inspector states that rain makes its way down the brick chimney and then soaks through the bricks into the plaster of the inside of the schoolroom; also that the stove pipes, although new last year, are rusted. He states that it is suggested by the teacher and yourself that, to remedy this condition, a galvanized chimney cap is required.\n\nI would, therefore, request that you arrange to have a galvanized chimney cap installed on the chimney. This should not cost more than approximately $4.\n\nThe Inspector also states that the foundation post under one corner of the schoolroom needs renewing. Please have new posts installed.\n\nAn order will be placed here to supply three pieces blackboard, each 6' x 3'. The Inspector states that these pieces will fit into the mounts of the present old black oilcloth boards. When the blackboard arrives, you should arrange to have it installed in the classroom.\n\nPlease forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the above authorized expenditure.\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. O'N. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nChehalis Indian Day School,\nHarrison Mills, B.C.\nJune 19th, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhen Captain Barry and yourself visited this school on the 13th instant, among other things discussed was the wretched condition of the roof of the school and the chimney, also, how the foundation of one end of the building slipped slightly during the heavy snow of last December.\n\nSince you were here I had Mr. McRea (the carpenter who is building the new houses for Indians here) go over the building and report upon its condition. Below is quoted what he said in this connection:\n\n\"It would be necessary\", said Mr. McRea, \"to take the chimney down as far as the roof, re-build it and put on proper flashing and a hood (galvanized cap). I would not advise the doing of this work unless the roof is re-shingled as the old shingles are rotten. If the building is not re-shingled before next winter the plaster and kalsomine will be ruined\".\n\nAt my request he has submitted an estimate of the cost of repairing the building which covers the labor and supplying the material laid down at Chehalis and comes to $188.00 made up as follows:\n\nRepairing foundations of school and cottage ... $10.00\n26 M shingles ... $78.00\nNails ... $5.00\nFreight (truck and scow) ... $13.00\nScaffling ... $10.00\nLabor (which includes re-building chimney) ... $70.00\nHauling material to site of building ... $2.00 $188.00\n\nMr. McRea said that he would repair foundations of school and cottage and put a cap and flashing on the school chimney for $20.00 in case the Department is not prepared to re-shingle the school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA. O'N. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6387, File 806-5, part 1)\nSIR:-\n\nWhen at the Chehalis Indian Day School, with School Inspector Barry, on the 13th instant, this official requested me to obtain quotations on repairs to the School house, which appeared to be necessary.\n\nAs we happen to have, at the moment, a fore-man carpenter engaged in building some houses on the Reserve, I instructed the teacher to have him submit figures in this connection.\n\nI am enclosing herewith, a letter from Mr. J.W. Burns, the teacher, giving Mr. McRea's estimate for the work, and which appears to be reasonable. You will note that Mr. McRea will repair the foundations of the cottage and school, and put a cap and flashing on the school chimney, in case the Department are unable to undertake the expense of re-shingling, at a cost of $20.00.\n\nAs Mr. McRea will have finished the work he is now engaged on, within a few days, and will have left the Reserve, I would appreciate the favour of your instructions by wire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O.N.

I enclose an encumbrance certificate, authorizing an expenditure to the above amount.\n\nYou may utilize the services of the foreman-carpenter at present engaged in building some houses on the reserve.

Please obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of all material and prepare accounts, in triplicate, for the labour employed. The number of days or hours employed and the rate paid should be definitely stated. Please state, on each copy of the account or voucher, that the expenditure was incurred under authority of E. R.

The material, freight to Chehalis and labor would cost about $55.00. I am enclosing an estimate of the material required and the price quoted for same by Mr. A. S.

Burns, teacher at the Chehalis Indian Day school, in which he requests that a porch may be placed across a portion of the cottage front, and screened with mosquito wire.\n\nI can vouch from experience as to the Chehalis mosquitoes, and would most strongly recommend that if it is at all possible to do so, that this request be granted.\n\nLife at Chehalis for the teacher and his wife, is at best a dismal affair, as it is totally isolated from white society, and anything to make their lot easier is only their due.\n\nAttached also is an estimate of the cost, from A.S. Nichol, the local Hardware store etc. at Agassiz, and which shows that any amount of approximately $55.00, would cover these improvements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O.N.

Only the necessary furniture should be secured and if at all possible the amount expended should be less than the authorization contained in this letter.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nNow that a nomination for the Chehalis Indian Day School has been submitted to the Department, the question of furnishings for the teacher's residence should be considered.\n\nFurnishings and equipment similar to that supplied for use in the teacher's residence at Pemberton, at an approximate cost of $250.00 would fully meet our requirements at Chehalis, and I would recommend that such expenditure be approved. A copy of Mr. Indian Agent Daunt's letter of the 11th instant on the subject is enclosed.\n\nAs it is the intention to open the Chehalis Indian Day School early in January, a reply by airmail would be appreciated.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been informed by Captain G.H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools, that there is a possibility of a teacher being appointed to the Chehalis Indian Day School in the near future.\n\nIf this is so, I would draw your attention to the fact that there are no furnishings of any kind in the Teacher's Cottage at that Reserve. I would suggest, therefore, that similar action be taken to that of Pemberton, and the bare necessities supplied to be kept on charge as Government stocks.\n\nAt Chehalis however, there are two bedrooms, while we only had one to consider at Pemberton, and I presume, therefore, that additional bedroom furniture should be supplied to cover the needs of the second room.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.O.N.

(RG 10, Volume 6387, File 806-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nChehalis Indian Day School,\nHarrison Mills, B.C.\nJune 27th, 1942.\n\nNew Westminster Agency,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch:\n\nI beg to request that the Department make every possible effort to supply the school equipment applied for in the attached requisitions.\n\nThere are at present only twelve suitable school desks in the school-room. The remainder are small, dilapidated double seated, old style desks which are very unsatisfactory.\n\nI have needed, during the past six months, seating capacity for thirty-three pupils at one time. The indications are that the next school term will call for upwards of forty desks. The present school equipment is entirely inadequate for even half this number. It will therefore be necessary, under these conditions, to refuse entry to new pupils or to try to work under difficulties that will be almost impossible.\n\nIt is very desirable that provision be made for opportunity to teach different forms of hand-work in the grades. This would necessitate the construction of a work-shop. An addition to the present school building could be made and equipment installed; woodworking tools and supplies. The boys should be taught to handle tools and apply their dexterity in problems related to home life and community activities. Such instruction is needed perhaps more in Indian Schools than anywhere else. The girls should be taught spinning and related activities. All we need is space and equipment. I therefore urge that ways and means to securing these be considered. I will supply drawings for necessary buildings and do all possible towards improving educational facilities for the Indians here.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\nTeacher.\nSIR:\n\nI beg to forward you a Requisition for School Material received from Mr. F. S. Morrison, teacher at the Chehalis Indian Day School.\n\nAt the present time, and quite probably for the next three or four years, the Chehalis Indians have employment in various Logging operations within reach of the Reserve. This means that the families are living home, and school attendance high. As things are, therefore, Mr. Morrison has more pupils than the school desks adequately accommodate. He also has an opportunity to do good work in the manual training line.\n\nIn giving consideration to the matter, it should be remembered that just as soon as local employment slacks off, the Indians will follow their work, and school attendance will again drop to former levels.\n\nI explained this to Mr. Morrison, but he is a new broom, and I think takes entire credit for the increased attendance.\n\nThere is no question that for the next two or three years, and possibly a little more, attendance at this school will warrant increased furniture and facilities; but I am quite sure that the Indians, trained loggers as they are, will follow work of this nature wherever it is to be found, rather than settle down upon the Reserve, when local logging operations cease. When they do so, the school attendance will drop sharply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEncl. The Secretary, Indian Agent,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 8, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, enclosing requisition for school supplies for the Chehalis Indian Day School.\n\nI am not exactly aware if you can obtain desks in British Columbia, but recently we had a request for equipment of this nature for a school in Ontario, and, on taking up the matter with the Purchasing Branch, it was found that it was necessary to obtain a priority, due to the fact that in the manufacture of school desks a certain amount of metal is used. Under the circumstances the Department decided not to supply the new desks for the Ontario school. In view of this decision, it is difficult for me to authorize new desks for the Chehalis School.\n\nI have also noted your remarks regarding the possibility of the increased attendance at this school only lasting temporarily. Would it not be possible to make some other arrangements for seating the pupils for whom no desks are now available?\n\nYou may purchase, for use at this school,\n\n- 6 gallons grey floor paint,\n- 1 5-inch brush,\n- 1 paper towel cabinet,\n- 1 door mat,\n- 4 panes window glass,\n- 10 lbs. soap powder,\n- 1 ordinary alarm clock,\n- 6 pkgs. paper towels,\n- 2 pails,\n\nThe blackboard, blackboard paint, compass, desk bell and athletic equipment will be secured here and sent to the teacher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. A.

On reviewing your purchase order No. 2990 A of December 30, 1941, I note that you stated that the cost of the furnishings would be $248.93, plus baling, delivery etc. The account attached from McLennan, McFeely & Prior reads: \"Prepaid freight on goods shipped January 7 and January 14\". The letter of the firm dated March 17 is confusing because they distinctly state in the letter that in the case of freight they can supply receipts. Consequently if the statement made on their account is correct there is no reason why a receipt should not be forwarded. Present regulations do not permit our paying freight bills without a receipt.\n\nThe firm's letter of March 17 mentioned above refers particularly to cartage. If the charge which they are now wishing us to pay covered cartage their account should read in that manner. It would be appreciated if you would interview the firm and submit a voucher if you consider there is any further amount due to them.\n\nR.A.

We wish to point out that no interior decorating has been attempted for the past several years, and as both buildings are dark and dingy, it is recommended that the work be proceeded with during the summer holidays.\n\nThe amounts as stated on the requisitions will be sufficient to cover the paint and material, and it is requested that a further sum of $75.00 be granted to cover the labour costs.\n\nMaterial $91.89\nLabour - approx $75.00\n$166.89\n\nJ.

Gillett with regard to the site, method of construction, etc., is enclosed together with quotation from National All-Steel Buildings Limited on the erection of a Quonset building, 24 x 42, with full cement basement in accordance with their plan attached.

The first step in the construction of any School is the location of water. Have you had a well dug, and if so, with what success? We have not dug a well but there will be no difficulty in getting a water supply from the \"Indian reserve ground.\" The Indians receive theirs from a hand pump.\n\n10. Normally we do not provide one and two room Day Schools with electricity or running water unless hydro is available in the immediate vicinity of the school.

I left the resolution for a meeting which the Chief promised he would call on May 9th, hence the reason the resolution reads \"in the absence of the Indian Agent\". I take it this is in order.\n\nIt will be necessary to have the two acre school lot cleared. This will take approximately $1000.00 for bulldozing and burning brush and stumps.

Cowell\nIndian Superintendent\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to draw your attention to an anomaly existing at Cowichan by the action of the Government in allowing a money grant for a Methodist day School at Cowichan, called the Romanes School. The Catholic Priest stationed there applied repeatedly for a grant, and this application was first made before the Methodist clergyman came to the place; but they were refused. I will not complain of this refusal, but there ought not to be a Methodist School there at all, because there is not a single Methodist Indian in that vicinity.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6387, File 807-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES CANADA\nvicinity, as you know, there are several little tribes or villages they called respectively the Quamichans, the Somnus, the Clametlats, the Hornykams, the Koksilahs, and the Kempsains. All these live within a radius of about two miles and are designated in general as the Cowichans. A priest has been working among them for over thirty-five years, and they are all Catholics, many of them good, some bad and some indifferent, like elsewhere; but they know no other religion. I hope the grant will be withdrawn because it cannot be for the good of the Indians to have different denominations at work in the same field. May I take the liberty of pointing out to the Department that, in my opinion...\nOpinion, whatever trouble has arisen in regard to grants for Indian day schools, is owing to the change that was made in the regulation determining the amount of payment allowed to the teachers. Formerly teachers were paid in proportion to the number of pupils in their school within certain limits, and the result was that schools were established only where they were really needed, i.e., where there was a sufficient number of children of school age. Now the fixed sum of $500, a considerable amount, is paid as a minimum to every teacher, no matter what may be the number of his pupils, and the result is that you have schools with an average attendance of half a dozen pupils or even less. Every minister out of employment finds here a chance to make a living, if he can manage to obtain a grant. It makes\nPractically no difference to him whether\nthe attendance be large or small,\nwhether it increase or diminish,\nprovided he can keep the school\ngoing. It is easy to see that the\nformer arrangement was much more\neconomical for the government and\nat the same time more beneficial\nto the Indians, as it prevented the\nopening of schools in little corners\nwhere the attendance must always\nremain ridiculously small, and\nencouraged the teachers of any school\nin operation to endeavor, even if\nonly for his own interest, to increase\nthe attendance by making the\nschool as useful and attractive as\npossible. I beg in conclusion\nto express my high appreciation\nof the fairness and impartiality\nwith which the Indian Office\nHere, as far as I have been able to observe, treats all matters pertaining to the advancement of civilization and morality among the Indians.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. R. Lemmens\n\nBp. of Vancouver\nCowichan Agency,\nIndian Office,\nQuamichan, B.C., 1896\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 42, herewith enclosing copy of letter from His Lordship Bishop Strachan, with reference to Indian Day-School in Cowichan and I most endorse His Lordship's statement and application for renewal of School Grant for said School near Quamichan, having been forwarded to your office before any Methodist Teacher came here; (i.e. May 28, 1896). Shortly afterwards the Rev. Mr. Spencer opened a day school in the Sonnenos village.\n\nNo application for Government Assistance had been made through my office, and it was some time before I learnt that it had been granted.\n\nI have nothing today against the personnel of the Methodist Teachers in the Agency as all appear earnest in their endeavor to do good for the Indians but suggest with His Lordship in questioning the good results that can occur by different denominations working in the same field.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.T. Thomas,\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6387, File 807-1, part 1)\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to enclose copy of a letter dated 23rd June 1896, received from His Lordship Bishop Lemmens (R.C.) in reference to day schools in this superintendency, more particularly at Cowichan.\n\nIn connection with the statement made by His Lordship as to the fact that application was first made by the Roman Catholic authorities for a school at Somenos, before the Methodist clergyman came to that place, I beg to refer you to the following application made by the Roman Catholics, viz:-\n\nLetter from Rev. C. C. VanCoethen, dated May 5th 1896 sent to the Department on the 8th of May 1896 under cover of letter No. 52. S.2.\n\nIn\n\nThe Deputy Supt. General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIn the Estimates for 1895-'96 from this office provision was made for three day schools in the Cowichan Agency, viz:- Songhees, Cowichan and Nanaimo. The Songhees school is under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church as during the past has been the school at Cowichan, or, as might be more particularly designated, Somenos. The school at Nanaimo had sometimes been carried on by the Church of England and sometimes by the Methodist Missionary Society; at present it is being conducted by the latter.\n\nIn view of the above His Lordship Bishop Lemmens feels aggrieved that the school at Somenos should have been handed over to the Methodists.\n\nAt the time that Mr. Tate's letter of June 28th, 1895 - sent to the Department under cover of official letter of July 5th, 1895, No. 20. O.2. - was received, the Somenos school, which had formerly been carried on by the Roman Catholic Church, was closed.\nclosed and had been some time previous to that date; and it appeared from tenor of Mr. Tait's letter that the Indians were desirous that the Methodist Missionary Society should establish a school there. From Mr. Lomas' reports on the subject, dated respectively 6th. and 11th. instant, copies of which are herein enclosed, it now seems that the Indians desire that the school at Somenos should be conducted by the Roman Catholic Authorities.\n\nIn regard to what His Lordship says about granting the fixed sum of $300.00 as the minimum allowance for every day school approved of by the Department, I have no doubt but if the old style of paying in proportion to the number of pupils attending was in force there would be less schools carried on and may be those under such circumstances established, might be more satisfactorily carried on. I would also state that of late since the introduction of Industrial and Boarding schools throughout the Superintendency there is less chance of the Indian children\nchildren, who may be found in small numbers in certain localities, being deprived of all chance of education were the restrictions suggested by His Lordship placed upon the maintenance of day schools, as children so situated are, when possible, drafted to the Industrial and Boarding schools above mentioned.\n\nI may also state that from the experience gained by those engaged in that work it has been found that but little advantage in the way of education is gained by the Indian children at day schools owing to the frequent and unavoidable interruptions in the course of their training caused by their parents being obliged to move from place to place at different seasons in pursuit of the means of support, etc., on which occasions they must, of necessity, take their children with them.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour Ob'dt. Servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, B. C.\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6387, File 807-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant enclosing copy of a letter from His Lordship, Bishop Larmen, in reference to Indian day schools in your Superintendency, more particularly at Cowichan; and in reply I beg to say that upon reference to the Estimates, it is found that provision was made for only one Roman Catholic school in Cowichan Agency, the Sanghoon School. The two other schools provided for were put down as Methodist. Your original Estimates do not show the denominations of the schools in this Agency. And it was only in your Estimates for this year that you made mention of a second Roman Catholic school. For some years the Estimates have provided for one Roman Catholic and two Protestant schools in this Agency and the sketches enclosed with your Letter of the 19th June 1926 showing the position of Indian schools on Reserves in the Cowichan Agency, designate these schools as above described.\n\nWhen the application for the opening of the school (N.C.) at Simon's was received, reference was made to the Estimates and as only one R.C. School, the Sanghoon, was provided for, you were advised that no funds for opening another were available; but the application for the Methodist school was allowed, as a grant for two Protestant schools had been made, and as the Department was aware that the Church of England school at Nanaimo had been closed.\n\nA.W. Vowell, Esq:\nIndian Superintendent,\nVictoria, B.C.\nThe Department regrets that any misunderstanding of\nthe true situation has occurred. The Department having lost sight\nof this School it not having been in operation since 1890.\n\nThe quarterly returns received from this new school\nshow that it has a fair average attendance.\n\nThe Estimates for Day schools in B.C. have been con-\nsiderably reduced since 1894-5 and the grant made for schools\nnot in operation has been withdrawn. Formerly the Department has\nhad funds at its disposal from which payments for such unfore-\nseen contingencies as the present could be made, but no more than\nthe actual requirements can be provided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt: Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\n(Copy)\n\nPrivate.\n\nCowichan, B. C.\n\nSeptember 10th. 1897.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFor your information and that of Mr. Superintendent Vowell, and to facilitate the endorsement of my application here enclosed, I take the liberty of giving you privately the reasons in support of my fourth application for a Government grant in aid of my Cowichan Indian day School.\n\n1st. I made an application in aid of the Cowichan Indian day School in the early months of 1895, before the establishment by any other Minister of a day school was ever thought of. Since then my application was renewed twice.\n\n(See Cowichan Office: 687. F. Supt's Office:114. S.2.)\n\n2nd. An application in aid of the Somenos day school was favorably received and a grant obtained, though the application was made after my first one had been forwarded to\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6387, File 807-1, part 1)\n(2)\n\nto the Indian Department, and though in answer to my application the Department contended in its reply refusing a grant that \"no funds were available for that purpose\".\n\n(See Cow. Office, 464. G. Supt's Office 114. S.2.)\n\n3rd. The Cowichan Indians protested publicly against the Government support of a teacher at the Somenos day school, contending it to be against the Regulations of the Department to be forced to abide with a teacher of a different faith than their own R. C. belief. They claimed their right in Resolutions to that effect forwarded by you to the Indian Department.\n\n4th. There is no call for a day school at Somenos, as the school is altogether inefficient, owing to the following causes:\n\nA. The Indians ask for teacher of their own faith to teach their children.\n\nB. The school is too far away from any Cowichan Reservation with the exception of the Somenos Reserve which cannot produce 5 Indian children of school age.\n\nMy\nMy assertion as to the inefficiency of the school is proven by the school's own returns.\n\n5th. The Cowichan Indian School is but a short distance from and in the centre of the Quamichan, Tlimtlmlolits, Komiaken and Genipson reservations, which contain the largest majority of Indians.\n\n6th. All the Indians of Cowichan professing any Christian religion belong to the Roman Catholic Faith.\n\n7th. The Catholic Cowichan Mission is the most deserving as for more than 40 continuous years it has sacrificed labour, time and money to civilize the Cowichan Indians.\n\n8th. The Cowichan Indian Day School has now been teaching for more than 2 years without any aid whatsoever, and with a larger attendance than any Indian school in Cowichan.\n\nYou will oblige me, Dear Sir, by forwarding this letter to Mr. Superintendent Vowell; he as well as you see the justice of my claim to a grant, and kindly endorse my application with a strong recommendation. In this hope, and with many thanks for past favors.\n\nI remain, Dear Sir,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) Geo. Chas. VanGoethem.\n\nW. H. Lomas Esq.\nDuncan's, B.

Father Van Goethem to Mr. Lomas dated 16th instant, and \"Copy\" of a Private letter from the Rev. Father to Mr. Lomas of same date explaining his reasons for renewing his application for a grant for the Indian Day School at Quamichan.\n\nI beg to add that this question was disposed of for the fiscal year last past in your letters dated 18th May 1896 and 1st August 1896.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Superintendent\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nI have the honour of forwarding, for the consideration of the Department, a statement in regard to the attendance at my Indian School during the term just elapsed.\n\nThe School I am now teaching at has been open for a period of two years and a half in succession without interruption. At present pupils are taught from 9 to 12 o'clock a.m., and from 6 to 9 o'clock p.m., on all working days, Saturdays excepted. Some of the boys attending in the morning, present themselves also in the evening. As soon as a Government grant in aid of my school will be forthcoming, a teacher will obtained and pupils will be taught.\nwill be taught morning, afternoon and evening. Being unable to support a hired teacher myself, I can possibly not teach 9 hours a day. From experience I learned that more profit is reaped by the pupils from the evening school than from the dayschool and therefore I preferred teaching in the evening rather than in the afternoon.\n\nThere are 59 names on the school register, with an average attendance of 26 pupils. This average was higher during the first part of the term; the cause of the decrease lies in the fact that during the term an opposition school has been opened on the Shuswap Indian Reservation situated about one mile and a half from my school. It is not now the occasion to enter into details concerning many irregularities connected with the removal of the Somers teacher to the Shuswap Indian Reservation, and I hope that a simple protest will suffice. I trust the Indian...\nthe Indian Department with true justice and in consideration of the many services rendered by our Mission in Cowichan during more than forty years, will not think it proper to support by a grant an opposition school in so close proximity of our School; and furthermore, I hope that the grant so often applied for, will not be refused my school on that account.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeo. B. Vancoothen\n\nW. H. Lomas Esq.,\nQuamichan B.C.\nI have the honour to submit hereewith for your consideration a duplicate of a letter dated 29th ultimo from the Rev. Mr. Van Gieson, Teacher at the Quamichan Day School applying for a renewal of the grant to the Quamichan day school which has been withheld since the opening of the Rupert Island Industrial School on the 14th June 1890. I beg to state that the Rev. J. Fatt's letter was sent to this office through Mr. Agust Sorens who is now requested to furnish his report on the same.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6387, File 807-1, part 1)\nQuamichan B.C., March 1st, 1898\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to supply you with some additional information regarding the Cowichan Indian day school, to meet the wish and request of our devoted Superintendent Mr. Powell.\n\nI am anxious to give some explanations in view of the fact that I have lately insured the efficiency of the school by appointing at my own expenses an able teacher, in the person of Mr. Edward Crozier.\n\nThis appointment is of course subject to the approval of the Department, the moment it comes to a much-needed assistance by granting a subsidy in favor of the Cowichan day school. As my personal means are very limited, the appointment is of necessity but temporary. I may add that as a matter of fact, my firm belief that a Government grant will be forthcoming before the expiration of the present School term has encouraged me in making the appointment.\n\nThe reason I made the appointment\nappointment is to be found in any declining state of health.\n\nJones of Victoria having ordered me to indulge more in outdoor exercise which is not compatible with teaching a day and night school. Rather than to close my day school on account of ill-health, I preferred to make a personal sacrifice in paying a teacher to replace me until aid from the Indian Department is obtained. I trust the Department will see in my action a proof that I firmly believe my day school to work a certain amount of good among the Indian children of Cowichan.\n\nIt need not be stated that now I have secured a teacher, I will be able to obtain a larger and more regular attendance at the school, as I will make it my duty to coax both parents and children to make the latter reap the most possible benefits from the afforded education. As soon as the Cowichan School will come under the administration of the Indian Department by a government grant, I am sure that you, Mr. Cornes, our ever willing and devoted Agent will add your influence to mine to obtain satisfactory results.\n\nAs to the future attendance...\nAs to the future attendance of pupils I may state that I am positive the Register will show an average of 25, if the past attendance goes to prove anything in that line; considering the favorable change referred to above, a higher figure may be looked for.\n\nIn my December report I stated that I was conducting an evening school from 6 till 9 o'clock p.m., and that I sacrificed the afternoon school hours of the children, in favor of the night pupils, because I expected better results from my labor. This far my assertion has proven true, therefore I will continue to teach my evening school as heretofore. The newly appointed day school teacher will attend to her classes both morning and afternoon, in compliance with the Government Indian School Regulations.\n\nI owe one more word of explanation in regard to the appointment of the teacher Mrs. Edward Cavelier. Personally acquainted with her these last 6 years, I can vouch for the statement.\nThe statement that she possesses all the qualities of heart and mind to creditably fill the position.\n\nI have selected a female teacher in preference to a male teacher in consideration of the well-known fact that more good can be wrought amongst Indian children, morally and intellectually, by kindness and tender care than by less sympathetic means. As these qualities are more natural to woman than to man, and as a woman understands children better than a man, I have given preference to the former. Furthermore, as far as my personal notice extends, girls at an Indian School are as a rule conspicuous by their absence when a male teacher happens to conduct the school, and parents are disposed to send their girls to school.\n\nIt is with reluctance that I undertake giving some explanations in regard to what I called in my last report an \"opposition school,\" which was started by a Methodist preacher about a mile and a half from the Cowichan day-school. The reason of my reluctance is simply because I do not wish the Department ever...\nDepartment even to suspect me of narrow-mindedness,\npossibly to think that I am directed in my work\nof motives of personal interest.\n\nThere is no doubt, but the\nRev. Gentman is transferring his school from\nthe Somers Reservation to that of Flintlinelots,\nexpected to take along with him the Government\ngrant voted by Parliament in favor of the So-\nmers day-school. In my December report I ex-\npressed the confidence that the Department\nwould not think it fair to transfer the grant.\nMy term \"opposition school\" I may further\nstate, was properly applied, since I can prove\nto the satisfaction that of the Department, that I\nhave lost pupils at my school after the Flint-\nlinelots School was opened.\n\nIn connection with this\nmatter it ought to suffice to bring to the know-\nledge of the Department, that Cowichan has been\na Roman Catholic Mission these last forty years,\nand that there are no Methodist Indians about.\n\nYour annual\nYour annual report classifying the population in\nthe various denominations, bears out that truth.\nIf through undue influence by caring parties at\nOttawa, a government grant has been obtained in\nfavor of the Preacher's Seminary school, you are\naware such has not been done at the recommenda-\ntion or with the approval of the local or provin-\ncial Indian Authorities, for they knew that such a\ngrant of financial aid was unfair to a more\ndeserving denomination, and I trust and hope\nagain that new matters will be righted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeo. W. Van Toefley\n\nH. W. Coniao Esq.,\nDuncan's\nB.C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 128 D 3 of the 3rd instant, enclosing a copy of one from Agent Lomas and another from the Rev.

On or about July 1880 the grant was not paid, it not having been asked for, the Rev. Father Donckele and the nuns who were in charge having been removed to assume control of the Kuper Island Industrial School. For the last three years the school has not received any Government grant.\n\nMr. Lomas states that the average attendance is 25, and that this might be raised to 35 or 40 when all the Indian families are at home, the children attending this school coming from three villages, namely, Quamichan, Comeakin and Clemclemalets.\n\nAs the school in question is the only one at this point, and as all the Indians belong to the Roman Catholic Church, it would seem only fair that the grant to this school should be renewed.\n\nH.C. Ross.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated 18th instant having reference to an application from the Rev. Father Van Geesten for the usual grant of $300.00 for a Roman Catholic Day School near Tsawwassen and beg to submit herewith Mr. Agent Lomas' Report dated 28th instant on this question.\n\nMr. Lomas in his report refers me to his letter dated 7th July 1896 (515-5) there is no such letter on file here he should properly have referred to his letter dated 11th July 1896 (525) copy of which was forwarded to the Department under cover of letter dated 14th July from this Office.\n\nA Copy of the Resolution referred to in Mr. Lomas' Report is herewith inclosed.\n\nI may add that the school under consideration is without doubt one of the earliest Indian Day Schools established in this province and is in every respect worthy of support.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAll Vowell\nIndian Superintendent No. 6\nPort Macquarie\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nCowichan Agency,\n\nIndian Office,\n\nQuamichan, B.C.\n\nMarch 1895\n\nI have the honor to report that the school for which the Rev. Father Van Boekum made application for the renewal of the usual grant was not opened by the Rev. Father Bourdon, the Roman Catholic priest of the district in the year 1859 or 1860 and being situated half way between the Quamichan and Cowichan villages seems to have been known by other names.\n\nGood school buildings were later erected and in 1883 the first ten-capula grant was received. In 1890 about July the grant was withdrawn or rather not asked for. The Rev. Father Donnelly and the late lamented Sister Celestine and others were removed to take charge of the Nipigon Island Industrial School.\n\nFor the last three years (?) the school has been working without Government grant, or any assistance except from the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nThe average attendance is 25 - this might be raised to 30 or 40 when all families are at home. The pupils are from Quamichan, Cowichan & Clackamas villages. All the Indians belong to the Roman Catholic Church and as all the buildings are in good condition and good working order.\n\nJ. W.

Mr. Simpson.\n\nAs I did not see any way clear to personally support a teacher for my school much longer, I have some time ago very reluctantly informed the Department that my school will be closed at the expiration of the present term, if no Government aid is forthcoming.

(RG 10, Volume 6387, File 807-1, part 1)\nI have kept the Quamichan Indian day-school ongoing in a flourishing condition during the last 3 years, at the cost of much money and labor. During that time I have forwarded as many as 6 applications for a grant, all of which were either ignored or met with a disappointing reply. Were it not that the Doctor forbade me to teach, I would cheerfully and hopefully undertake the task of conducting the school myself again. But I find myself in such a position that I have not even the choice of an alternative. My means do not possibly allow me to retain the services of the teacher I secured when I took sick, and on the other hand I am forbidden to teach myself.\n\nI would therefore, dear Sir, have to witness the downfall of my school, in spite of my willingness to do so for its sake.\nFor its sake whatever lies within the bounds of possibility; therefore it pains me sorely to be refused Government help again.\n\nHowever I hope the Department will come to my assistance.

Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will be willing to pay a much higher salary than $300.00 a year for a qualified teacher and for one with suitable qualifications the maximum salary of $600.00 per annum will be allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. R. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan's Station, B.C.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to yours of the 7th instant No.128434-I also letter dated Feb. 24th last. I have the honor to inform you that on receipt of letter dated Feb. 24th, I advised Rev. W. Lemmens, priest in charge of this mission, who was then teaching the Quamichan Day School (R.C.) and he informed me that Miss L. Douglas had resigned, therefore he was teaching until he could secure some other suitable teacher; which is very difficult to do on account of the very low salary paid, namely $25.00 per month.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, June 7, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer you to official letter of February 24th, last, in reference to the appointment of a competent teacher for the Quamichan (R.C.) day school and to ask you whether you are yet in a position to report on this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. R. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan's Station, B.C.\nOttawa, February 24, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a report upon the Quamichan (B.C.) day school in which it is stated that the school is in charge of Miss Louise Douglas, aged 14 years.\n\nIn this connection I beg to say that the Department must insist upon being informed of the appointment of teachers and its approval must be received before payment of salaries can be made and you will be good enough to inform the Church authorities accordingly. Although this girl is so young the Department is disposed to give her an opportunity for a few months to see with what success she will meet. You will be good enough to report upon this school when you have an opportunity.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. R. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan's Station, B.C.\nSir:\u2014\n\nIn reply to yours of the 29th, ultimo No.128434 also to one dated June 23rd, last re, new teacher for the Quamichan R. C. Indian day school, on receipt of yours of last June, I at once informed Rev. W. Lemmens, the priest in charge of the mission, of its contents since that time he has diligently tried to find a suitable teacher for the Quamichan R. C. Day school, as will be seen from copy of letter dated the 7th, inst., from Rev. W. Lemmens, enclosed herewith.\n\nI will recommend that the present teacher be allowed to continue until the end of the June quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. D.

C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn answer to yours of the 5th, inst., I beg to state that I am fully convinced of the necessity of making a change of teacher at the Clemolemalute School. As you know I have been trying all along to secure a new one, but have failed thus far. Although I have a promise of a good teacher after the summer holidays. From now until then we will have to do the best we can with the present one, as it would be impossible to find a teacher for the five remaining months. And notwithstanding my good will I cannot attend to the teaching myself.\n\nI hope the Department will consent to this arrangement.\n\nYours truly\n\n(Sign) W. Lemmens.\nReport of Inspector Bitchburn for the Month of January, 1912.\n\nSouthwestern Inspectorate, B.C.\n\nSir:\n\nHerewith I submit my report of Inspections made during the month of January, 1912:\n\nThe Quamichan Catholic Day School on the Clemoemilitz reserve was visited on the 26th. There were only five in attendance. The present teacher is Archie Alexander, an ex-pupil of the Kuper Island Industrial school, but I do not consider him a good teacher, in fact he is only a make-shift. Rev. Father Lemmens, the Catholic missionary, expects to be able to procure a good teacher in the near future, and he then expects to have a much better attendance at this school.\n\nSgd. W. E. Bitchburn.\nInspector.\nOttawa, January 29, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to official letter of June 23rd last, in reference to the appointment of a new teacher for the Quamichan (R.C.) Day School and to ask what progress has been made in the matter. It would seem that the usefulness of the present teacher has gone and that it is necessary that a change should be made at an early date. The Department will expect a prompt reply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. R. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan's Station, B.C.\nGeneral Remarks.\n\nThere was only pupil present, and he was learning the \"A, B, C.\" and could not speak English.\n\nIn talking with some of the Indians they told me that they wanted a white teacher, as their children would not learn from an Indian.\n\nI saw the children playing about in the village and asked why they were not at school. They replied \"School no good.\"\n\nA good teacher is needed here with a fair salary. At present the school is doing little if any good.\nOttawa, June 6, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of February 14th, last, and the Department's reply of the 22nd of that month I have to ask you to be good enough to state what steps, if any, have been taken with a view to securing the services of a teacher for the Quamichan (B.C.) Day School to take charge after the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. R. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncans Station, B.C.\nOttawa, February 22, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant enclosing a communication from Rev. W. Lemmens in reference to a new teacher for the Quamichan (R.O.) Indian Day school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in view of Rev. Mr. Lemmens' explanations the present teacher may remain in charge till the end of the June quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. R. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncans Station, B.C.\nDear Sir,\n\nI thank you for drawing my attention to the fact that on my removal to Rupert Island, I should have sent in my resignation as teacher of the Quamichan R.C. Day School. I send in this resignation by this letter, and notify the Dept. that Rev. G.M. Scheele take my place for the present.\n\nYours Truly,\nW. Lemmens.\nOttawa, July 27, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant with enclosure from the Rev. Father Scheelen in reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Quamichan Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that if Father Scheelen can obtain the services of a qualified teacher the Department will increase the grant at this school, but it would then be expected that a larger attendance would be secured than there has been in the past. It is not the intention of the Department to pay any larger salaries to teachers without professional qualifications, such as have been in charge of this school up to the present.\n\nIn regard to the regulations recently issued I beg to say that these are being modified in so far as the length of the daily sessions is concerned. Notice has already been sent to the different teachers and others interested will be advised in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. R. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncans Station, B.C., Assistant Deputy and Secretary.\nCowichan Agency\nIndian Office\nDuncans Station, B. C. July 8th, 1912\n\nSir:-\n\nIn reply to yours of the 6th, ultimo No. 128,437/I in regard to a new teacher for Quamichan Indian day school (B. C.) at Clenclemslute. I have the honor to enclose herewith a letter dated the 29th, ultimo from Rev. Ed. M. Scheelen who succeeds Rev. W. Lemmens, as Teacher. It is, as stated, in the Reverend Gentlemen's letter, impossible to secure a suitable teacher for an Indian day school at the salary offered viz., $25.00 per month. The hours under the new regulations are much longer than required of the Public School of this Province, and the duties of a teacher of an Indian day school are far more arduous.\n\nIt is noted on the last June quarterly report that Archie Alexander is acting as a substitute, under the supervision of the Rev. Father of this Parish.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nIndian Affairs.

Robertson, Esq.,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your last letter, I beg to inform you that I have not secured yet the services of a teacher for the missionary school at Churchill Falls. The Department has not been able to give the children an education. The latest school regulations, which it has issued, make it impossible to find a teacher who would be willing to teach, especially Indian children, for 6 hours in consideration of \u00a35 per month. It would be hardly enough to pay the board. If, for one, protest strongly against these regulations and I hope that the Department will devise better and practical ones.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nW. Wheeler\nCowichan Agency\n\nIndian Office\n\nDunrobin Station, B.C., July 8th, 1913.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a letter dated the 8th inst., from Rev. Father Lemmens, informing the Department of his removal to the Industrial School at Kuper Island and that Rev. E. M.

Ed. M.

The present teacher does not hold a teacher's certificate, but her work has been quite successful instructing Indian children.\n\nI will await your instructions before consulting the Indians as to the location of the school.\n\nI will respectfully suggest that a building similar to the one erected for the Methodist school near Quamichan village be supplied for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.

Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to the conversations that we have had as to the necessity of providing a properly equipped and adequate building for a day school for the Catholic Indian children in the Cowichan District, I beg to ask you to be good enough to request the Department to make provision for the erection of the necessary building on a site sufficiently large to provide play-ground accommodation for the children and at the same time to make provision for the payment of the salary of a qualified teacher.\n\nThe building in which the school is now conducted is, as you are well aware, quite dilapidated and utterly unfit for school purposes. The teacher although she is doing her work as well as can be expected under the circumstances, is not certificated and such a qualified teacher could not be secured for the salary now paid, viz: $100 dollars a quarter.\n\nOf course the Indians whose children would attend the school, are Catholics, the teacher should be a Catholic.\n\nIt is for the Department to decide, on your recommendation, where the school will be situated; but you are aware that it can be so situated as to obtain from Catholic Indians within a radius of three miles an attendance of about thirty children.\n\nI had hoped that the new school at Ruper Island would be sufficiently large to accommodate the children of the Indians under\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6387, File 807-1, part 1)\nunder my spiritual charge, but I find that in that I was mistaken,\nand I cannot, without disregarding my duty, longer delay in\nsecuring the providing of a properly equipped day school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev.

Day School was also visited on the same day and although the weather was inclement I found 12 children present out of 23 on the roll. The pupils are all making good progress under the teaching of Miss Frumento. The children were all dressed neat and were clean in appearance. I am pleased to state that I have noted a very considerable amount of improvement in the children of this school both in their studies and appearance since Miss Frumento has been in charge. The school building is an old one and is not situated in as central a position as might be to ensure a large regular attendance from the children of the Quamichan, Comeakin, Clemolemalitz and Khenipsin Reserves, but as it is possible that some of the children from this school will be transferred to the new Kuper Island school when opened, it would not be advisable to take into consideration the matter of building a new school at the present time.\n\nSgd.

McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nAlfred H. Lomas, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B. C.\nMight I suggest that the name of locality of this school be changed to Cowichan Indian Reserve.

Miss Akerman has completed the Public School course entrance to High School and has a certificate for Commercial Course. She has been teaching Sunday School for some time and also at different times has substituted for other teachers.\n\nThough not a qualified teacher she is well able to manage children. May I add that this Appointment in my mind is only a temporary one until the summer holidays. As I have the greatest hopes for getting Sisters to teach in the Cowichan District.\n\nMay I add also that a qualified teacher of several year's experience had in July accepted the position as teacher in the Quamichan School with the understanding that the new school would be ready not later than October 1st, but has since accepted another position as the school has not been started yet.\n\nHoping this will meet with your approval, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFrancis Beshore,\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6387, File 807-1, part 1)\nOttawa, Sept. 18, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter of the 5th ultimo, referring to the future policy in connection with the Quamichan and Kaskilah Indian Day Schools near Duncan B.C. As you are aware, the Superintendent of Indian Education visited this reserve this summer and after a conference at which the Indian agent, the Inspector of Indian schools and Roman Catholic and Methodist school representatives were present, it was decided that the Kaskilah School should be classed as undenominational. The present Teacher, Miss Phyllis Gibson, will remain in charge, but there should be no religious instruction offered to the pupils in attendance.\n\nThe Department believes that all the Protestant children resident in the vicinity are close enough to this school to attend. It is understood that the Roman Catholic children who are nearer the Kaskilah than the Quamichan school will also attend the first mentioned class.\n\nI might inform you that the Department is erecting a day school on the Quamichan Reserve, close to the Indian Village of Comoxen. As all the children in this vicinity are Roman Catholic, this school will be conducted under the auspices of that church.\n\nI have noted that you would agree to both schools being undenominational; but the Department has ruled that the Kaskilah School, due to the mixed population, should be undenominational and that the Quamichan School, which could cater to no Protestant children - as there are none living in the vicinity, should be Roman Catholic. Mr. Indian Agent Lomas is being informed of this decision and we are asking him to communicate with Rev. Mr. Gibson and the Rev. Father Bochumers.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Mclean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent,\nMethodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6387, File 807-1, part 1)\nBrandon, Aug. 21, 1922.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRegarding the Day Schools at Quamichan and Koksilah, B.C.\n\nI understand the Department has been considering making these two schools undenominational. Inasmuch as the Roman Catholics and the Methodists are the two religious bodies concerned and for some time past the only school operated for the two Reserves being at Koksilah under the management of the Methodist Church, I would agree to the proposal of undenominational schools being established providing a Roman Catholic teacher is engaged for the Quamichan children and a Protestant teacher engaged for the Koksilah Reserve.\n\nIn agreeing to this arrangement we do so with the hope that all Protestant children on the Quamichan side will attend the school with the Roman Catholic teacher and that all Roman Catholic children on the Koksilah side will attend the school with the Protestant teacher.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. Ferrier\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6387, File 807-1, part 1)\nOttawa, February 9, 1922.\n\nSir:\u2014\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 17th ultimo, referring to the education of the Indian children on the Cowichan reserve. I have noted that there are 80 children of school age in the Quamichan, Comseaken, Khenipson, Clem-clemalute, Somenos and Koksilah bands.\n\nAs you may know, at one time there were two day schools for the Quamichan band, under the auspices of the Roman Catholic and Methodist churches. These were closed in 1917 and 1912, respectively, because of poor attendance. There was a Roman Catholic school for the Somenos band which met a similar fate in 1910. There remains now the one Koksilah Indian Day School, with an average attendance of about 10.\n\nI have noted that you have made a careful study of the educational needs on the Cowichan, and the Department is giving earnest consideration to your suggestions. As soon as funds can be provided, we will endeavour to build a day school on the north of the river, between the Quami-chan and Comseaken bands. You might inform the Department if we own any school buildings in the vicinity and if any school equipment, such as desks and blackboards, is available. The Department's policy is to allow a church to have the supervision over these day schools, and it is thought that this school to the north of the river should be conducted under the Roman Catholic auspices.\n\nFor the requirements of the children to the south of the river, you have recommended the moving of the Koksilah Indian Day School. In reply I wish to state that we have taken up with the Methodist Church authorities the advisability of moving their school to a point near the Koksilah railway station. I believe it would be advisable to have it continue under their auspices. Would you give an estimate of the cost of moving this building and intimate to the Department if its condition would permit of such moving. I understand that it was erected in 1915 and is the property of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nAlfred H.

That the mother is to blame seems quite evident, from the same reasons which the father has given to more than one person interested in the attendance of the children. And that reason is \"to keep the peace in the house. I let the woman have her way.\"\n\nNo. 4. The parents take this boy away 12 miles to Cherrain, where the father works in the Mill.

LeJeune, teacher of the Cowichan Indian Day School, regarding the lack of attendance of a number of the Indian children. I enclose herewith a copy of his report.\n\nYou should take up with the parents in each case the matter of seeing that the children mentioned are sent regularly to school each day it is open. If the parents in any case refuse, after they have received notice, to send their children to school, it is considered that it would be advisable to arrange to have them placed in a residential school of the faith to which they belong. You should bear this matter in mind, and, after the summer holidays next, you should issue the necessary instructions to the parents. If they fail to comply therewith, you should then take the necessary steps to have the children placed in a residential school.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear later as to the results of any action taken by you in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6387, File 807-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo in connection with the Cowichan Indian Day School and the teacher Mr. J. P. Lejeune, and in reply I would say that we have great difficulty from the commencement of this school in getting the children to continually attend, although repeatedly both Dominion Constable O'Connell and myself have got all children in reach of the school to attend, it is found that they gradually drop off. In my experience with Indian Day Schools, the reason for this is that the teacher, possibly through ill health, does not have enough variety in his teaching so that the children want something outside of the ordinary routine of reading and writing which would create an interest. In other day schools in the Agency I find the children keen and anxious to attend, and should one be absent the teacher calls on the parents to see if the child is ill, etc., etc., thus the teacher wins the respect of the parents, but in the case of the school in question, Mr. Lejeune, say the same, although repeatedly I have tried to get Mr. Lejeune to take an interest in the parents as well as the pupils.\n\nThis school was built in the Spring of 1923 at the request of R.C. Missionaries and yet we see little interest taken by them. On the Reservation adjacent we have both Catholic and Protestant families which may in some way affect the attendance. It has been found at the Koksilah Indian Day School a few miles distant, a purely non-sectarian, that far better results prevail in spite of the fact that most of the pupils have a much greater distance to travel. I am firmly of the opinion that if the Cowichan Indian Day School was on the same lines better results would be assured.\n\nIt might be suggested by the Department that the school should be closed and the children sent to residential schools; against this I would point out that two-thirds of the pupils of the Koksilah and Cowichan Day Schools are unable to pass a Doctor.\n\nMr. Lejeune is in poor health but manages to attend regularly, but the situation is hopeless as it is.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Alfred H.

In this connection it is noted that there was no possibility of obtaining an attendance of more than one pupil during the above mentioned period. Your action in having the school closed is approved.\n\nIt is hoped, however, that the children will recover at an early date and that the school will not remain closed any longer than absolutely necessary. As you are aware, there has been difficulty from the commencement of this school in getting the children to attend, and owing to the poor results that have been achieved, it is hoped that the school will be reopened at an early date.

You should, therefore, inform Mr. Lejeune just previous to the last of June, next, that his services will not be required after the end of the present school year. One month's notice to this effect will be sufficient.\n\nAfter you have served this notice, you should take up with the Church authorities interested in the school the question of nominating a qualified teacher to succeed Mr. Lejeune, to begin duties on or about September 1st, 1927. The teacher nominated should be approved by yourself, and, if possible, Mr. Inspector Cairns. You should then submit the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated for the approval of the Department. The salary allowed would depend entirely upon the qualifications of the teacher secured. It is thought that if the services of a qualified teacher are obtained for the next school year, and one who could make the classroom instruction interesting, it would lead to a more regular attendance of the Indian pupils, and better results would be obtained.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I would strongly recommend that the Reverend Father's wishes be carried out, and Mrs. Rey, although not a qualified teacher, has taken a very deep interest in the little ones at her school, and has brought up the average considerably by her kindness and devoted interest in them.\n\nYou will understand that the children that attend this school are very young, and, in fact, the school is more or less primary.

She has to travel about 2\u00bd miles to and from school every day, for which she has to use her car, and in doing so carries a number of the children backwards and forwards to school, as they live at considerable distance from the school. There is no facilities to house her car. I think that the Department should put up a small shed, at a cost of about $25.00 that she could put it in.\n\nNumber of Pupils in 1st Standard 13\ndo 2nd do 6\ndo 3rd do 4\ndo 4th do\ndo 5th do\ndo 6th do\n\nAgency Cowichan Dated November 29th, 1930\n\nN.B.\u2014A separate form to be used for each school. \"State whether 'day', 'boarding' or 'industrial'\".\n\nForm No. 19\n\nIndian Affairs.

As there are a lot of children for this school, it is really too bad that we should have a weak teacher, where so much good work can be accomplished.\n\nI would like to recommend that a change of teachers be made at the end of this term, as I am sure that there must be lots of good Roman Catholic teachers available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

I went around to find out where the others were, and found some away at the berry picking and others just playing around with no excuse except that they did not learn anything.\n\nThis school has always been very unsatisfactory. I did manage to work it up after I came here but I could see that the teacher Mrs. Rey had such poor discipline that she could not hold the children. During the month of April, Mrs. Smith relieved Mrs. Rey, and she immediately made a tremendous change. The work was made interesting and the children attended well. You will note that from Mr. Inspector Barry's report that the school is not what it should be. We talked it over on several occasions and decided to let Mrs. Rey carry on till the summer holidays to see if she could improve things, but instead of that they are getting worse.\n\nI would like to strongly recommend that a change be made in this school. That a certified teacher be put in.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

C. Ferry, Esq.,\nAssistant Indian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI am in receipt of a copy of a letter 610-P-3 May 1st addressed to the Department of Indian Affairs by Mr. Indian Agent Graham, in which he recommends the termination of the services of Miss Olive H. Anderton, teacher of the Cowichan Indian Day School, as from the end of the present school year in June. The grounds given by Mr. Graham for such recommendation are that the teacher is not able to preserve proper discipline or to advance the pupils in their class work in a satisfactory manner.\n\nI had a short conference with Mr. Indian Agent Graham in Duncan on the 28th of April, and then recommended him to report to the Department, making any suggestion he thought fit. This he has now done.\n\nI have the honour to draw the attention of the Department to my remarks on this subject contained in my last report on the Cowichan Indian Day School. This report was forwarded by you to the Department in Ottawa under your 15/1580 dated October 24th 1933. Under the heading \"Success\" I stated that I was not very well satisfied with the work of the past year. Under the heading \"General\" I recommended that the teacher be warned that her services would not be required after the end of the school year in June. If the work of the Grade 1 children had not been greatly improved by the Spring, I do not of course know if the teacher was so warned by the Department at that time. I certainly hope that Miss Anderton was given this warning. It is impossible to carry out another inspection of the school this month as I leave on the 8th of May for Bella Coola and Prince Rupert, and will not be back from this lengthy tour of the schools till the middle of June.\n\nI have done everything in my power to help Miss Anderton. I think it is time that she has some experience in one of the Provincial Day Schools. I am inclined to agree with Mr. Graham that this teacher should be dismissed, particularly as I have on my list two or three Roman Catholic teachers, particularly highly recommended by the Roman Catholic Church for this school. One of such teachers ought to be able to improve the standing of the Cowichan Indian Day School. I do not consider that a teacher recommended locally would prove suitable.\n\nPerhaps you would be good enough to forward this letter to the Department together with your own recommendations in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMiss Olive Anderton taught the Comeakin Indian day school for the last two years. Has a first class certificate and has attended summer school. Was told she would have to try and pull up the attendance and claims she did so. She was dismissed on notice dated June 15th to take effect on June 30th. She was given no reasons and on asking them was refused. If she did bad work the first year why was she retained, and if her second year's work was bad how was it known seeing that the last inspection of her school was in October last.\n\nWhile working for the Indian Dept. she was subject to B.C. school laws and regulations, had to have a B.C. teacher's certificate etc. By B.C. School laws, when dismissed the reasons must be clearly stated in the notice. This was not done and on seeking them she was refused. When legally dismissed she has a right of appeal to an independent Board.\n\nFurther, notice of dismissal with reasons must be sent her at least 30 days before date of taking effect. This was not done and according to B.C. law the notice is invalid and she can return to the position for next term. You can ascertain the truth of above by phoning Dr. Willis, Supt. of Education from whom I received it.\n\nSome one appears to have blundered and I suggest that the simplest way to clear the matter up is to either reinstate her in the school from which she has not been legally dismissed or provide her with another school as well situated as the Comeakin one.\n\nThe lady is entitled to the same treatment as any other B.C. teacher. Failing this I must take it up at once with Ottawa, but I trust that will not be necessary.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"A.W. Neill.\"\n\nIndian Affairs.

Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Capt. Barry:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 19th instant (No. 15/3/35193) in which you state that you consider that I have had \"every consideration\" shown me during the past two years.\n\nIn my letter of the 18th instant I asked you to please give me some satisfaction as to why I was dismissed from my school. You did not mention this at all in your reply. May I be so bold as to repeat the request?\n\nAs for the Department's consideration for me, do you think it is considerate of them to dismiss me without inspecting my work this year? If they considered dismissing me I think the least they could have done would have been to have you inspect my school this spring. They are apparently unaware of what I have accomplished this year as the only reports that have been made are those which Mr. Indian Agent Graham made after his monthly visits to the school, when he stayed generally less than five minutes. Obviously, he knew nothing of the accomplishments of the pupils. The last report received at Ottawa which bears on my teaching ability is yours of October 11th last. I think you will realize that this tells nothing of what I have done since then, or, for practically the whole of the present academic year. You ought to be able to see, then, that I have not been treated fairly.\n\nI have put my heart and soul into this work, have secured the love and cooperation of the pupils, have gained their interest and the confidence of their parents. There are practically no disciplinary difficulties now and, as you know, discipline was the biggest problem when I undertook the school. The children now are willingly obedient. You gave me the school's most difficult years and now, when I have succeeded in getting the school into a workable condition you pass it on to someone else and give me absolutely no credit.\n\nHowever, if the Department can show me that I have failed as a teacher or can give me any other valid reason for my dismissal then I shall be quite satisfied to make the best of it. But I do think refusal to give me a reason not only an insult but a suggestion that perhaps there is not a valid reason. I ask no more than fair play.\n\nOne reason for my persistence in this matter is the dire necessity for me to get employment. For the past two years I have been practically supporting my parents and a brother. My father has been unable to get work other than Government Relief for the past three years. His usual earnings\nare from twenty to thirty dollars per month. Also, my mother has been an invalid for the past four years, bedridden for the past ten months and will probably be an invalid for the remainder of her life. Therefore, she needs good food and care. How we can procure her this on even thirty dollars a month is more than anyone knows.\n\nIf you are unable to help me in any other way, perhaps you could give me a recommendation so that I might be able to find another school for, as things stand now it will be almost impossible to do this. All School Boards insist on receiving copies of inspectors' reports with which, of course, I shall be unable to provide them.\n\nI hope that I do not seem to you to be making trouble about nothing. To me this matter is of vital importance and I do want to be shown fair play.\n\nI trust that you will consider my side in this matter and do something for me.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n\"Olive H. Anderton.\"\nMiss Olive H. Anderton,\nCowichan Indian Day School,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nDear Miss Anderton:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 25th instant, and may say that I have given it careful consideration.\n\nYour best course, if you consider the actions of either Mr. Indian Agent Graham or myself to be unfair, is to write to the Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs in Ottawa. As the Department has decided to terminate your services on the 30th of June next, you will understand that it is quite impossible for me to enter into any discussion on the matter.\n\nShould you care to do so you might place the facts of the matter before the B.C. Teachers' Federation, by writing to the General Secretary, Mr. Harry Charlesworth. The address of the Federation is 1300 Robson Street, Vancouver, B.C. They sometimes act for teachers who do not belong to the B.C. Teachers' Federation.\n\nI never give either copies of my reports, or letters of recommendation, to teachers seeking other appointments. In making application to Principals or Boards of School Trustees you may of course refer to me as your last inspector. On request from a Principal or Board of Trustees for confidential information, I am prepared to supply particulars with regard to teachers who have served in the Indian Schools of British Columbia, and I am of course prepared to do this in your case.\n\nI regret that owing to pressure of work it was quite impossible for me to visit your school this Spring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"Gerald H. Barry.\"\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n15/3/35749.\n\n31st July, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Neill:\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of July 28th, instant, concerning Miss Olive Anderton, and to advise you that I have sent a copy thereof to the Department at Ottawa, as I think the Department would wish to deal with your correspondence, more particularly as the same brings into question the extent to which the Department would consider employee teachers entitled to the benefits which British Columbia School teachers would enjoy within the scope of the \"Act respecting Public Schools\", Chapter 236 of the Province of British Columbia.\n\nNo doubt the Department will be able to give you the benefit of further advice in this matter. I have sent the Department a copy of this letter, as well as copies of Miss Anderton's correspondence with the School Inspector, for its information.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC. C. Perry,\nAssistant Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nA.W. Neill, Esq., M.P.,\nAlberni, B.C.\n\nCCP:FM\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6387, File 807-1, part 1)\nSir:-\n\nI have the honour to transmit herewith copy of a letter dated July 26th, instant, received from A. W. Neill, Esq., P.O. of Victoria, B.C., in regard to the dismissal by the Department of Miss Olive Anderton, Indian Day School teacher of the Cowichan Indian Day School on Comoxkin Indian Reserve, Cowichan Agency, together with a copy of my reply to Mr. Neill of today's date. These letters will be self-explanatory.\n\nIt is further deemed advisable to enclose, for the Department's perusal, copies of the underquoted correspondence which took place between Inspector of Schools and Miss Anderton, namely:\n\nJune 16th - Miss Anderton to Inspector Barry.\n\" 19th - Inspector Barry to Miss Anderton.\n\" 25th - Miss Anderton to Inspector Barry.\n\" 26th - Inspector Barry to Miss Anderton.\n\nMy own understanding is that while the Provincial textbooks and curricula are being generally followed in our Indian Schools, and it has become the practice wherever possible to have British Columbia certificated teachers employed for our Schools, the Department, nevertheless, reserving to itself the prerogative of appointing as teachers of Indian Schools teachers who hold any other certificates which the Department considers adequate (see letter No. 1820, dated December 14th, 1933, Department to Assistant Commissioner), there has been no arrangement as between the Department and the Provincial authorities whereby Indian School teachers are to be brought within the general scope of the Provincial act cited above. Consequently, it seems questionable if the Department is in a position to recognize Miss Anderton's claim to the privileges specified in Mr. Neill's letter with respect to appeal under Provincial regulations.\n\nI may say that the Inspector of Indian Schools, Captain G.H. Barry, tells me that he considered Miss Anderton's second year might possibly result in some improvement of her work with which he had not been satisfied, and that it was in a spirit of goodwill and helpfulness to\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6387, File 807-1, part 1)\nThe Secretary,\n\nthe teacher that he did so. He further states that although he did not inspect the school the second year, because of his necessary visits to other schools in the Province, there being only one Indian School Inspector for British Columbia, the school was nevertheless visited by the Indian Agent, who reported in May, 1934, his dissatisfaction with the school conditions. Inspector Pragnell in December, 1932, also reported unfavourably.\n\nThe correspondence between the Inspector and Miss Anderton did not come to my notice until after the arrival of Mr. Neill's letter, it having been apparent that there was little that I could do in the circumstances.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. G. Perry.\nAssistant Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nCCP: EH\nEnc.\nOttawa, May 5th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, with reference to leave of absence for Mr. Bernard F. Neary, teacher of the Cowichan Indian Day School, who wishes to attend the University of British Columbia, from October 1st, 1936, to April 30th, 1937.\n\nPlease consult the Church authorities with a view to obtaining the nomination of a qualified teacher to take the place of Mr. Neary during his absence at the University.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Neary, teacher Cowichan Indian Bay School, applying for seven months' leave of absence to attend the University of British Columbia.\n\nInspector Barry remarked on this in his report on this school.\n\nI think a suitable teacher can be found to substitute, and I would like to recommend that leave of absence be granted to Mr. Neary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI hereby make application for a seven month's leave of absence from my position as teacher of the Cowichan Indian School at Duncan, B. C.\n\nIt is my intention during this period to attend the winter session of the University of British Columbia, and to complete my last year's study necessary to attain my B. A. Degree. While I have as yet been unable to obtain information as to the exact dates of the session the approximate extent of my leave will be from October 1st, 1936 to April 30th, 1937.\n\nI understand from the resident missionary priest on the reserve (the Rev. Father X. Lauzon) that he is in complete approval of my being granted this leave.\n\nI sincerely hope you will recommend to the authorities in Ottawa that this leave be granted.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Signed) Bernard F. Neary.\nEXTRACT from Inspector Barry's Report regarding his visit to the COWICHAN INDIAN DAY SCHOOL on March 18, 1936 - Original on File 152-8-6.\n\nGeneral Remarks:\n\nA proper Time Table is followed with care. The Junior Red Cross organization is operating in the school. The whole school is perfectly clean. There is no corporal punishment or any need for it. I am satisfied that Mr. Neary is doing his very best for these children. While the conduct of the children is very good, the fact is that Mr. Neary is a good teacher and finds matters of control very easy for this reason.\n\nI understand that Mr. Neary wishes to attend the session of the University of British Columbia from the 1st of October 1936 to April 30th, 1937, that he may receive a degree in Arts. He has done the previous three years work by attendance at Victoria College and by Summer Schools and private reading.\n\nI am also informed that the local Priest considers this a very suitable thing, and that the Catholic Church authorities will be prepared to nominate a SUBSTITUTE teacher for the months during which Mr. B. Neary is away from his school.\n\nFor the information of the Department, I may say that I have no objection to Mr. Neary taking his degree this next year provided a qualified substitute be placed in charge of the school. I do not think that the Catholic Church will have much difficulty in nominating a suitable substitute. I would therefore ask the Department to give favourable consideration to Mr. B. Neary's request if and when it is made in a proper manner through his Indian Agent. He certainly has worked hard here, and I think a final year at his University will be good for him in a professional, as well as in a physical way. His general health should certainly improve by a change for a few months from Indian surroundings to the atmosphere of the University, and I think it would do his nerves good.\nOttawa, August 22, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to the request of Mr. Bernard F. Neary, teacher of the Cowichan Indian Day School, for an increase in salary.\n\nThe Department regrets that, at the present time, regulations will not permit our increasing Mr. Neary's salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\nMr. Bernard F. Neary, the teacher at the Cowichan Indian Day School, who was appointed to this school on Aug. 2nd, 1934 by Department letter No. 152-6-1 at a salary of $900.00 per year, is now applying for an increase in salary to $1000.00.\n\nMr. Neary has a first class certificate, and has attended Summer School every year since he passed out of Normal School, and this year he is the only Indian school teacher who is attending any summer school and he is attending the Summer Session of the University of B.C.\n\nMr. Neary has certainly given very great satisfaction in the Cowichan Indian Day School, and has really made a school out of it.\n\nMr. Neary in order to keep up his average school attendance transported certain pupils to and from school who would not have been able to attend otherwise.\n\nnight school of older pupils was carried on by Mr. Neary, which goes to show that he had the Indians and their education at heart.\n\nIf there is any way or means of allowing Mr. Neary an increase in salary, I would like very much to recommend it, as this is the class of teacher that we want to get for our Indian schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6387, File 807-1, part 1)\nOctober 3, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Neill:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, in further reference to dispensing with the services of Miss Olive Anderton from the position as teacher of the Cowichan Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I regret that I am unable to add anything further in this matter to that of my letter of the 6th ultimo. In dispensing with this teacher's services, the Department acted on the reports received from the local Indian Agent and our School Inspector. Our letter to the local Agent, instructing him to advise Miss Anderton that her services would not be required after the end of the last academic year, was dated June 9th. No doubt, he informed her accordingly, promptly on receipt of this letter.\n\nAs you were advised in my previous letter, under the regulations of the Treasury Board and the Auditor General, it will not be possible to pay Miss Anderton salary after the end of June last, in lieu of the full 30 days' notice. While the Department, in most cases, gives ample notice upon the dismissal of a teacher, I would point out that it is not obligatory on our part to give any stated length of notice.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nA. W. Neill, Esq., M. P.,\nAlberni, B. C.\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\n\nAlberni, B.C., Sept. 25th, 1934\n\nH.W. McGill Esq., M.C.M.D\nDeputy Supt Gen of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of 6th inst no. 152-8-1 re unjust dismissal of Miss O. Anderton without explanation and without legal notice.\n\nThe explanations given are poor. If the Inspector was suspicious that she was not doing well why did he never inspect her school in the second year although close to Victoria? Why act on the report of the Indian agent who is not competent to inspect schools.\n\nHe did not like her letting the grades one and two (little children) out early and disapproved of finding her having the children playing games in school hours but mentioned in one of the questions in report to Ottawa is \"How much time daily do you give to group games?\"\n\nWhen it came to dismissing a teacher, surely that was the time if ever when the Inspector should have thoroughly inspected the school and her work.\n\nRe lack of legal notice. No teacher in B.C can be dismissed without 30 days notice and moreover must be given reasons in writing and the teacher has...\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\n\na right of appeal and is quite often reinstated.\n\nThe dept can because of its position as a part of the Dominion Govt ignore this law but it poorly becomes it to take such an advantage.\n\nRe lack of notice, I note you do not consider that she was handicapped in getting another school by not getting proper notice but unfortunately the facts are against you.\n\nThere is such a surplus of teachers that the minute they get notice which must be on or before June 1st, they do not wait to look in papers for vacancies but circulate half the schools in the Province and the country school boards pick a teacher from those applying in that way.\n\nThis girl lost the chance of doing so for the first and most important fortnight. She WAS handicapped by the negligence of the Dept's officials. There is no other word but negligence. Both of them must have been familiar with B.C. Law and custom. It was not a sudden act of wrong doing on the part of the teacher that would justify instant dismissal. She was entitled to get the usual 30 days notice of dismissal or salary in lieu thereof. You refuse it because your dept is in a position to take advantage of the girl's poverty and inability to take the case before the Exchequer Court where it would undoubtedly be decided in her favour. But it reflects little credit on the Dept and I doubt if parliament will endorse it.\n\nYours faithfully\nA.W. Neill\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6387, File 807-1, part 1)\nSeptember 6, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Neill:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, relative to dispensing with the services of Miss Olive Anderton from the position as teacher of the Cowichan Indian Day School and the length of notice which she received.\n\nMiss Anderton's teaching services during her first year were reported unsatisfactory by the Inspector of Indian Schools and also by the local Indian Agent. However, the Inspector considered her second year might possibly result in some improvement. He states it was in a spirit of good will and helpfulness that he approved of continuing her in the position during the past school year. Although he did not make an inspection during her second year, the school was, nevertheless, inspected by the Indian Agent, who reported in May, 1934, his dissatisfaction with conditions at the school and recommended a change. Upon consideration of the reports received, it was decided to make a change in teaching services for the present academic year. The local Indian Agent was instructed to advise Miss Anderton accordingly. She received the notice before the end of the term and was paid salary in full to June 30th, last.\n\nI do not consider that Miss Anderton was handicapped in securing another school after the date on which she received notice. It will not be possible, under the regulations of the Auditor General and Treasury Board, to pay two weeks' salary in lieu of the length of notice she claims she should have received.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nA. W. Neill, Esq., M.P.,\nAlberni, B. C.\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\n\nAlberni, B.C., August 30th, 1934.\n\nH.W. McGill Esq., M.C.M.D\nDeputy Supt Gen. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nUnder date of July 28th I wrote to Mr. C.C. Perry re dismissal of Miss O.Anderton without due notice etc.\n\nHe sent me copy of my letter to your dept and later copy of the reply he received.\n\nI would point out that while not bound by B.C. laws, your dept is bound by ordinary fair rules and the custom in such matters.\n\nThe law and custom in B.C require 30 days notice before end of school term or the teacher can claim another term. She should have been given notice on June 1st, as all other teachers must. She got it on June 15th and consequently was heavily handicapped in applying for any other school.\n\nThe reason given was lack of discipline. She had served a whole year with presumed satisfaction or why was she taken on for the second year?\n\nThe Inspector inspected her school in October 1933, just after the school opened for her second year and it was not inspected again. The inspection in October could not have applied to the subsequent 8 months of the school term, when then was the lack of discipline observed?\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\n\nHowever perhaps your dept has the right to fire teachers without reason\naltho the contrary is the law in B.C and this took place in B.C\nbut leaving that aside for the moment, I suggest that both in law and\nin equity this teacher was entitled to 30 days notice and she only\ngot 15, hence she is entitled to 2 weeks more salary.\n\nWhere there is no law as to length of notice to be given, it is\ngoverned by the prevailing custom in that particular occupation and\nthere is no doubt whatever that 30 days notice is both the law and the\nlong established custom in B.C. I submit she is entitled to the extra\ntwo weeks salary a very small recompense for losing the opportunity of\nsecuring another school as the other applicants would get two weeks\nstart over her in applying.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA.W. Neill\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6387, File 807-1, part 1)\nOttawa, August 9, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your 15/3/3750 of the 31st ultimo, enclosing copies of correspondence regarding the action of the Department in dispensing with the services of Miss Olive Anderton, teacher of the Cowichan Indian Day School.\n\nAs you are aware, reports received from both Inspector Barry and Mr. Agent Graham indicated that Miss Anderton's services were unsatisfactory. As there is a large enrolment at this school, the Department considered, in view of the reports received, that it was advisable to make a change in the teaching services. Consequently, Mr. Graham was advised on June 9th to notify Miss Anderton that her services would not be required after the close of the academic year 1933-34.\n\nIndian day schools are administered solely by the Department of Indian Affairs, and while we usually employ, in British Columbia, teachers holding B.C. certificates, the Department is not obliged to do so. Any regulations made by the provincial government of British Columbia in connection with the engagement or dismissal of teachers do not apply to Indian day schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nDear Sir:\n\nBeing Missionary to the Cowichan Indians, I am in charge of the Komiaken Indian Day School, which is under the auspices of the Catholic Church.\n\nI would like to know, what are the rights and duties of a missionary who attends to a school which is under \"the auspices of his Church\".\n\nThere is one instance specially on which I would like to have informations. It is about the attendance of the children. Here many are not attending, or are attending very irregularly. Now what is the duty of the missionary and the teacher regarding those children. Is it enough for the teacher to show the register to the Agent, at his monthly visit, or is he obliged to call the attention of the Agent to the absence of a pupil after a certain number of days. If you would like more informations about the situation, I could give more details.\n\nRe: Religious instruction at the Koksilah Day School. Answering my letter of the 8 Jan, Mr Phelan on the 13 Jan, 1936, sent me a copy of a letter to Rev. J. Welch, Ottawa, Sept 18, 1922, regulating the matter. Here again I would like to have a few informations. The letter says that \"the school should be conducted along the undenominational lines.\" Is there any positive rules made by the Department regarding such schools, or are rules made for each case.\n\nThe actual teacher is having the Lord's prayer said, thus following what is done in the schools of the province. Is that according to the agreement. This matter was referred to the local Agent, who apparently could not reach any decision.\n\nRe; admission of a child to Kuper School. Gaspard Elliot, child of a half-breed father and an indian mother, who were never legally married, was admitted to Kuper Island School, in April or May 1935. The Principal, not knowing the exact status of the child, referred the case to the Agent, who said the child...\nwould have to be dismissed. Meantime the child's father went to the school to claim the child. The Principal told him that the child was his and that he could take him at once. But the father refused to take him, saying that he would be back soon to get him. He never came for him and so the Principal sent the child to his mother. I was asked to take up the matter, by the mother who since a few years is the sole supporter of the child, being separated from her husband.\n\nI spoke to the Agent about it who told me that the child could not be admitted to any Indian School, being a half-breed, and could not go to Kuper specially as it was against the will of his father. As to be admitted to an Indian School, I know that some of his cousins, Elliots and half-breeds also are attending the Chilliwack School. The Principal at Kuper Island is willing to accept the child, as long as a decision would be given by the Department. As I was told that it was by special request that the Elliots were admitted at Chilliwack, I make the same request for this child, and a sister of his who never attended school.\n\nAs to go against the will of his father, may I asked for a decision from the Department. The mother was allowed to have her children baptised as catholic. She is the only one looking after them now.\n\nAssuring you of my good will to act according to any decision given by the Department, I would like to excuse myself for sending this letter to you. As I did not know who would have to study those questions, I thought the best was to send them all to you.\n\nObediently Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMissionary to the Cowichan Indians.\n\nP.S. Religious instructions at Koksilah. I have been going there after school hours. But I noticed that children are not very willing to stay after school time. Moreover the teacher is taking some children home in her car; of which ride they are deprived when they have to stay. The situation would be worse yet if general transportation was practiced. So if the agreement regarding religious instruction would stand for, I would ask for a certain time during school hours.\n\nYours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6387, File 807-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nRELIGION OF CHILDREN\n\nIn many places in the foregoing list of children it will be noted that, while the original religion is given as Roman Catholic, some of the children in the family are shown as members of the United Church of Canada, and in several cases, where children have returned from the Alberni Indian Residential School to a local Indian Day School, it will be noted that they are again being considered as Roman Catholics, and receiving religious instruction from the local Catholic priest as such.\n\nI particularly wish to bring to the attention of the Indian Affairs Branch the following extraordinary situation which has arisen in the Cowichan Agency.\n\nAs will be seen from the study of the Statistical Analysis of the Child Population as given in this Report, out of the total of 279 children 244 are Roman Catholics now, 26 United Church now, and 9 doubtful. Of the 26 who are now United Church the overwhelming majority were previously Roman Catholic.\n\nIt appears that when Roman Catholic parents wish to send their Roman Catholic children to an Indian Residential School there is no religious accommodation available at Kuper Island. The following practice has then been followed. The children in question were received into the United Church to permit of their being called Protestants, and were then sent to either the Alberni Indian Residential School or to Coqualeetza Indian Residential School as members of the United Church of Canada. It will be seen from the lists given in an earlier part of this report that the other members of the family, including the younger children, have remained Roman Catholic, and with these so-called United Church children have, for one reason or another, returned from the Residential Schools to the Indian Day Schools, they have, in the majority of cases, reverted to their original Roman Catholic church affiliation. They have, of course, always been considered as Roman Catholics by the authorities of that church, and I have satisfied myself that their names appear on the Baptismal Register of the Roman Catholic Church along with those of their brothers and sisters.\n\nIt would appear that the practice reported above has been followed in order to circumvent the strict regulations of the Indian Affairs Branch with reference to the admission of Catholic children to a Protestant Indian Residential School, and I would certainly recommend that the necessary steps be taken to put an end to the above practice.\n\nNECESSITY FOR MORE INDIAN DAY SCHOOL ACCOMMODATION.\n\nFrom a study of the Statistical Analysis of Child Population in the Duncan area it would appear that there are some 166 children of school age and 92 children under school age. Of the above number 30 are at present attending Indian Residential Schools, 13 being at Coqualeetza and 17 at Kuper Island.\n\nSeventy-one children are, or have been, attending day schools, 39 going to the Cowichan Indian Day School, and 32 to the Koksilah Indian Day School. Sixty-five children of school age do not appear to be receiving instruction in any schooling whatsoever. 40% of the school population is not\nESTABLISHMENT OF A CONSOLIDATED IMPROVED INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nWhen the 39 children at present attending the Cowichan Indian Day School, and the 65 children of school age not at present attending any school, are taken into consideration it would appear that an improved Indian Day School to accommodate some 100 children is required.\n\nIt further appears that, as practically all these children belong to the Roman Catholic Church, the proposed Consolidated Day School should be administered under Catholic auspices.\n\nIt will be understood, of course, that some form of transportation to and from school daily will be required for the majority of the children. This matter is discussed on another page of this report.\n\n(a) Location of Proposed School.\n\nAfter an examination of various possible sites for a school it would appear that the best available is at a point on the South Trunk Road, adjoining the block at present owned by the Catholic Church.\n\nThe actual site which I considered the most suitable would include some 4 or 5 acres at present part of the Cowichan Indian Reserve and owned by Mrs. Sammy Bob. This site is about 2\u00bd miles from Duncan, and about \u00bd mile from the Cowichan Catholic Rectory and the Convent Boys' Residential School, administered by the Sisters of St. Anne. The actual land suggested for school purposes is more or less level, and at least 4 or 5 acres would be necessary to provide for a playing field and a large school garden of at least an acre, where the majority of fruit and vegetables used in the school dining room would be grown. It is not suggested that the boys attending this proposed school should engage in farming operations but it is suggested that part of their regular vocational training should consist of instructions in the care of a large garden.\n\nThere is a satisfactory well on the Catholic property adjoining the site of the proposed school, and from an examination of the slope of the land, etc., it is considered that it would not be difficult to find a sufficient water supply by sinking a well to bed rock.\n\n(b) Suggested Accommodation.\n\nTo provide suitable vocational facilities for the children of this area it would be necessary to have one Primary Division working on an All Day Plan, a Girls' Division, and a Boys' Division.\n\nThe girls and boys might well be given academic instructions on the Half Day Plan, in which the girls' classroom would be used for the junior girls in the morning and the senior girls in the afternoon, while in the boys' classroom the senior boys would receive academic instruction in the morning and the junior boys in the afternoon.\nSuggested Accommodation (continued)\n\nDuring the morning session while the junior girls are working in the classroom the senior girls would receive vocational instruction including practical work in Arts and Crafts. Some of these girls in turn would be responsible for the preparation of the mid-day meal provided for all children attending the school. In the afternoon when the senior girls are in the classroom, the junior girls might well receive suitable vocational instruction.\n\nDuring the morning session while the senior boys are in the classroom the junior boys should be instructed in manual training, work in the garden, etc. Similar work, but of a more advanced nature, should be undertaken by the senior boys in the afternoon while the junior boys are in the classroom.\n\n(c) Necessary Accommodation\n\nTo carry out a plan such as suggested in this report four classrooms would be necessary, one to accommodate the Primary Division, one for the girls, one for the boys, and one for girls' work in Arts and Crafts, including sewing, wool work, basket making, etc. A boys' manual training shop might well be established in the basement which would, no doubt, also accommodate the necessary kitchen. A large room which might be used for the dual purpose of an Assembly Hall and dining room would also be required, together with store room, boys' and girls' wash rooms, and toilet accommodation. No dormitory accommodation would be necessary.\n\nThis is only intended to be a rough outline of the accommodation which would be required, as it is not considered necessary to go into detail at the present time. Bathrooms would also be required.\n\n(d) Staff.\n\nThree regular teachers would be required for classroom work, a male teacher being employed in the Boys' Division. A qualified manual training instructor who could also supervise gardening operations, a kitchen supervisor, and an instructress in Arts and Crafts for the girls would also be required. With a school of this size a part-time principal would be necessary.\n\nThe suggested location of the school is unique in that the local Catholic missionary priest could no doubt act as part-time principal, and, with the exception of the two male members of the staff, all the other positions might well be filled by Sisters of St. Anne, living accommodation for whom is, I understand, available at the nearby Convent.\n\nTRANSPORTATION\n\nFrom the information given on pages 1 to 9 inclusive, and the study of the attached map, it will be clear that the odd pupils available for this school are distributed roughly in a circle nearly 10 miles in circumference, which includes Duncan, Koksilah, Clem-Clem-Alits, the Stone Church, Knipsen, and the Trunk Road between Duncan and the present Cowichan Indian Day School.\nTRANSPORTATION (continued)\n\nTo gather these children daily for school a large covered bus would leave Duncan and travel around the circle via Koksilah, Clem-Clem-Alita, the Stone Church, and Knipsen, to the proposed school. The return journey after school would, of course, be made in the opposite direction. The cost of this transportation in an approved and insured bus, such as that used by the Duncan Consolidated School Board for the transportation of Provincial school children, would be in the neighbourhood, though not exceeding, $150.00 per month, or $1500.00 per school year.\n\nSuch a service would be absolutely necessary for a Consolidated Improved Day School to be established in this area.\n\nFUTURE OF THE PRESENT DAY SCHOOLS IN THE DUNCAN AREA.\n\nThere are at present in the Duncan School area two Indian Day Schools, the Cowichan Indian Day School and the Koksilah Indian Day School.\n\nThese schools provide for approximately 40% of the 166 children of school age in this area.\n\nThe Cowichan Indian Day School, administered under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church would be absorbed by the proposed Consolidated School. This school at present costs in the neighbourhood of $1000.00 per year.\n\nThe Koksilah Indian Day School, unlike any other Indian Day School in the Province, can hardly be said to be operated under the auspices of any one church. It is located in a United Church mission field, but the majority of the pupils attending the school are members of the Roman Catholic Church. The school building is of considerable age, and is not of very great value. The approach to the Koksilah Indian Day School is through United Church property, which, I understand, may possibly be sold in the near future.\n\nA survey has, I understand, recently been made on instructions from the Surveyor General's Branch, and with the co-operation of Mr. Indian Agent Graham. I am informed by Mr. Graham that it will be necessary to construct a new approach to the Koksilah Indian Day School, and that this will involve road making, bridge building, and the possible purchase of road allowance from the local Indians. I further understand that the total cost of the above will be in the neighbourhood of $2000.00.\n\nShould the Indian Affairs Branch decide to undertake the installing of an Improved Indian Day School on the location suggested in this Survey, very few children, and those of course belonging to the United Church of Canada, would remain as pupils of the present Koksilah Indian Day School.\nDUNCAN SCHOOL SURVEY\n\nFUTURE OF PRESENT DAY SCHOOLS IN THE DUNCAN AREA. (continued)\n\nIn my opinion it would not be worth while to continue this Day School in its present location, and I would most strongly advise that no money whatever be spent on road making, bridge building, or on the construction of a new approach to this school.\n\nIf it is considered that a small Indian Day School, working under the auspices of the United Church of Canada, is necessary to care for the children in the Cowichan area attending to that church, I would suggest that such a school be located on the Cowichan No. 1 Indian Reserve in Duncan where the majority of these children live. It must be remembered that a number of these United Church children could be accommodated at Coqualeetza Indian Residential School were it decided to discontinue the present Koksilah Indian Day School.\n\nMAP\n\nIt is hoped that the attached map will be of use to the Indian Affairs Branch, as the location of points mentioned in my Survey is shown, and also the proposed route of the transportation bus.\n\nThe above is submitted with respect,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGerald H.

While bitterly disappointed to learn that no complete remedy is possible at the present moment for the sad state of affairs prevailing in the Cowichan Agency, I have the utmost confidence in your determination to accomplish as soon as possible whatever amelioration lies within your power.\n\nIn accordance with your suggestion I will study the situation further in order to know definitely whether your plan or the alternative suggested by Inspector Barry would be more advisable though at the present moment I incline towards your proposition.\n\nWith very best wishes I remain\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Victoria.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of March 17th, with reference to the School Survey of the Duncan area, Cowichan Agency, carried out by Inspector Barry last summer.\n\nAs Capt. Barry is carrying out inspections in the northwest part of the Province, Queen Charlotte Islands, etc., I shall not be able to discuss the matters referred to in your letter with him until about the middle of May, when the whole question of the school situation in the Cowichan Agency will again be considered. I shall then be in a position to make some further recommendations in the matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nOttawa,\nMarch 17, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn your letter of July 23, 1937 you forwarded a survey on the schools of the Duncan area in the Cowichan Agency which had been prepared by Inspector Barry. It was not found possible to include in the estimates for 1936-39 an amount for a new school in this district.\n\nRecently we received letters from Right Reverend J. C. Cody, Bishop of Victoria, urging immediate action in order to provide for proper educational facilities for the Catholic children in the area. I enclose, for your information, a copy of my reply to him.\n\nInspector Barry's report was very carefully considered but the erection of a consolidated school, as suggested by him, would involve the transportation of children for a distance of 10 miles. This would be a rather expensive undertaking and at the same time it is doubtful if we could depend on obtaining regular attendance even though transportation facilities were provided.\n\nYou will note the contents of my letter to Bishop Cody and I would appreciate if you would give the whole matter further consideration within the next few months and let me have your views.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 8,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nMarch 14, 1938.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nThis Branch has received your letter of January 31 also your letter of February 18 in which you point out the necessity for providing increased school accommodation for the Catholic Indian children of the Cowichan Indian Agency.\n\nThe contents of your letters have received very careful consideration and I have also reviewed a report made in July, 1937 by Captain G. H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia. In his report Mr. Barry suggested a four-roomed consolidated school. This would involve driving the children a considerable distance and I am inclined to feel that better results and more regular attendance would be obtained by the erection of two two-roomed schools or possibly three one-roomed schools. Such action would obviate the necessity of transporting the children.\n\nIt was not found possible to make any provision in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1938-39 for increased school accommodation in the Cowichan Agency but the matter will receive very sympathetic consideration when we are preparing our estimates for the fiscal year 1939-40. In the meantime I would appreciate your studying the situation further and advising me whether you favour Inspector Barry's recommendation or whether you would prefer the suggestion contained in the second paragraph of this letter. I intend to write Mr. Barry again in regard to\n\nRt. Rev. J. C. Cody,\nBishop of Victoria,\n740 View Street,\nVictoria, B. C.\nthis matter and by exchange of correspondence with all parties concerned within the next few months I feel that we will be able to reach the best solution of the problem before the time arrives for preparation of our estimates for the fiscal year 1939-40. In the meantime if there is any building available such as a Church basement or Mission house where a school could be conducted temporarily the Department would be prepared to consider favourably providing the amount required for the salary of a teacher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa,\n\nOnt.,\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nSome weeks ago I despatched to your department an important letter showing\nthe absolute necessity of a new day school for the Cowichan District but so I have received\nno acknowledgment of my letter I fear that it may have gone astray. If so kindly let me\nknow and I will set about presenting the data once more. It is possible you may be still\nweighing the matter but at all events I shall feel relieved to know that my request reached\nyou.\n\nPossibly it is advisable for me to mention that the Fathers at Nakusp have\nadvised me of their desire to erect a small chapel for the Catholic Indians at Shawnet who\nhave been complaining of being neglected for some years. I advised the Fathers to follow\nwhatever is the accepted procedure in such cases and trust there will be no misunderstanding\nof our intentions which are purely and simply to give adequate spiritual care to the Catholic\nportion of the tribe.\n\nWith kindest personal regards I remain\n\nDevotedly yours in Christ,\n\n+ John C Cody\nBishop of Victoria.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6387, File 807-1, part 2)\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nC/O Mr. Philip Phelan,\nOttawa,\nOnt.,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing a very carefully compiled report of the number of Catholic children of school age and under now living in the Cowichan District. The official report of the Inspector will bear out the facts as here set forth in detail. The state of affairs is now so alarming in regard to school accommodation that it is imperative that some action be taken at the earliest possible date. Wuper Residential School is filled and there is accommodation for only 30 of the 124 Catholic children of this district. The inevitable result is that the balance are either not attending school at all or else contrary to the provisions of the Indian Act and also contrary to the admitted policy of the department are attending Protestant schools. The Koksilah Day School is not a Catholic school yet at present there are only 8 United Church pupils there the other 19 being Catholics! Since the department allowed some grant for transportation purposes there has been a very marked improvement in regard to attendance but absolute lack of accommodation has only one remedy and that is a new day school. I therefore respectfully request that the whole situation be studied with a view to immediate action before the Indian children get completely estranged from the very idea of school.\n\nDevotedly yours in Christ,\n\n+ John C Cody\nBishop of Victoria.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6387, File 807-1, part 2)\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer you to my letter of March 17 and your reply of April 2 in connection with the proposed erection of a consolidated school in the Duncan Area. I would appreciate receiving from you a report indicating the number of rooms which you consider should be provided in the event of this school being erected. I am inclined to favour a four-roomed school, centrally located, with a basement suitable for vocational training. If you agree with this suggestion you might let me have an estimate of the probable cost.\n\nWould you recommend that teachers' living quarters be also provided?\n\nThe erection of a consolidated school would involve the transportation of the children. What would be the approximate cost of driving the children to and from school? In supplying this information you might let me know the approximate distance of the children living farthest away from the new school. It is understood, of course, that you will make a recommendation regarding the exact site on which the school might be built.\n\nIn the event of the consolidated school being erected what would you consider should be done with the present Cowichan School?\n\nWould you approve the Protestant children in the vicinity continuing to attend the Koksilah School?\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nI remember discussing this matter with you when I was in Vancouver and you suggested that it might be possible to centralize the sweater-making industry. Would you recommend that this work be done in the new school if built or would you prefer to use the present Cowichan School?\n\nAs the estimates for the fiscal year 1939-40 will be under consideration about the end of this month I would appreciate receiving an early reply.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nVancouver\n\nJuly 16, 1938\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\n418 Federal Building,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of Departmental letter 152-33-1 dated March 17 last, and your reply #15/3/2777 dated April 2, I may say that I have given considerable thought to the provision of proper educational facilities for the Catholic children in the Duncan area of the Cowichan Agency. In this connection I may say that I have spent several days in Duncan recently. I had several long conferences with the Reverend Father Louzon, and with him and Mr. Conroy, teacher of the Cowichan Indian Day School, made a very thorough inspection of the ground adjacent to the present Cowichan Day School, and of the area suggested in my Duncan School Survey, Page 14, Paragraph A, suggested as the location for a Consolidated School.\n\nI would ask you to consider the matters referred to in this letter in connection with my Survey of the schools of the Duncan area forwarded to you on July 8th, 1937. The following paragraphs are therefore arranged in the order of the former Survey.\n\nThe various lists of children as given in my Survey, Pages two to ten inclusive, with summaries on Pages eleven, twelve and thirteen is still to be considered as correct though the children are, of course, one year older.\n\nAs practically all the children belong to the Roman Catholic Church, I still consider that the proposed Consolidated Day School should be administered under definite Catholic auspices.\n\nLOCATION OF PROPOSED SCHOOL\n\nShould the proposed Consolidated School be erected on ground adjoining the site of the present Cowichan Indian Day School, I would suggest that extra land be acquired from James Connel (Indian). The extra land required should have a frontage of some 110 yards S.E. along the road from the Cowichan Indian School ground and some 50 yards N.W. of the school grounds. The depth of the completed block would have to be at least 100 yards to give anything like adequate room for the erection of a large Consolidated School with playground and garden facilities.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6387, File 807-1, part 2)\nThis site was visited by Mr. Hoey and yourself in company with Rev. Father Lauzon last June, but I do not think you made any careful examination of the ground.\n\nI find that only about one acre would have sufficient depth of soil for growing purposes, most of the land being extremely rocky. The basement of the school, if such were constructed here, would of necessity be above ground level to avoid rock excavation. There would be some difficulty with regard to the construction of a septic tank. I would point out however, that the worst feature in regard to this site is the almost total lack of a water supply. It is true that there is a good surface well near the present Cowichan Day School but this well dries up in the Fall, and would be entirely inadequate to supply the domestic water needs of a large school. Though I examined the ground with some care, I could not discover any place where we might expect to find water.\n\nI am therefore of opinion that the Consolidated school should be placed on the block of four or five acres, part of the Cowichan Indian reserve now owned by Mrs. Benny Bob. This site was described on Page fourteen of my Survey. The land would appear to be very suitable for playground and garden requirements. Most of it has been cleared and under crop at some time. I am glad to say that there is little doubt that water could be obtained in good quantity by sinking a well some twenty-five feet to thirty feet. Local residents consider that there would be little difficulty whatever in obtaining a good supply of water both for domestic use and garden requirements.\n\n**NOMINARY SCHOOL ACCOMMODATION**\n\nWith regard to accommodation necessary in the Proposed Consolidated School, I may say that after considerable discussion with Father Lauzon, I would recommend that provision be made for the following:\n\n- A stone school building with basement (above ground) of some 90 ft. by 60 ft., and with an extension of about 24 ft. by 20 ft. to the rear of the school. The basement might well include a large hall at least 65 ft. by 40 ft. and 17 ft. high with folding doors so that it could be used either for basketball and gymnasium or as separate boys and girls play rooms.\n- A kitchen of about 24 ft. by 30 ft., a room for the storage of food materials and vegetables and fruit canned at the school.\n- A manual training shop 30 ft. by 24 ft. Main stairs and a road of about 20 ft. by 13 ft. for resident manual training and gardening.\n- Provision would of course be made for a furnace connected with the hot water heating of the school and baths on boys and girls sides.\n\nOn the first floor there might well be a class room for girls on one side, and for boys on the other, each about 24 ft. by 30 ft., a room for the Sisters who would act as teachers, a vocational room, an office for the part time principal of the school, a dormitory that is a class room of some 24 ft. by 30 ft. There should also be provision for a bathroom and toilet adjoining the Sister's room, and a similar bathroom and toilet on the boys side adjoining the vocational class room.\nI would modify the suggestions made on Page 15 of my School Survey and suggest that the staff of the school should be composed of a part time principal who would no doubt be the Catholic Missionary Priest, three Sisters of St. Anne from the nearby convent, one of whom would be in charge of an all day primary class, a second in charge of senior and junior girls, who would work on a modified half-day system as explained below, and the third to supervise preparation of noon day meals in the school kitchen, the preservation of fruit and vegetables from the school garden, and instruction in sewing and other Arts and Crafts on the girls' side. Two male teachers would be necessary, one to take charge of the senior and junior boys working on the modified half-day system explained below, and one to act as caretaker, manual training instructor and gardening instructor. This man might also drive the school bus recommended later in this report.\n\nMODIFIED HALF-DAY SYSTEM\n\nThe primary class will be in school all day. The other remaining children will receive academic and vocational training as tabulated below:\n\n| Time       | Girls          | Boys          |\n|------------|----------------|---------------|\n| 9 A.M. to 10 A.M. | Senior & Junior academic | Senior & Junior academic |\n| 10 A.M. to 11 A.M. | Senior, A.     | V.            |\n| 11 A.M. to 12 A.M. | V.             | A.            |\n| 1 P.M. to 2 P.M.   | A.             | V.            |\n| 2 P.M. to 3 P.M.   | V.             | A.            |\n| 3 P.M. to 4 P.M.   | V.             | A.            |\n\nHEATING\n\nI believe that the best form of heating for the proposed Consolidated school would be by hot water radiators. The furnace in connection with this system of heating either be arranged to burn wood or oil, though I am of opinion that oil is preferable. I do not consider the system of heating would be satisfactory, and would say that it is almost essential that no large hot air ducts be erected in the basement halls as such pipes would interfere with basketball.\n\nSEPTIC TANK\n\nA septic tank will of course be required in connection with the proposed school, and I recommend the Survey Report recommendation. There should be no difficulty whatever in the excavation of a suitable septic tank site, but it may be most difficult to arrange for one on the Cowichan Capel near the present Cowichan Indian Reserve.\nLIGHT\n\nThe light lines of the Namaimo and Duncan Utilities Company are located along the road frontage past the suggested site of the new school on the property at present owned by Mrs. Sammy Bob, but stop about 400 yards short of James Capael's property.\n\nTRANSPORTATION\n\nAs explained in my School Survey Report, pages fifteen and sixteen, the hundred odd pupils available for this school are distributed roughly in a circle some ten miles in circumference as shown on the map previously forwarded to the Department.\n\nIt will of course, be necessary to have a large covered bus to collect these children daily for school and to return them to their homes in the late afternoon. As pointed out by Mr. Hoey, the success of such a Consolidated Indian Day School as I have suggested would depend entirely on the successful operation of the school bus.\n\nIn my Report, I suggested that the cost of an approved insured bus such as that owned by the Duncan Consolidated School Board for the transportation of provincial school children would be in the neighborhood of $1500.00 per school year.\n\nI understand that owing to the increase in the cost of materials, it might now be possible to arrange for transportation at $1500.00 per academic year, that the cost would be more likely to be in the neighborhood of $1750.00.\n\nI am inclined to think that it might be wiser to purchase a suitable bus and permit the school authorities to operate the same. Such a plan would probably mean that one of the male members of the staff for preference the manual training instructor mentioned below, would operate the bus each morning before school and afternoon at the close of the day's work.\n\nEven when capital expenditure, operating expenses, insurance and licence fees are taken into account, it is probable that such a private school bus might be for some $1500.00 per annum or less than the cost to the Department of one from a Transportation Company.\n\nSALARIES\n\nAs explained above, it will be necessary to pay a school principal apart from the teaching staff. Such might well be the local missionary Catholic priest. It may be necessary to pay this man a full time salary and that such a sum of $50.00 per month or $600.00 per annum is reasonable. Each of the Sisters of St. Anne would be in the neighborhood of $60.00 per teaching month, four classroom teachers and one supervisor a total of $2400.00 per year. The male teacher of the boys would expect a compensation with that paid to the qualified male providing similar work. This would amount to approximately $800.00 per month or $1000.00 per academic year. The man employed as manual training instructor, caretaker, gardener and driver of the school bus would no doubt expect $1000.00 per annum.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6387, File 807-1, part 2)\nFINANCIAL\n\nThe probable cost to the Department of a block of six acres of land at present owned by Mrs. Sammy Bob, would be in the neighborhood of $600.00.\n\nSuch a school as I have suggested above might be expected to cost in the neighborhood of $30,000.00 but this is of course, only an approximate estimate. The cost of noon meals, sinking of a well, and operation of a water supply, and garden must be taken into consideration. As outlined above, operating costs of the school would be between $6,000.00 and $7,000.00 per year.\n\nIt will be seen from the above approximate figures that the erection of an improved Consolidated Indian Day School in the Duncan area of the Cowichan Agency would involve a considerable annual operating expenditure in addition to a considerable capital outlay.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nIt would appear to me that the Department might find considerable difficulty in obtaining the necessary funds for the erection of a Consolidated Improved Day School in the Duncan area. It seems to me that the Superintendent of Training and Welfare would be justified in asking for such a large appropriation when the needs of other parts of the Province are taken into consideration. If this is so, and the decision against the erection of a school as I have described in the near future be arrived at, I should be glad to be so informed. If instructed to do so, I shall make my next routine visit to Duncan, again examine the situation, and consider the idea of the erection of a one room Indian Day School itself, and another at Clowhomluts, and another at the Trunk Road. (See page 11 of my Survey Report accompanying map).\n\nThe above is submitted with respect and in the hope of assistance to the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald N. Barry\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nYour File 152-22-1\n\nI have received your letter of September 6th regarding the proposed consolidated school for the Duncan area of the Cowichan Agency. In this connection, I am forwarding herewith a copy of a further report from Capt. G.H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for B.C., in which most of the information requested in your letter of the 6th instant is given.\n\nProvision is made in the basement of the proposed school for accommodation for a resident Manual Training Instructor and Gardener, who also could probably act as janitor. It would not be necessary to provide living quarters for the staff composed of three Sisters of St. Ann from the nearby convent, the local Catholic Priest as part-time Principal, and two male teachers who could arrange for board and lodging either at the local mission house or in the nearby village.\n\nCapt. Barry estimates the cost of the proposed school at $30,000, with an annual operating cost of approximately $7000.\n\nThe present Cowichan Day School building could be used in connection with the manufacture of Cowichan sweaters, and other woolen articles, under the supervision of the school, or used to advantage as a community hall. If we are to endeavor to centralize the sweater making industry in the Duncan and Koksilah sections of the Cowichan Agency, I consider it should be in a small building apart from the main school, but under the direct supervision of a member of the school staff at least during the experimental stage. A start could be made in a small way, and the operation extended should conditions warrant.\n\nThe Protestant children available to attend school in the area, should attend the Koksilah Day School and continue to do so until such time as arrangements, as suggested by Capt. Barry in the penultimate paragraph of the Duncan School survey, could be made.\n\nThe advantages of a consolidated school, such as is proposed in this case, would be:\n\n(1) A graded school, as against 2 or 3 ungraded schools.\n(2) Better facilities for vocational training, manual training and school gardens.\n(3) The children would receive a midday meal.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nThe main...\nThe main disadvantage, if not the only one, is that transportation of pupils would be necessary. This, however, has been successfully overcome in connection with Provincial Government schools in the same area and I doubt, once proper arrangements are made and under way, that we should have any difficulty in this respect.\n\nI would recommend that the Department proceed with arrangements for the construction in the Duncan area of an improved consolidated Day School along the lines suggested by Inspector Barry, when funds are available. The alternative is the construction of two or three Day Schools, involving a capital outlay of approximately $10,000.00.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMajor D.

As pointed out by Mr. Hoey, the success of such a Consolidated Indian Day School as I have suggested would depend entirely on the successful operation of the school bus.\n\nIn my Report, I suggested that the cost of an approved and insured bus such as that owned by the Duncan Consolidated School Board for the transportation of provincial school children would be in the neighborhood of $1500.00 per school year.\n\nI understand that owing to the increase in the cost of materials, it might now be possible to arrange for transportation at $1500.00 per academic year, that the cost would be more likely to be in the neighborhood of $1750.00.\n\nI am inclined to think that it might be wiser to purchase a suitable bus and permit the school authorities to operate this. Such a plan would probably mean that one of the male members of the staff for preference the manual training instructor mentioned below, would operate the bus each morning before school and each afternoon at the close of the day's work.\n\nEven when capital expenditure, operating expenses, insurance and licence fees are taken into account, it is probable that such a private school bus might be for some $1500.00 operated per annum or less than the cost to the Department of one hired from a Transportation Company.\n\nSALARIES\n\nAs explained above, it will be necessary to have a school principal apart from the teaching staff. Such a principal might well be the local missionary Catholic priest. It would not be necessary to pay this man a full time salary and I would suggest that such a sum of $50.00 per month or $600.00 per annum would be reasonable. Each of the Sisters of St. Anne would no doubt expect in the neighborhood of $600.00 per teaching month or for the two class room teachers and one supervisor a total of $1800.00 per year. The male teacher for the boys would expect a salary in accordance with that paid to the qualified male provincial teachers doing similar work. This would amount to approximately $100.00 per month or $1000.00 per academic year. The man selected as manual training instructor, caretaker, gardener and possibly operator of the school bus would no doubt expect $100.00 per calendar month or $1200.00 per annum.\n\nThe salaries would therefore amount to a sum of approximately $4600.00 per annum.\nFINANCIAL\n\nThe probable cost to the Department of a block of six acres of the land at present owned by Mrs. Sammy Bob, would be in the neighborhood of $600.00.\n\nSuch a school as I have suggested above might be expected to cost in the neighborhood of $30,000.00 but this is of course, only an approximate estimate. The cost of noon meals, sinking of a well, and operation of a water supply, and garden must be taken into consideration. As outlined above, operating costs of the school would be between $6,000.00 and $7,000.00 per year.\n\nIt will be seen from the above approximate figures that the erection of an improved Consolidated Indian Day School in the Duncan area of the Cowichan Agency would involve a considerable annual operating expenditure in addition to a considerable capital outlay.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nIt would appear to me that the Department might find considerable difficulty in obtaining the necessary funds for the erection of Consolidated Improved Day School in the Duncan area. It might be that the Superintendent of Training and Welfare would not feel justified in asking for such a large appropriation when the needs of other parts of the Province are taken into consideration. If this is so, and the decision against the erection of any such school as I have described in the near future be arrived at, I should be glad to be so informed. If instructed to do so, I should on my next routine visit to Duncan, again examine the ground with the idea of the erection of a one room Indian Day School at Duncan itself, and another at Clemoelmelts, and possibly one on the Trunk Road, (see page 11 of my Survey Report and accompanying map).\n\nThe above is submitted with respect and in the hope that it may be of assistance to the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGerald H. Barry\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nEnc.\nSept. 21, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received your letter of September 6th regarding the proposed consolidated school for the Duncan area of the Cowichan Agency. In this connection, I am forwarding herewith a copy of a further report from Capt. G.H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for B.C., in which most of the information requested in your letter of the 6th instant is given.\n\nProvision is made in the basement of the proposed school for accommodation for a resident Manual Training Instructor and Gardener, who also could probably act as janitor. It would not be necessary to provide living quarters for the staff composed of three Sisters of St. Ann from the nearby convent, the local Catholic Priest as part-time Principal, and two male teachers who could arrange for board and lodging either at the local Mission house or in the nearby village.\n\nCapt. Barry estimates the cost of the proposed school at $30,000, with an annual operating cost of approximately $7000.\n\nThe present Cowichan Day School building could be used in connection with the manufacture of Cowichan sweaters, and other woolen articles, under the supervision of the school, or used to advantage as a community hall. If we are to endeavor to centralize the sweater making industry in the Duncan and Koksilah sections of the Cowichan Agency, I consider it should be in a small building apart from the main school, but under the direct supervision of a member of the school staff, at least during the experimental stage. A start could be made in a small way, and the operation extended should conditions warrant.\n\nThe Protestant children available to attend school in the area, should attend the Koksilah Day School and continue to do so until such time as arrangements, as suggested by Capt. Barry in the penultimate paragraph of the Duncan School survey, could be made.\n\nThe advantages of a consolidated school, such as is proposed in this case, would be:\n\n(1) A graded school, as against 2 or 3 ungraded schools.\n\n(2) Better facilities for vocational training, manual training and school gardens.\n\n(3) The children would receive a midday meal.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nThe main...\nThe main disadvantage, if not the only one, is that transportation of pupils would be necessary. This, however, has been successfully overcome in connection with Provincial Government schools in the same area and I doubt, once proper arrangements are made and under way, that we should have any difficulty in this respect.\n\nI would recommend that the Department proceed with arrangements for the construction in the Duncan area of an improved consolidated Day School along the lines suggested by Inspector Barry, when funds are available. The alternative is the construction of two or three Day Schools, involving a capital outlay of approximately $10,000.00.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, October 4, 1938.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI should appreciate it if you would forward, at your earliest convenience, a few of the pamphlets relating to your septic tank installation at public schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nCaustic Sanitation, Limited,\nDundas,\nOntario.\nOttawa, October 4, 1938.\n\nRe: Cowichan Agency Consolidated School\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 21st ultimo and also a report relating to the above noted subject, received by you from Inspector Barry, attached thereto.\n\nThis report, dated July 16, 1938, together with Inspector Barry's report dated March 17, last, enables us to grasp very easily the existing conditions and the educational needs of the Duncan area.\n\nI naturally hesitate to comment upon the proposals and recommendations submitted to the Department by men who are thoroughly familiar with local conditions and who have made a very thorough inspection of the district. I should state, however, that it is not at all likely that I can secure an appropriation of $30,000 for the construction of a consolidated school in the Duncan area this year. We had a somewhat unfortunate experience in the construction of the Port Simpson school. It would appear that when we depart from the construction of one or two room schools the cost seems out of proportion.\n\nWhat I really had in mind with respect to the Duncan area was a square four room school with full basement accommodation. This basement, in my judgment, should be approximately two thirds underground, thoroughly lighted and equipped for vocational instruction and the necessary facilities for providing, not a noonday meal, but a noonday lunch. This lunch should consist of biscuits, supplied by the Department; broth or soup and any additional supplies the pupils might care to bring with them from their homes. I dislike the thought of providing living accommodation for any member of the staff in the school. If such living accommodation is really necessary, we might, later, convert a cottage on the school grounds, in which the caretaker or the manual instructor could live. Is a septic tank really necessary? I am sending forward, under separate cover, pamphlet dealing with a comparatively inexpensive set-up that might be suitable at the consolidated school.\n\nI have learned from experience that worthwhile vocational instruction - boat building, auto mechanics, hand loom weaving, etc. - is inseparable from a certain amount of vibration, hence the desirability of making provision for this instruction in the basement of the building. If the land on which the school is to be established is of rock formation, may I suggest that consideration be given to the construction of the school as such and the construction of an additional -\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nan additional building for vocational studies.\n\nI am personally in favour of securing the five acres owned by Mrs. Sammy Bob, referred to in Inspector Barry's report. I would have to be assured, however, that there was an adequate supply of water at this site, and I should like to have, also, an expression of opinion from you with respect to the removal of the present day school to the new site. I was very much impressed by the suggestion you made in conversation to me with respect to the desirability of combining educational effort and vocational effort, particularly the production of Cowichan sweaters. I am anxious to know therefore, if it would be practical to move the day school or if it is close enough on the present site to permit its use for vocational work (sweater production).\n\nI have intimated that the new school should have full basement accommodation. Upstairs there should be a main hallway running from the front to the back. On the left there should be two classrooms, separated by folding doors. This would enable these classrooms to be used as an auditorium for meetings of Indian parents, adult education, the display of pictures, etc. On the right hand side we might have two smaller rooms and perhaps a principal's room or principal's office. I have been informed that in eastern cities school boards are providing good size classrooms with full basement accommodation for less than $5,000 per room. In view of this fact, I think we should be able to construct the school at Duncan for a cost not exceeding $20,000.\n\nThis school, when completed, should be placed in charge of fully qualified, up to date teachers. Such teachers, I feel confident, can be supplied by the Sisters of St. Anne if they are anxious to assume this responsibility. There is no need whatever, in my judgment, for a Principal other than the Sister Superior, in charge. Our experience at the Qu'Appelle Day School, where we have an enrolment of 334 with the Sisters of St. Anne in charge, has been very satisfactory. To have a clergyman nominally in control, as Inspector Barry suggests, might in my judgment lead to friction and to certain misunderstandings. However, this is a mere detail of administration that can be given consideration later.\n\nAre there any four room public schools with full basement accommodation close to Vancouver or Victoria? If there are, I would certainly appreciate receiving a rough sketch map of one of these schools and also a statement indicating the original cost.\n\nIn view of the fact that our estimates are under consideration, anything you can do to send forward this information within the next week or so will be deeply appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, September 2, 1939.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI am anxious that you should discuss with Inspector Barry, just as soon as you can conveniently do so, the organization of a staff to take charge of the Cowichan Consolidated School.\n\nI have discussed with Mr. Phelan in a general way the organization of this staff, and we have agreed that the instructional duties should be taken over by the Sisters of St. Anne. Mr. Phelan and I are of the opinion that at least three Sisters will be employed in classroom work at the school. In addition to this, a fully qualified vocational instructor should be employed and a caretaker might be in a position to drive the bus.\n\nFather Lauzon called at my office a few days ago and discussed with me very thoroughly and at considerable length the operation of this particular school. The Priest expressed the opinion that for a number of reasons a clergyman should be appointed principal, and that for this service the clergyman should receive a nominal salary. Mr. Phelan and I have given this suggestion a great deal of serious consideration, and we are not at all satisfied that the appointment of a priest as principal would be likely to prove satisfactory. This priest, as I understand it, would only visit the school intermittently and would not be responsible for giving instruction in the sense that we usually speak of instruction. It is our opinion, therefore, that for the first year at least the Sisters of St. Anne should be placed definitely in charge and made responsible for the progress of the school. If who set-up can, if necessary, be reviewed at the end of the year, with the object of making certain adjustments, if experience convinces us that such adjustments are necessary.\n\nIt may be difficult to secure a vocational instructor equally well qualified in auto mechanics, boat building, elementary agriculture, etc. If this difficulty is experienced, consideration might be given to the desirability of employing a vocational instructor at Kuper Island and of having these men exchange places for a couple of months in the year. The school at Cowichan is, as you know, an experiment in Indian educational effort. If the cost can be kept down to a reasonable figure and a worthwhile educational program provided, there is no reason why somewhat similar schools should not be established throughout the Dominion. It is our intention, therefore, to\n\nfollow -\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nfollow this experiment with the utmost interest from month to month. A good deal, of course, will depend upon how the work of the school is organized at the start. It might be well to have Inspector Barry, if he can do so, spend a week over there in the organization of the classroom work.\n\nI should like to have from you, also, a recommendation with respect to the teacher now in charge of the day school at Cowichan - Mr. Conway. Is it your intention to transfer him to another school? You made a suggestion on one occasion that it was your intention to centralize the Cowichan sweater industry, using perhaps the old school building for this purpose. Is it still your intention to do this?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir;\n\nI have received your letter of Oct. 2, last, and am answering at once.\n\nFirst let me tell you that I regret that my last letter was so badly typed. Lack of practice and time were the causes.\n\nMy recommendations, except the one regarding the rest room for the Sisters, were based on an assumption, now dispelled by your letter. According to the plan I submitted to Capt. G. Barry, at the time of the survey, which plan I explained to you and Major D. M. MacKay during your visit in Duncan, this school would have been a semi-residential school in as much as the department would have provided a noon-meal to the children, and the older pupils would have spent a good part of the time in vocational training.\n\nI do not remember if I stressed the necessity of providing a hot meal for the pupils, during our talk in Duncan. But I must have, because I always considered it very important for the success of the school. More than half of our children are underfed, not always from lack of food, but from the lack of well prepared food. That is why I figured that a hot meal at noon would have been very useful, and a dining-room required. Also as I said in my letter, Sept 26, last, Mr. Phelan had told me that there were enough rooms, to use one for that purpose. After looking at the building, I noticed that he was quite right. We have accommodation for 150 children all attending school or class at the same time. Yet the actual roll as I pointed out to Capt. Barry will be from 80 to 100. Even if we had 150 pupils, only three rooms would be required, as half of the older pupils would be only part of the time in the class-rooms. So I concluded that one room could be used for a dining-room.\n\nAnother reason why I presumed that a lunch would be served, was that 5 acres of land have been reserved for the school grounds, and only 2 would be required for building and play-ground, leaving 3 for garden.\n\nAlways having in mind that a meal would be served, I also asked for a hot water tank.\n\nWhen I suggested that a rest room be provided for the Sisters, I knew that they would be very much dismayed if such accommodations were not given them.\n\nAs you will notice, in this letter I am just pointing out the reasons that prompted me to make the recommendations contained in my last letter. I am doing so to dispel the impression that it seems to me, you gathered from my last letter, and which would have been that I went out of my way to submit those suggestions. But as I had no chance to talk the matter over with Capt. Barry, who was absent when I passed in Vancouver, I wrote directly to you.\n\nIn the future I will refer everything to him; and he knowing the exact plans of the Department, will decide what should be submitted to your office.\n\nI will also refer your answer to the Rev. Sisters. They can take whatever decision they may think necessary.\n\nI would like to say that what I have done in the past and might do in the future, was not and will not be done in a spirit of criticism, but with the conviction that being in a different position, it may happen that some of my suggestions would be useful.\n\nIn conclusion, I want to say that I certainly do appreciate the cooperation your department has given us in organizing this school district, and assure you of my earnest cooperation in all matters, which in the opinion of the Department and in my mind would be within the scope of my duties.\n\nR. A. Hoey\n\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6387, File 807-1, part 2)\nDear Sir;\n\nIn my last conversation with you, in Ottawa, I gave you the reasons, I had for believing that a priest of our Order should be appointed as principal of the school. You asked me then to try and contact Mr. Phelan, and discuss the matter with him. I tried but did not succeed.\n\nYou had promised me that if I did not contact Mr. Phelan, you would refer my reasons to him.\n\nIt is nearly two months since that conversation. I have not yet received any answer from your office. Yet I feel that it is very important for me to know if those reasons were approved or not, because the whole program of my work of cooperation with the Department is based on them.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare and Training\nOttawa\nOnt.\nSeptember 29, 1939.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nOur Reverend Mother M. Leopoldine, Superior General, is presently visiting the houses of the Victoria Province. Your request for Sisters of St. Ann for the Indian School at Duncan was brought to Reverend Mother's attention and Mother has advised me to write you concerning the matter.\n\nIf I remember well, during our conversation last August when you visited St. Ann's Academy, you mentioned that you would send a letter confirming your request. Not having heard from you since then, we have made no move towards finding the staff which would be required if we have to open this School. Some time would be needed to make the necessary changes in other schools so this is the reason of my letter.\n\nYou mentioned that it would be important that this school should be started in an efficient way, our Reverend Mother is of the same opinion and would like to know as soon as possible how many Sisters will be required and when may we expect to report for duty, that is, if you still have in mind that our Sisters will be asked to operate the school in Duncan.\n\nThanking you for past favors and assuring you of our hearty cooperation,\n\nWe remain\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nTHE SISTERS OF ST.

In addition to this, I have communicated with Commissioner MacKay, in the hope that I can secure from him certain recommendations with respect to the staff that will be necessary to operate and maintain the Cowichan school in the highest state of efficiency.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend L. D. LeClair, S.M.M.,\nCatholic Indian Mission,\nDuncan, B. C.\nDuncan, B.C., Aug. 26th, 1939.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nHad I only suspected that shortly after your visit to the West Coast about a year ago, I would be called upon to continue R.Fr. Lauzon's work, amongst the Cowichan Indians, I would have profited of the occasion to familiarize myself more with your program and plans to carry it out. Nevertheless, Father Lauzon kept me well informed about the work and directives of the Department, and therefore you may be assured of my ever faithful cooperation.\n\nWith the energetic help of Mr. R.H. Moore our new Indian Agent, I have done the utmost to assure the school attendance of our fit children and, as shown by the records, with the result of a double pupilage during the past six months. This has required of us in some instances to act as truant officers, as some of our children would play hide and go seek when school time would come but, at times we met with failure due to lack of any official mandate. Therefore in view of the fact that in a very near future, we will have ample accommodations for all the children of school age, I would highly recommend the appointment of a truant officer. As very likely, this attitude of some children and parents towards school attendance, would vanish rapidly when realizing that now the Indian Act, Sec. 10 #3 will be fully enforced, I would not think that this would constitute enough work for a man even if his services would be extended to the whole of the Cowichan Agency. I feel sure that this request meets fully with the approval of the Indian Dept. Officials here, as I have had at different times the occasion of discussing this matter with them.\n\nWhen Mr. P. Phelan passed through here a week ago, I suggested to him few alterations in the new school building which had previously been discussed with the Agent, Mr. Moore i.e. power running water in the kitchen one inside toilet and one washing basin for the staff one door on the outside from the manual training room and one also from the kitchen.\n\nAfter a proper study of the suggestions, Mr. Phelan assured me he would immediately refer the matter to you. Now, I beg you to understand that I foster the same ambition as the Department that is, to keep the building and the upkeep costs as low as possible, but at the same time, I feel that these suggested alterations would only assure to the staff essential accommodations and guarantee greater order and cleanliness which advantages would I think amply compensate for the extra expenditure.\nMoreover with power, an informative and educational film could occasionally be shown to the children and thus, driving home principles which would otherwise require much time and patience to inculcate. I have a good machine at my disposition and a few excellent films. It would also possibly permit the school influence to be carried beyond the actual years of schooling, through night classes and study clubs, thus keeping up the work long enough to stay.\n\nMr. Phelan must also have given you the results of our talks about the problem of transportation. As I explained to him the system of the past year has proven efficient as far as school attendance is concerned but, it required too much time and too many trips in the same districts raising the costs of operation beyond necessity. To obviate this I recommended a thirty passenger bus. The best offer came from the Chevrolet people who can supply a B.C. regulation thirty passenger bus for nearly five hundred dollars less than any other I have approached. On a two ton or even a ton and a half truck chassis, an all steel bus body would be built in Vancouver. This fact and also the freight cost from the East to here account mostly for the difference in price. As full particulars will be submitted to you, no use for me of stressing this matter. All I wanted was to justify my recommendations. May I remind you that the distance to cover daily would be approximately thirty to thirty-five miles accommodating around seventy children all outside a mile radius from the new school.\n\nI have one more point I would like to take advice about. I have talked to the agent Mr. Moore about it and as the plan necessitates the cooperation of different divisions of the Indian Affairs Branch, he told me that it should be submitted to you. The plan would be to have the manual training instructor execute whatever construction work would be deemed necessary on the Reserves with his older pupils and ex-pupils who have already received proper training and find no personal use for it. The plan would probably cut down relief costs, provide work and keep the manual training at school within the sphere of practical. The young ex-pupils could not expect a man's salary and the pupils nothing or very little as matter of encouragement. The same plan could probably followed in agriculture and in fish canning, also for young women in indian handicrafts. I would appreciate your opinion about the possibility of the plan, then a deeper study of it in detail could be made.\n\nMay I assure of my endeavor in improving indian conditions through perfectly united cooperation with you and the other Officials and for this purpose alone after long hesitation have I submitted the above questions to you.\n\nI am very truly yours,\n\nRev.

(RG 10, Volume 6387, File 807-1, part 2)\nP.O.Box 444,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nSeptember 8th 1939.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nWith reference to our discussion today in regard to the organization of a staff to take charge of the new Cowichan Consolidated School at Cowichan Agency, and the contents of Mr. Hoey's letter 152-22-1 of the 2nd instant, I wish to report as follows.\n\nIn my original Survey Report on this area it was suggested that a male teacher might take charge of the senior boys, and that in such a case it would be best to have one of the local Priests as nominal Principal of the school. In later letters on the same subject I pointed out that neither the male academic teacher or the Priest as Principal was in fact necessary, and that the Sisters of St Ann might well take complete charge of the whole school. May I say that I am in complete agreement with Mr. Hoey and Mr. Phelan in this matter.\n\nAt the nearby St. Ann's Boys' Residential School the Sisters do all the academic teaching and in addition look after the administration of the school. While one of the local Priests visits daily, he is not Principal of the school. A similar arrangement would in my opinion be quite satisfactory at our new Consolidated School.\n\nMr. Hoey suggests that the whole set up might if necessary come under review at the end of the first year, but that for that time at least the Sisters of St. Ann should be in charge and held responsible for the progress of the school. With such a view I am in complete accord and I am of course prepared to give the Sisters all necessary assistance in the organization of the classroom work, even to spending a week in Duncan for this purpose, as suggested by Mr. Hoey. It would be well to have the Sister Superior in Victoria supply the Department with the names of the Sisters it was proposed to send first to take charge of the new school, so that if necessary their past records in the classrooms of Indian schools might be looked up here.\n\nThe above in some degree modifies the suggestions made in my letter to you on this subject dated July 16th 1938 and in particular Page 3 the paragraph headed Staff.\n\nThe minimum number of Sisters needed to operate this school will be four including a Sister Superior. One will take charge of the senior boys, one the senior girls. The junior boys and girls will be taught by the above teachers as senior and junior boys and girls will work on the half day system. A third teacher will be required for the primary class of boys and girls combined. This class would work on the whole day system, though possibly not the whole of every day would be spent in the academic work of the classroom. The fourth Sister would need to be qualified to teach Arts and Crafts to the girls and take charge of the Vocational Work, preparation of lunch etc. This Modified Half Day System is explained below.\nUnder the Modified Half Day System the primary class is either in its own classroom all day or at least is working under its own teacher in some part of the school.\n\nThe remaining children senior and junior, girls and boys, would receive academic (A) and vocational (V) instruction as tabulated below.\n\nHere vocational training may be said to include Indian Arts and Crafts, Sewing, Knitting, Preparation of Native Wool, Weaving, Dressmaking, Preparation of meals etc., and in the case of boys Manual Training, School Gardening, etc.\n\nAcademic instruction includes all the usual classroom subjects, Singing, Health, Religion, etc. Physical Training and Games would probably be taken during periods marked V.\n\nThree classrooms would be devoted to the academic work, one of these being for the primary classes, one for the boys and one for the girls. The fourth classroom would be fitted up for Arts and Crafts (Girls') while the Manual Training shop in the basement would be for the corresponding boys' classes.\n\n| Time   | Girls: | Boys: |\n|--------|--------|-------|\n|        | Senior | Junior| Senior | Junior|\n| 9 a.m. | A      | A     | A      | A     |\n| 10 a.m.| A      | V     | A      | V     |\n| 11 a.m.| V      | A     | V      | A     |\n| Noon   | Lunch and recreation for all |\n| 1 p.m. | A      | V     | V      | A     |\n| 2 p.m. | V      | A     | A      | V     |\n| 3 p.m. | V      | A     | A      | V     |\n\nWith particular reference to paragraph four of Mr. Hoey's letter of the 2nd instant, I may say that in my opinion it would be much better to have a manual training instructor here who could also operate the school bus. Such an instructor should be employed for work at the new Cowichan School quite apart from any instructor at Kuper Island Indian Residential School, where one of the Brothers as a manual training instructor and has other duties as well. Boat building would not be possible at the start of the new school for many skills have first to be learned in the shop.\n\nMr. Conway now in charge of the Cowichan Indian Day School is much better as a manual training instructor than in the position of a classroom instructor. His work was last reported on by me December 14th 1938. His school will be inspected again next month, October. He is a married man not particularly well liked by the Indian parents, and as a rule in a most embarrassed financial position. His manual training work has been very good at his present school and benches etc., are ready for transportation to the new school. I consider that he might well be employed at the opening of the new school as Manual Training Instructor and to operate the school bus. He would have to pass the B.C. Police test and obtain a licence to drive a school bus. This work would take up all his day and a janitor would also be necessary to clean the rooms, though Mr. Conway could look after the heating furnace during the day.\n\nI do not consider that the sweater industry should be in any way linked with the new school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6387, File 807-1, part 2)\nDear Mother General:\n\nWith reference to Mr. Phelan's interview with you on November 10 I wish to confirm the following arrangements in connection with the Cowichan Consolidated school:\n\n1. The Sisters of Ste. Anne are to supply 3 teachers, one of whom shall be Principal at a salary of $1000.00 a year. The salary for the two assistants will be at the rate of $900.00 and $850.00 respectively. One of these assistants should be fully qualified to teach domestic science. The school will open Jan. 3, 1940.\n\n2. Mr. Conway, at present teacher of the Cowichan day school, will be employed as manual training instructor for the boys. His work will be under the direction of the Principal of the school.\n\n3. It is desired that the staff keep in mind that the Department wishes the education to be made as practical as possible in order to properly fit the children for the environment to which they will return on the completion of their school days.\n\n4. The caretaker will be employed on a yearly basis.\n\n5. The Sisters in charge of the school should work in close co-operation with Indian Agent Moore who will be prepared to give them every possible assistance. I understand that Mr. Moore is particularly interested in having a school garden.\n\nThe Rev. Mother General,\nSisters of Ste. Anne,\nLachine, Que.\nThis activity should be given encouragement and arrangements can later be made to have the caretaker look after the garden during the months of July and August when the children and staff are absent on holidays. If required his services, no doubt, can also be obtained at other times in connection with the garden.\n\n6. Arrangements are being made to transport the children to and from the school.\n\n7. I am particularly desirous that the Cowichan sweater industry should have every possible encouragement. Specific instructions in this regard have been forwarded to Indian Commissioner MacKay and when the school is opened you will no doubt hear further from him. I feel certain that the Rev. Sisters will give Commissioner MacKay every possible support in promoting this industry.\n\nThe Cowichan Consolidated school is the first of its kind in the Dominion of Canada and the Department is extremely anxious that the training received by the pupils will be a credit to us. I feel certain that the Sister whom you place in charge will do everything possible to co-operate with us in this regard.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HOEY\n\nOn Friday, November 10, I interviewed the Rev. Mother General of the Sisters of Ste. Anne at Lachine, Quebec, in connection with the teaching services at the new Cowichan Consolidated Indian day school.\n\nI pointed out to her that we wished to engage 3 Sisters of Ste. Anne for this school, one of whom should be a Principal. She stated that she was prepared to supply these 3 Sisters and it was agreed that the salaries would be as follows:\n\nPrincipal .................. $1000.00\n2 Assistants at $900.00 & $850.00 respectively\n\nShe promised to supply one teacher fully qualified to teach domestic science.\n\nI advised her that Mr. Conway, at present teacher of the Cowichan school, would also be employed for the vocational training work for the boys.\n\nI pointed out to her that we wished the education to be as practical as possible. In this regard the Mother General stated that the Sisters in charge of the school would make arrangements for the Indian pupils to visit from time to time the farm operated by the Sisters of Ste. Anne in connection with their white school which is situated adjacent to the Indian school. This would give the pupils practical\ndemonstrations in the proper methods of gardening and farming.\n\nI also mentioned the fact that you were interested in having the Cowichan sweater industry encouraged and that Commissioner MacKay was making arrangements in this regard. The Mother General stated that the Sisters that were going to Cowichan would be instructed to give every possible assistance and if deemed advisable one of the Sisters would make a special study of the making of Cowichan sweaters in order that she would be in the best possible position to assist the pupils.\n\nI informed the Mother General that this school would open on January 3, 1940. I promised her that I would confirm the arrangements by letter and the attached letter is, therefore, addressed to her.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nNovember 8, 1939.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 3rd ultimo regarding arrangements for the operation of the new Cowichan Consolidated school. Very careful consideration has been given to the contents of your letter and it has been decided to arrange for the under-mentioned staff whose employment is to date from January 1, 1940:\n\nThree Sisters of Ste. Anne, one of whom will be Principal at a salary of $1000.00 a year and the other two Sisters at a salary of $850.00 each.\n\nMr. Conway, the present teacher at the Cowichan day school, is to be appointed manual training instructor at the same salary he is now receiving; namely, $950.00 a year. I may say that the Department is not altogether satisfied that he possesses all the qualifications that should be required for the person occupying this position. Consequently during the next few months Inspector Barry should consider if his services could be used in any other Catholic school in British Columbia. If so, the Department will be prepared to favourably consider transferring him to that school from September 1, 1940. If however, Inspector Barry is not aware of any school to which he could be transferred Mr. Conway should be notified about May 1, 1940, that his services will not be required after the end of June, 1940.\n\nMr. Phelan intends to interview the Mother General of the Sisters of Ste. Anne in Montreal on Friday with a view to making final arrangements for the\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nthree Sisters whom it is intended to engage. Further particulars regarding these will be forwarded to you later.\n\nI intend to secure the approval of the Minister's office to accepting the offer of one or other of the transportation companies who quoted a price on driving the children to and from the school. Taking everything into consideration I agree with you that this would be preferable to operating our own bus. As soon as I have a definite decision in this regard you will be advised.\n\nIn view of what I have just stated regarding transportation it will then be necessary to secure someone for the janitor duties only. In this connection I consider that a salary of $600.00 a year, payable on a monthly basis of $50.00 a month for 12 months, would be most suitable. In this manner we would be able to have the services of the janitor for the months of July and August to look after the school garden and any other duties that might be required during that period.\n\nAs we will be paying him an amount of $600.00 it will be necessary to establish a position and have the incumbent appointed through the Civil Service Commission. Before taking the necessary procedure in this regard I would like you to make very careful inquiries with a view to ascertaining if there is some Indian who could be engaged. I feel that it would be possible to have him appointed because if at all possible an Indian should be employed. Please give this matter your immediate consideration and let me have your reply as soon as you can conveniently do so.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nYour File 152-22-1.\n\nI have now before me sufficient information on which to base a reply to your letter of September 2nd regarding arrangements for the operation of the new Cowichan Consolidated School. Perhaps I should deal with the various matters in the sequence in which they appear in your letter.\n\n(a) The question of a staff has been considered at some length and both Inspector Barry and I agree that the instructional duties and full responsibility for the general conduct of the school should be taken over by the Sisters of St. Ann. Some objection to this arrangement has been raised by Rev. Father Lauzon, mainly on the grounds that the Sisters of St. Ann would find it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to maintain discipline among the older boys and that the Sisters could not be expected to stand in the same relationship to the boys outside the actual classroom work as a male teacher-principal. The points brought forward by Father Lauzon are important and no doubt will receive due consideration by the Branch. It is understood, however, that a review of the school's progress will be made at the end of the current school year at which time no doubt such measures as are then deemed necessary to strengthen the administration will be taken.\n\n(b) With reference to paragraph 4. of your letter, I should say that it would largely depend on the respective qualifications of the Manual Training instructors as to whether or not an exchange, such as suggested, would be an advantage. The duties of a Manual Training instructor and janitor at the new school might be combined or, if a decision to operate a departmental bus is made, consideration might well be given to combining the duties of the bus operator and manual training instructor, as suggested.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nby ....\nby Capt. Barry, although I would not recommend that Mr. Conway be considered in this latter capacity.\n\n(c) Inspector Barry considers Mr. Conway's manual training work at the Cowichan Indian Day School \"very good\" and suggests the retention of his services in a similar capacity at the new school with the additional duties of bus operator. Frankly, I doubt very much if Mr. Conway would be equal to what would be required in this respect. He might perform the duties of manual training instructor and janitor but I should not care to trust the transportation of Indian children to him. In any case, it is doubtful if he could pass the test required by the Province to obtain the requisite licence to operate a school bus.\n\nIt is intended to have Inspector Barry spend sufficient time at Duncan to fully organize the classroom work of the new school at which time he could further advise as to the employment of Mr. Conway.\n\nThe questions of the transportation of the Indian children and the centralization of the sweater industry are being dealt with in separate communications.\n\nA copy of Capt. Barry's letter of September 6th, to which reference has been made, is enclosed.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl /AC\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6387, File 807-1, part 2)\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nSussex Hotel,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nNovember 8, 1939.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI am forwarding herewith my report on the Cowichan Indian Day School, Roman Catholic Church, Cowichan Agency, which I inspected on Monday afternoon, November 6th.\n\nIt was about 2 p.m. when I arrived at the school with the Rev. Father Le Clair S.M.M., having been delayed by a conference with the local missionaries dealing partly with the conduct of the teacher Mr Donald McConney.\n\nThough not a recognized recess period in B.C. the children had been granted one and were found playing about the schoolroom quite out of any sort of control. Pieces of paper and rubbish were all over the floor, and there were even pieces of bread on the floor near the door and cups on the desks. These conditions were of course also observed by the Priest.\n\nOf the 57 pupils on the roll some 38 only were present and the majority of these were small beginners. It will be noted from my report that there are too many children in Grade 1, some 42 in all.\n\nThe teacher, who did not at first observe our presence, was engaged in the preparation of pencil copies for the Beginners writing lesson. He is far too much of a High School teacher to deal with this mob of little beginners, though he has of course been given in the past very detailed instructions as to work and methods for such a class.\n\nIn a very few minutes I managed to get good order and to satisfy myself that in the key subjects Grade 1 knew very little indeed, the subject of Language being particularly poor.\n\nThe past two reports on this school have been good, and it is with regret that I have now to report in an adverse manner on the work of the school.\n\nThe older pupils are anxious to learn but the teacher is too much occupied with the Primary Grades to give them the instruction they so much desire.\n\nWhen I inspected here in December 1938 I found the Manual Training quite good. Since that time very little has been done. Some steps have been made which are of use as the children have to use the Manual Training benches as desks, but the work sent in for exhibition in Vancouver was not of much value, being mainly some small boxes.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6387, File 807-1, part 2)\nI spoke to Mr Conway about the many debts he appears to have contracted in different parts of Alberta and B.C. He explained that the local debts had been paid, and that sums supposed to be owing in other places were in fact money put into his invention, a new kind of pen which he has not been able to put on the market. In particular a woman in Alberta, with whom there has been some correspondence considers that she is owed money for board, but Mr Conway says that this was in fact the payment for sharing his \"work.\" I explained that the Department did not like teachers in Indian schools to owe money like this. This subject was included in a previous report, March 1938.\n\nWhen informed that in all probability on the opening of the new Cowichan Consolidated School in January this present school would be absorbed, Mr Conway told me that he expected to be the Principal of the new school and that he had been promised a good position by Mr. Joey.\n\nI suggested that it was highly unlikely that he would be Principal, and that it was possible that a community of Sisters would take charge of the teaching. Mr Conway was advised that while I had nothing to do with the selection of a staff, the matter being one for the Department of Education, I might well consider writing to one or more of the Catholic Bishops, particularly to His Excellency Bishop Bunog O.M.I., to seek nomination should a vacancy occur in a northern Indian day school.\n\nMr Conway was not a success at Kamloops Indian Residential School where he taught the older boys for one year. He did not get on well with the Sisters of St. Ann.\n\nI would recommend that he be informed that the position he now holds will be done away with at the end of December, and that his services will therefore no longer be needed as from December 31st 1939. He should be given a full month's notice if this is in any way possible. I simply could not recommend that he be employed at the new school, for this year's work at the present Cowichan Indian Day School has not been satisfactory.\n\nAs my previous reports on this teacher have been satisfactory, may I suggest that you obtain a report from the Indian Agent before forwarding your own recommendations to Ottawa.\n\nThis whole matter has been discussed with Mr Moore and I understand that he is even more dissatisfied with Mr Conway's work than I am. There has been a great falling off in the work accomplished at the school during the past year, and the teacher's control is now so weak that I can do little for him. These facts in themselves would be sufficient to justify the termination of his services. However the matter might be better dealt with by the abolition of the position he now holds.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H.

Barry's report on Mr. Conway's work during the past year and the fact that I understand from the Inspector that the Catholic Church, as represented by the local Missionaries, is strongly opposed to the appointment of Mr. Conway in any capacity whatever at the new Cowichan Consolidated Indian Day School, I would suggest that the proposed appointment of this man referred to in paragraph 3 of your letter of November 8th, file 152-22-1, be reconsidered.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

Extreme care should be taken in selecting this teacher. I feel that he should be a young man who, in addition to his teaching duties, would be expected to oversee the boys during recess and other times when they are around the school. He could give some physical training to the boys as well as organize games for them.\n\nI presume that such a teacher can be secured at the same salary as has been paid Mr. Conway.\n\nI enclose copy of a letter forwarded to the Mother General of the Sisters of Ste.

Marchant of 4048 West 18th Avenue, Vancouver, B.C., for the position of Manual Training Instructor at the new Cowichan Consolidated Indian Day School.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 18, 1939.\n\nDear Mr. Conway:\n\nI have received a letter written by you, with respect to your employment at the Cowichan Indian Day School. It is noted that your letter bears no date.\n\nI can see no reason whatever why there should be any misunderstanding with respect to your employment at the Cowichan school. When the new consolidated school was in the process of construction, a great deal of thought was given to the employment of teachers and it was finally decided that it would be in the interests of all parties concerned if the school were taken over by the Sisters of St. Ann. These Sisters, I am glad to state, have consented to take charge of the school. The school, therefore, will be in charge of these Sisters from the date of its opening onward.\n\nYour claims for a position on the teaching staff were very carefully and sympathetically reviewed by the Department on a number of occasions. It was discovered, however, that the reports on your work during the last year were in no sense satisfactory; in fact, the reports on your work in so far as the elementary grades were concerned were very unsatisfactory. It was decided, therefore, that you should be notified on or before December 1 that your services would not be required when the school re-opened after the Christmas holidays. It is altogether likely that this notice reached you on or about December 1. This action taken by the Department is, you will note, in complete conformity with the rules and regulations governing the employment of teachers at Indian day schools.\n\nI note with interest your statement that \"you were given to understand you would automatically be\n\nMr. D. M. J. Conway,\nDuncan R. D. I.,\nDuncan, B. C.\non the staff of the new school\". I recall to mind very distinctly my visit to the Cowichan school and my interview with you at that time. At no time during the course of our discussion was a reference made to the new school or to the staff that might be employed at a new school. As a matter of fact, no decision with respect to the construction of a new school had been reached at that time. You did intimate to me that you would like an increase in salary and I promised that your claims for an increase would be carefully investigated immediately following my return to Ottawa. I was accompanied during my visit by the Commissioner for British Columbia - Major D. M. MacKay, who is of course familiar with the conversation that took place at that time. The local Priest of course is not an employee of this Department and is in no sense responsible for the employment of teachers, nor is the Department responsible for any promises he may have made in respect to your employment.\n\nI am always sympathetically disposed toward a man when he loses a position and particularly so if a man is married and has children to support. I think you should discuss your claims for re-employment at an Indian day school with the Catholic Church authorities responsible for nominating teachers for vacant positions, with the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia and with the Inspector of Indian Schools. If these representatives of the Church and the Department feel that you should be re-employed at an Indian day school, the Department will raise no serious objection, provided of course that the Inspector's reports on your work - should you be re-employed - are satisfactory from time to time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Mr. Hare,\n\nBy the matter of my school\u2014Cowichan Indian Day School\u2014being absorbed by the new Duncan day school built here, I wish to point out to you the following.\n\nA grave injustice has been done to me in that I was given to understand that I would automatically be on the staff of the new school.\n\nThis was done by the local priest, Fr. Laurier, and by yourself on the occasion of your visit here.\n\nNaturally, I expected there were two possibilities, the one that I would be informed otherwise at the end of June;\nthe other; that the Inspector would have placed me in one of the vacancies that have been created.\n\nI am married and have a wife and two children to support. I am asking for just and fair treatment and I mean to have it.\n\nMy notice for my house shall be given to take effect the end of this month and I am anxious to have something definite by then.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. I have just heard that the lady teacher at Saugus near Victoria is resigning and I have applied for it.\nOttawa,\nDecember 20, 1939.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant recommending the appointment of Mr. G.P. Marchant as manual training instructor at the new Cowichan Consolidated Indian Day School. He will be allowed salary at the rate of $950.00 a year and his appointment will date from January 1, 1940.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa, December 18, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am today in receipt of a letter from Mr. Conway, teacher of the Cowichan Indian Day School, the contents of which suggest that this teacher has not yet been notified of his dismissal from the Cowichan school.\n\nMr. Conway states that he was promised a position at the new school by the local Priest, Father Lauzon, and by myself. I cannot of course speak for the local Priest, but I remember very distinctly the conversation I had with him at the time of my visit to his school. The employment of teachers at the new school was not even mentioned. Mr. Conway, you may remember, asked for an increase in salary, and I intimated to him that his claim for this increase would be carefully reviewed immediately following my return to Ottawa. You were with me during the course of the entire conversation. No decision had been reached to build a new consolidated school at the time of my visit, although the matter was at that date under consideration.\n\nIt is highly desirable that Mr. Conway should be given a full month's notice and it is my hope that you notified him on or before December 1. I have intimated to Mr. Conway that he should discuss his future with our officials in British Columbia and with the church authorities. If our officials and the church authorities feel that he should be re-employed in one of the northern schools, the Department will raise no serious objection, provided, of course, that his work is satisfactory to the Inspector from year to year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nBox 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nYour File 152-22-1.\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Hoey's letter of December 18th regarding Mr. Conway whose services as teacher at the Cowichan Indian Day School terminate on December 31st.\n\nMr. Conway was notified of his dismissal by registered letter No.17838 posted at Vancouver on November 21st. I personally saw to it that there would be no doubt as to the notification being forwarded in sufficient time to reach Mr. Conway well before November 30th. In addition I instructed Mr. Indian Agent Moore to personally inform him of the Department's decision before November 30th as I anticipated that there might be some claim made that proper notice had not been given.\n\nI well recall our visit to the Cowichan Indian Day School. I was present during your conversation with Mr. Conway and I am positive no promise was made to him with respect to employment on the staff of the new school as the subject of the staff or who would comprise it was not referred to.\n\nMr. Conway visited this office yesterday. He considered he had been unfairly dealt with but made no statement to the effect that he had not received a full month's notice. I informed Mr. Conway that his services were not satisfactory and under the circumstances there was but one course of action open to the Department.\n\nMr. Conway was informed of the contents of the last paragraph of your letter and was advised to keep in touch with the officials of his church and if nominated for one of our Day Schools consideration would no doubt be given to his reemployment on the conditions mentioned therein.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

Short\nDept. of Welfare and Training,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter of Dec. 18th has been received by me and I have very carefully considered its contents.\n\nI am not further concerned with any appointments made at the New Cowichan Indian Day School but I am very much concerned with Captain Savory's report on my work of the past year.\n\nFor your information,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6387, File 807-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nI will briefly recount the circumstances attending Captain Barry's visit to my school. He arrived at 2:15 in the afternoon and left at 2:50. He rushed through a brief inspection and made no comment on the work. The only remark he made was that there were papers on the floor. It was a very wet day and the children had to stay in the building during play hours and it was inevitable that a few papers would have fallen to the floor.\n\nI had 66 out-of-register and had desk accommodation for 26. I had requisitioned desks but nothing came of it.\n\nI object to Captain\nBury or anyone else making a report on my work without having spent a reasonable amount of time on testing the pupils.\n\nThe mysterious word \"Department\" seems to cover a big area but I am not going to hang my reputation as a teacher ruined by incompetency on the Inspector's part. I am taking steps to have a complete investigation made into the setting up of the new school at Duncan. Captain Harvey was not only to me but also to Miss Pennell the teacher at Koksilah.\n\nAs I said in my last letter to you I am not...\nI dare not trust a system where incompetency and unfairness in the inspector's past would again jeopardize the interests of my little home.\n\nI trust however to bring this matter up in review in the proper quarters so that other teachers may not be victimized.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nL.M. Conway\nlooking for favours but I am demanding justice.\n\nI called at the Agent's office in Duncan and asked to see a copy of my report. He refused, stating that he had no authority to show it to me. It is intolerable that such a condition should exist; it means that the Inspector is a liar unto himself. Had I known in time that Captain Savory had given me such a report, I would have demanded another inspection. I would not have feared a thorough inspection by a competent inspector.\n\nI thank you for the suggestion in the last paragraph of your letter but I think...\nOttawa, January 3, 1940.\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am sending forward herewith, for your information, copy of a letter received by this Branch from Mr. D.M.J.

Rev. J. C. Cody, Bishop of Victoria, has requested that instead of using the name Cowichan Indian Consolidated School we refer to it as Ste. Catherine's School.\n\nI can see no objection to calling the school by the name suggested by the Bishop and consequently this name should be used in future communications. Please advise Indian Agent Moore and any others interested accordingly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nFebruary 21, 1940.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSup. of Welfare and Training,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn several occasions I have interviewed Mr. Moore about the draining and levelling of the grounds of the Cowichan Consolidated Indian School, and he informed me that, due to lack of funds, authorization to proceed with this very necessary work has been withheld. It seems impossible that this can actually be the case, as it is absolutely necessary for the health of the children to have the grounds seen to as soon as possible.\n\nPerhaps the Department is not aware of the fact that only about 10% of our schoolchildren have the means to buy rubbers, and as all accommodations are outside, they are obliged to wade ankle deep through the mud, with the result that children, already delicate in health from undernourishment, must sit for several hours in the classroom with wet shoes and stockings. This, as you will readily understand, is very detrimental to their health and may cause lasting trouble.\n\nOur school, so beautiful and spotless at the outset, has been damaged considerably by mud brought in unavoidably from the grounds which are really in a deplorable condition. This, though regrettable, is, however, merely of secondary importance. The children's health comes first, and as this was brought to the attention of Mr. Moore, he advised me to write to you myself.\n\nRegarding Domestic Science supplies I also conferred with our Indian Agent, who seems to be of the opinion that the Department can make no provision. Knitting needles, thimbles, needles and thread, etc., have been supplied, but no provision has been made for the purchase of raw wool and other material necessary for the knitting of Indian sweaters and the teaching of cooking. May we suggest a monthly allowance of ten dollars ($10) from March 1st until the end of June? Our Domestic Science teacher is most eager to do her best to promote the Cowichan sweater industry. If material is provided for the first few months, the knitted articles might be sold later and with the proceeds other raw material could be purchased without added expense to the Department.\n\nEager to assist us in every possible way to make this new undertaking a great success, our Mother Provincial sent our Prefect of Studies on an official visitation of the classes to ascertain the number of pupils actually taught in this school. Forty six (46) were registered on the first day of school, and on the first of February this number had increased to 90, a very satisfactory enrollment, indeed. We both agree that, as Principal, it is impossible for me to do justice to five grades, teach an hour and a half daily in the Primary Grades in order that the Domestic Science teacher may devote this time to her branch of training, interview...\nvisit, and supervise the run of the school in general. Something must necessarily be neglected. To remedy this deficiency, and to make of this school, the only one of its kind in the Dominion, a real credit to the Department, we would strongly advise a fourth teacher, at least at the beginning of the new Scholastic Year in September. Classes could then be more evenly divided, vocational training could be placed on a more practical basis, and, though an added expense, the Department would be better satisfied.\n\nI am happy to have this opportunity of expressing the sincere thanks of the Sisters and of our Indian children and their parents for this beautiful school and costly equipments. We trust that the improvements pleaded for will meet with your approval, and in return you may safely count on the wholehearted co-operation of the Sisters of St. Ann.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nSister Mary Armella, S.S.A.\nPrincipal.\nDuncan, B.C., Mar. 30, 1940.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT ON COWICHAN AGENCY FOR MARCH.\n\nPractically all the agency were visited at least once in the month, while the St Catherine's school was visited several times a week. The attendance at all schools has been good, but a great deal of colds and coughs resulted from the children having wet feet while at school. The condition at St Catherine's school was greatly improved during the month with plank walks being put down, and once again the attendance can be expected to be back to normal.\n\nR. H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 15, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 2nd instant and also certain correspondence relating to the display of films at the Ste. Catherine's Indian day school, attached thereto.\n\nYou are aware of the action taken by the Department with respect to the operation of a cinematographic machine at the Alert Bay Indian residential school. After very careful and sympathetic consideration, it was felt that in view of the fire hazard involved and a number of other factors it was inadvisable in times such as these to display films at the Alert Bay school. It is not the intention of the principal in charge of the Ste. Catherine's school, as I understand it, to have the general public admitted to these displays. I feel, nevertheless, that a great many of the objections that apply to Alert Bay apply in this case also. No one at this date doubts the value of visual instruction. I have advocated its adoption and extension in public schools for a number of years. As a matter of fact, however, I do not know at the moment of a single white school where visual instruction is systematically provided. It would appear that for the time being at least the cost of this instruction is something the taxpayers are not able to meet. In view of this fact, it is of the utmost importance that those in charge of our Indian schools maintain, if they can, a sense of proportion. We shall be very fortunate indeed if we can provide regular instruction for Indian pupils during the war period, without extending this instruction to include visual education. It seems exceedingly difficult to bring home to our school teachers and missionaries on Indian reserves the fact that these are very extraordinary times in which we are living and times that demand substantial sacrifices on the part of all of us.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith application received from the Principal of Ste. Catherine's School, Duncan, to have the Rev. Father Lauzon exhibit films to the pupils, and in the School, twice a month, at a cost of $2.00 per exhibition; such cost to be defrayed by the Department. I am also enclosing copy of Father Lauzon's letter of 24th February, 1940, to the Principal, copy of Mr. Indian Agent Moore's letter of the 25th ultimo and Mr. Inspector Barry's report on the subject dated 20th March.\n\nIn view of the fact that it will be almost impossible for us to ensure that only safety film will be used in these exhibitions and that the use of ordinary film would constitute a very grave risk to the pupils and endanger the School, I am not prepared to recommend approval of the application.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSt. Ann's School for Boys,\nDuncan, B. C. February 25, 1940.\n\nMr. R. H. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Moore:\n\nThe enclosed letter from Reverend Father Lauzon is heartily endorsed by me. To my mind, nothing can equal visual education for these Indian children who have a limited knowledge of the English language. What they see makes a far greater impression upon them than what they hear. By means of pictures they could learn in half hour what, in ordinary classroom procedure it would take us a month to instill.\n\nReverend Father Lauzon's kind offer would certainly be a great asset to the educational advancement of our Indian charges. I sincerely trust that the Department will favor this excellent project by granting the small emuneration petitioned for.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n(Signed) Sister Mary Armella, G. S. A.\nPrincipal.\nCatholic Indian Mission\nDuncan, B.C.\nFeb. 24th, 1940.\n\nRev. Sister Armella,\nPrincipal,\nCowichan Indian School.\n\nRev. Sister:\n\nAt his last visit Capt. Gerald H. Barry, School Inspector approved of my proposal to show educational films at the Cowichan Indian school, provided it would be agreeable to you, and to the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nAs you know we have at the mission, a projector \"Filmosound\" Bell & Howell of the latest type.\n\nI propose to put on two shows a month, in which three reels of educational matters would be shown and one of comic, *inserted*. I have a number of catalogues from which we could choose our programs, and lectures or any other work could be given to prepare the showing of those films.\n\nI figure that the average cost of such a program of four reels would be about $1.50. We can have a limited number of films free, while others can not be obtained at less than $1.00.\n\nI would be glad to show those films, free of charge, but you know what the revenues are in the Indian Missions. So if you think that those films would be a valuable addition to the school program, would you kindly forward to the Department of Indian Affairs, the above proposal, with my request of a remuneration of $2.00 per show, to cover service and operating cost.\n\nTrusting that this effort of bringing one of the most efficient means of education in the new school, will meet with the approval of all concerned,\n\nI remain truly yours\n\n(Signed) Father H. Lauzon.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6387, File 807-1, part 2)\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter with reference to the showing of educational films at the new St. Catherine's School by Father Lauzon, also letter attached from Inspector Barry on the same subject.\n\nPersonally, I cannot find any fault with the showing of the films as suggested, providing they are of General Educational value and not confined to Religious matters; in fact I feel that the Religious side should be left out of it entirely. Then, of course, there are the other questions which come to my mind such as:\n\n(1). Father Lauzon states that the average cost of the show would be $1.50 but he asks that the Dept. pay him $2.00 to cover service and operating cost. I don't know what he means by service but the operating cost would be automatically borne by the Dept. in the Electric light bill.\n\n(2). What assurance are we to have that only safety films will be shown? And how long is the time to be taken up from other other school subjects on these shows? To my mind 1 hour twice a month should be sufficient, especially during the fine weather.\n\n(3). I am certainly very much against the performance being put on except during the regular school hours and then only to the Indian pupils. Night shows, in my opinion, should not be permitted under any consideration.\n\n(4). I would strongly recommend that unless \"Safety Films\" are available that permission be not granted, because I saw a large Community Hall burned down when I was in the north by the films getting on fire from no apparent reason. As I have no idea how much electric energy a machine of this kind would take, I just mention it in passing in case that there happens to be a rise in the monthly light and power account.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nD. M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\n(R.H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nP.O.Box 444,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nMarch 20, 1940.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nAs requested I have given some consideration to the suggestion of the Rev. Father Lauzon, C.M.M., that he be paid some $3.00 per month to show educational films at the new St. Catherine's School, Cowichan Agency.\n\nThe Principal of the school, Sister M. Armella, appears to be in favour of this form of education, and I know from experience that Indian children do learn much from good films.\n\nThe Rev. Father Lauzon was supplied with information as to the location of certain firms etc., from which films could be borrowed. This was done at his request. I have no objection to such films being shown provided no charge is made and the general public excluded.\n\nI should however point out that there are no shades to the windows at the school and though the large classrooms, when the doors are folded back, could accommodate the school, I do not see how the light could be sufficiently excluded to make such a picture show with safety films possible. Again if shown at night there is the question of transportation of the children by bus to be considered. These points should perhaps be cleared up by reference to the Indian Agent, and while the matter may be educational I for one should value his observations and recommendations, particularly on the points raised here.\n\nWithout the Indian Agent's full approval I do not see how this matter can be taken up with the Department. It involves the expenditure of some $30.00 per annum at the least, and with possible transportation charges might be very much more.\n\nOnly safety film should in any case be shown in a classroom, and this would no doubt be made a condition when permission was being considered by the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H.

However, on the other hand, it is imperative that all the preparation of the soil and the planting of the seeds be done prior to the end of April, and unless it is done by that time we might as well forget about a vegetable garden at the School this year at all. I would much prefer not to have a garden at all than one which would, and only could, bring discredit on everyone connected with the School.

The Inspector rushed into my school, spent 35 minutes there and sent to Ottawa an adverse report on work he did not test. He was safe in doing so as he instructs the Agent not to allow teachers see their reports.\n\n2. The work in Indian Schools in B.C. is a hit and miss affair, as it seems to be work outlined by a very variable inspector. A definite curriculum should be laid down and the teacher's work appraised on that standard.\n\n... I immediately obtained another position as Mathematics and Science master in Duncan Grammar school.\n\nI apologize for intruding on your valuable time but I cannot afford to let Inspector Barry get away with ruining my reputation as a teacher by giving me a report such as he gave. It was the first poor report I have received in all my teaching experience.\n\n...............\n\nI am honoured to remain, Hon. Sir, Yours very sincerely,\n\nsigned) D.M.J. Conway\nOttawa,\nMarch 13, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI note from your February report that Mr. Marchant, manual training instructor at the Ste. Catherine's School, has sent in his resignation to take effect at the end of April next.\n\nSimilar information was received in a report forwarded by Inspector Barry regarding his recent visit to this school.\n\nAs yet this resignation has not reached the Department but possibly you have forwarded it to Indian Commissioner MacKay and in that event it will not be necessary for you to take any further action but if you have not yet sent in the resignation I should appreciate your doing so at once.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. R. H. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\nThe manual training instructor at the Cowichan day school sent in his resignation to take effect as from the end of April next. I must say that he has shown some improvement in his work since last month, but even yet he falls far short of what is required for a man holding a position of this kind.\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 28, 1940.\n\nEXD.\n\nReverend Sister:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 21st instant with reference to Ste. Catherine's Indian Day School.\n\nI have written to Indian Agent Moore authorizing him to expend an amount of $10.00 a month from March 1 to June 30 for the purchase of supplies required for the domestic science class.\n\nI regret that you have had so much trouble with the grounds. I have also written to Indian Agent Moore in connection with this matter but, as he has already advised you, our funds at the present time are extremely limited and consequently no heavy expenditure can be incurred.\n\nI have considered your suggestion regarding the appointment of another teacher at the beginning of the academic year 1940-41. I regret that at the present time I can see no hope for securing the funds that would be required for this appointment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Armella, S.S.A.,\nPrincipal,\nSte. Catherine's Indian Day School,\nDuncan, B.C.\nP.O.Box 444,\nVancouver, B.C.\nMarch 26, 1940.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nMr. Hoey's letter 152-8-1 of the 16th instant has been read with care as requested and I wish to make the following observations for your information.\n\nWith regard to the Manual Training Instructor I may say that I understand that the Department has by this received Mr. Marchant's resignation to take effect April 30th No doubt His Excellency Bishop Cody will be requested to nominate the best qualified candidate he may have available to take Mr. Marchant's place as from May 1st 1940.\n\nIt has been explained previously that while Mr. Marchant may not have been sufficiently qualified as a tradesman he was the best available man for the combined position at St. Catherine's School at the time he was nominated.\n\nThe necessary school supplies and desks have I understand reached the school so that the ordinary academic work of the classrooms is being carried on as in other schools.\n\nWith regard to the grounds, a report of which was included in my letter of February 15th, 1940 and Mr. Hoey's observation that the teachers might have kept the children indoors for a week or two till conditions improved, I would point out that when the school was last visited by me on February 14th, some six weeks after the opening of the school, the grounds were in this hopelessly condition, and that as far as I am aware a similar condition has existed for at least a further month. In any case the children had to walk through thick mud to reach the school from the school bus and every time they went to the toilets. The pieces of wood that Mr. Hoey considers might be picked up by the older children were no doubt the pieces put down to cover patches of thick mud to allow the children to get to the school building. They will of course be removed when the ground has dried up a little.\n\nWhile it is possible for one teacher to take up to forty or so children when these are in one or two Grades I have never known a teacher successful with 50 to 55 in a number of Grades. In British Columbia the limit for one teacher was six years ago at 40 and later reduced to 35 I believe. The classrooms at St. Catherine's School are intended and arranged for some 35 to 40 pupils each, as has been explained in previous reports and letters.\n\nIt was explained at great length to the Department that four Sisters would be required to look after the academic and girls' vocational work. The school was opened with three Sisters and very soon the Vocational Teacher, Sister M. Alphonse...\nbecame ill through overwork. I was unable to arrange for pupils from the Primary Division to be promoted to this Sister's Division as she could not take on more work with the Vocational Training.\n\nThe Sister Superior or Principal, Sister M. Armella, next became ill and had to go to Victoria to hospital for a short time.\n\nWhile these teachers are now back at work I have received in the last few days a letter from the Sister Prefect of Studies, St. Ann's Academy, Victoria, Provincial Administration Office. In the course of a letter dated March 14th 1940 Sister M. Dorothea S.S.A. says:\n\n\"I have had occasion, recently, to visit the new Indian School at Duncan, and I am happy to report that Sister Mary Armella has been able to resume her teaching and principalship there since early last week, - On March 6th, to be exact.\"\n\n\"The pupil attendance at the time of my visit was only about 60% as many of the children were suffering from colds and illnesses of one kind or another. I was most interested, however, in noting the advancement of the classes.\n\n\"We regret that it has been necessary, for a time at least, to relieve Sister Mary Alphonse, the Home Economics teacher of the 100-1015 period of academic teaching. Mother Provincial has provided a substitute for the stated period, Miss Somerville, whom the Sisters have carefully initiated into the needs of the class. As Miss Somerville seems to like the Indian children and to enjoy teaching them, I think her work will be successful. I hope the arrangement will prove satisfactory to you.\"\n\n\"Sister Mary Alphonse will now be free to devote her time to Home Economics and she will adjust her programme to take care of Religion and of singing as well.\"\n\n\"Sister Mary Armella has received official notification that the name, \"St. Catherine's Indian School\" has been approved by the Department at Ottawa. The Sisters are very pleased, as is also our Reverend Mother Provincial, who first proposed the name.\"\n\nI am still of opinion that four Sisters are needed at this school if Home Economics is to be taught to the girls by one of the teachers with special qualifications for this work. You will see from the letter from the new Sister Prefect of Studies that a Miss Somerville has joined the school staff at least for the time. I wish the Department to be aware of this fact even if it is decided not to allow her any salary as above the sum being now given to the three Sisters of St Ann at the school.\n\nI am certainly glad to learn that some at least of the vocational and physical training equipment recommended in my letter of February 16th last is to be provided.\n\nSuch matters as the proper fencing of the whole of the school grounds, levelling and seeding of the part around the building and the provision of suitable depth of gravel on part of the ground and the ploughing of a school garden, are not being further reported on as such matters have no doubt received the attention of the Indian Agent and yourself.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 18th instant with reference to Ste. Catherine's (Cowichan) School, I enclose herewith a report by Mr. Inspector Barry on the points raised therein.\n\nIt is presumed from the fourth paragraph of your letter that it is not the intention of the Department at the present time to supply a fourth teacher for this school, and that under the circumstances it will be necessary for the Sisters in charge to defray from their own funds the cost of any additional staff added to the school without authority.\n\nWhile the unusually rainy winter at Cowichan has undoubtedly been responsible for the wet condition of the grounds the situation has been considerably aggravated by the excavated material being left where it was dumped after completion of the school and I strongly concur with your views that the responsibility of leaving the school surroundings in a usable condition immediately after the construction of a new building, is one that should be determined as it is a problem that has occurred at other points. Instructions will be issued in future that new schools are not to be opened until everything is in a satisfactory condition.\n\nThe Department has a report dated December 22nd, 1939, on the improvements required to the school grounds. It is understood that the additional toilets referred to in this report have already been provided, in which case the costs of same can be deleted from the estimated total of $1035. These improvements are necessary and should be proceeded with as soon as funds are available.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIn ...\nIn view of the lateness of the season and that funds may not be available until after the forthcoming session of Parliament to provide fence protection, it is not intended to prepare any of the land for cultivation this season. A sufficient area could be prepared this coming fall and made ready for seeding next spring.\n\nI should appreciate your further instructions in respect to the improvement of the school grounds in due course.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl. /AC\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to Mr. Hoey's letter of March 21st, I beg to advise that I have received a letter from His Excellency Bishop Cody, nominating Mr. P. J. Corcoran for appointment as Manual Training Instructor and Boys' Supervisor at St. Catherine's School, Cowichan Agency, effective May 1st, 1940.\n\nThe Department has accepted Mr. G. P.

We were together in St. Joseph's Seminary in Edmonton, and have been in touch with each other constantly since. He was at the Indian School at Lejac for seven years, and so has a certain amount of experience.

(RG 10, Volume 6387, File 807-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n4958 Rupert St,\nVancouver, B.C.\n18th March, 1940.\n\nYour Excellency:\n\nI beg to submit my application for the position of Instructor at your Indian School near Duncan.\n\nI had an interview with the Rev. Sr. Superior about a week ago, and she said she would mention my name to your Excellency, and to Captain Barry.\n\nI was Supervisor of Boys at Leac Indian School for seven years, and also did general work around the farm. I resigned this position to obtain medical attention for my wife in Vancouver. Since I have been living in Vancouver I have been employed at carpentering work for various people, remodelling kitchens, building cupboards etc. I feel quite capable of doing the work required at the School.\n\nI went down to see Captain Barry today and he assured me that \"if nominated by your Excellency he would endorse the appointment, as he could not personally find anything against it\".\n\nAs I told your Excellency in a previous letter, I have two small children, not of school age, and I badly need the work. If your Excellency is kind enough to send in my name I shall endeavour to give complete satisfaction.\n\nTrusting that this application will meet with your\napproval and that I shall hear from your Excellency at your earliest convenience,\n\nI remain,\n\nvery respectfully yours,\n\nPatrick J. Corcoran.\n\nPatrick Joseph Corcoran.\nSir,\n\nI wish to thank you for your letter, date and file number above noted, with reference to the movement or transfer of children from either the Nokmakah or St. Catherine's schools to the other, unless there are special reasons to the contrary, and that after a child is enrolled in one school or the other that such child must remain there at least until the end of that academic year. This ruling of the Department is just as I expected it would be.\n\nThere is another angle in connection with our Day schools which I would like to have clarified, and a definite ruling from the Department on, and it refers to Sec. 10, s.s. 2 of the Indian Act. My interpretation of the above s.s. is that R.C. children when attending Residential Schools must be sent to Residential schools operated under the auspices of the R.C. Church, and Protestant children attend schools operated under Protestant Church denominations. In the case of Day Schools does that regulation also apply? For instance at the moment we have three R.C. children attending the Nanaimo Indian Day School which is operated under the auspices of the United Church, owing to the fact that the mother of these children is living as the C.Wife of an Nanaimo Indian and residing for the time being in Nanaimo I.R. Then at the Songhees Indian Day School we have a United Church child attending the Songhees Day School which is being operated under the auspices of the R.C. Church, for the reason that the guardian of the child is working at the Shipyard adjoining the Reserve and living on the Reserve at Songhees while he is working there.\n\nIn the case of the former 3 R.C. children I wrote their mother asking that she send them to Rupert Island Residential School, she replied saying that they were attending the day school at Nanaimo and that is where she wanted them to go and so far as their religious views concerned it didn't make any difference anyway as there was only one God and both faiths were going in the same direction but by different routes. In the case of the Protestant child attending the Songhees School the same argument applies, and as all of these children are receiving their education in day schools I hesitate to move them forcibly into Residential Schools of the faith to which they belong, largely on account of Sec. 10, s.s. 2 of the Indian Act which I endeavour to interpret in a broad way. For instance I believe that the s.s. referred to applies to Residential Schools and not to Day Schools. Of course I may be wrong but in my humble opinion I find it strange if the Department has one school on each reserve which is operated under one particular Church denomination and if there are children of another Denomination living on that Reserve that they should have to go to a Residential School of the Denomination to which they belong, instead of attending the day school on the Reserve. I quite appreciate the fact that the Department realise the added cost of a child's education in a Res. School, and I also appreciate the fact that the Department in its wisdom know what is best from all the various angles, and for that reason I would like to have a ruling on the matter and particularly with reference to the cases cited above. I would also like your on my interpretation of Sec. 10, s.s. 2 of the I.A.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6387, File 807-1, part 2)\nI regret having to bother you in this way as I feel that I have been with the Department long enough to know what action I should take in matters of this kind, but it is only since coming to this Agency that I have been confronted with two religious denominations. I have maintained that where a child is attending a day school that may belong to a different religious faith, that we should allow that child to stay there instead of going to the expense of sending such child to a Res. school of its particular denomination, and that further in spite of arguments put up to the contrary by various people I was of the opinion that the section of the I.A. referred to in this letter was not intended to apply to day schools unless there were two schools of different faiths on the same reserve.\n\nI quite realise that I may be entirely wrong and it is with the view of getting put right that I am writing this lengthy letter, in which I have tried to explain matters just as they exist.\n\nYours obediently;\n\n(R.H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nOctober 29, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 20th instant with reference to the Koksilah and St. Catherine's Day Schools.\n\nWhile the Department has always allowed the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada to nominate the teacher for the Koksilah School, an arrangement was made in the year 1932 for the Catholic missionary to visit the school once a week and give religious instruction to Catholic children attending that school. In this regard I would refer you to official letter of November 13, 1936, also letter received from the former Agent, Mr. Graham, dated December 7, 1936. Copies of these letters are enclosed.\n\nI feel that when a child is enrolled at either the Koksilah or St. Catherine's School such child should continue attending that school unless there are some special reasons to the contrary. On enrolment of a child in either the Koksilah or St. Catherine's School it should be definitely understood by parents and teachers that such child must remain in that school at least until the end of that academic year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. R.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSir:\n\nI would respectfully request to have a ruling from the Department on the following questions which have to do with educational matters:\n\n(1). Does s.s. 2 of Section 10 of the Indian Act apply to any school for Indian Children, or just for children attending Indian Residential Schools?\n\n(2). Would you please advise the exact status of the Koksilah Indian Day school? Is it an un-denominational School or recognised by the Department as being operated under the auspices of the United Church? If the former, will my first question about Sec. 10 have any bearing on R.C. children attending that school?\n\nAs you are quite aware there are certain R.C. children attending the Koksilah School who, if Sec. 10, s.s. 2 of the I.A. applies to Day Schools, should be attending St. Catherine's School, if not then who is the rightful person to determine just what school these children should attend?\n\nThere seems to be some confusion about this whole matter and I would like to be informed definitely just where we stand. For instance an R.C. child is enrolled at the Koksilah School for a couple of years and then it is decided that this child should go to the St. Catherine's School and the transfer is made without reference to me until after it has actually taken place. I believe that it might be well if the Department would be good enough to give a ruling on the subject. Should the wishes of the parents of the children have any bearing in deciding to which school a child should go or in case a parent asks that his or her child be allowed to go to another than the one the child has been attending for a year or more be sufficient reason to make the transfer?\n\nYours obediently,\n\nThe Secretary;\nIndian Affairs Branch.\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Very careful consideration has been given to the report on the Ste.

M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\n2. Bella Coola Agency:\n\nThere are no schools operated under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church in this Agency.\n\n3. Cowichan Agency:\n\nSt. Catherine's Indian Day School\n\nThis school was opened on January 8th 1940 as a consolidated school. It absorbed the old Cowichan Indian Day School.\n\nThe school was inspected by me on January 11th when there were 62 children on the school roll. I visited the school several times since the above date. There were 91 on the roll on the occasion of my visit on February 14th but since that date the attendance has increased till there are in excess of 110 pupils on the roll.\n\nThe school building is quite new. It is not necessary to report on this now. Children are brought to school and taken home by a school bus operated by a transportation company. This bus takes children to and from the Koksilah Indian Day School, reported on in my survey of United Church Indian Day Schools.\n\nThere are three Sisters of St Ann teaching at St Catherine's. A Manual Training Instructor and a part time janitor are also employed.\n\nThe attendance this last June has been very small indeed. The Rev. Sister Principal informed me that most of the children would be away in June and that it would not be worth my while making an inspection during this month.\n\nChildren from this district leave the local Indian reserves for seasonal employment towards the end of May. I do not believe that the school should be kept open in June. It seems very foolish to me to employ a large staff and operate a school bus for a very few pupils.\n\nUnder present regulations St Catherine's School will reopen on October 1st 1940. The academic year should in my opinion be one of eight months from October 1st to May 31st yearly.\n\nWhatever course is decided on here should be followed in the Koksilah Indian Day School also, for the reason given above, that the same school bus is operated for the two schools, picking up and depositing children throughout its complete itinerary on the two morning trips and two afternoon trips.\nOttawa,\nMay 14, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 9th instant enclosing letter received from Sister Mary Armella, Principal of the Ste.

We are most eager to comply with your wishes in this matter but hesitate to upset the existing order of the school arrangement until we have explained the situation more fully.\n\nIn the first place we expect no remuneration for the present supplementary teacher, Sister Mary Thecla, neither are we attempting by giving her a temporary and minor position on the staff, to indicate the need of a fourth teacher. But it seemed to us that, during this period of adjustment in a new school, that more effective work could be done by the Home Economics teacher if she were relieved, temporarily, of the one period of class work in question, and being fortunate, for the time at least, in having a Sister free who could do this substitute work efficiently, we arranged the matter for what we considered the greater success of the school work.\n\nHowever, if knowing our intentions, and understanding that the supplementary work is merely a temporary adjustment for the greater success of the whole, you still desire that we withdraw the supplementary teacher, we shall comply with your wishes.\n\nIn the meantime we are continuing to do our utmost to complete the first term of St. Catherine's School to the satisfaction of all and are grateful to you for your ready consideration of the many needs of our new school.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nApril 25, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 30th ultimo in connection with the Ste. Catherine's Indian Day School.\n\nWith reference to the second paragraph of your letter the Department does not see any necessity for supplying a fourth teacher nor are we prepared to approve the Sisters' supplying a fourth teacher without receiving salary from this Department.\n\nI have just reviewed the March quarter return from this school and it shows an enrolment of 108 with an average attendance of approximately 60% of that number. It is difficult to understand why three Sisters and a manual training instructor cannot handle this number without difficulty.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa, April 22, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Dismissal of Mr. D.M.J. CONWAY,\nSte. Catherine's (Cowichan) School.\n\nMay I refer to a memorandum relating to the dismissal of the above noted teacher, dated March 12, 1940, and signed by Mr. W. C. Bethune? It is noted that the letter drafted by this Branch for the signature of the Private Secretary was not sent forward to Mr. Conway.\n\nThe records here indicate that a letter somewhat similar to the communication received by the Prime Minister from Mr. Conway was sent forward to Major MacKay, Indian Commissioner for British Columbia, on January 3, 1940. Major MacKay has not replied to this letter and it would appear that there is little to add to the reports already on file in the Department with respect to the dismissal of this teacher.\n\nI am sending forward, for your information, a letter received by the Department from Major MacKay dated November 12, 1939, and also excerpts from a report dated November 8, 1939, received by the Department from Inspector Barry.\n\nI wish to point out that the one-room Indian day school at Cowichan, to which Mr. Conway was appointed, was displaced by a four-room consolidated school about three months ago. The new school, on the recommendation -\nrecommendation of the Inspector and the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia, was placed in charge of the Sisters of St. Ann, who agreed to supply four teachers to undertake the academic work. Mr. Conway was fully aware of this fact. In addition to the four Sisters, a director of vocational instruction (male) was appointed. Consideration was given to Mr. Conway's claims for this position, but his work as teacher of the one-room school had been so unsatisfactory that he was not acceptable either to the church authorities or to the Department and consequently was given notice of dismissal. It is difficult to see how any good purpose can be served by referring the matter again to the officials in British Columbia.\n\nDirector.\n\nRAH\n\nIndian Affairs.

He will be allowed salary at the rate of $950.00 a year and his appointment is effective from May 1, 1940.\n\nWhile he will only be teaching for two months during the current academic year I think it would be advisable to consider his appointment as temporary and possibly Inspector Barry would have an opportunity of visiting Ste. Catherine's School some time before the end of June with a view to determining how he has taken hold of the work and advising the Department whether or not he considers Mr. Corcoran's services should be continued for the academic year 1940-41.\n\nI enclose staff questionnaire which you should have Mr. Corcoran complete and return to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Even now, jobs in Duncan are non-existent, and it has been necessary to find work elsewhere. This has meant supporting two homes for one third of each year. Had the school remained open for six months, this burden would not\nhave been so undesirable.\n\nI have worked with the Indians for almost twelve years, and like the work, but conditions being such as I have stated, it is with sincere regret that I tender my resignation.\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nPatrick J.

I wish to advise that both these schools opened on April 16th, on instructions from Major D.M. MacKay and Dr. A.L. McQuarrie who felt that a better check could be kept of the children at school than at home. As it happened, this was quite correct but a nurse had to be employed to examine the pupils at school as well as those at home.

With particular reference to the last paragraph of your letter I wish to advise that the epidemic of mumps is pretty well over; no further cases having been reported to me either by the parents or the Medical Officer. However, the principal of the St. John's School informs me that none of the children have not returned to school and the attendance is most unsatisfactory. I am getting a list of these children absent today and will ask the Medical Officer to examine them and if found medically fit to attend school. An effort will be made to get the mounted police to put pressure on the parents to see that a more regular attendance is maintained.\n\nWhile in the question of mounted police, I would again point out that the nearest detachment is Victoria and it is often a week or more before we can have a constable come up to attend to matters of truancy. Some time ago I recommended that one of the local constables of the B.C. Provincial Police be appointed Truant Officer but nothing further has been done in the matter and until some action is taken by the use of a Truant Officer and possible arrest of recalcitrants, we will always have unsatisfactory attendance at these schools.

The father asked me if I would allow her to go to the Ruper Island school as he could not handle her and she simply would not pay any attention to what he told her. I explained to the parent that this state of affairs was his responsibility and that I would not advise her transfer to a Residential school for such a reason. As the girl did not return within a reasonable time I gave her name, along with many others, to the R.C.M.P. as truants and they in turn advised the parent that she would have to attend school or he would be charged in Court for failing to have her do so.\n\nYesterday, we (the Police and I) found out that the girl has been employed in domestic service in Nanaimo, B.C., being employed in a very fine household. Her employer asked me if she could continue in his service as she was very happy and contented. After consideration I decided that she might do so until I referred the matter to you for a ruling. Since then the question has been discussed with the Principal of the school who informs me that Majorie is quite a big girl for her age, and has a will of her own, and if she is suitably employed in a good home the education she would receive there might be just as beneficial as if she was at school, particularly as there is a strong possibility that even we did bring her back she would only run away again at the first opportunity and her next job could quite easily be the very opposite to what her present one is. Personally, I quite agree with this reasoning and feel that under the circumstances it is definitely in the interests of the girl to remain where she is. I happen to know the people for whom she is working and they will see that the girl behaves and is not permitted to go out at nights. I would therefore recommend that this girl be excused from school so long as she stays in her present position.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nR.H.

Sister Mary Dorothea's letter of June 14th which was intended as an answer to the letter you mention stated that some of our teachers in your schools had made application for Teachers' Certificates for the Province of Quebec. We are happy to say that progress is being made in this matter, but licenses will not be issued, I understand, until the close of the current scholastic year, May, 1948.\n\nThe teachers of St. Catherine's have completed forms last May indicating their present educational and professional status. These you must have in hand. Since the Quebec certificates are not immediately forthcoming, I presume that the salary rating will be set for the year 1947-48 on the record of training and experience which you hold. It is unfortunate that the excellent work being done by our Sisters in the Indian schools, as attested by the inspectors' reports, must be subordinated to the holding of certain certificates, but since the salary schedule is set on the basis of professional training, as shown by certificates, plus experience, I presume the grading will be as follows: 1947-48\n\nSister Mary Sheila - Grade I Principal plus Exper. salary $1740\nSister Mary Eugenia Grade I Teacher \" $1120\nSister Dorothy Marie Grade I \" $1120\nSister Mary Charles Anthony Grade II Teacher (accepted) $1500\n\nI trust this answers your present questions satisfactorily.

The organization sheets show that approximately 1/3 of the pupils' time from Grades 4 to 8 was devoted to Vocational Instruction. This limits considerably the time devoted to academic fundamentals and should not be increased.\n\nI recommend that an additional full time classroom teacher be employed and that the room at present used for sewing be converted into a classroom. This involves moving the equipment to the cooking room in the basement, and equipping the classroom with desks.\n\nAn alternative plan is to employ the specialists on a full time basis and to decrease the size of the groups in these classes. The various grades would then have to be organized on a platoon system. This alternative is recommended only if it is impossible to secure a classroom teacher. Apparently this was the plan the Reverend Principal had in mind in asking for the full time employment of the Vocational Training Teachers.\n\nR.F.

Sister recently, his memorandum in this connection, together with the Reverend Sister's letter of July 4th, being forwarded herewith. You will note that on the basis of an anticipated enrolment of at least 113 Inspector Davey considers that the employment of four full-time classroom teachers would best meet the requirements of the school rather than extending the time of the Home Economics and Manual Training teachers, but that as he did not have an opportunity to review the organization sheets of this school which were prepared for the school survey and forwarded direct to the Department, he is unable to make a definite recommendation. If the Department does not wish to make a decision with respect to the staff requirements at St. Catherine's school without the Inspector's report I would suggest that the organization sheets be forwarded to this office for review by Major Davey.\n\nD.

On the basis of the regulation for Provincial Schools this would warrant the employment of four full time class-room teachers without reference to the number of specialists on the staff, and I believe that the requirements of the school would be better served by the provision of such a teacher rather than extending the time of the two specialists.\n\nThe Department has the organization sheets of this school which were prepared for the school survey, and a final decision on this matter should be based on a consideration of these. Unfortunately these forms are not available for use in this office.\n\nR.F. Davey\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools\nSt. Catherine's Indian School\nDuncan, B.C.,\nJuly 4, 1947.\n\nMajor R. F. Davey,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nBox 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major Davey,\n\nRE: 1947-1948 enrollment\n\nWe anticipated an enrollment of 112 not taking into account pupils who may come to the day school instead of returning to residential schools, two families of the district, one with three children attending the Agulmalt school last year, the other with four children who have been nomadic during the past year, back and forth to U.S.A. I may add that there are four beginners that may be added to our list if parents return to Duncan.\n\nThe Domestic Science teacher has four classes daily. If classes have to be readjusted, as we think they will, for there will be 41 pupils in Gr. I alone, 45 in the intermediate room (Gr. II, III, IV) and 27 in the senior class comprising Grs. V, VI, VII, VIII, then there will have to be five classes of domestic science. There are 30 girls in the senior group and most that can be handled in one senior class is 12 pupils, as there are only 3 machines and all the senior girls are capable of cutting and making dresses. One hr. is required for the supervision of preparation of cups and hot cocoa drink for the noon hour. Sister therefore teaches 5 hours a day totalling 25 hours per week. I may add that Sister does any First Aid work plus dressing of sores between the visits of the nurse.\n\nThe Manual training instructor who is now working on 3\u00bd day basis will have to be subject to the same regime if things are to work harmoniously. Otherwise the girls of a grade will be out of the classroom and the boys in, leaving a divided grade, the girls being handicapped academically.\n\nTen pupils are the most that can be accommodated in the woodwork room at one period, but twelve make up the largest class.\n\nUnder the above plan children unable to progress academically can be given extra vocational training enabling them to return to their environment better equipped to raise their standards of living.\nI hope, Major Davey, this information will be what you require.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\"Sister Mary Sheila\"\nPrincipal\nSt. Catherine's Indian Day School,\nDuncan, B.C.,\nMay 17, 1947.\n\nMr. R.H. Moore, Indian Agent,\nIndian Office,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Moore,\n\nLast October the Department allowed us a part-time Domestic Science Teacher.\n\nTo keep the classes uniform it has been necessary for her to work in unison with the manual training instructor. At each change of class the boys of the grade go to woodwork while the girls go to sewing.\n\nThirty-nine pupils comprise the Domestic Science classes. There are two class in the morning from 9:30 - 12:00, two in the afternoon from 1:00 - 3:00. This arrangement provides also for pupils who are too old or under-talented to progress far in academic work to get extra vocational work to fit them for a profitable after life.\n\nSince for the betterment of school and pupils the Domestic Science Teacher has had to give full time. (I would refer you to the time table submitted to the Educational Survey Dept. to see what we have been and are up against) could it not be considered that she be put on full time pay-roll.\n\nI would appreciate an answer to this letter before the close of the school term so that the authorities of the Sisters of St. Ann can be informed before the reappointment of the Sisters for another school term.\n\nI pointed out our predicament to our school inspector, Major Davoy, when he was with us.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrinicipal.\nAir Mail\n\nOttawa, June 16th, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M.

(RG 10, Volume 6387, File 807-1, part 3)\nSt. Catherine's Indian Day School,\nDuncan, B.C.,\nOctober 7, 1946.\n\nMr. H. Moore, Indian Agent,\nIndian Office,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Moore,\n\nI am enclosing with the returns a letter which I hope will make clear the situation I hurriedly tried to explain when in your office last week. I am sending two copies, asking you to please forward the second one to Ottawa, that they too may study the matter.\n\nThe attendance question of St. Catherine's School has been a \"bone of contention\" since its inauguration on January 8, 1940. Since every question concerning the school seems to be based upon the \"Average Attendance\" of the quarterly returns it seems to me that this method does not do us justice considering the question from different angles.\n\nAs an example to prove the above statement:\nRoom \"Two\" or Grades 3, 4 and 5 had 15 pupils registered at the opening of school, against 22 at the end of the month.\n\nThe average attendance for 15 pupils was 14.7\n\" \" \" \" 22 \" \" \" 17.5\nlowering the average 4.5 against .3.\nThe per cent attendance for 15 pupils was 98.2\n\" \" \" \" 22 \" \" \" 71.3\nleaving a drop of 26.9\n\nPupil No. 3 has 6 days to his credit out of 19\n\" \" 6 \" 2 \" \" \" \" \" 19\n\" \" 5 \" 2 \" \" \" \" \" 19\n\" \" 10 \" 3 \" \" \" \" \" 19\n\" \" 22 \" 6 \" \" \" \" \" 19\n\nDividing the aggregate attendance by the number of days school was open means that there are 74 out of the 95 days that cannot possibly be accounted for because how can a child be in school when he is not even in the country? Then again, how is it fair\nto judge the attendance by the above method when the late comers depreciate the average to such an extent.\n\nAnother point is the changing back and forth from schools. Pupils 5 and 6 registered September 27th, remained 6 days\u20144 of which will tally in on the next quarterly. The family has gone to Esquimalt to work in the canneries. They expect to be gone for three months, returning for the dance season. Hence their 4 days present will bring down the average for the next quarter and their absence is unavoidable.\n\nAgain, when a pupil reaches 16 he leaves school regardless of the time of year.\n\nTake the April, May and June returns for the same room, (Sister Mary Eugenia, teacher) the number of pupils registered was 40, the average 22. Twenty of these pupils left for the U.S.A. between the dates of May 23 to June 3. Two left for Nanaimo April 12. Nine pupils were in for the first week of June. Two pupils were present when school closed. All had left the country or the district.\n\nAccording to the above, a better way of tabulating the aggregate attendance would be found if all circumstances would enter into consideration.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, February 12, 1947.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nInspector's Report on\nSt. Catherine's Indian Day School\n\nReference your 0-11-5 of February 3 -\n\nWe concur in Major Davy's comments concerning supervision at this school. It is felt that with only 93 students, three full time and two part time teachers are sufficient to provide adequate supervision. Most provincial schools of a similar size have a smaller teaching staff. Our letter 152-22-1 of 31 August sets out clearly our policy concerning the number of teachers at this school. The additional work involved in making and distributing cocoa is or should be largely borne by the older students themselves.\n\nSister Dorothy Marie was employed as a part time teacher at the request of the Provincial Superior of the Sisters of St. Ann. It is suggested that Sister Mary Sheila communicate with the Reverend Sister Superior concerning the status of these two teachers.\n\nBernard F.

Church, but his daughter, Cecelia Charlie, was baptized in that Church at time of birth. David disclaims having any knowledge of any such Baptism and states that if such a Baptism took place, it was without his consent.\n\nYou will note from his letter that he does not wish to have Cecelia raised an R. C. and with that end in view, had her re-baptized into the United Church this date, as per copy of Certificate of Baptism attached. He also wishes to have permission for her to be transferred from St. Catherine's School to the Koksilah Indian Day School. If the Department approves of this transfer as requested by the father of Cecelia and for the reason stated, I should like to ask you to reply at the earliest possible date. I might say in closing that David Charlie is greatly incensed over the fact that he can not have his child go to the school of his choice and is quite definite that if permission is not given for her to attend the Koksilah Indian Day School he will not permit her to go to St. Catherine's.\n\nR.

May I acknowledge it with sincere thanks.\n\nAs I have stated in my letter of the 9th inst., I am very happy to hear about the action taken to improve the textbooks for religious instruction. As far as I am concerned the samples I have sent you are in my estimation just as good as one can follow for a complete course, unless anyone would have time to write one specially for the Indians. I want to congratulate you and thank you sincerely on this move.\n\nAs for the increase in salary of Mr. F.S. Morrison, our instructor in manual arts at St. Catherine's I.D.S., I am awaiting with interest the outcome of your efforts. You will allow me to comment on your statement about the basic salary now $125.00 per month. If as you state the cost-of-living bonus has been amalgamated with the basic salary by an Order-in-Council, at first sight one would be inclined to think that there was an increase in salary, but in reality this is not true. In fact it is just a change in accounting or bookkeeping. If the basic salary is $125.00, to it should be added the cost-of-living bonus, then one could justly say that the basic salary is $125.00, but this way of doing that is amalgamating simply complicates the matter and does not solve the problem. However, this are all angles which I am sure you have in mind and will try to adjust.\n\nThe other matter of estimates given by the surveys and engineering branch is a complete mystery to me how such a high figure was quoted. As I am in a field which I have not investigated, as I promised you I cannot discuss the point. I quite understand that no such provisions have been made for this toilet improvement in the present budget, so no one can expect any organization except in case of complete emergency to be prepared to approve such an expense. I would however ask that this matter be given favorable consideration when the budget of the coming year is prepared. I shall remind you of it in due time. I suppose that the normal procedure would be to have the local agent and the commissioner reminded of it.\n\nMr. B.F. Neary\nWith my very best wishes and cooperation\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

He teaches for three and one half hours of the five hour school day. In addition his classes are small, none of which is larger than twelve when attendance is perfect. The day I visited him one of his classes consisted of four pupils. The total number of pupils receiving instruction in Manual Training is 27. This is divided into three classes. Mr. Morrison assists with the instruction in music for special occasions. He states that he considers his age prevents his organizing sports in the school in which he is the only male teacher.\n\nI have enclosed a copy of the \"Qualification of Teachers for Grant Purposes\" which is the basis on which grants are paid by the Provincial Government to school districts. To qualify for a grant the district must pay these salaries. Many districts pay only this\nOttawa,\nDecember 4, 1942.\n\nMr. R.H.

Mr. Morrison graduated from the Fredericton Normal School, New Brunswick in 1907 and holds a British Columbia Manual Training Certificate in the class headed Type E-C which I have marked on the back of the form. This information I have verified with the Registrar, Department of Education, Victoria.\n\nIt is my opinion that Mr. Morrison is being paid adequately for the service he is rendering. This opinion is based upon his teaching load, his extra-curricular work, his certification, and the salaries being paid at present in Provincial Elementary Schools.\n\nThere is no reason why the school time-table cannot be arranged so that Mr. Morrison teaches three and one half full days per week instead of three and one half hours for five days per week. In this way he might be able to supplement his earnings by working elsewhere on the days he is not required at the school. This would not reduce his present teaching time which is ample for the 27 pupils receiving Manual Training instruction. His daily work would still be light because of the small number of pupils in his classes and the negligible amount of extra-curricular work he has to perform. I did not discuss the above suggestion with Mr. Morrison or the Principal of the school.\n\nI hope that you will find this information of some assistance.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. J.

Your interest in the welfare of the Indians is very much appreciated.\n\nAs you are probably aware, Major Davey, the newly appointed Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia, is to visit St. Catherine's School and to report upon Mr. Morrison's work. When this report is received, the Department will then carefully consider the question of Mr. Morrison's salary.\n\nI regret that I was unable to meet you before you left for your new Diocese but hope to have that pleasure in the not too distant future.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

As you are probably aware, Major Davey, the newly appointed Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia, is to visit this school and make a report upon the work being done by Mr. Morrison. When this report is received, the whole matter of his salary will be carefully reviewed. We are now awaiting this report at the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nWith best wishes for your good health and continued success in your missionary endeavours,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

I have delayed replying to your letter because of a long series of letters which has been necessary between officials in British Columbia and Ottawa. It is understood that Major Davey was to inspect this school and to check carefully into the work which Mr. Morrison is doing there and make a recommendation as to the salary to be allowed to this teacher.\n\nBy Order-in-Council the cost-of-living bonus was amalgamated with the basic salary as of September 1, 1946. Therefore Mr. Morrison's basic salary is now $125.00. There may be minor discrepancies in Mr. Morrison's cheque, due to the fact that there has been some correspondence with the Inspector of Income Tax, Vancouver, concerning Mr. Morrison's income tax status.\n\nI regret to inform you that it will not be possible to undertake the provision of indoor toilet facilities at the St. Catherine's Indian Day School, for the present at least. We have recently been informed by the Surveys and Engineering Branch of the Department of Mines and Resources that a cost of $5,000.00 would be involved in the provision of such facilities. As you are probably aware, it is most difficult in times like these to provide such appropriations.\n\nYou will be glad to know that I have a large stock of samples of various Bible Histories and Catechisms. These were passed to Father Plourde for consideration by the Reverend Father L. D. LeClair,\nTzouhalem Catholic Rectory,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I believe Bishop Jordan is directly concerned with the decision as to the recommendation which will be made to the Department for the best type of books to be provided for use by Indian pupils.\n\nIn conclusion I would say that the matter of increase in Mr. Morrison's salary has been given most serious consideration and that we eagerly await the arrival of Major Davey's report.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nFurther to my letter of November 13th in connection with the application of Mr. J. M. Morrison, Manual Training Instructor, St. Catherine's Indian Day School, for a salary increase, I have now arranged with Mr. H. F. Harvey to inspect Mr. Morrison's work in the near future without expense to the Department. A recommendation will be made following receipt of Mr. Harvey's report.\n\n[Signature]\nH. M. R. Macdonald,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Affairs. (RG 1G, Volume 6387, File 807-1, part 3)\nI have just been notified that Mr. Frank S. Morrison, instructor at St. Catherine's Indian Day School, Duncan, B.C., is sending in his resignation. The reason, I am told, is exclusively a salary question.\n\nHe apparently applied several times through the regular channels and directly to Ottawa for an increase in salary. True he is now drawing higher monthly checks but this is due mostly to the cost of living bonus and not to any substantial increase in his basic salary.\n\nMr. F. S. Morrison, as your files will show is fully qualified for the position he now holds. Moreover, the standard of his work with the Indians in general, and particularly in manual arts, has been of a very high quality, practically unequaled, as any person able to judge in the matter will readily admit. When he came to St. Catherine's, no work shop, nor work program were properly organized. The so-called instructors who preceded him were mere handy men, doing everything and anything. Under his guidance, the Boys learnt how to handle tools and in a short time they were able to put into practical use their training, as a visit around the school will conclusively show. He himself without any extra financial remuneration for this work built for the school several pieces of necessary furniture. This work alone in many instances would have cost the Department more than the salary he received. He gladly did it in the interest of the school and because he has the welfare of the Indians at heart. This last point is in my opinion of major importance, if we want to get results with the Indians.\n\nAll in all, I feel that Mr. Morrison has been an ideal man in his position and the Department would be ill advised to leave him go for the mere question of salary. I know it is the ambition of the Department to have and keep on staff good and qualified teachers and instructors. Consequently, I felt it was my duty to call your attention to his case, and ask you to reconsider it for a substantial increase in his basic salary. If you have time to refer yourself to the periodical reports which must have been sent to your office, you will find that they bear my claims, this I say in spite of the fact that I have not seen any of them at any time.\n\nA copy of this letter is being sent to Mr. R.H. Moore, our local agent and to the Comm. Major D.M. MacKay with the request to support this case and give their viewpoint.\n\nSorry to trouble you about this matter, but I consider it as serious and important for the school and would ask you to give it serious consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nL.

(RG 10, Volume 6387, File 807-1, part 3)\nNote that they are sending in forms.\nDear Reverend Father:\n\nI thank you for the religious manuals and the Bible History which you have sent me. I have already arranged for sample copies of these and other books to be sent me from Montreal. I have taken this matter up also with the Reverend Father Pleurde, O.M.I., and he also is anxious for the supply of a more modern series of religious books for use in our Indian schools. I expect to be writing you further in this regard.\n\nAs you probably know by now, we have already authorized a raise in salary for the Sisters who are teaching at St. Catherine's School. We have also authorized the payment of $60.00 per teaching month for a part-time domestic science teacher. I hope this meets with your approval.\n\nI have also written to Major MacKay regarding the indoor toilet facilities at this school. You should be hearing further concerning this matter from Mr. Moore. I have seen Father Lauzon quite recently and he is looking very fit and well.\n\nI hope all goes well with you and share with you your disappointment in the sad defeat of the Brooklyn Dodgers.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Payment at the increased rate from Sept. 1st, will be included in the cheques issued at the end of October.\n\nAfter reviewing your letter very carefully, it is felt that a part-time teacher should be allowed and we are prepared to pay her a salary of $60.00 a teaching month.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nSince the receipt of your letter of August 31, we have been further studying the situation at St. Catherine's Indian Day School, Duncan, B.C., and can at this date, only reiterate the points that have already been brought before your department through letters from Sister Mary Sheila, Principal, from Reverend Mother General, and from this office - also in person and in writing by Reverend L. D. Leclair, S.M.M.\n\nThese points are, briefly: (1) The Extra Teacher\n\nIn spite of the admittedly low AVERAGE pupil-attendance at St. Catherine's over the ENTIRE school year, (Such condition being attributable to circumstances peculiar to the Duncan reserves, and well-known to your office) and of the consequent shortening of the school year for pupils who register late and withdraw early - this coupled with the loss in teaching-time in every class on account of irregularity in student personnel from day to day, St. Catherine's is grading its pupils according to the B.C. Programme of Studies and has succeeded in bringing some of them to High School Entrance standing.\n\nAt the same time, St. Catherine's is endeavouring to carry out the much-to-be-desired Home Economics Programme for girls and the Manual Training for boys, as required for Indian schools.\n\nTherefore, when the question is considered from the point of view of grade-programmes to be covered or of classes to be taught, rather than from the viewpoint of average attendance, the need for an extra teacher seems quite apparent - for:\n\nIn Grade I, . . Primary Class . . Sister Mary Walter . . there is the problem of teaching the children to speak English and then of bringing them to the scholastic standard required for promotion.\n\nIn Grade II & III, . . Intermediate Class . . Sister Mary Eugenia . . the teacher has to schedule her time so as to carry out the Home Economics programme for Grades III to VIII, as well as see to her own class.\n\nIn Grades IV, V, VI, VII and VIII . . Senior Class . . Sister Mary Sheila the teacher has charge of several grades besides attending to the duties of principal of the school.\n\nIt is conceivable, though, that a part-time teacher, relieving in Sister Mary Eugenia's class daily, for whatever period, or periods, is necessary to provide for the proper functioning of the Home Economics courses, would satisfy present needs.\n\nWe therefore repeat our request that we be allowed to present for the approval of your department a teacher who will be available for such daily periods, at least, as most seriously require the services of an extra teacher.\n\n(2) Salary Increase\n\nAs requested in your letter of August 31, we are enclosing a statement of qualifications for each of the teachers now engaged at St. Catherine's. These are supported by extracts from Inspector's reports - copies of which you must have on\nfile - I trust you will find them satisfactory and that they will justify the increase in salary for which request has been made.\n\nAt the same time, may I draw to your attention the fact that the $10.00 addition to the salary was solicited by our Reverend Mother General as remuneration to St. Ann's School for Boys for housing the teachers of St. Catherine's School, rather than as a salary increase for teachers' service. In any case, we would be grateful for your kind attention to this matter.\n\n(3) The installation of an indoor Toilet\n\nThe third point that requires attention for the personal convenience of the Sisters is the installation of an indoor toilet. I believe, however, that Reverend Father LeClair has made application for this.\n\nWe have watched with satisfaction the steady advance made by St. Catherine's School in recent years, and we wish, on this occasion, to assure you of our deepest interest in its future development. We deplore, with you, the one thing that hinders its progress, that is, the irregular attendance of the pupils, and we are hoping for an improvement this year. Some months of last year were very good. The zealous devotedness of the four teachers now trying to advance the interests of the school and at the same time cope with difficulties as presented above, has been truly admirable. The three Sisters and Mr. Morrison have accomplished marvels in the few years of the school's existence.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nSister Mary Mildred,\nProvincial Superior.\nMr Frank Morrison  \nP.O. Box 201,  \nDuncan, B.C.\n\nDear Mr Morrison:\n\nSpring Exhibit of Indian Children's Arts and Crafts.\n\nHerewith enclosed I have pleasure in sending a copy of a brief report which has been prepared to cover the above exhibit.\n\nFrom this report you will see that your efforts and ours are meeting with an enthusiastic reception at the hands of visitors to this Museum. I personally mix among the people who visit the show and listening to what they have to say am convinced that the work we are doing is very popular.\n\nThe Indians too seem to be taking a greater interest in this work than they have hitherto shown. Thank you for all you have done.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. E.

Some very excellent totes carved and painted by the older pupils show that the spirit of Charlie James is not dead. The traditional excellence of work of this kind from Alert Bay is well maintained.\n\nSt Catherine's School, Duncan, has supplied a number of articles made in the manual training school including toy wagons, automobiles, boxes, door-knockers, a mechanical grasshopper and other items. Larger articles include a child's desk, an occasional table, a piano stool, a stool for a ladies dresser and a cleverly made child's wheelbarrow the sides of which represent a mythical bear designed and executed by the pupil with practically no guidance from the teacher. All of these articles are painted and finished in great taste and many of them carry aboriginal designs as medallions and other decorations. These medallions are so perfect that they give the impression that they are obtained from transfers whereas actually they are carefully drawn and coloured by hand. This feature has elicited loud praise from visitors to the Museum. Mr Frank Morrison, who is responsible for this work, has supplied us with his source material for these designs all of which make a very helpful record. We wish to compliment Mr Morrison most heartily on the quality of the work his pupils are turning out.\n\nThe Songhees School at Craigflower. In addition to the art work of Bernard George and his colleagues a great deal of excellent needlework and woodwork has been sent in with other practical products. These latter include figurines modelled in clay, paper mache masks, raffia baskets, wood trays and plaques. All of this work, and particularly the excellence of the silk embroidery has attracted a great deal of attention from visitors who are loud in their praise of the ability shown by these native children. In handling this abundance of material it was found necessary to rotate some of the articles, or such was the intention until, due to a misunderstanding on this score the materials not at the moment on display were withdrawn.\nTzouhalem Catholic Rectory\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nSeptember 17th, 1946.\n\nMr. Bernard Neary,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou will receive under separate cover a sample of textbooks for religious instruction together with a Bible History. A simple glance at the manuals will be enough to see how far superior these are to the ones now in use in our schools. First the text is well prepared according to the vocabulary knowledge of each grade and is well illustrated. The three volumes on Christian doctrine cover eight full academic years. The Bible History is planned for the first four years but according to our teachers, it may be enough for the eight years. I have on hand and use the second volume for the white children and if you are interested in seeing that one I would gladly send you a sample. I shall naturally be happy to know what you think of the books, and especially if you are prepared to approve the text books at least for St. Catherine's in the Cowichan Agency. I shall continue to study all new publications and if you desire so keep you well posted on the matter.\n\nAfter serious study with the Agent Mr. R.H. Moore and the staff at St. Catherine's, I am still more convinced of the need of an additional teacher. As I explained to you when I called at your office the aggregate annual average gives a very inaccurate picture. On the basis of the possible attendance, I figure that the average would well be in the eighties and possibly more. As things now stand the teacher of domestic arts in particular is expected to give more work than anyone could expect of any teacher. She should be free of regular class work. She has enough with her work. It would naturally be much better also from the viewpoint of the pupils.\n\nIn spite of the fact that you had orally authorized me to obtain estimates on the installation of indoor lavatories for the staff at St. Catherine's Day School, I took it upon myself to discuss the matter with the Agent. He himself favors this improvement. He would like to get from you written authority and he would himself look into the matter and submit to you whatever estimates he can obtain. Looking at the building, one can notice that no provision was made in the plans for such facilities.\nTzouhalem Catholic Rectory\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nThis will consequently entail a greater expense than it would have at the time the school was erected. I was given to understand that the Commissioner for B.C. is aware of the request made last January by Mother Leopoldine, Sup. General of the Sisters of St. Ann in regards to this present matter.\n\nTaking this occasion to thank you very sincerely for your kindness when I visited you at your office recently and assuring you of my unlimited cooperation, with my very best wishes,\n\nI am sincerely yours,\n\nRev.

Eucharis directs me to acknowledge your letter of the twenty-second in which you assure her of your immediate attention to the matter of the exemption of our Sisters from the payment of Income Tax.\n\nSister Eucharis deeply appreciates your deep interest and prompt action in the interest of these Sisters.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nSister M. Felicia,\nSecretary General\nAIRMAIL\n\nOttawa, August 31, 1946.\n\nReverend and dear Sister:\n\nI have received your letter of August 7, 1946. Before answering it I took the opportunity of thoroughly discussing the situation at St. Catherine's with the Reverend Father L. MacLair, S.M.\n\nAt the time that Mr. Phelan discussed the matter of an extra teacher with the Reverend Mother General at Alcine, she was given assurance that the fifth teacher would be acceptable providing that the attendance warranted it.\n\nHowever, here are the average attendance figures by quarters at St. Catherine's for the 1945-46 school term:\n\n| Quarter     | Attendance |\n|-------------|------------|\n| September   | 25.7       |\n| December    | 71.52      |\n| March       | 72.7       |\n| June        | 58.77      |\n\nAnnual average attendance - 57.1\n\nAt present we are prepared to pay for one teacher per average attendance of 30 students, which is better than the most Provincial Departments of Education offer (usually they pay for one teacher per average attendance of 35). We also allow for the payment of one vocational training teacher for larger day schools over and above the usual classroom teachers.\n\nIn other words, the actual average attendance at this school warrants the payment of two teachers only. However, we realize only too well that the September and June attendances are very...\nare very low, due to circumstances beyond the control of the teachers. As you know the Department has actually authorized the payment of four teachers at salaries as follows: Sister Mary Sheila, $100.00 per month; Sister Mary Eugenia, $85.00 per month; Sister Mary Walter, $90.00 per month and Mr. Frank Morrison at $100.00 per month.\n\nThe Department is quite prepared to authorize an increase in salary of $10.00 per teaching month for each Sister providing that she is a certificated teacher. I enclose forms which each Sister should complete so that we can determine her qualifications.\n\nHowever, we would appreciate your comments on this situation before considering further the appointment of an extra teacher. The Reverend Father LeClair pointed out clearly the long hours of extra work which the Sisters at this school are putting in and the real need for a Home Economics teacher. It is possible, in view of his arguments, that authorization for a part time teacher could be obtained.\n\nI hope I have succeeded in making clear to you that we realize fully the need for this teacher but that we must first justify the extra expenditure from our already depleted funds.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nCopy sent to Major MacKay\n\" \" \" Rev. Mother General, Mount St. Ann\nAugust 29, 1946\n\nMr. R.A.

For some reason or other a lot of the parents don't like sending their children to this school, too much religion taught is the principal complaint, and pressure has to be constantly maintained to keep their children going. Many applications for transfer from St. Catherine's to the Koksilah school has been received in the Office, one or two of which have already been referred to the Department for consideration. I look for a much improved attendance this year however and hope that the prejudice of the Indians against St. Catherine's will eventually pass off.

I am therefore submitting Mr. Moore's letter to you for whatever action you consider necessary.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAttention: Educational Branch\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to request necessary authority to buy the following supplies for use of the various Indian Day schools in this Agency:\n\n300 Report Cards, for grades 1 to 3. @ .01 = $3.00\n300 \" \" \" \" 4 to 6 @ .01 = $3.00\n200 \" \" \" \" 7 to 12 @ .02 = $4.00\n500 Permanent Record Progress Card. @ .01 = $5.00\n\nThe above cards are being used in all the Provincial Public & High schools in this Province and are available through the Provincial Dept. of Education at the prices shown above.\n\nProbably the Dept. will not feel that these cards are necessary for our Indian schools but from what I can gather from some of the Indian parents they would be much appreciated as they could then know how their children are progressing from month to month. As it is at present they don't know anything, nor in fact do they know what grades their children are in. Furthermore, I think that they might be a help in creating more of a competitive spirit among the children themselves, and probably among the parents as well in seeing to it that their children are made to attend school regularly. An early reply will be appreciated as I would like to have these cards supplied to 301 Indian Day schools by the end of this month.\n\n(R.H. Moore) Indian Agent.\n\nAIR MAIL.\nOttawa, September 17, 1945.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 8th instant, no income tax is being deducted from the salary of Sisters Maureen Regan, Ethel Swain and M. Socorro Meza. It is also provided that when income tax is not paid no bonus is allowed. This applies in their case.\n\nWe do not seem to have any record of the Grade IX books for Dorothy Paul. In order that the matter may not be further delayed, you may purchase what is required, locally.\n\nPlease tell Sister Maureen Regan that the Department considers the supplying of report cards should be delayed until we appoint our own Inspector.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI am forwarding herewith Mr. Indian Agent Moore's letter of September 4th addressed to the Department and enclosure referred to therein.\n\nThe applications of the Reverend sisters for tax exemption require no comment, and it is presumed that the Department will deal with the requisition for textbooks for Dorothy Paul in due course.\n\nWith reference to the enrollment card enclosed, I am of the opinion that some of the information required thereon is not necessary and the question of the supply of these cards might well be left in abeyance until a School Inspector is appointed in order that he could prepare a form which would meet the requirements of all Indian Day schools in the Province.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to submit herewith in duplicate, through the Office of the Indian Commissioner for B.C., the following documents:\n\n(1) Applications on behalf of the Reverend Sisters: Maureen Regan, Ethel Swain and M. Socorro Maza for Tax exemptions on the grounds stated.\n\n(2) Copy of letter from Sister Maureen Regan.\n\n(3) One copy of an enrollment card mentioned by Sister Maureen, and if approved by the Department for use in our schools, she would like to have 200 of them printed in Ottawa and sent out here, or else have authority to have them printed here. While Sister Maureen does not state what it would cost to have them done here, or rather where they (the Sisters) had theirs done for the white school under their charge in Victoria, I made enquiries at the local printing office and I find that they would charge approximately $15.00 for 500 cards. It would, I imagine, cost much less than that to have them done at the same place as the sample attached was done in Victoria, and probably still less to have them done in Ottawa as the B.C. rates for printing are quite a lot higher I believe.\n\nRe: Dorothy Paul, mentioned in Sister Maureen's letter, this girl was recommended by Inspector J.E. Brown last year to take the 9th grade work; the Sister is qualified to teach that grade in the Tsartlip school (Sr. room) but requires certain books, the requisition for which was sent to the Dept. on June 20th last and which I have received no notification of its acceptance, or otherwise, since. I would recommend that the Text books asked for be supplied or that authority be given to purchase them locally. In the meantime she will be attending our Tsartlip school. The other matter mentioned in Sister Maureen's letter is being attended to.\n\n(R.M. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\n1130 Palmer Road,\nVictoria, B.C.\nSeptember 3, 1945.\n\nMr. R.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Moore,\n\nEnclosed are the letters of identification from our Mother General for the purpose of tax exemption.\n\nAlso, I am enclosing a form which I would like very much to use in the three schools taught by our Sisters. Would it be at all possible to have about 200 or 300 printed for distribution to the three schools. In this way our record system could be kept uniform. We had this one run off here in Victoria for the purpose of our school here. If it would be cheaper to have the same done from this same type, we could have ours done at the same printers.\n\nOur school orders have not been sent as yet. Is the delay due to the heavy freight transportation problem?\n\nDorothy Paul wishes to start school as a ninth grade pupil on Tuesday. As yet, I have received no word from the Department in answer to my letter asking permission to give her ninth grade work at the Indian School. Also, there are no ninth grade books on hand. The order for them have been placed, however. Shall I accept her back on the presumption that it will be alright with the Department?\n\nThanking you for your wonderful cooperation in the past.\n\nI remain,\n\nSincerely,\n\nSister Maureen (sgd.)\n\nCOPY\n\nIndian Affairs.

St. Catherine's and Saanich Schools were quite low although a much larger attendance in both these is expected from now on as a lot of the Indians have returned from the Hop fields and fishing grounds during the last few days.

It is the intention to have this school visited by myself or the Inspector of Agencies before it is closed and I will make a further recommendation if necessary.\n\nD.M. Mackey,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIn reference to your above noted letter, I wish to advise that the quotation given in your letter as taken from my report, cannot be supported except, as already stated, by our opinion. And by our I mean, Miss Robertson, Miss Hayward and myself, also Corporal J. Henry to a lesser degree. I said that I had no direct evidence to support our opinion other than the fact that we thought the teachers were not just the right type for that school, actually one or two of them might be alright, but it might avoid trouble and fuss if a complete change could be made at the suggestion of the Department to the proper authorities.\n\nIt is not my intention to make any trouble, but rather do I feel it my duty to suggest some means of getting better results at that school and as we have tried everything else, it would appear to be time to change the teachers to see if that would improve matters. If that does not have the desired effect then the question of changing the status of the school entirely might be considered. The children, or rather some of them, have told their parents that they did not like the teachers, but then there is nothing unusual about that and would be difficult to prove that the child was right and the teacher wrong. However, there must be something wrong when the existing spirit in the school is not better and the opinion expressed in my report and the suggestion offered is -to my mind-the easiest way to find out just where the trouble does lie. The reason I suggested a complete change would be, I thought, obvious, and simply means that with a new staff there a new and better feeling between teachers and pupils might be built up. I am not recommending a change, but rather suggesting that one be made to see if it will improve conditions at this school.\n\n(R.H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON COWICHAN INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL, 1944.\n\nSchools were quite well attended during the period, with the exception of St. Catherine's which seem to have great difficulty in holding the interest of the children and getting the support of the parents. Some of us are inclined to think that a complete change of teaching staff is needed in that school, for although we have no direct evidence to substantiate our opinion, the fact remains that the children do not like their present teachers who might be alright in a Residential School but quite unsuited in a Day School. There is certainly a marked difference in the spirit existing in the Tsartlip School, where we have Rev. Sisters teaching also, than there is in St. Catherine's although the facilities and conveniences at the latter school are very much greater. I am of the opinion that if a change could be made in this school, that all the teachers should go there at present, for certainly we are not getting results now, even with the Truant Officer.\n\nR.H.

McCutcheon\nChief Treasury Officer.\nAs reported last month a meeting was held with the Chiefs of the Cowichan Band in regard to the then irregular attendance at St. Catherine's school, the outcome being that a meeting of the Teacher's of the School and the Councils was arranged when the matter was fully discussed and all phases of the school and the program of studies gone into and explained by the Teachers. This meeting apparently had a very beneficial effect on all concerned and no further complaints have been received from the Council members. It was felt that the Teachers were doing a good job but the Indians some of them are of the opinion that more time should be devoted to classroom teaching and not so much to Domestic Science and Manual training, in other words more after the time table of the Provincial Public schools.\n\nR.H.

It would appear as if there is a definite objection by the Indians to have their children attend this school. A meeting to try and get to the bottom of the trouble was held with the Chiefs' and Councillors of the Cowichan Band during the month, along with the Truant Officer, but as there was not a quorum present no definite action could be taken. It was agreed however, by all those present that they would interview the parents of each child attending this school and get their objections to the school and report back at a regular Council meeting as soon as possible. There is certainly a very definite passive resistance on the part of the parents to their children being forced to attend this school and it is hoped that the situation can be clarified and a complete report submitted very soon.\n\nR.H.

In view of the heavy costs of bus transportation, the continuation of the school beyond that date would not have been justified.\n\nAn endeavour is being made to bring up the attendance of this school during the next term and, if successful, it will be continued to June 30th, 1944, as suggested, but, in my opinion, this should not be done if the attendance falls to the level that it experienced this last month.\n\nFor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, June 15, 1943.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn view of the information recently forwarded to you to the effect that all Indian Day Schools would operate for a 10 month period during the current fiscal year I thought you might have authorized St. Catherine's Indian Day School to continue to the end of June instead of closing on May 31.\n\nI would appreciate your advising if the school continued or if it closed on May 31.\n\nFor the coming academic year this school should operate from September 1, 1943 to June 30, 1944.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt.of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O.Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\nOttawa,\nJune 10, 1943.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your recent letter, the Treasury Office states that a statement of salary, including deductions, will be mailed to you within the next few days.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Corcoran\nformerly of St. Catherine's Day School\nDuncan B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6387, File 807-1, part 3)\nREPORT FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY 1943.\n\nOwing to the severe cold and deep snow it was considered advisable to close some of the day schools for a few days, especially on the reserves where the children had long distances to walk. School affected were St. Catherines, Koksilah and Tsartlip. The attendance at all schools could be considered satisfactory, although there is still room for improvement, which, in my opinion, will not be obtained without the appointment of a permanent truant officer.\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nJanuary 25th, 1943.\n\nD.M. MacKay, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nFurther to my letter of the 21st instant, I wish to advise that owing to weather conditions being worse than ever this a.m., I instructed the teachers to not open the schools today or until weather conditions improved sufficiently for those children who have to walk to get there in reasonable numbers.\n\nBus operator and children were also informed in plenty of time before the time of departure by the bus.\n\n(R.H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\n\nSecretary:\nForwarded for your information.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nRe. St. Catherine's and Koksilah Day Schools\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nThe attached letter from Mr. Indian Agent Moore is forwarded for your information.\n\nThe action taken by Mr. Moore with respect to St. Catherine's School is considered in order in view of the unusually severe weather conditions which is the reason for the small attendance.\n\nPerhaps I should add that all public schools in Vancouver and surrounding municipalities have been closed since Monday last and are not likely to reopen until the weather improves.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\nDuncan, B.C.\nJanuary 21st, 1943.\n\nD.M. MacKay, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C. Vancouver,\n\nThis is to inform you that Mrs Miller, Teacher of the Koksilah Indian Day School, telephoned me this morning at 7 o'clock to let me know that she was unable to attend school today on account of illness, having contracted a chill during the first two days of this week which has settled in her arms and legs.\n\nI have just now received a telephone call from St. Catherine's School informing me that there are only 30 pupils present today, on account of the weather conditions, and I took the liberty to instruct the Principal to keep the school closed tomorrow as there does not appear to be any sign of the weather breaking; so if the Koksilah School will not be open it will just be a waste of money to have the bus run\u2014and also a waste of fuel\u2014for such a small attendance.\n\nIt is hoped that the weather will be back to normal again by Monday next and travel by bus will not be as hazardous as at present. Trusting that my action will be approved.\n\n(R.H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nDecember 23, 1942.\n\nSister Mary Sheila, Principal, St. Catherine's Indian Day School, Duncan, B.C.\n\nIn a letter dated December 22 the Chief Treasury Officer wrote to you regarding salary paid to the Reverend Sisters of the St. Catherine's School for the period mentioned in your letter of October 18.\n\nOn checking our books it is found that a cheque for $90.40 was forwarded to Sister M. Rose Alida for the month of June, 1942. This was an oversight on our part as the school was not in operation for that month and consequently the cheque should not have been issued. I should appreciate your arranging to have Sister Alida return to this office the amount mentioned at the earliest possible date.\n\nFor your information I may add that there is some money in the retirement fund to Sister Alida's credit which she will receive if she makes application for same.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, December 28, 1942\n\nSister Mary Sheila,\nPrincipal, St. Catherine's Indian Day School,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nAs requested in your letter of the 12th October last we are attaching hereto statements of salary paid the following teachers:\n\nSister M.

Conway, from $900.00 to $950.00 a year effective September 1, 1938. The following entry should, therefore, appear on the September and subsequent pay lists until further advised:\n\nD.M.J. Conway, ..........$95.00\nTeacher,\nCowichan Indian Day School,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Sir:\n\nIt has been decided to increase the salary of D. M. J. Conway, teacher of the Cowichan Indian Day School, from $900.00 to $950.00 a year. This increase will be effective from September 1, 1938. Please advise Mr. Conway.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B. C.\nMarch 31, 1939.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThe Acting Agent at Duncan has reported that Mr. Conway, teacher of the Cowichan Indian Day School, has had to discontinue his work at the school due to an infected hand and arm. The Doctor has advised that Mr. Conway will be unable to resume his duties for at least ten days.\n\nOn receipt of this information, I consulted Inspector Barry, who suggested the school be closed and remain so until after the Easter holidays. I concurred in this and so instructed Mr. Moore. It was considered that it would be better to follow this course than to arrange for a substitute teacher for the short period between now and the commencement of the Easter holidays on April 5th. I trust this action meets with your approval.\n\nThe Department will be advised should Mr. Conway not be able to resume his work after the Easter recess.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nEXD.\n\nOttawa,\nApril 5, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo in which you state that Mr. Conway, teacher of the Cowichan Indian day school, has been obliged to give up duties owing to an infected arm and hand.\n\nYour action in allowing the school to remain closed until after the Easter holidays is approved.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Moore included in the current year's estimates for the Cowichan Indian Agency an amount of $600.00 to re-shingle the roof of the old Cowichan Indian Day School, and carry out other necessary repairs and improvements to the building with a view to its eventual use for school purposes by the pupils now attending the Sokolish Indian Day School. The question of the transfer of the Sokolish school to the old Cowichan Indian school building is one that should, in my opinion, be held in abeyance until the Inspector of Schools is appointed and has an opportunity to pass on the proposal. In the meantime, however, I feel that we should re-shingle the roof of the Cowichan Day School building in order to prevent deterioration of the structure and would recommend that the necessary authority be issued for this purpose. The Department's decision at an early date would be appreciated.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Commissioner\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6387, File 807-1, part 4)\nOttawa, October 18, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nFormer Cowichan Indian Day School\n\nI have for answer your letter - 3-11-1 - of September 27, which has necessitated a considerable review of old files in order to thoroughly investigate this whole matter.\n\nIn a letter of June 2, 1944, Mr. Moore stated that there was not available in his office a copy of the survey made of this site in 1937. Therefore I am enclosing an extra copy which I discovered on one of our old files. If you so desire this can be forwarded to him. It is understood that in 1938 the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada offered to transfer this property to the Department for school purposes. I enclose a copy of the letter dated July 18, 1938, which was received by the Department at that time. It was decided, in view of the recommendation of the then Indian Agent, Mr. Graham, that nothing should be done in this regard. Would you now wish that the United Church be approached regarding the transfer of this property to the Department?\n\nIt is felt that the old Cowichan School is unsatisfactory for use as a school for the following reasons:\n\n(a) The lighting in this school is very poor and does not meet the required standards.\n\n(b) The question of transporting the United Church children to this school will probably necessitate the contracting for additional bus service.\n\n...... (c)\n(c) As pointed out in a previous letter (our 152-34-1 of August 1, 1944), the Department is not enthusiastic about moving the Koksihlah Day School to within such a short distance of the St. Catherine's Day School.\n\nIt is not our desire to enter into a long correspondence over this matter and we concur in your recommendation that this whole question of the transfer be held in abeyance until your Inspector of Schools has an opportunity to pass on the proposal.\n\nIn view of the heavy expenditures of recent months, it is regretted that we are unable to provide the funds necessary to re-shingle the roof of this school, as requested.\n\nEncl.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMr. W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nPost Office Box 70,\nVANCOUVER, B. C.\n\nP. O. Box 396,\nDuncan, B. C.,\nJune 4th, 1948.\n\nCould you give me any information regarding what amounts have been authorized for necessary additions and improvements to the Day Schools in this Agency as listed in the current year's estimates -- submitted to your office in July, 1947.\n\nDuring my last visit to your office the only authorization you had, then, was an amount of two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) for Kuper Island Residential School.\n\nIf I may be informed of the amounts approved for the various schools I will be in a position to have the work done during the months of July and August.\n\nR. H. MOORE\nSuperintendent\nCowichan Agency\n\nRHM:EL\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWith reference to Superintendent Moore's letter of June 4th attached will you please advise if the items in the Cowichan Agency Estimates, 1948-49 for repairs and improvements to Indian Day Schools are approved, or if you would prefer that the Agent make separate application for the expenditure required at each school.\n\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nJune 14, 1948.\n\nMr. W.S.

I have taken the matter up with Mr. Ditchburn, Indian Commissioner for B. C., who informs me that in some parts of the Province, advances have been made towards the middle of the quarter, which would greatly assist.\n\nThe Department undoubtedly have their rules on this matter, but if I may, I would like to suggest that the teachers in the West draw their monthly salary. You will understand by the time the quarterly returns can be checked over and forwarded from this office, it would take approximately 6 days and allowing for a few days in your offices, and a fortnight in both ways mail dispatch, puts them far behind those who are closer to your headquarters.\n\nI submit this merely as a suggestion, and I feel you will treat the same without prejudice, knowing as you do the great distance between Ottawa and our Coast.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Alfred H. Lomas)\nIndian Agent.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We are, however, prepared to allow an advance on the salary, provided application for same is made through your office. These advances will be made about the middle of the quarter. I regret, however, that, as our appropriation for the current fiscal year is totally assigned, it will be impossible to make advances during the current quarter but, commencing from April 1st, next, you may, if any teacher so requests, apply for an advance on the quarterly salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to our conversation this morning re a small school bus - we are submitting to you our regular INTERNATIONAL 1 ton panel job with the following alterations as recommended by Sgt. McDonald, School Bus Inspector of Vancouver:\n\n3 windows in each side of the body equipped with \"safety\" glass; straps in lieu of regulators. 2 rows of seats to be installed, one on each side of the body. 2 ventilators to be installed in the roof. A remote-control door handle for the right front door and a fire extinguisher. The left-hand rear door would be permanently locked and the right-hand rear door would have a regulation \"safety-latch\" installed on it; this door would be used for emergency purposes only.\n\nThe cost of this unit would be as follows:\n\nModel D-15 Panel on 700x16 single tires and spare $1,376.00\nNecessary body alterations 165.00\nAdditional Duty on Chassis (Only when used for carrying passengers) 11.00\nExcise Tax 49.60\nComplete delivered price f.o.b.Vancouver $1,601.60\n\nTrusting this meets with your approval and that we may have the pleasure of furnishing this equipment for you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nINTERNATIONAL HARVESTER CO. OF CANADA LTD.\n\nPer \"L. Salisbury\"\n\nLS/B\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have before me a letter from Rev. Father Lauzon, S.M.M., of the Catholic Indian Mission, Duncan, dealing with the transportation of Indian children in the Duncan School district of the Cowichan Agency. You will recall that an arrangement was made last year whereby the Department allowed Father Lauzon $175.00 per school year for the transportation of ten children in his own car to and from the School, but this only makes provision for the transportation of a small percentage of the children.\n\nIt would appear that 36 children now attending school should have transportation and, of these, 23 are pupils of the Cowichan Day School and the remaining 13 attend the Koksilah Day School. It has been suggested that a one-ton regulation school bus, as described in the attached letter from the International Harvester Co. of Canada Ltd., would suit our requirements. General Motors also supply a one-ton bus for $100.00 less, but for the difference in price the International would probably be more satisfactory. In addition to the capital outlay involved, an allowance of approximately $800.00 would have to be provided to meet the costs of operation and maintenance. Father Lauzon would be responsible for the transportation of the children and the care and maintenance of the motor vehicle supplied. The amount asked for operation and maintenance ($800.00) is based on a mileage cost of 13 cents per mile and is considered reasonable when compared with transportation costs as paid by the Municipality of Duncan for the transportation of white children in the same area.\n\nIt will be recalled that in the Duncan School survey dated July 23rd, 1937, Inspector Barry recommended a consolidated improved Indian Day School for to take care of the children attending the Cowichan Day School and children of school age not at present attending any school. If approved, such a School would not lessen the need of transportation for a large number of the children, indeed, more children would be attending school for which transportation would be necessary than at present.\n\nIf funds are available, I would recommend a one-ton school bus be supplied and that a grant on a mileage basis be allowed Father Lauzon for the operation and maintenance of the bus. Should funds not be available, I would suggest that the arrangement we now have with Father Lauzon be continued.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOTTAWA, October 6, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of September 25th with reference to the transportation of children in the Duncan school district.\n\nAt the present time there are no funds available for the purchase of a one ton regulation school bus. Under these circumstances, the arrangement we now have with Father Lauzon, as outlined in official letter of June 8th, should be continued.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Toilets are outside and no doubt of the dry earth type, pits being dug.\n\nSome local plumbing was done at a cost of $116.50 but the contract price of the splendid four room school was only $6,209.80.\n\nI would ask that the contents of this letter be considered as strictly confidential as I am dealing with matters of a Provincial Department of Education of which I am not supposed to have any official knowledge.\n\nFurther I have no reason to believe that there would be any difficulty in obtaining the blue prints of this particular four room school, which I have examined or rather just seen. May I suggest that you as Indian Commissioner apply to the Department of Public Works or the Architects Branch of the Provincial Government for one or more blue prints of the new four room school just erected at Yarrow, though the plans were drawn for Sumas. The particular plan that Mr. Hoey would want is numbered 845 and dated Public Works 1936. Such plans would probably cost $1.00 each.\n\nThis plan with modifications to be suggested by Mr. Hoey would no doubt be perfectly satisfactory for the proposed Consolidated School near Duncan.\n\nThe fitting up and even the arrangement of the rooms could of course be changed in the Ottawa plans which would have to be drawn before tenders were called for by the Department. Such changes might add greatly to the cost of the school.\n\nI must also point out that the extraordinary low contract price of $6,209.80 for this school was put in by a local firm, from Chilliwack I believe, who are said to have made only wages out of this job. It was stated to me by the Provincial Inspector that I might add 50% to the above contract price to obtain a duplicate building near Duncan. Even then the total price of the school building would be under $9,000 and the completed school might not cost in excess of $15,000.\n\nMy estimate of $50,000 would appear to be too great under present conditions, and I am confident that the type of school suggested by Mr. Hoey, without gymnasium, kitchen, living quarters etc., could be erected and equipped for under the $20,000 he mentions.\n\nIt is hoped that the above confidential information will be of assistance to the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nI am sorry to say that I do not like the modified water system mentioned by Mr. Hoey.\n\nBoat building is not very necessary here, and a few benches placed along the side of the boys' basement would probably provide all the accommodation necessary. There would have to be cupboards for tools etc., but in this letter I am not going into details.\n\nMy own view is that the present Indian Day School called the Cowichan School is not worth moving to the site proposed for the new school. As the distance is not great, about a mile I should say, such a move could of course be arranged. The distance between the present site of the Cowichan Indian Day School and the proposed site of the new school would make any supervision of vocational work by the Sisters impossible should such work be carried on in the old school, where it now stands.\n\nMay I say in confidence that Mr. Hoey's suggestion that there would be no need for a Principal other than the Sister Superior, if the Sisters of St. Anne took charge, would be objected to by the Catholic Church authorities, I have reason to think.\n\nFather Lauzon intimated to me that he wanted a male teacher for the older boys. The Manual Training Instructor would be a man of course.\n\nI am of the opinion that the Sisters of St Ann could very well supervise the whole school, including the older boys few if any of whom would be above 15 years of age.\n\nWith Sisters and men on the staff of the school I suggested that the Catholic Missionary, in the present case, Rev. Father Lauzon, would be the most suitable to place in nominal charge of the school.\n\nWith regard to the second last paragraph of Mr. Hoey's letter of October 4th and acting on your instructions I may say that I visited the office of one of the local Provincial School Inspector's this morning.\n\nI took up the cost of erection of Provincial Schools in places near large towns such as Victoria and Vancouver and was pleased to find that the cost of one, two, and four room day schools has been greatly reduced since I had anything to do with such schools.\n\nI would say for Mr. Hoey's information and more or less in confidence, that the sum of $5,000 per room suggested in paragraph two of page two of his letter, and my own estimate of around $4,000 per room in B.C. are well in excess of present costs, if schools near Vancouver are to be taken as standard.\n\nA very fine two room school with teachers' room, and double basement, with toilet accommodation water being laid on and central heating, electric light etc., cost at Stillwater near Powell River not more than $4,500. I have seen a photograph of this school which compares favourably with the new Indian Day School at Port Simpson though with less accommodation.\n\nI may say that the Provincial Inspector considers the Stillwater School a highly satisfactory one. The basement is above ground.\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nP.O.Box 444\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nOctober 31st 1938.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nAt your request I have read Mr. Hoey's letter 152-22-1 of October 4th last with regard to certain suggested modifications in my recommendations for the construction of a Consolidated Indian Day School in the Cowichan Agency near Duncan.\n\nI certainly agree with Mr. Hoey that many items might be eliminated from those suggested in my letter of July 16th 1938 if it is necessary to cut down the cost of the school.\n\nMy letter and previous Survey Report of July 8, 1937 were made with great care and are I believe sound from a professional point of view. This does not mean that modifications could not be made. I am inclined to think that the Reverend Father Lauzon is requesting rather more than is necessary.\n\nA square four room school with full basement accommodation would supply all that is necessary for the present.\n\nIn B.C., we find that basements should be above ground and not two thirds underground as suggested by Mr. Hoey. There is too great a danger of flooding in our rather wet climate. Even in the dry belt they are as a rule erected above ground.\n\nKitchens can be eliminated if the noon meal is just a lunch that could be heated on an electric stove in the room used as a lunch room for the children. Even tables in the basement on the boys' side and on the girls' side would be quite suitable and eliminate even a lunch room.\n\nLiving accommodation for a member of the staff might be eliminated in the simple school proposed by Mr. Hoey.\n\nInside toilets are better than those outside and at the rear of a school. Water is necessary for inside toilets and a septic tank is necessary, and is recommended by me still. I believe that a good water supply could be obtained by sinking a well on the property suggested for the school and now owned by Mrs Sammy Bob, which is by far the best site for the proposed school.\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe your file 152-22-1.\n\nProposed Consolidated School, Cowichan Agency.\n\nFurther to my letter of October 27th regarding the marginally noted subject, I beg to forward herewith a copy of a letter from Capt. G.H. Barry dealing with the points on which information was sought in your letter of October 4th.\n\nI have made application to the Provincial Government for the plan of the four-room Provincial Day School referred to by Capt. Barry. When their plan is received, I'll forward same with whatever further comments I feel I should make regarding the proposed school.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl\nDM/AC\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 16, 1938.\n\nRe: Proposed Consolidated School,\nCowichan Agency\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 8th instant and also copy of a communication received by you from Captain Barry, relative to the above noted subject, attached thereto.\n\nI note with interest that you have applied to the Provincial Government for a plan of the Provincial Day School referred to by Captain Barry. I shall certainly be glad to receive this plan, just as soon as you can conveniently send it forward. You might also discuss with Captain Barry the desirability of securing from the Provincial Authorities plans of one and two room schools. If these can be secured for a nominal fee, it might be well to have a number of them on hand here when our Architects are drawing up plans for schools in the province of British Columbia.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWith reference to your letter of November 16th, I am forwarding this day under separate cover plans in duplicate of two Day School buildings in this Province.\n\nYou will note the Sechelt School can be added to make a four-room school. In regard to the 1-room school, lavatory accommodation could be provided by taking off a portion of the woodshed from the fuel room.\n\nThese plans were very kindly supplied free of charge by the Provincial Architect of the staff of the Department of Public Works, and I trust will be found helpful in the preparation of plans of 1- and 2-room Day Schools for our Branch.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Your File 152-22-1.\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Hoey's letter of October 4th, and subsequent correspondence, regarding the proposed consolidated Indian Day School near Duncan, Cowichan Agency, and in this connection beg to advise that two blueprints of the plan of the 4-room day school erected by the Provincial Government at Yarrow, referred to by Capt. Barry in his letter of October 31st, a copy of which was submitted with my letter of November 8th, file 15/3/6632, are being forwarded this day under separate cover. This plan, with whatever modifications are considered necessary by the Department would no doubt meet our requirements.\n\nAs stated by Capt. Barry, most of our school basements in this Province are built in line with, or above, the ground level, this being found more suitable owing to climatic conditions.\n\nBefore finally deciding on the site for the proposed school, the question of a good and sufficient water supply will have to be gone into carefully, and in this connection it may be necessary to have some investigation work made by our engineering Branch. Should our requirements in this connection be found on the present school site, there would hardly be any need to consider the other site suggested, provided extra land could be acquired from James Capeal. The present school building could then be utilized for vocational work, and so divided that a section of it could be used for the manufacture of Cowichan sweaters and other woolen articles under the supervision of a member of the school staff. Should circumstances be such, however, that it will be necessary to acquire the acreage owned by Mrs. Sammy Bob, as recommended by Capt. Barry, a small inexpensive separate building for vocational training, where the manufacture of Cowichan sweaters...\nsweaters could, to an important extent, be centralized under proper supervision, would have to be provided, as the distance from this site to the present Cowichan Day School would preclude supervision by the school staff, which is considered desirable.\n\nWell constructed outside toilets with the usual screens and proper ventilation vents would probably do for the present. This is what is usually provided by the Province where connection with established water and sewerage systems is costly. The necessary pipe fittings for inside toilets and wash basins could be placed in the building when it is being built, so that these additions could be installed at any time the Department wishes to do so, should an adequate water supply be available.\n\nI trust the plan being forwarded will be helpful to the Department in preparing final plans for the proposed consolidated school.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

There are however several matters which I wish to raise now. These will not hinder a start being made but should be brought to the attention of the Department.\n\n(1) No provision would appear to have been made for toilets for the teachers. Two toilets of simple outdoor type have been allowed for and it is possible the male members of the staff might use the toilet set aside for the boys. I believe that as Sisters of St Ann will be employed a separate toilet should be erected in a convenient place for their use. I regret that it was not found possible to arrange for inside toilets.\n\n(2) No Luncheon Room appears to have been provided though perhaps it is intended to use the Cooking and Sewing Rooms for such a purpose. I think it would be possible for the boys to use one of these rooms and the girls the other.\n\n(3) No provision appears to have been made for the accommodation of a school bus. The transportation of children to the Cowichan Indian Day School is now being looked after by one of the local Catholic Priests, but such an arrangement might not be possible after the Consolidated School is in working use. Transportation was mentioned on Pages 15 and 16 of my Duncan School Survey Report of July 8th 1937, and in my letter of July 16th 1938.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGerald H.

Father Lauzon, Indian Missionary at Cowichan, visited the Department on the 24th instant and brought up the question of installing electricity in the new consolidated school.\n\nI pointed out to him that it is not our practice to install electricity in day schools. However, I promised him that I would bring the matter to your attention.\n\nHe was under the impression that this school was a little different than the ordinary school and if part of the building were used for adult instruction in the evenings it would be advisable to have electric light in it.\n\nHe also mentioned that running water should be supplied at least in the kitchen. From conversation with Mr. Buck of the Surveys & Engineering Branch I understand that they are supplying an electric pump for pumping water from the well and it is quite possible that without too much expense water could be piped into the kitchen and a sink installed. If you approve of this suggestion it will be necessary to communicate with the Surveys & Engineering Branch as this item was not requested in the original specifications.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Sir:\n\nIt has been brought to my attention that no provision has been made for installation of electric lighting in the new Cowichan Indian Day School, although the power line passes right by the school. As there is no question but that some time the school will be connected to the source of supply I would recommend that the wiring be roughed in during the construction of the building to avoid tearing it apart at a later date. In the absence of the Commissioner and the Inspector of schools, on leave, I do not wish to recommend the provision of electric lighting on my own initiative.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(J.

This well is situated 235 feet west of the western boundary of the church property and 33 feet south of the power line along the south side of the Tzouhalem road, in approximately the same location as suggested by Mr. G.H. Whyte in a report dated April 27, 1939.\n\nThe well was excavated six feet square for the first ten feet and then reduced to four feet square from ten feet to twenty-five foot depth. The underlying strata being as follows:\n\n- 0 ft. to 1 ft. - Top soil\n- 1 ft. to 13 ft. - Hard Clay\n- 13 ft. to 19 ft. - Hard Clay with very thin layer of fine sand.\n- 19 ft. to 25 ft. - Medium grain sand and gravel.\n\nThe level of the ground water was found to be at a depth of 24 feet. At first the water was extremely rusty coloured but constant bailing removed much of this discoloration. The rusty colour was due to stirring up of the sand while excavating, for after bailing the well out so that the bottom was exposed, clear water flowed in from all sides of the well. Left overnight, the water in the well became almost clear. This would indicate that after using the well for a short period of time, the water will be perfectly clear. After\n\nC.E. Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water and Power Bureau,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\nbailing for an hour, the rate of inflow was tested and found to be approximately 80 gallons per hour. Deeper excavation would increase the flow considerably, as at present, the bottom of the well is only one foot below ground water level.\n\nThe depth of the well should be increased by eight to ten feet, unless clay is struck sooner, making a total depth of thirty-three to thirty-five feet below the surface. This would allow for lowering of the ground water level in the dry season and also provide a small amount of storage.\n\nThe present rate of inflow would be sufficient for school needs, but there is no assurance of the adequacy of the supply in the dry season until the well has been in use for one season and the flow compared with other wells in the same locality.\n\nAn investigation of some other wells in the vicinity showed Mrs. Sammy Bob's well, a few hundred yards west of the school site, to be 23 feet deep and it is reported to have an ample supply of water for domestic use except in very dry years. Mr. Johnson's well, about 100 yards west and on the north side of the road, is 12 feet deep and has ample supply for gardening and house use all year. A well due north of the new school site is about 16 feet deep and has a shortage of water in November and December. Father Lemon's well, about one mile south-east, is 40 feet deep and has a sufficient supply of water. On the property adjoining Father Lemon's is another well, located in the swamp, which is 12 feet deep and has ample water all year. This inves-\ntigation indicates that the test well on the new school site will probably yield sufficient water.\n\nAs suggested in Mr. G.H. Whyte's report, water could be supplied through a hydrant if a small electric pump were installed. The cost of connecting up to such a pump would be small as the transmission line of the Nanaimo Duncan Utilities Ltd. follows the main road on the north boundary of the property. The minimum power rate is $5.00 per month, which allows a consumption of 60 K.W. hrs. The cost of operating a small pumping unit should not exceed this minimum charge.\n\nAs there is no definite assurance of a sufficient supply of water in the driest portion of the year, until the well has been used for one season, it would be advisable to use wood cribbing for lining the well rather than a more permanent lining. At present the well is not cribbed but temporary wood cribbing could be installed at a comparatively small cost. As the well is to be about thirty-five feet deep, it will be necessary to place the pumping unit about fifteen feet below the ground level. The six-foot square excavation will make a satisfactory location for a pump house. It would be advisable to have openings in the cribbing from the 20-foot to 35-foot depth and to surround it with well graded gravel. This would insure a maximum rate of flow into the well.\n\nThe estimated cost of completing the test well and installing an electric pump ready for school use is given in Appendix \"A\".\nThe test well indicates that sufficient water is available but this can be assured only by using the well for one season. It will be necessary to excavate the present well eight to ten feet deeper, making a total depth of 33 to 35 feet. It would be advisable to line the well with wood cribbing which would have a life of at least fifteen years. Using wood cribbing an estimated expenditure of $742.00 would be necessary to complete the well. This amount would include the installation of an electric pump and an Eclipse hydrant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.V. McDonald\n\nAPPROVED\n\nIndian Affairs.

MacDonald.\n\nThe preparation of this report was authorized by our radiogram to Mr. Webb of June 16th last when word was received from the Indian Affairs Branch that a definite site had been decided upon.\n\nYou will note from Mr. MacDonald's report that he has excavated a well on the property which will supply water sufficient for the needs of the school but that there is no assurance on the adequacy of the supply in the dry season until the well has been in use for one season and the flow compared with other wells in the vicinity. From the comparisons made in the report, with nearby wells, it is felt that the supply from this well should be ample. You will observe, however, that Mr. MacDonald recommends the use of wood cribbing until the adequacy of the well has been proven. At such time, a more permanent lining might be installed.\n\nThe report states that water could be supplied through a hydrant if a small electric pump were installed and that this installation could be effected complete with all necessary labour and materials for Seven Hundred and Forty-two Dollars ($742.00). Operating charges are estimated to be approximately Three Dollars ($3.00) per month.\n\nThe pump would be adequate to supply water to the Cooking Room in the School should such installation be considered advisable.\n\nIt is therefore recommended that the test will be completed and equipped and that authority be obtained to utilize for the purpose funds from Vote 76-64 already transferred to this Service to the amount of approximately Eight Hundred and Ninety-four Dollars and Sixty Cents ($894.60) including items as follows:-\n\n| PRELIMINARY EXPLORATORY WORK |   |\n|-------------------------------|---|\n| Labour                        | $80.70 |\n| Hardware                      | 7.26 |\n| Lumber                        | 33.04 |\n| Engineer's expenses           | 31.60 |\n\nTotal: $152.60\n\nJ.M.

I also understand agent move will send forward additional information and forward the number to be transported to the number of two children who are more than a mile from the school. To do this work effectively a bus building is needed to travel about 32 miles a day (bus schedule both morning and evening) about 30 children will walk to school.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6388, File 807-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nIt has been proposed we engage a janitor who would also be further driving of the bus. We'll discuss this with you.\n\nI saw Sister Mark - B.C. Provincial of the Sisters of Our Lady - and she is prepared to supply 3 qualified teachers - one of these has just completed a special course in household science.\n\nEveryone hopes as soon as very much pleased with the erection of the school and the church you are to be congratulated on the purchase of a site.\n\nSincerely,\n\nPhil Milner\nOttawa,\nSeptember 28, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant with reference to the cost of transporting the children to and from the Cowichan and Koksilah day schools.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter the Department will allow Rev. L. D. Leclair an amount of $67.50 a month for transporting the children. This arrangement will be effective from October 1, 1939, until the date of the opening of the new school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a copy of a letter received from Rev. L. D. LeClair in connection with transportation of school children to and from the Cowichan and Koksilah Day Schools, which I trust you will find self explanatory.\n\nIn this connection I wish to point out that the attendance at both these schools this year is very much better than previously, at least so I am told, and at the present time the bus has got to make more trips both before and after school than they did before, and by the time the Indians and their children return from the Hop fields the number of trips will have to be doubled.\n\nAs you know, the bus being used at present is a seven passenger sedan and on practically every trip it makes now it is overloaded which is bad business from the point of view of Provincial Motor Vehicle Act, especially should an accident occur.\n\nUntil the new school opens and permanent plans can be completed for the transportation of the children to it and Koksilah, I would respectfully request that favourable consideration be given to Father LeClair's request for the present grant to be increased by the amount of $35.00 monthly. An early reply would be appreciated so that the Reverend gentleman may be informed of your decision.\n\nYour obedient servant;\n\nThe Secretary;\nIndian Affairs Branch.\nMines & Resources.\nOttawa.\n\n(R.H.Moore)\nIndian Agent.\n\nAttention of Mr Hoey:\nDear Sir:\n\nDue to your very appreciated cooperation in the matter, our school attendance is ever increasing and by the beginning of next month, October, 1939, when most of all our Indian children will be back from the hop fields, at least fifty (50) and most probably more will need transportation to and from our Cowichan and Koksilah Day Schools.\n\nIn order to provide them all with the necessary transportation, I will have to multiply the trips and consequently the expenses. Would you kindly have approved by the proper authorities an increase in the allowance, at the actual per capita monthly rate of $1.75.\n\nAt present for thirty (30) children, I receive monthly, $52.50. Therefore $87.50 would allow me to give service to at least fifty (50), and this starting October 1st, 1939, until with the opening of the new school a more adequate means of transportation will be provided for.\n\nAs you know by experience that much time and energy have been spent to train our children to regular school attendance, it would be both deplorable for the children who are disposed to attend and also for ourselves after our efforts if we cannot meet this emergency. But on my part on account of the extra expense, unless an extra allowance is approved, I feel I could not serve more than thirty (30) children, as I am now doing.\n\nAs the above request for an increased grant is for an immediate emergency, I would be very obliged to you for immediate attention.\n\nMay I assure you of my eager desire to cooperate to the success of your work as a whole.\n\nI am very truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. R.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nPI/EDL.\nDear Sir:\n\nI would advise that your letter of the 2nd instant, discussing various matters in connection with the new Cowichan Consolidated Indian School has been received, and the various suggestions therein are receiving consideration; but, before making a final reply, further information is being awaited from Mr. Indian Agent Moore regarding the transportation of pupils and proposals in connection with the centralization of the sweater industry, which information is expected before the return of Mr. Commissioner MacKay who has been called away for a few days on urgent business. In the meanwhile, it is his wish that you be assured that the matter has not been overlooked.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n6th September, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Basement, Cowichan School.\n\nReferring to your memorandum of August 23rd, it is the opinion of our Architects that sufficient access has already been provided for the admittance or removal of any articles of equipment that might be required for the manual training or domestic science rooms in this school.\n\nThe question was discussed with Mr. Hoey of your Branch who agreed that it did not seem additional doors were required.

The subject matter of this letter, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nFather Lauzon, the Priest in charge of the missionary work at Cowichan, visited the Department a few days ago. He intimated to the officials at that time that it was the intention of the sisters in charge to use half the basement accommodation for vocational work for girls and half for vocational instruction for boys. In view of this decision a second door in the basement would appear to be a necessity.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 28, 1939.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou will remember on the occasion of my visit to your Agency we discussed with Rev. Father LeClair the type of bus required for the Cowichan Consolidated school.\n\nIt was my understanding at that time that you intended to obtain further information. As yet we have not heard from you and if you have any other details available it would be appreciated if you would forward them immediately by air mail as we wish to make arrangements to purchase a bus. I enclose the letter dated August 14 from Frank Sidebotham, Ltd., also the specifications which he forwarded to Father LeClair with his letter.\n\nYou will note on the specifications that they refer to series 1550 and 1560. Which of these series do you consider more suitable? In the last paragraph of his letter you will note that Mr. Sidebotham states as follows: \"A 30 pupil bus body can be supplied on the chassis suggested by Messrs Allison and Cabledu at very little extra cost.\"\n\nI have a note saying that the approximate cost of the bus would be $3000.00. Does this amount include both the chassis and the body? I hope that you will give this matter your immediate attention and let me have your reply at the earliest possible date. At the same time make certain that you return all the correspondence which I am enclosing in this letter as the detailed specifications etc. will be required when placing the matter before the Purchasing Agent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B. C.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Sir,\n\nI arrived here, a week, last Saturday. Since then, I have been busy studying the requirements of the new school. After conferring with Rev. Mother General of the Sisters of St. Ann, I have a number of alterations, that I would like to submit to the Department.\n\nThere is no room provided for an office, where the records could be kept, where officials would be received, and where doctors or nurses could examine the children. This same room would also be required for the good management of the school, so that the teacher will be at the head of the school could confer with members of the staff. Another reason why that room would be needed is that it is to speak to the children. It is a fact of experience, that Indian children, once they grow up, are not to be reprimanded in public.\n\nAnother such a room would also be required for the Sisters. If they have to spend the whole day at the school, they should have place to retire. I have spoken with the Superintendent of the builders, and he agrees that it would be easy to move the partitions between the wardrobes and the class-rooms, so as to change two wardrobes into rooms large enough for the purposes mentioned above. Any of the wardrobes upstairs, could be used for that purpose.\n\nThere would be left two wardrobes upstairs, which could be used by the girls while the store room could be turned in to wardrobes for boys.\n\nReferring to Father Leclair's letter of Aug. 26th, I beg to inform you that no answer giving a decision on the matter of having an inside toilet for the staff, has been received. After going over the matter, with Mother General, I agreed to make a new application which we think is necessary for a group of sisters.\n\nIt was also suggested that for the sake of keeping that school clean in winter time, it would be very desirable to have two more toilets for the children, so that class hours, at least, the children would not have to run out in the mud. This matter should be settled very soon, because the sewer pipes will be put in soon and the cement floor put in.\n\nDuring my first visit in Ottawa, I spoke to Mr. Phelan, about a room to be used for a dining-room. He told me that although the plans did not provide for such a room, yet with the space we would fit in the building, it would be easy to secure such a room. After looking at the plans, the only solution would be to take the actual sewing room for that purpose, and put the sewing room in one of the class rooms where there will more light.\n\nMother General suggested that between the kitchen and the proposed dining-room, no partition would be needed. Folding doors could also be used there. The actual partition, is only a light one which could be removed, as it does not support any of the superstructure. Whether the Department provides the lunch for the children, or they have to secure their own, it would be better to have a dining-room than to let them eat in the class-rooms. The purpose of leaving the two rooms in one is to have more room for a dining place.\n\nR. A. Hoey, sq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6388, File 807-5, part 3)\nIn the kitchen also, there is no provision for a stove. On the plans, it does not indicate where the stove pipe is to pass. It would have to go through a partition, and then be connected to the furnace pipe.\n\nThe sisters were also asking if a hot water tank would be provided. Rev. Mother General was also asking what the Department intended to do about the noon meal, so as to know what would be expected from the sister who would be in charge of the kitchen.\n\nShe also suggested that the sisters should be consulted for the furnishing of the various rooms. I agree with that, because of the experience they have in the various works. They would be able to bring each department to the maximum of its efficiency.\n\nAfter looking at the plans, I presume that it is the intention of the Department to leave it to the manual training classes to provide cupboards, presses, and the like. I would be in favour of such a plan.\n\nIn renewing certain recommendations, and asking for new alterations, I am asking myself if I have a right to do so. But as these alterations must be made within ten days if they are to be made, and as I conferred with the sisters on that matter, I thought that I would be justified to make them.\n\nOur Agent, Mr. Moore has a copy of this letter.\n\nThanking you and Mr. P. Phelan for the kindness shown to me during my visit at Ottawa, I remain, obediently Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nOctober 2, 1939.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Father Lauzon:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo in connection with the new Cowichan school. I have carefully considered the contents of your letter and have also reviewed the plans.\n\nPermit me to point out that it is our desire that the new school be conducted as a day school. Under these circumstances it is not possible nor feasible to provide rooms for every purpose. The plans show that the class rooms, sewing room, kitchen and vocational rooms are sufficiently large for the purposes for which they are intended. While it may be a slight inconvenience to the members of the staff to permit the pupils to eat their lunch in one or other of the class rooms I think you will agree that it would not be possible to supply a special room for this purpose as such a room would only be required for a short time each day.\n\nIt is our desire that the building be used in the manner in which it is being constructed. I have, however, arranged for provision to be made for the stove pipe from the stove in the kitchen to the chimney.\n\nI am informed by the Surveys & Engineering Branch that a separate toilet is being provided for the members of the staff.\n\nIf hot water is required it can be heated on the stove. We cannot supply hot water connections because this would involve a great deal of additional expense and upkeep. The same applies when the matter of installing inside toilets.\n\nRev. Father Lauzon, S.M.M.,\nCatholic Indian Mission,\nDuncan, B.C.\nis considered. Such an installation would necessitate additional piping and a septic tank. As a matter of fact arrangements are being made to have a sink installed in the kitchen with a waste pipe leading to the drain. A connection is also being made to the well so that water may be obtained at the sink.\n\nI feel certain that when you have reconsidered the matter you will agree with me that the present layout of the building is all that can be expected in an Indian day school. We must keep in mind that this is not a semi-residential school. From my experience I believe that this building will compare very favourably with any white day school of similar size in the Province of British Columbia. It might be advisable to suggest to the Rev. Sisters that they should visit some white day school with a view to ascertaining how white schools handle the question of a place for noonday lunch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Phelan to this Agency and our conversation regarding the transportation of children to the new Cowichan Day School, now in course of construction, he asked me to get particulars of a suitable School Bus from one of the local dealers.\n\nI did this getting the particulars from Wilson & Cabeldu Ltd., who in turn had to get the information from Vancouver, B. C. This is a 30 passenger bus, which it was felt would be more suitable than a 20 passenger.\n\nMr. Phelan asked me to send the particulars to him as soon as I could but felt that as it might be necessary to get further particulars from the General Motors Co. in Vancouver, and as you would probably wish to see the Bus, or one like it first; and will probably desire quotations from other firms, I am sending you in duplicate full particulars of the bus with specifications of body and motor as well as prices covering the whole job.\n\nIt would appear to be a better arrangement if the manufacturers in Vancouver would quote to you direct for the dealers here have got to get the information there before passing it on to me. As soon as you can deal with this I would respectfully request that you submit the enclosed quotations to the Department as soon as possible. Please understand that the new Chassis will be out in another few weeks, the prices for which may be a little different from those quoted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(R. H.

(RG 10, Volume 6388, File 807-5, part 3)\nBeneath the attractive streamline exterior of the Superior school bus is a solid framework of steel \u2014 steel riveted and electrically welded to steel. Pillars, braces, floor, all riveted and welded, piece to piece, so the entire framework becomes a solid, safe steel structure.\n\nSteel channeled roof strainers are continuous from windshield to rear of the body and are firmly welded and riveted to upright pillars. They add materially to the strength and rigidity of the frame.\n\nFOUNDATION of the great strength of the SUPERIOR All-Steel Safety school bus body is the solid frame of cold rolled steel, electrically welded and riveted into a one-piece unit. It is an achievement in steel body structural engineering and offers greatest possible protection and safety to children.\n\nBesides the outside steel panels for sides and roof, the SUPERIOR All-Steel Safety school bus body has steel inner panels which add almost 30% to the strength of the body.\n\n\"Distributed Ventilation\" \u2014 a SUPERIOR development \u2014 is the latest advancement in temperature control. Air is changed approximately every three minutes.\n\nInsulation of the SUPERIOR body is especially effective because of the dead air space between inner and outer side panels as well as ceiling and roof. With the efficient SUPERIOR heater, comfortable inside temperature can be readily maintained.\n\nBelow \u2014 Upright pillars supporting sides and roof are spaced 27\u00bd inches apart, giving the body firm rigidity. Most important, this spacing brings a strong pillar at each seat and provides additional safety for children.\nAmerica's Choice - On The Record of Performance!\n\nSUPERIOR engineers and designers work ceaselessly to build school bus bodies that not only conform to rigid state requirements, but which provide an important margin of strength and safety. They develop more than just a better body; they develop a record of performance - the SUPERIOR Record of Performance that has earned for it the first-choice position among school bus body buyers.\n\nThis record of performance is the preference for the SUPERIOR All-Steel Safety school bus body is an emphatic endorsement of SUPERIOR'S progressive leadership\u2014a leadership that pioneered the first all-steel school bus body in 1937, and which has continued to lead\u2014SUPERIOR pioneering each year with the most important improvements.\n\nAgain SUPERIOR takes command; lead in the school bus body that sets a new standard in school bus body building. With basically right engineering, with fine designing and craftsmanship, with feature after feature\u2014it stands as the school bus body that leads in SAFETY, HEALTH, COMFORT, ECONOMY, and DURABILITY\u2014affordably\u2014the greatest dollar-for-dollar value among school bus bodies.\n\nWide range vision for the driver is an essential safety factor provided by SUPERIOR's windshield design in which pillar posts are narrow, reducing blind spot to a minimum. In addition, safety PLATE glass affords protection against shattering. Large rear view mirror and sun visor also add to the driver's ability to see.\nSUPERIOR FLOOR PLANS\n\nPlan-A (Model 2219)\nPlan-B (Model 2219)\nPlan-C (Model 2219)\nPlan-D (Model 2219)\nPlan-E (Model 2219)\nPlan-F (Model 2219)\nPlan-G (Model 4219)\nPlan-H (Model 4219)\nPlan-I (Model 4219)\n\nSUPERIOR SEATING ARRANGEMENTS\n\nSEAT PLANS\n\nPLAN-A \u2014 36\" all forward facing seats for 80\" outside width body.\n\nModel 2117 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 4 rows\nModel 2118 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 5 rows\nModel 2119 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 6 rows\nModel 2120 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 7 rows\nModel 2121 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 8 rows\nModel 2122 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 9 rows\nModel 2123 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 10 rows\nModel 2124 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 11 rows\n\nPLAN-B \u2014 4 rows of longitudinal seats for 90\" outside width body.\n\nPLAN-C \u2014 Longitudinal side seats with 36\" forward facing center seats.\n\nModel 3117 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 4 rows\nModel 3118 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 5 rows\nModel 3119 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 6 rows\nModel 3120 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 7 rows\nModel 3121 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 8 rows\nModel 3122 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 9 rows\nModel 3123 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 10 rows\nModel 3124 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 11 rows\n\nPLAN-D \u2014 42\" forward facing seats on left side with 36\" forward facing seats on right side for 90\" outside width body.\n\nModel 4117 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 4 rows\nModel 4118 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 5 rows\nModel 4119 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 6 rows\nModel 4120 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 7 rows\nModel 4121 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 8 rows\nModel 4122 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 9 rows\nModel 4123 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 10 rows\nModel 4124 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 11 rows\n\nPLAN-E \u2014 39\" forward facing seats on left side with 36\" forward facing seats on right side for 90\" outside width body.\n\nModel 5117 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 4 rows\nModel 5118 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 5 rows\nModel 5119 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 6 rows\nModel 5120 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 7 rows\nModel 5121 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 8 rows\nModel 5122 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 9 rows\nModel 5123 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 10 rows\nModel 5124 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 11 rows\n\nPLAN-F \u2014 45\" forward facing seats on left side with 36\" forward facing seats on right side for 90\" outside width body.\n\nModel 6117 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 4 rows\nModel 6118 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 5 rows\nModel 6119 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 6 rows\nModel 6120 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 7 rows\nModel 6121 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 8 rows\nModel 6122 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 9 rows\nModel 6123 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 10 rows\nModel 6124 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 11 rows\n\nPLAN-G \u2014 4 rows of longitudinal seats for 96\" outside width body.\n\nPLAN-H \u2014 Longitudinal side seats with 42\" forward facing center seats.\n\nModel 7117 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 4 rows\nModel 7118 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 5 rows\nModel 7119 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 6 rows\nModel 7120 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 7 rows\nModel 7121 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 8 rows\nModel 7122 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 9 rows\nModel 7123 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 10 rows\nModel 7124 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 11 rows\n\nPLAN-I \u2014 39\" forward facing seats for 96\" outside width body.\n\nModel 8117 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 4 rows\nModel 8118 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 5 rows\nModel 8119 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 6 rows\nModel 8120 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 7 rows\nModel 8121 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 8 rows\nModel 8122 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 9 rows\nModel 8123 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 10 rows\nModel 8124 \u2014 Forward facing seats \u2014 11 rows\n\nThese seating plans are standard, but can be rearranged when necessary to meet various state specifications.\nUNDERBODY - Non-gauge steel special formed channel placed on 12\" centers, securely riveted to overlapping 14-gauge steel floor panels.

H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your memo of Saturday last and our conversation of this morning, I checked the mileage on the proposed school route for Indian Children and find same to be sixteen (16) miles, making a total of thirty two (32) miles per day, or one hundred sixty (160) miles per school week.\n\nI am prepared to contract for a thirty (30) passenger bus for this work for six (6) months at the rate of thirty five cents (35\u00a2) per mile or a school week price of Fifty-six ($56.00) Dollars which would bring the price for the six (6) months period to One Thousand Three Hundred and Forty-four (1344.00) Dollars.\n\nInsurance carried will cover Five and Twenty Thousand ($5/20000) Dollars Public Liability for any one accident and One Thousand ($1000.00) Dollars for Property Damage and the Indian Department can be shown on the Insurance Policy so as to clear them of any Liability while children are in transit. It would also be understood that any day the service did not operate no compensation would be claimed.\n\nHoping to hear from you at your convenience, I remain\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"J. A.

This bus, which would hold up to 36 children, would comply with the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act of British Columbia governing the operation of school buses.\n\nThis coach to leave the White Bridge on the Somenos Reserve at approximately 8:05 a.m. and proceed to the new Cowichan Day School. From that point to proceed to the Koksilah School via the White Bridge and thence to the Cowichan Day School via the Tzouhalem Road. This route to be reversed in the afternoon at approximately 3:10 p.m.\n\nAny contract entered into to go into effect on the first school day after January 1st., 1940 and to be for a period of six months expiring June 30, 1940 with an option of renewal.\n\nFor your information, we wish to advise that we carry insurance on every piece of equipment we operate for Public Liability in limits of $20,000.00 for death or injury to one person and $100,000.00 for death or injury to two or more persons in any one accident and a limit of $5,000.00 for property damage. This insurance coverage would apply to any or all buses operated by us on this proposed school contract.\n\nFor the above service, we hereby tender in the amount of $11.20 per day or $56.00 per week.\n\nWe wish to thank you for allowing us the opportunity to quote on this contract, and trust that we may be favoured with your further instructions herein.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nVANCOUVER ISLAND COACH LINES LTD.\n\n\"?\"\n\nAgent.\nR.H.

No payment would be expected during a school week for holidays which would appear in the week or for cancellation of service due to weather conditions, sickness etc.\n\nThe contract would be purely on a day by day basis.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nVANCOUVER ISLAND COACH LINES LIMITED.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6388, File 807-5, part 3)\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter, date and file number above noted, with reference to matters generally in connection with the new Cowichan Day School, also for copies of letters from Mr Hoey and Inspector Barry for which I thank you.\n\nI am supposing that no comments are required from me in connection with the teaching staff of the School, as that has been all settled at least for the first year; however, I am strictly in accord with the suggestion that a Priest be not appointed Principal. However, I am doubtful about the success generally if the Sisters of St. Ann are going to remain indefinitely in charge of the School, for the simple reason that the Indians as a whole are inclined to take more interest in what their boys learn at School than their girls. I am also fearful about the attitude of the bigger boys to the Sisters, and feel that while the Sisters will probably give as good, or better, academical instruction in the class room as anyone else, nevertheless I feel that a man with organizing ability for grounds and outside work of the boys (such as gardening) is necessary as well as to keep the necessary discipline among the boys, and I am satisfied that the present teacher Mr Conway is not suitable for that, nor in my opinion to have charge of any Indian School. If we could get a male teacher with Manual training as well as class room qualifications and interested in gardening, who could also look after the physical training periods for both boys and girls and blessed with organizing ability, then I think you have the ideal man for the job as Principal.\n\nRegarding the transportation question, I beg to attach herewith letters received from two local firms, operating several busses locally for the Schools and also for some of the large mills. From these letters you will please note that the prices are exactly the same, viz: $56.00 for a school week, or approximately $2240.00 per year. These prices include all necessary Insurance as apply at present to the white schools. On a five day basis this would mean an expenditure of $11,000. If we supplied our own bus and had a qualified driver and make him act as caretaker as well and pay him $150.00 per month for both jobs, figure an average weekly mileage of 150 miles for 24 weeks at a cost of 1\u00bc per mile for the full six months you will have an expenditure of $1437.60., as against $1344.00 offered by the Transportation Companies and we would still have to pay for the services of a caretaker for the school which should not be less, I think, than $75.00 per month or a total of $450.00 for six months, when added to the cost of transportation would be $1794.00. I believe it would be much cheaper for us to operate our own bus.\n\nD.M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\nP. O. Box. 70,\nVancouver, B.

If we supplied our own bus had a qualified driver and made him act as caretaker as well and paid him $150.00 per month for both jobs, figure an average weekly mileage of 300 miles for 24 weeks at a cost of 14\u00a2 per mile for the full six months you will have an expenditure of $1437.60, as against $1344.00 offered by the Transportation Companies and we would still have to pay for the services of a caretaker for the school which should not be less, I think, than $75.00 per month or a total of $450.00 for six months, when added to the cost of transportation would be $1794.00. I believe it would be much cheaper for us to operate our own bus.\n\nD.M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nP.O. Box, 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nproviding we could get the right kind of a man to operate the bus, because the success or failure of the whole transportation system, as well as the regular attendance of the children at school, will depend largely on this man. If it is eventually decided to put on a bus of our own and employ a man in the dual capacity of bus driver and caretaker, may I be permitted to suggest that all applicants be interviewed and questioned by yourself and a recommendation made before the appointment is made. While the appointment of a good driver is essential, I believe that the Provincial authorities see to it that only good drivers are issued with a Class A bus driver's license and one of the stipulations should be that he has held this license for at least one year, free from accidents, prior to his appointment. However, to my mind, being a good driver is only one of the qualifications he should have as his attitude toward the children and parents and his interest in his job generally should be above reproach. These can not be arrived at by looking at a man's application form but must be arrived at from a personal interview.\n\nI might say in conclusion that the prices offered by the transportation companies would apply to a ten month's term at just the same rate as they are shown for the six month's period commencing at the beginning of the school term after the Christmas holidays, or whatever time it is proposed to open the School. I may say however that both companies were anxious to know just what decision is arrived at before the end of October so that they can make the necessary arrangements for their equipment for the next year which they tell me has to be done before the first of November, for if a bus is not required during the winter months they cancel all insurance and license's on that vehicle. I would therefore respectfully request that an early decision be arrived at and I be notified so that I can tell the firms concerned.\n\nAccording to my estimate of the costs involved in the transportation costs, providing we do it ourselves for a period of five years will be as follows:\n\nCost of Bus $5000.00 (this is high)\nMiles travelled per year @ $680 @ 14\u00a2 per M. 963.20\nSalary of driver & caretaker @ $150.00 1500.00 ($10 month year)\n\n$7463.20\n\nAs there are only a comparatively short number of miles run each year it is reasonable to expect that for the first five years no repairs of any kind would need to be made to the bus especially as the maximum speed would only be 25 miles per hour, and the same bus should be good for ten years with few repairs except an engine overhaul and one complete set of new tires. One advantage there would be in operating our own bus is that the driver would be more interested in the children and seeing that they attended regularly; in fact he could be given powers of a Truant Officer if it were thought advisable.\n\nI will write a separate letter regarding the sweater and knitted goods industry later.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(R.H.Moore)\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6388, File 807-5, part 3)\nDear Sir:\n\nYour File 152-22-1.\n\nThe question of transportation arrangements for the Indian children who will attend the new Consolidated Indian School at Duncan has been given considerable thought. The following courses are open to us:\n\n(1) Transportation by Departmental bus.\n\n(2) Transportation by arrangement with one of the local motor transportation companies.\n\nComparative costs are briefly summarized as follows:\n\n(1) By Departmental Bus\n\n(Considering original cost of bus at $3000)\nAnnual depreciation, insurance, licence fees, etc. $900.00\n\nRepairs, gas, oil (estimated at 10\u00a2 per mile)- 600.00\n\nOperator's salary at $125.00 per month for 10 months, for which he would also do the janitor's work at the school: - 1250.00\n\nTotal - $2750.00\n\n(2) By Motor Transportation Co.\n\nBased on 197 school days, less 7 holidays, 190 days with daily mileage of 32 miles or 6080 miles per school year:\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\n6080 miles ...\n6080 miles per year @ 35\u00a2 per mile\n(which is the mileage rate paid by the City of Duncan for the transportation of white school children) or 190 days @ $11.20 per day\n\nTo this should be added part of school janitor's salary as with Departmental bus, operator would also act as janitor.\n\nJanitor, 10 months @ $50 per month\n\nTotal\n\nThe above is considered to be a fair comparison of costs, and even if it should finally be established that the cost of operating a Departmental bus would actually be less than is herein shown, there is still the very great responsibility involved in the transportation of a large group of children to be considered. Careful consideration of the various angles of the transportation problem confronting us based on the information gathered, leads me to conclude that it would be safer, more satisfactory and as economical for us to make arrangements with one of the transportation companies for the transportation of the children for the current school year, when the matter of transportation could again be considered, if necessary.\n\nIn order that the Department may be in a position to fully consider the matter, the following letters are enclosed:\n\nIndian Agent Moore to Indian Commissioner of Sept. 24th,\nIndian Agent Moore to Indian Commissioner of Sept. 30th,\nVancouver Island Coach Lines Ltd. tender for transportation of Indian children, of Sept. 20th,\nCowichan Valley Bus & Taxi Service tender for transportation of Indian children, of Sept. 19th.\n\nTenders on school bus from the following firms are also attached:\n\nVancouver Motors Ltd.

Ltd., Vancouver, (Dodge or Fargo)\nWilson and Cabeldu Ltd., Duncan, (Chevrolet)\nInternational Harvester Co., Vancouver, (International)\n\nIf .....\nIf I were to express an opinion as to the motor vehicles offered, I should say that the International unit would in all probability give the best service.\n\nI should appreciate being advised in due course of the Department's decision in this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKey,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDear Sir:-\n\nWith further reference to my letter of the 24th inst., which was in reply to yours, date and file number above noted, with reference to transportation facilities for the new Cowichan Day School. I beg to attach hereto a letter in duplicate from the V.I. Coach Lines Ltd., which will throw further light on their letter of September 20th. inst., which you have received.\n\nIf you will please refer again to the letter from the Cowichan Valley Bus & Taxi Services, (Kyle), you will note that in the third paragraph of their letter that they state as follows: \"It would also be understood that any day the service did not operate no compensation would be claimed.\" I take it that it will not be necessary to have a further letter from them although I have confirmed it with the Company verbally.\n\nI am also enclosing herewith additional prices and specifications of another Bus which I think would be the most suitable of any, and the cost is $3320.00 F.O.B. Duncan less Sales Tax, which the Dept. would not have to pay anyway. It would appear from the letter received from Mr. Phelan that they consider buying a Bus instead of hiring, but of course they could always change their mind after receiving your letter. I also enclose a copy of my letter to Mr. Phelan.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n\"R. H. Moore\"\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nD. M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nM?

The 85 new desk sections with the 27 old desk\nsections available will furnish seating for 30 pupils in\neach of the Senior and Junior Divisions and 35 pupils in\nthe Primary Division, or for 95 children.\n\nFour substantial teacher's desks will be needed, as\nwell as four teacher's chairs and eight visitors chairs for\nthe four classrooms.\n\nIn the vocational room in place of school desks we\nshall need:\n\n2 ordinary and 2 tailor type Singer treadle sewing\nmachines and 15 chairs for girls.\n\nA large cutting out table and a teacher's table\nwill also be needed in this vocational or sewing room.\n\n4 classroom clocks and one kitchen clock will be needed.\n\nA suitable kitchen stove to burn coal and two large\nkitchen tables will be needed in the kitchen.\n\nIn the lunch room six large trestle tables and\ntwelve forms will be required.\n\nOne large school bell and six small desk bells will\nbe needed.\nThe following articles will be most necessary:\n\n**Furnace Room**\n- 1 only coal shovel\n- 1 long iron hook poker\n\n**Entrances**\n- Front: two large (at least 25in by 36in but larger if possible) coco door mats.\n- one metal scraper mat\n- Children's: four largest size coco door mats\n- two metal scraper mats.\n\nOne large garbage can.\n\nThe three carpenter's benches, five small forms, one small sand table, one low kindergarten table, and all texts and other equipment now at the Cowichan Day School will of course have to be moved to the new school, and this equipment includes a few tools.\n\nA flag pole and medium size Union-Jack flag will be needed at the new school.\n\nWhile the lighting fixtures are in place, the school wired, and the electric light and power meter in place, there are no electric light bulbs at the school.\n\nI have gone into the matter of lighting with some care and consulted the experts of the B.C.Electric Co., this morning. As a result of what I have learned I would recommend the supply of the following lights:\n\n| Division                  | Lights of 200 watts each |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Senior Division           | 6                        |\n| Junior Division           | 6                        |\n| Primary Division          | 6                        |\n| Vocational Room           | 6                        |\n\n| Hall                      | Lights of 200 watts each |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Entrance Halls            | 2                        |\n| Cloak Rooms (4)           | 4                        |\n\n| Room                      | Lights of 150 watts each |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Manual Training Shop      | 8                        |\n| Kitchen                   | 4                        |\n| Lunch Room                | 4                        |\n\n| Door                      | Lights of 150 watts each |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Outside Entrance Doors    | 2                        |\n\n| Room                      | Lights of 60 watts each |\n|---------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Furnace Room              | 2                       |\n\nLumber will be needed for the Manual Training and the strips to which the desks are to be fixed. A large number of cupboards and shelves will need to be constructed, and no doubt other articles for use in the school.\n\nMay I suggest that at least the sum of $200.00 be made available for dressed lumber, fir and pine. A number of tools additional to the small quantity from the present Cowichan Day School will be needed. These will cost about $150.00. A list could no doubt be prepared by the Manual Training Instructor later.\nOn December 11th I visited the Cowichan Indian Day School and the Koksilah Indian Day School, not to inspect but to find out as well as I could how many pupils might be expected at the new Cowichan Consolidated School on opening.\n\nOn the roll of the Cowichan Day School there are now some 66 children, of which only 13 boys and 19 girls were present on the morning of the 11th.\n\nAt the Koksilah Indian Day School there were 18 boys and 16 girls present out of a total 37.\n\nOf the above 37 pupils only 22 are described as Roman Catholics by the teacher, Miss Perry. I am aware that some of the Roman Catholics at the Koksilah School may not wish to change to the new Cowichan Consolidated School, and it is very doubtful if we have the right to force the parents to send their children to the new Catholic school. It should be remembered that the Koksilah School is more or less undenominational though taught by a United Church girl.\n\nThere are some children not going to either of the present schools who should come to the new school.\n\nFrom 80 to 90 pupils should be expected at the opening of the new school, and while force should not be used, I do think that the Catholic children should be encouraged in every way to attend the new school.\n\nThe provision of bread and soup, which I hope the Department will provide, should attract the children.\n\nWhile I asked for four teachers at the new school in my letter of September 8th 1939 only three Sisters have been authorized. The plan outlined in my letter of September 8th could not be worked with three teachers. It will now be necessary to have boys and girls in the same academic classes, and under this arrangement it will be just possible I hope to arrange the teachers' work so that vocational as well as academic work can be taught.\n\nI am to see the Sister Superior and Prefect of Studies this afternoon and I shall do all I can to assist first these Sisters of St. Ann to make out their requisition for supplies and later to assist the actual Sisters going to Cowichan with the organization of the classroom work.\n\nThe original requisition forwarded to Mr. Moore by the Sisters of St. Ann included many of the articles mentioned in this letter. Other articles, some necessary and some unused in our schools, were included, and as the requisition was in a form almost impossible for you to deal with, I am spending some time assisting the Sisters to draw up a better list of necessary articles, which I hope the Department will supply.\n\nWhile I believe the teachers, Manual Training Instructor and Janitor should be at the new school from January 3rd, the day set for opening, I do not see how the classrooms could possibly be ready then for the children. May I suggest that the children do not attend the new school after the Christmas vacation till at the earliest Monday, January 8th, but much better Monday January 15th.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H.

As the building has not cost as much as was originally estimated there will possibly be sufficient funds available to carry out his suggestions.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nDecember 7, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant with reference to your recent visit to the Cowichan Consolidated Indian day school.\n\nYour recommendations regarding the toilets are being brought to the attention of the Surveys & Engineering Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI had occasion recently to visit the Cowichan Agency and while at Duncan went out to look over the new Cowichan Consolidated Indian Day School. The building has every appearance of having been well constructed, and is of very pleasing design. One is favorably impressed almost immediately with the somewhat distinctive lines and general appearance of the school. The classrooms are large and bright, and the basement has been subdivided so as to provide for Manual Training and other requirements. The building, which will be completed shortly, will be an important addition to the facilities provided by the Department in this Province for the education and training of our Indian children.\n\nIt would appear that the contract only provided for three small outside toilets, as this is the number that has been erected. One of these is for the staff. The accommodation provided in this respect is by no means sufficient, and I would suggest that provision be made immediately for the construction of an outside screened-in boys' urinal and two extra toilets. This would meet the requirements and would provide two toilets for the girls and the same number plus an urinal for the boys. Board screens should be erected in front of the urinal and all toilets. Should funds not be available at the moment to provide all this additional accommodation, I consider it very important that the urinal be constructed, and I should appreciate covering authority in this respect.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

The offer of the Cowichan Valley Bus & Taxi Services mentions a period of 6 months. The Department prefers to have an agreement with this firm for a longer period unless you are aware of some reasons why such a contract should not be made. I should, therefore, appreciate it if you would arrange with them to handle this work on the basis specified in their contract for the period January 1, 1940, to June 30, 1941.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

You may arrange for the purchase of a kitchen range. It is noted that you quote a price of $90.00 and that the weight of the stove to which you refer is 480 lbs. It is felt that a much lighter stove should meet the requirements at this school. In any case it will only be used for limited periods and I feel that a stove costing around $50.00 or $60.00 should be sufficient.\n\nYou may also purchase the shovel and poker at an estimated cost of $2.25.\n\nRegarding the kitchen equipment $60.00 to $75.00 should purchase all the equipment that is necessary. Our funds are rather limited at the present time and if it is found later on that additional equipment of this kind is needed it can be purchased.\n\nA teacher's hand bell and 4 desk bells are being ordered from the Government Stationery Office.\n\nYou may also purchase 50 electric light bulbs.\n\nThe Purchasing Agent is being requested to procure the school desks and teachers' desks and chairs.\n\nIn regard to the 3 items -- (a) construction of cupboards and shelving, (b) construction of tables and trestles, (c) strips of wood to which desks should be fastened -- I believe that you should purchase the\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nlumber that is necessary for these purposes and have the manual training instructor and the older boys do the work. Such procedure will mean a slight delay in having this equipment ready for use but it will provide good training for the boys and besides a considerable saving in cost should be effected.\n\nI note that there are some tools available for the manual training class at the present Cowichan Day School and that these will be transferred to the new school. Inspector Barry suggests an expenditure of $150.00 in the purchase of new tools but, as stated above, our funds are limited at the present time and consequently we can only consider an expenditure of approximately $75.00 for the purchase of new tools. If more are needed we can arrange for their purchase after April 1. I think I can depend on you to purchase only the tools that are absolutely necessary.\n\nThe Department does not consider it advisable to purchase wall clocks due to the fact that this would involve considerable expenditure and our experience shows that they are continually going out of order and require repairs. You may, however, if you consider it necessary, purchase an ordinary alarm clock to be placed on the teacher's desk in each of the class rooms.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nYour File 152-22-1,\nCowichan Consolidated Indian Day School\n\nI beg to forward herewith a letter received from Inspector Barry regarding the requirements in desks and equipment of the new Cowichan Consolidated Indian Day School. I would recommend immediate consideration be given to the supply of the following:\n\n83 School desks, approximate cost, f.o.b., Vancouver, $600.00\n\n1 Kitchen Range, f.o.b., Vancouver, 90.00\nSuggest range similar to those used in Provincial schools be supplied, which is \"Queen Mary\" type, size of top 44\" x 27\", reservoir 7\u00bd gallons, weight 480 lbs., fire box for coal or wood.\n\nFurnace coal shovel and poker, 2.25\n\nKitchen equipment, such as soup bowls, spoons, pots and pans, etc., 150.00\n\nClassrooms:\n\n4 Teacher's Desks and chairs @ $40.00, 160.00\n\n1 Large school bell, 6.25\n\n6 Small desk bells @ $3.70, 22.20\n\n50 electric light bulbs, at various prices, 18.00\n\nIn addition to the foregoing, materials and the\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nservices of a qualified carpenter should be authorized for the following:\n\n1. Construction of cupboards and shelving in the kitchen.\n2. Construction of tables and trestles for the lunch room.\n3. Preparation of strips of wood to which desks should be fastened and labor for fastening desks.\n\nNo information has been supplied with respect to the number and size of cupboards, shelving, tables, etc., necessary so that I would suggest that an amount of $200.00 be provided to cover materials and labor for this item. The total approximate cost of the foregoing items would be $1250.00.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing, the equipment necessary for the vocational and manual training rooms, including tools and materials for the latter, is required. The Department might make provision for these on the basis of the information supplied by Capt. Barry, but if more detailed information is necessary, which I should imagine the Department would require, this could be supplied, if desired.\n\nIf clocks are provided for these schools, then this item should also be taken care of.\n\nAs the school is scheduled to open the first week in January, I should appreciate receipt of your instructions with respect to the items which should be provided prior to that date.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

It is hoped to have this school ready for occupation early in January and, therefore, it would be appreciated if the order for these desks were placed at the earliest possible date. We could not place the order earlier due to the fact that we have only recently been advised of the date of the completion of the building and if the desks had arrived before the building was finished there was no place to store them.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

The Caretaker will be required to operate the furnace, keep the building clean and assist with the school garden.\n\nThis is a case where it is considered that an Indian should be given preference in appointment. Owing to present economic conditions and the high cost of relief, the Department feels that when an opportunity arises where the employment of an Indian will meet the requirements, he should be given consideration.\n\nMajor MacKay has thoroughly discussed the matter of a Caretaker for this school with the Indian Agent, Mr. R.

He is 38 years of age, good living and industrious, and is stated to be qualified to undertake the work.\n\nIt is thought that $600.00 per annum would be a fair and reasonable salary.\n\nI have, therefore, prepared a submission to the Civil Service Commission and Treasury Board for the establishment of a position, and would ask that the matter receive early attention.\n\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In the interval the staff will be kept occupied in getting the equipment on hand installed as well as placing in position that made available from day to day.\n\nInspector Barry informs me that the boys are too young to be of much practical assistance to the Manual Training Instructor in assembling and placing the new school desks and in the construction of cupboards, trestle tables, etc., in which considerable work will be involved and suggests a carpenter be employed for a short time to assist Mr. Marchant.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nYour File 152-22-1.\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Hoey's letter of December 20th in which authority was issued to purchase certain equipment required at the Cowichan Consolidated Indian Day School.\n\nThe attached quotations have been received on the equipment which is considered necessary for the kitchen, and the electric light bulbs. These items were requisitioned for by Mr. Indian Agent Moore after conferring with the Reverend Sisters in charge of the school and Inspector Barry. Deducting the cancelled items from the list, which I understand Mr. Moore has received authority to purchase, the lowest quotation is $134.74. In view of the third paragraph of your letter above referred to limiting the expenditure on kitchen equipment to $75.00, I should appreciate your further instructions before placing the order.\n\nI have examined stoves available here at a price of $50 to $60 and would say without hesitation that they are too small for a school which has been built to accommodate 120 pupils and which in all probability will have 100 pupils in attendance before the close of the current school year. I would strongly urge the purchase of the type suggested in my letter of December 14th on which the firm has quoted a price of $81.80 f.o.b. Victoria. This is the type used by some of the Provincial schools and has proven very satisfactory.\n\nI have not to date received a reply to my letter of December 28th, forwarded by airmail, requesting authority to postpone the opening of the school until January 8th and for reconsideration of my recommendation to employ a carpenter to assist for a few days in constructing cupboards, tables, etc.\n\nPlease return the attached quotations with your reply.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

WHYTE\n\nVancouver, B.C.,\nDecember 22, 1939.\nVancouver, B.C.,\nDecember 22, 1939.\n\nMemorandum - Mr. Webb:\n\nRe: Improvements School Grounds\nCowichan Indian School,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nIn accordance with your instructions I visited this school on December 8th in company with the Indian Agent, Mr. Moore, and after looking over the situation beg to report that to carry out full improvements as outlined in detail hereafter will cost approximately $1035.00.\n\nDuring time of visit the grounds were very wet from exceptionally heavy rain falling at the time and the previous day. Conditions were therefore as severe as are likely to be encountered unless after melting snow.\n\nThe several items which it is suggested might be improved are as follows. These are given in order of importance:\n\nTOILETS:- The present toilets with capacity two for boys and two for girls are rather small for a four-room school (with domestic science and manual training rooms additional) which might easily have a school population of from 160 to 200 pupils. It is suggested the pupils toilets be doubled in size by affixing directly to present toilet one of same size as that at present in place with fence in front and end as shown on plan. Doors on the boys' toilets to be left off. The cost of these improvements is estimated at $114.00 made up as follows:\n2 toilets @ $40.00 = $80.00\nFence, 6-feet high = $18.64\nTrough = $5.00\nPlus 10% = $10.26 = $114.00\n\nWALKS: A wooden walk should be provided from the road to the front of the school and also from the terrace about the rear door to the toilets. The front walk to be of 1-inch slatted material 4-feet wide and the others to be 2\u00bd-feet wide except inside fence of toilets where 4-foot walks are needed. It is assumed the main entrance for pupils will be at rear door and a 10 ft. by 10 ft. platform should be built in front of this door. This platform to be slatted of 2-inch material.\n\nThe cost of these improvements would be approximately $114.50, and work required is as follows:\n\n- 102 ft. of 4-foot walk laid and painted.\n- 220 ft. of 2\u00bd-foot walk laid and painted.\n- 1 - 10 ft. x 10 ft. platform laid and painted.\n\nGRADING AND CLEARING: Between the school and the road there is a small area of brush, also a similar area just to the southeast of the school. These should be removed and the area about the school properly graded up as shown on the plan. The area in front of the school contains three stumps which will have to be removed. One of these is of good size and appears quite solid. The others are partly rotted. Provision for flag pole with pulley and rope and its erection should also be made. The cost of grading and clearing is estimated at $82.90. It is estimated this work could be done with one team and driver, and four men in approximately four days, plus one man day for flag pole.\n\nTotal 4 team days and 17 man days.\nGRAVELLING ROAD ETC. As the fuel room and entrance is on south side of the building, it will be necessary to provide access to it by wagon or truck, therefore a road will be necessary from the highway to rear of building. It is estimated that roadway with six inches of gravel and about 10 feet wide would be satisfactory. A culvert must also be placed as shown on plan. To provide room for trucks to manoeuvre at fuel entrance and also to provide a parage ground for pupils it is considered 6\" gravelling should be continued as shown on plan. Gravel should also be provided around the hydrant in the yard and from there to the road. It is also desired that a 10 foot strip of 4-inch gravel be placed on sides and front of building. The estimated cost of this work is $80.70 made up as follows:\n\n6\" gravel on road and parage, 4700 square feet\n4\" gravel around three sides of school, 1900 square feet.\n\nEstimated 110 yards of gravel required.\n\nDITCHES\n\nThe drainage of the grounds is very necessary if they are to be used for playing fields, as due to its general flatness and clay surface soil the heavy rains usual during the winter in this district do not run off and undoubtedly the grass which now covers a good portion of the grounds would soon be destroyed if drainage is not provided. It is also necessary the swamp in the bush lying to southeast of school should also be again drained and some provision made for removal of ground water now spilled on to land to west of school. As it may not be considered necessary to put in tile drains at present,\nthis estimate is divided into two parts. Under ditches is included the clearing of the highway ditch which is now causing a considerable amount of water trouble at the site, clearing of old ditch from the swamp and clearing of ditch from pond on land to west. The cost of this work should not cost over $28.20. Work to be done is as follows:\n\nClearing highway ditch, 2 men 1 day\n\" old ditch from swamp, 2 men 1 day\n\" old ditch from pond on land to west, 2 men 2 days\nTotal 8 man days\n\nDRAINS\n\nTo further improve the condition of grounds it would be advisable to install certain tile drains as shown on the plan. The estimated cost of this work would be $172.30.\n\nWork proposed is laying of following:\n260 feet 4\" agricultural tile drain\n450 feet 3\"\n\nFENCE\n\nAs it is desired to teach a certain amount of farming at the school and as a garden is proposed, it is very necessary the property or at least a portion, be fenced. This fence will also keep stock out and thus protect the buildings etc. It has been suggested by the Indian Agent that a four foot stock fence be erected around the whole property with two 10-foot gates and two 4-foot gates as shown on plan. On the highway side of property and on west side where fence would be across open land a 2 x 6 rail be placed on top and one of same size about half way up the post. These rails would pro-\ntect fence from children climbing it. Where fence is through woodland it is suggested that wooden rails be left off and a line of barbed wire be placed on top. The estimated cost of the fence around the whole property is $407.40.\n\nWork etc., to be included is as follows:\n\n- 2000 feet of clearing for fence\n- 2000 feet #936 Mc & Mc Heavy Stock fence\n- 1250 feet 4 point cattle barbed wire\n- 2 - 10 foot gates 48\" high\n- 2 - 4 foot gates 48\" high\n- 1500 lineal feet 2 x 6 cedar rails painted\n- Necessary 4 x 4 cedar posts dipped and painted.\n\nSUPERVISION\n\nIt is believed supervision of this work if carried out by Indian labour is necessary and an item of $35.00 to cover living expenses etc. during progress of work is included. This is based on sufficient men being available to complete work in about one week. All buildings, fence, walks etc. are to be painted with brown creosote stain and bottom of fence posts tarred. Estimates cover cost of this work.\n\nAttached hereto is detailed estimate and plan showing proposed improvements.\n\n[Signature]\n\nO.H. Whyte\n\n[Stamp]\n\nIndian Affairs.

From this report you will note Mr. Whyte has covered the situation quite fully and has outlined what improvements may be carried out at the school. These include construction of additional toilets, boardwalk, grading and clearing, graveling of road and the installation of drainage ditches, as well as the fencing of the school property. Total cost of this work is estimated to be $1055.00.\n\nMr. Whyte has discussed the items in the order of their preference as they appear to him, and the extent to which the improvements are carried out will, of course, have to be governed by funds available.\n\nCosts given in this report are based on the use of Indian labour, under supervision of an engineer of this organization.\n\nCopies of this report are being furnished Mr. Indian Commissioner MacKay who will no doubt be making some recommendations to his branch in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd) C.E.

While it is considered that the Department's interests are fully protected, it would be appreciated if the proposed contract receives careful consideration. Meanwhile, the transportation of the children is fully arranged for until the end of this term, in June, in accordance with your instructions of the 5th ultimo.\n\nThe proposed contract would expire on 30th June, 1945, and would, therefore, be effective for five and one-half years, including the present term. The signature of the contractors was secured, as it was anticipated that any changes in costs would tend to be on the increase than otherwise, under conditions that are likely to prevail for some time.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.
