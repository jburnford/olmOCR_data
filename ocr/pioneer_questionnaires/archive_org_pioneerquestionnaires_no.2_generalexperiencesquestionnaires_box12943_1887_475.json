Mr. Churchill and myself, but were instructed, under the direction of Mr. Graham, tried to get us to go and help him, but he was too busy with his work, but he brought me here, and I will let him bring it down to earth. The work which Mr. Metre has proved so successful, in the Great Canadian Council of the Brothers together.

We are arranging a family tree now.\nTwo of my Sisters are retired, and living in Yorkton, Sask.\nOne in Carstairs Alta., One in B.C., One in Humboldt, Sask., One at Foam Lake, and one met with an accident in running a team of horses, which resulted in her death.\nOne brother at Govan, Sask., and the youngest brother near Demolines U.S.A.\nFather and Mother died at 82 and 79 respectively; I am nearing 77, and thank God, able to work and still get a kick out of life.\n\n23. Is there any particular experience of pioneer days that stands out in your memory which you would like to record? The second Year in Sask., 1888, we were used to using shorts, but they were shorts then, and we lived most of the Winter on shorted bread, scones, bread, with plenty of good rich pure milk, and were very much healthier, and not ashamed to tell it, had plenty of vegetables etc., and built up a foundation which proves that the food in those days was pure, which cannot be said of most of the so-called food we get today.\n\n24. Did you travel about much in the early years? (for business, attending church, visiting friends, etc.) How often? How far? By what means of travel?\nWe did not travel far in those early days, but our friends and neighbours might live 50 to 100 miles distant, but we knew about them, and they were the means of travel later horses, light bronchos from U.S. which we had to break in, and it was fun.\nThe only form of recreation was a dance among the neighbours, when we would put some hay in the waggon box, pile in, dance till dark, have breakfast, come home do the chores, and have a sleep, we had to make our own fun. Never heard of drinking anything stronger than water or milk, can't say that today.\n19.

We are arranging a family tree now.\nTwo of my Sisters are retired, and living in Yorkton, Sask.\nOne in Carstairs Alta., One in B.C., One at Humbolt, Sask., One at Foam Lake, and one met with an accident in runaway team of horses, which resulted in her death.\nOne brother at Uxbridge, Sask., and the youngest brother near Demolino U.S.A.\nAnd Father and Mother died at 62, and respectively, I am nearing 77, and thank God, able to work and still get a kick out of life.\n\n23. Is there any particular experience of pioneer days that stands out in your memory which you would like to record? The second Year in Sask., 1888, we were used to using oxen, but they were shorts then, and we lived most of the Winter on short as porridge, scones, bread, with plenty of good rich pure milk, and were never more healthy, and not ashamed to tell it, had plenty of vegetables etc., and built up a foundation which proves that the food in those days was pure, which cannot be said of most of the so-called food we get today.\n\n24. Did you travel about much in the early years? (for business, attending church, visiting friends, etc.) How often? How far? By what means of travel?\nWe did not travel far in those early days, but our friends and neighbours might live 50 to 100 miles distant, but we knew about them, and even were by means of travel later horses, light broughams from U.S. which we had to break in, and it was fun.\nThe only form of recreation was a dance among the neighbours when we would put some hay in the waggon box, pile in, dance till daylight, have breakfast, come home do the chores, and have a sleep, we had to make our own fun. Never heard of drinking anything stronger than water or milk, can't say that today.\n25. What was the first car used in the community? The first car I rode in was a Model T.\n\n26. If you owned a car before 1914, when did you buy it? What makes it 1910 Ford?\n\n27. How was your traveling comfort? How far from your home?\n\nIn 1914-19 there was no store other than Langley's where the first store was opened by Mr. Langley. In a large tent, that is where salesmen in the new location.\n\n28. Did you continue to trade there? (Indicate any changes due to new terms appear-\n\ning.)\n\nWe have been there and we are able to travel in comfort, and the people who own a rubber tire buggy was looked on as the people who today drive Lincoln automobiles. It was the buckboards and horses.\n\n29. How often did you shop in the early days? When we moved to the trading business, Mr. Langley was the nearest store other than Langley's. We traveled to Langley's in spring with the wagons and sometimes no stores\n\nin winter. Yes, no doctor near 60 miles, and sometimes no stores.\n\n30. When (if ever) did people in your district first start going to town regularly on Saturdays? I should say about 1912-1916.\n\n31. When (if ever) did you first begin to buy through the mail order catalogs?\n\nWhat kind of articles did you buy in this way? Indicate also what fraction of your total purchases were by mail order and any changes in the proportion of purchases made by mail order since the pioneer days.\n\nAbout 1910, mostly wearing apparel, and not over $10. I would say as far as the common people, there is more purchased now than before the opening of the store.\n\nI will venture to say we are progressing now in the early days of settlement, too much spent for such sport, but in comparison to population we are doing much better.\n\n32. When did you first have a telephone and what company provided it?\n\nThe first one I had the privilege of using was hung on a farmers wire fence near Langley's. It was a fair, but it tied together the neighbors, and made life more enjoyable.\n\n33. When you came to Saskatchewan the first time was it with the idea of staying permanently? Or did you make up your mind after trying it out? When did you make this decision? I stated that out side of eight years in B.C., I have lived in Sask. for 65 Years, moved back from B.C., I have lived to stay here. I enclose a poem I wrote a few days before we made our way back, and no doubt we will end our remaining days here, as I love the province and its people.\n25. What was the first car used in the community? The first car I rode in was a Ford.\n\n26. If you owned a car before 1914, what did you buy it? What makes 1910 Ford.\n\n27. How was your traveling comfort? How far from your house?\n\nIn 1914-19 there was no other than Washington, D.C., was attended by many passengers. In 1914-19 where the first stage was opened by\n\none passenger. In 1914-19, that is where salutes is now located.\n\n28. Did you continue to travel there? (Indicate any changes due to new terms appear-\n\nWe have been there and were able to travel in comfort and the people who\n\nowned a rather tired buggy was located on the people who today drive\n\nLincoln. Especially it was the buck-horned horses.\n\n29. How often did you shop in the early days? When we moved to the resulting\n\nbusiness district was the nearest shopping center that was fortunately not\n\noptimum. In spring with two wagons and in fall when we delivered the out-\n\nstanding year, no doctor near 60 miles, and sometimes no road.\n\n30. When (if ever) did people in your district first start going to town regularly\n\non Saturdays? I should say about 1911-1912.\n\n31. When (if ever) did you first begin to buy through the mail order catalogue?\n\nWhat kind of articles did you buy in this way? Indicate also what fraction of\n\nyour total purchases were by mail order and any changes in the proportion of\n\npurchases made by mail order since the planer period.\n\nAbout 1910, mostly wearing apparel, and not over $10.\n\nI will venture to say we are progressing only in our minds, there is too\n\nmuch spent for such purposes as in U.S.A. and the same goes for beer on a large\n\nscale but in comparison to population we are doing much the same thing they are\n\nfor $100 to $10,000 for a single mail order purchase.\n\nThe real estate for investment must be at least $10,000 each.\n\nAnd the cost of living is so high that even Canada's prosperity is not per se buying.\n\nBut the cost of the property in spite of the war is still low.\n\nThere are competitive systems here to live at pleasure, and the inventive to\n\nmake money by selling this system to others.\n\nIt is a lie to get it over the air and the greatest\n\nthing that has been done is the result. The old children\n\nare shooting and killing\n\nin the presence of the Mother, willingly increase.\n\n32. When did you first have a telephone and what company provided it?\n\nThe first one I had the privilege of using was hung on a farmers wire.\n\n33. When you came to Santa Barbara it first time was it with the idea of staying\n\npermanent? Or did you make up your mind after trying it out? When did you\n\nmake this decision? I stated that out side of eight years in B.C., I have lived\n\nstay here. For 65 Years I moved back from B.C., this year 1902, and intend to\n\nstay here. I enclose a poem I wrote a few days before we made our way back,\n\nonly do doubt we will end our remaining days here. I love the pleasant life\n\npeople.\nSaskatchewan.\n\nI was born Saskatchewan\nQuite some years ago,\nI've travelled over Canada\nThru summer heat and snow,\nI've worked in lumber camps and mines\nI've sailed the salty seas,\nBut now I'm heading home again\nSaskatchewan for me.\n\nI'll see the homestead once again\nMeet Mother at the door,\nThe Meadow Lark will greet me\nAs in the days of yore,\nFor then I'll settle down for life\nWith friends who've stood the test\nOf all the lands I've travelled\nSaskatchewan is best.\n\nI see the fields of waving grain,\nThe cattle in the run,\nA Tiger Lily here and there\nA nodding in the Sun's light,\nWhile Nature adds her miracle\nNor Nature has a plan, the train has stopped\nThe breaks are set, the train has stopped\nBack home, Saskatchewan.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note: (name not legible)]\nSaskatchewan.\n\nI was born Saskatchewan.\nQuite some years ago,\nI've travelled over Canada.\nThru summer heat and snow,\nI've worked in lumber camps and mines.\nI've sailed the salty seas,\nBut now I'm heading home again.\nSaskatchewan for me.\n\nI'll see the Homestead once again.\nMeet Mother at the door,\nThe Meadow Lark will greet me.\nAs in the days of yore,\nTis then I'll settle down for life.\nWith friends who've stood the test\nOf all the lands I've travelled.\n\nI see the fields of waving grain,\nThe cattle in the run,\nA Tiger Lily here and there,\nA nodding in the Sun's smile.\nWhile Nature says her miracle\nFor Nature has a plan, the train has stopped.\n\nBack home Saskatchewan.\n34. Did any people move away from your district prior to 1924? What reasons did they have for moving? Did many return?\n\nSome people in Southern part of Sask. did move, but very few as compared to those who moved North to share the rain-fall land and new surroundings were much preferred to the soil desert conditions in Southern part of the province, but with the advent of the proposed dam on S.Saskatchewan River, these conditions will be changed and will add to the comfort and well being of the people who have remained.\n\nAnd we hope the work will soon commence on the project. If the Federal Govt. does not care to assist in this undertaking, we can do it ourselves, we are on the verge of great prosperity in this province.\n\n35. Did many people move away during the 1930s? Did many return?\n\nSome people in Southern part of Sask. did move, but very few as compared to those who moved North to share the rain-fall land and new surroundings were much preferred to the soil desert conditions in Southern part of the province, but with the advent of the proposed dam on S.Saskatchewan River, these conditions will be changed and will add to the comfort and well being of the people who have remained.\n\nAnd we hope the work will soon commence on the project.

If you or some member of your family have held public office, or have been active in any organizations, mention it here. Giving dates wherever possible.\n\nI was employed by Federal Govt., Indian Affairs, Dept. of Indian Affairs in 1900 as Farm Instructor at Poly/Sask.\n\nThis was the only time I was employed as such, other than working for a farmer or?\n\n37. If you or any of your family or friends were \"first\" to have or do something in the district mention it here, giving dates wherever possible. (Such as owning first building, first school, first church, first post office, etc.)\n\nThe first school built in the district was called \"First School,\" District No. 1, H.C. This would be about 1871.\n\nThe first crop of 20 acres was cut with an old mower in 1871.\n\nThe only organization known at that time was the \"First Church,\" District No. 1, H.C.\n\nThere were no lodges of any kind in the district until 1900 when the Independent Order of Odd Fellows was organized.\n\nThere was a school in the district prior to 1871.\n\n38. How did the places in your community get their names? (School districts, Post offices, villages, railway stations, creeks, hills, etc.)\n\nTry to give: (1) name of person who named place; (2) date and reason for change; (3) date and reason for change; (4) any changes in names since the first name was given.\n\nI am unable to state who gave the name to the town of Saskatoon, but it could have been some Scotchman who lived there at that time. In fact, I remember it was/that think the name was given by a man who came to Canada from Scotland.\n\n39. Do you know of any early settlers who came to your district before 1871?\n\nI do not remember how many of these early people landed in April, 1889, but know they came and the village thereafter was called Welcome.\n\nOn opening up of Villages (Saskatoon), there were three or four men who came to settle near a charge of trees just building houses, etc., as a shelter, store or two men in each house, potatoes, etc.\n\nWe had plenty and a good feed to all who came then and these people moved to their homesteads, but the days were nice and cool and this day they have been some of the best people who ever came to Canada from the old country. From the Govt's point of view and upholding the\u62b1boys of our Country in true Scottish style.\n39. Questions regarding historical source materials:\n\nDo you have in your possession or do you know the whereabouts of diaries, old letters, old posters and programs, minute books of community organizations, old pamphlets, old photographs, written recollections and reminiscences? (Describe).\n\nI am sorry I have none now. I had some records from Polly Beating back to 1868, but I gave them belonging to O.C.O. No. 96, where we lived last, I do not know. If I have I shall get them together and try to get them to go to Croogoos as soon as spring is here. I am sure they will be interested.\n\nThen we were in the Langhorne & Ne. Westerly R.R., which was the first time they were known there. Then the Manitou & North Western R.R., which was the second time they were known there. Then the R.R. moved to Selkirk, and then the Winnipeg & Red River R.R., which was the third time they were known there.\n\nLater, when the R.R. moved to Selkirk, they were greeted three fine fellows coming around. Would you or the person who owns them realize those days, since a month we were faring?\n\n(1) be willing to lend them to the Provincial Archivist for copying? Later, I will\n\n(2) be willing to present them to the Archives Division of the Legislative Library Regina, or the Archives Office at the University in Saskatoon.\n\n(Indicate your preference, if any). At your discretion.\n\n40. If you have children or grandchildren, please give their names, where they live and occupations.\n\nI will supply this latter, as we are having a family tree arranged now.\n\n41. What do you think are the most important changes in your community since you first came west? I have heard about Sask., considerable, and the most notable change is the advent of this power house, and the most notable change is the advent of this power house. We are getting away from the art of killing animals. The power of advertising thru press, and Radio, is in my opinion being carried too far in trying to make money fast, we are losing much of the art of living. Pride, fine homes, the food and other things that are full of life upon every man's table. WARM weather this spring, we will be able to take care of our crops and not get it wet in one year. Last fall I noticed in many places where the farmers were unable to work still, and should it be wet again, hit them hard, we might be in for one of the worst worst seasons that conservative could ever hope for. I hope it is so, but we have had a much less dry winter than very little snow, and where the rows of grain lie under the trees, crop has been saved, and where the rows of grain lie under the trees, crop has been removed there will be no grain left, which must be thrown before sowing can begin, and this will prevent early sowing and is worth of the wet grain will come to our assistance if ever this New Season about I hope the Lord will come to our assistance if ever this New Season about to break a nation is measured in the Homesteaders' immortal troubles they have their look ahead over the 49 line, the news is NOT good, the internal troubles they have their please give your names and addresses of other pioneers who could answer this questionnaire.\n\nJames and William Paterson, Preceville, Marshall Reynolds, Preceville.\n\nJ.
