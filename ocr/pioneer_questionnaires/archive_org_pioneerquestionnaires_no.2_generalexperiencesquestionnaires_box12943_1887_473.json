Is there any particular experience of pioneer days that stands out in your memory which you would like to record?\n   Don't know whether to class it as particular. Remember my cousin Jose Hammond & I taking a stroll one day, wandered on to the Indian Reserve, which was about a mile away, met a bunch of Indians, who told us a Montana, put our feet out. So it was only a year before that a neighbour said he had seen them. Then there was the time when out on 16 mile Lake a party of us went out in Anna Blair's boat, dived in for a swim & tangled in weeds & nearly drowned. Space will not permit to relate the narrow escapes one has, such as, drowning, getting shot, being dragged by runaway horses, etc.\n\n24. Did you travel about much in the early years? (for business, attending church, visiting friends, etc.) How often? How far? By what means of travel?\n   Not much. As it took too long riding behind a team of oxen. Last summer travelling with one person in a small car.

Time marches on.\n19. How often did you write to relatives or friends in your old home?\n\n20. If you got married, give the name of your husband or wife along with the date and place of marriage.\n\n21.

Is there any particular experience of pioneer days that stands out in your memory which you would like to record?\n\n24. Did you travel about much in the early years? (for business, attending church, visiting friends, etc.) How often? How far? By what means of transportation?\n\n[Handwritten text not legible]\n25. When was the first car used in the community?\n   about 1914\n\n26. If you owned a car before 1914, when did you buy it? What make?\n   Have never owned a car, too old. Most of family have cars\n\n27. Where was your trading center? How far from your home?\n   14 miles to Maple Creek\n\n28. Did you continue to trade there? (Indicate any changes due to new towns appearing, better means of travel, etc.)\n   Yes I believe in patronizing our home town\n\n29. How often did you shop in the early days?\n   about every 2 weeks\n\n30. When (if ever) did people in your district first start going to town regularly on Saturdays?\n   In the old days if I was not home by 6 p.m. Oh I wonder what they're doing now in this age, they don't want to work till after supper. In such a rush forget half the stuff.\n\n31. When (if ever) did you first begin to buy through the mail order catalogues? What kind of articles did you buy in this way? Indicate also what fraction of your total purchases were by mail order and any changes in the proportion of purchases made by mail order since the pioneer period.\n   First time I heard of T. Eaton was back about 1870 at that time, Barn prices being kept up in M.B. Nudels 5\u00a2 each, & if one complained, storekeeper said it was the freight; But prices are more reasonable now.\n\n   The reason many of the Ranch women had to patronize mail orders was they could fill out the orders at home. When on 9c of young children in some cases it would be years before a woman would get to Town.\n\n32. When did you first have a telephone and what company provided it?\n   Have no telephone\n\n33. When you came to Saskatchewan the first time was it with the idea of staying permanently? Or did you make up your mind after trying it out? When did you make this decision?\n   I think anybody or most of them figured it was OK at a neighbors one time. Phone many, nothing the body of the house was kept away answering questions a long time. I said that maybe a handy thing to have. She replied yes but sometimes I feel like talking an are something it's all right sometimes, but when some gossip phones you asking a lot of stupid questions, just as you are expecting the man in for dinner it's not so good.\n25. How was the fruit our used in the community?\n\n26. If you owned a car before 1914, how did you buy it? What makes?\n\n27. Where was your trading contact? How far from your house?\n\n28. Did you continue to trade there? (Indicate any changes due to new towns appearing, better means of travel, etc.)\n\nYes, I believe in patronizing our local Town.\n\n29.

Indicate also what proportion of purchases were made by mail order during the pioneer period.\n\nFirst time I heard of \"Catalogues\" was back about 1875\n\nat that time, Barry's store kept them. She keeps and it was the middle 5\u00a2 each. 9\u00a2 of our camp family. She keeps and it was the\n\nfrugal; But prices are more reasonable now.\n\nThe reason many of the Armed Forces had to purchase Paul's\n\nwere they could not get the orders at home. Also on 9\u00a2 of\n\nyoung children in some cases it would be 10\u00a2 before a summer\n\nwould get to Town.\n\n32. When did you first have a telephone and what company provided it?\n\nHave no help here.\n\n33. When you came to Saskatchewan the first time, was it with the idea of staying permanently or did you make up your mind after trying it out? When did you make this decision?\n\nI think completely or nearly. The history of the house\n\nat a neighbor's one place. Also, I said I'd make it a\n\nfamily thing. I've heard it's all something, but when one grows up\n\nin an old community it's a lot of stupid questions. Just as you can expect,\n\nthe man in the dinner is not so good.\n34.
