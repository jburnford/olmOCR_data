If you have any particular events or experiences to relate, please describe them.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOTHER QUESTIONNAIRES\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer Days: What Did Western Canadian Pioneers Eat?\" is still being circulated.
