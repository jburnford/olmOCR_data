Is there any particular experience of pioneer days that stands out in your memory which you would like to record?\nThe friendship of the people of the early days is one thing that we will never forget. The school house was never locked. The stable was an open door. The windows were never covered at night, so some one might need your light for a guide. And that friendship still holds true.\n\n24. Did you travel about much in the early years? (for business, attending church, visiting friends, etc.) How often? How far? by what means of travel?\nThe travel was not very extensive. We traveled to Yellow Grass Home for business and trading. Our first school house was built in 1908 and church was established there at that time. Church was held in the homes one year before the school was built. The school was just across the road from our land and the post office was at the corner of our land. The travel was all by horse drawn one mile away. The travel was all by horse and buggy or by sleigh and team, and more often with a wagon and team than buggy.\n3.

When (if ever) did you first begin to buy through the mail order catalogues?\n   What kind of articles did you buy in this way? Indicate also what fraction of your total purchases were by mail order and any changes in the proportion of purchases made by mail order since then.\n\nThe mail order catalogues were mainly our chief source of buying in early days. Nearly all clothing and most of our needs. I would always buy half or more of the total purchases were made through Eaton's catalogue. But in later years that few catalogs was shipped to a small store (with the building up of the town and store began to stock more every thing). However a certain amount of mail order business gradually became less.\n\n32. When did you first have a telephone and what company provided it?\n   The Government Telephone.\n\n33. When you came to Saskatchewan the first time was it with the idea of staying permanently? Or did you make up your mind after trying it out? When did you make this decision?\n   The first year or two it was hard to think of staying here always. I was thinking of moving my wife to Montana and working some money so as to go back East. But as the country developed with the coming of the Railway and building of a town more people settled here. This homesick feeling to leave this gradually wore away.\n25. When was the first car used in the community? 1914\n\n26. If you owned a car before 1914, when did you buy it? What makes? Model & Serial.\n\n27. Where was your trading centre?

(Such as owning the first automobile, combining organizing the first lodge, etc.)\n\nMy Dad Billed the first car of mail out of Ogema in May 1911. I believe we bought a car out of the first shipment that was sold in town. And I believe they were delivered in Ogema. No more in a company that had the first building outfit.\n\n38. How did the places in your community get their names? (School districts, Post offices, villages, railway stations, creeks, hills, etc.) Try to give: (1) name and occupation of person suggesting place-name (2) origin and meaning of the name (3) date of its adoption (4) any changes in names since the first name was given. Give facts of new name as above in (1), (2), (3).\n\nOne night in June at a football practice with newspapers on the field which you could hardly hold in third hand in the rain. We then decided that the Post Office would have a name that was suggested by Ernie. But a homesteader said we call it Key West. I don't know whether he was thinking of Key West Florida and sign of mosquitoes down there. We all considered well that might be the case. So we said it may have been the sea to the west. So we said it beyond. This way the name was stuck. We acted in beyond. It was the name that stuck. We acted in beyond.\n39. Questions regarding historical source materials:\n\nDo you have in your possession or do you know the whereabouts of diaries, old letters, old posters and programs, minute books of community organizations, old pamphlets, old photographs, written recollections and reminiscences?

What do you think are the most important changes in your community since you first came West?\n\nI think the most important change is the doing away with the horse power, and replacing it with the machines. Hand labor has been almost entirely eliminated by the machines, and with the power lines now there's a lot of the country the machines do a lot of manual work. On no other time in history had so great a change been made in ages, in so short a time (all will in about 20 years).\n\nPlease give the names and addresses of other pioneers who could answer this questionnaire.\n\nE.G.
