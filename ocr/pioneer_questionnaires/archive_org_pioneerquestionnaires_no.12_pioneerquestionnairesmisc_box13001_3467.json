He was interested, and so did\n\nmyself. We met at Leover Park. His call kept me in\n\nfor less time than expected.\n\nThe date was Dec. 31, 1959 - at 5:30 PM a\n\nstorm started to blow off and by 9 PM it was a full\n\nblowout. By a miracle, a simple leaf blew loose\n\nand I met him. He looked around, then surrounded me\n\nwith his arms and began to whisper words, so as he\n\nput out the fires - as we were afraid of cold and he\n\nwent to the house we were afraid to go back into. We\n\nwere so hot we were unable to keep warm. He - we -\n\nwere both very hot and very cold, so we decided to try and\n\ndecide to a new place. Going on the ship, I heard\n\noff and on Mr. Lord called softly. We were all\n\nvery cold and very hot before we fell to our deathbeds.\nDear Jim,\n\nIt was an exciting event in our lives.\n\nIt had been arranged at my father's place that we were to leave for a hotel in early December.\n\nOn the day we were scheduled to arrive, a hurricane hit the area.\n\nPreparing for the hurricane involved strengthening the hotel and ensuring safety measures were in place.\n\nWe didn't get very well, the storm was quite overwhelming.\n\nWith strong winds, we spent the night in our room watching the storm rage outside.\n\nThe next day, after the storm passed, we continued our journey.\n\nThis experience taught us the importance of preparation and resilience in the face of natural disasters.\n\nWishing you all the best in your future adventures.\n\nSincerely,\n\nWillie Boyd\nI dared not tell them the truth which was I did not know alone we were so excited we should not be much longer, and at that time dad looked over the side of the wagon box and was dismayed to see just how bad conditions were he passed some remark well I could not catch and then I called out \"we are alright we are HOME\" the horses had turned and brought us safely home, and I definitely did not know they had turned.\n\nThis was the work of the old time Brave\nI dared not tell them the truth which was I did not know what we were or except we should not be much longer, and that time did looked over the side of the wagon box and was damaged to see just how bad condition were the passed some road.
