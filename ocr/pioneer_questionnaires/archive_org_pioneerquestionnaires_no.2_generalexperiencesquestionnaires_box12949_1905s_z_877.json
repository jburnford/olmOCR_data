Some of the questions here will not apply to your experiences; others may prove impossible for you to answer, so don't worry about leaving blank spaces.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1914, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer Diet: What It Was,\" and No. 2, entitled \"Pioneers' Life,\" are still being compiled. If you have already answered these, and would be willing to do so, please put a check mark here ( ).\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire on other subjects will be prepared at a later date.

(People you met on the way, meetings with Indians, adventures on the journey, accidents or other excitement etc.). A former school boy met me at Crack Lock, and we were driven in a democrat behind a spirited team down into what looked like the depths of Hell - just at even tide. This turned out to be Beaver Creek valley. We ended up that night - mother, father and our four children at a brother's former neighbor, one-room shack. There was only bunk bed, with the children about six while my husband and I slept in a back parlor. It was an unforgettable night.\n\n15. Where did you first stay when you arrived in Saskatchewan? We slept and lived in a two-room house, had windowless shack. If I'd had the money and opportunity I would have returned to the States.

Did anyone else come to Saskatchewan because of your recommending it as a place to settle?\n   No \u2014 I hope not. Money did come and my husband probably was partly responsible. He loved the freedom of virgin land \u2014 and the turkey and geese and prairie chicken that flew over or about.\n\n22. If other members of your family (brothers, sisters, parents, etc.) came West tell when they came and where they settled.\n   None\n\n23. Is there any particular experience of pioneer days that stand out in your memory which you would like to record?\n   We were 3\u00bd miles from the nearest one-room school. Our young children had to drive by horseback during the mosquitoes were so bad, the horse insisted on laying down and rolling. My husband had no time to define them, and they were only 9, 8 and 6 years old, so for months our school was postponed. It was a period of frustration and privation.\n\n24. Did you travel about much in the early years? (for business, attending church, visiting friends, etc.) How often? How far? By what means of travel?\n   We had Sunday school in our little school, with as many as 26 in attendance. We also attended Sunday School in our neighbor's homes. We traveled by horse team and sometimes by car. We were 15 miles from the town of Craik, and weather permitting usually drove in back every week or two.\n19.

Did you continue to trade there? (Indicate any changes due to new towns appearing, better means of travel, etc.). We dealt here\u2014at Riverhurst for years\u2014until 1927 except when river froze over making ferry boat travel difficult via mail order.\n\n29. How often did you shop in the early days? All dry goods were purchased there. I called them door peddlers.\n\n30. When (if ever) did people in your district first start going to town regularly on Saturdays? Around 1927.\n\n31. When (if ever) did you first begin to buy through the mail order catalogues? What kind of articles did you buy in this way? Indicate also what fraction of your total purchases were by mail order and any changes in the proportion of purchases made by mail order since the pioneer period.\nI bought my first coat and hat there. I called it in 1909, and wore it on a visit back to the States that year. I decided on that visit home, I preferred my Canadian way of life.\n\nI bought all clothing necessities by mail order in early days. Perhaps half of food and buying the rest at local stores.\n\n32. When did you first have a telephone and what company provided it? 1922 Alexander Bell Co. - Rural service\n\n33. When you came to Saskatchewan the first time was it with the idea of staying permanently? Or did you make up your mind after trying it out? When did you make this decision?\nNo, we were going to get rich quick and return to the States because we hoped each\u2014and the next year would be even luckier year. Each year was worse than the last\u2014drought, rust, grasshoppers, hail, and poor sandy soils. We planted more wheat some years than we harvested.\n25.

Nazism still poisons the minds of very many Germans. There is no reason to believe that there is not the slightest assurance that the evil forces are not ready to continue their havoc at the first opportunity.\n\nThe effects of two decades of totalitarian teachings, of racist and militaristic propaganda, do not appear to have been checked.\n\nThe Canadian Jewish Congress before adjourning, the Government use its good offices to delay admission of Germany to the family of nations until it is clear that such a step will not involve the reliving over of the wicked record of the Nazis and until it is certain that such an admission will not strengthen the forces of totalitarianism in the world.\"\n\n**FILM GUILD COMES OF AGE**\n\nBritain's oldest film society, The Edinburgh Film Guild, this year celebrates its 50th anniversary. With a membership of over 2,000, it is thought to be one of the largest film societies in the world.\n\nClouded chicken houses and hail stones as big as hen's eggs ever happened.\n\nNever in my life, before or since, have I experienced such a feeling of well-being, all's right with the world as I would when my Dad signed the bill and said \"Everybody back to bed.\" Stern's all over.\n\nAs if of one accord, we came to life, some of us diving head-first into the apple barrel, others plunging our arms to the elbows in the dill pickle crock, searching for the biggest pickle. Up the stairs we would climb, laughing and joyfully spill milk to the water pail and with peace and contentment in our hearts\u2014falling into bed\u2014perhaps to dream of finding the old dill pickles and potatoes with great big juicy green eyes.\n\nAs I sit here and listen to the roar of the bulldozer as it excavates our new, big, up-to-date, modern community deep freeze storage locker plant, I feel sad, sad that my children's children will never have memories of the old food cellar, remember so vividly\u2014and the delicious\u2014my mother prepared from the contents therein.\n\nI wonder, as I roast my perfectly preserved, frozen-in-a-minute, big, juicy, tender corned beef, if future, will my family enjoy it as much as we enjoyed the corned beef and cabbage preserved so well in the old storm cellar? I wonder\u2014oh, yes, I wonder,\n\nin financing the purchase of consumer goods.\n\nThe following requirements will be in effect when retail sales are made on the instalment plan on and after November 1, 1930:\n\n| Motor vehicles (e.g. passenger automobiles and motorcycles) | Minimum down payment | Maximum time to pay |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| All other consumer goods                                     | 20%                 | 18 months           |\n\nIn no case shall the down payment be less than $5.00.\n\n**INSTALMENT PAYMENTS** are to be in regular, approximately equal amounts of not less than $5.00 monthly or $1.25 weekly.

I remember it well.\n\nMy parents migrated from the woody cyclone Minnesota state in the early nineteen-hundreds to the Canadian prairie.\n\nFrom living in one extreme they reverted to the other, a pioneer homestead overseeing nothing but a flat expanse of prairie, nary a hill or a dale in sight.\n\nHow I, as a young one, hated that endless, bleak land with only the trees above meeting the horizon to break the view. The heat waves that rippled and shimmered in the distance on hot summer days filled me with a woebegone, desolate feeling that then unexplainable.\n\nMy parents, however, seemed to revel in that newly-found freedom of space and appreciated God's handiwork in its naked state. Nary a tree was planted on our homestead. They never ceased to be awed at the beautiful panoramas of the skies; sunsets, sunrises, the moon, the stars, rainbows, storm-clouds, sun-dogs. My folks were never earth-bound; they literally lived with their heads in the clouds. My dad, as well as his breed, delighted in the songs of the wild birds, war keys, geese, ducks of the air. How often I've heard my parents remark \"Wonderful country, this Canada. Space to see and live in. No chance of a storm sneaking up and catching us unawares in this country\"\u2014No more!\n\nMy mother would often, come the cold winter evenings, hold us spellbound with true tales of her youth and homes of the far-off prairie winds that ripped and tore their way through her childhood territory, great trees snapping like match sticks; houses sailing through the sky like modern aeroplanes, barns, horses, cattle, pigs, all over single log coops, and Aunt Hattie our maiden aunt, hanging suspended by her long, beautiful hair in her nightdress, from the top of a huge oak tree. Aunt Hattie lived to tell the tale but died in her bed, partially scalped, head to her dying day.\n\nGrandma, a pioneer nurse in her own right, bound the injured messes back on with good thick, black molasses.\n\nThen there was cousin Tessie, who sailed through the tree tops, also in night attire, was frequently held in a neighbor's oat bin. She, poor girl, was innocent, but for years and years quite forever after, but we all loved hearing how cousin Tessie saved her wild oats.\n\nThe cellar meant that lumber was naturally an expensive commodity\u2014and cement was virtually unknown. The roof had no fancy shingles but was covered with tar paper, lathed on. In as much as we young ones used to sleigh-ride from the roof to the ground on the banks of piled up snow, our house frequently leaked some rain on those days. But no one seemed to care overly much. At the first splash someone would run for a tin dipper. Occasionally the leak would spring unexpectedly over someone's bed and then Dad would hustle to tack on a new piece of tar paper.\n\nOh, I'm willing to admit our house was not as much as far as modern houses go and as the family grew, it grew room by room. But, by golly it did have one thing of which we were mightily proud: It had a storm cellar.\n\nMost pioneer homes, I think I can safely say all pioneer homes had a cellar\u2014an ordinary hole in the ground beneath the house garden provision cellar. No fancy affairs, these either. At least ours wasn't. A few rough boards shelves held the jars of fruit, canned vegetables such as marrow, squash, pumpkin, cabbage, etc. This was more or less temporary produce and not expected to keep more than that last fall December. We also kept a small barrel of potatoes handy here for ready daily access. Our family, like most pioneer families was a big one; ten of us boys and girls all mixed up alive and kicking, and very discontented.\n\nFood, then as today, was of vital importance! It's true my mother's knowledge of balanced diets, vitamins and calories was nil in my early days, but she did realize, that the human frame as all, she must have healthy, happy children and not spindly, undernourished, mentally retarded ones.\n\nConsequently, my mother and dad usually gardened in a big way and always respected a bountiful harvest. Should nature fail, we had a bountiful supply of water in the form of a deep \"bucket on a rope\" well. How we youngsters hated that job! We were backwards, all.\n\nWatering the garden was our ob. At least we had to dip and carry the pails of water to the garden's edge. Mother and dad took it from there. The last one to the well was always a big, fat, monkey and no one seemed to mind it. At this job we were backwards, all.\n\nWith our own children in mind, nowadays, I shudder at the thought of what old pioneer women must have endured. If it hasn't been only a few feet from our kitchen door stood, the top of the cellar like a stick a foot or so off the ground. To each side, a two-by-four piece of lumber was nailed with nails that could sink the pail to the proper level for my slight weight. Invariably the pesky thing would disappear out of sight. Then there was to me a torturous thing\u2014a bitter tug-o-war between the over-flowing pail on one end of the rope and me, a very disgruntled me, on the other end. One thing I can say, however, this hard over-stretching of the rope built up muscles on my forearms and a strength in my wrists, unknown to most puny females. These facts so impressed my sportsman Dad, he attempted to make a female puller just for me. He even went so far as to team me up with a brother two years older, for boxing lessons. Many a bout we've put on for the benefit of the visiting threshing crew. Mother eventually noticed my nose growing in size and leaning to one side, but put a stop to this unlady-like racket.\n\nBut in the meantime the gardens were watered, vegetables grew, the harvests were garnered and finally stored in our underground cellar and its neighbor, the\u98ce\u66b4 cellar.\n\nNow the storm cellar was descriptive to the same as the ordinary cellar except it led away from the ordinary cellar by a dark underground passage. Not only this, it was a bit deeper and had the floor of our house here too. It was a place under the earth, beneath the frost line with only the sky above. To me it was an awesome thing. It had two main purposes: To store and preserve the quantities of garden produce we would consume until next year's harvest, and secondly to do just what its name implies: give protection from storms.\n\nIt was an odd-smelling place, not unpleasant and quite cool during the hot summer nights. It had offensive nerves. Not since my childhood days have I smelled a smell to equal it.\n\nMy Yankee grand-parents, thinking always of their dear daughter and family, each fall would ship several barrels of apples, sorghum syrup, brown sugar and a keg or two of apple cider. These commodities, in common with mother's canned tomatoes, preserved beans, preserved hams and corned beef, plus bushels of new spuds, blended to make an aroma I'll guarantee was unknown to any other pioneer family. We had occasion to smell it often.\n\nCome a hot, murky, clothes-stick-to-your-back kind of day, you would hear my dad and mother begin to mutter, \"This heat's terrible. Sure to blow up a storm tonight. We'll have a win and a half storm tonight. So hot and sticky, a person can't breathe. Sure to have a storm tonight.\" And sometimes it did.\n\nNot the kind of storms where parents had been accustomed to rain and lightning sometimes hail, but more often rainstorms. When these storms happened to burst upon us in the middle of a noon and sight we were rushed around and ushered into our trundle beds with the words, \"Hurry down to the storm cellar.\"\n\nKeep Out Nazis\n\nCJC Advises\n\n\"The admission of Nazis among any German immigrants who will be allowed into this country will endanger the harmonious pattern of Canadian life and will create security problems of the utmost degree,\" said the Canadian Jewish Congress today in a letter to Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent urging the utmost care in the admission of Germans.\n\nThe Jewish Congress said:\n\n\"The coming of any Nazi will necessarily, the community of Canadians of German origin whose record of contribution to our national life is so creative...the Government must be aware that the admission of any immigrant with a fascist background will complicate the security problems of our country at a time when the entire western world is giving rise to the most anxious concern as evidenced by recent American measures to prevent the entry of any person who at any time was a member of any totalitarian organization. Moreover, it would constitute a grave menace to democratic ideals if such an immigration brought to our shores those with so vile a heritage.\"\n\n\"We fear that unless the greatest caution and reserve is exercised in the face of these laws, Canada may be faced with grave moral, political and administrative problems which can be avoided at this juncture,\" wrote Mr. Samuel Bronfman, National President of the Canadian Jewish Congress.\n\nThe Congress urged the greatest reserve in all questions regarding Germany and German nations.\n\n\"Germany's wounds inflicted only a short time ago in an international initiative must be faced with grave moral, political and administrative problems which can be avoided at this juncture,\" wrote Mr. Samuel Bronfman, National President of the Canadian Jewish Congress.\n\nTo ignore these inhumanities and the formulation of Canada's Nazi policies is to ignore the sacrifice of six million Jewish victims and the German occupation of large parts of Europe.\n\nTo ignore these inhumanities and the formulation of Canada's Nazi policies is to ignore the sacrifice of six million Jewish victims and the German occupation of large parts of Europe.\n\nFurthermore, it is universally recognized that the extermination of Jews was not the kind of storms where parents had been accustomed to rain and lightning sometimes hail, but more often rainstorms. When these storms happened to burst upon us in the middle of a noon and sight we were rushed around and ushered into our trundle beds with the words, \"Hurry down to the storm cellar.\"\nThe Old Storm Cellar\n\nWith the roar of a bull dozer and the sound of the earth age trucks ringing in my ears as they rip and tear at the earth, I remember it\u2014the old storm cellar. I remember it. I remember it. I remember it.\n\nMy parents migrated from the early cyclonic Minnesota state to the Canadian prairie living in one extreme they left behind. They reverted to the other, a pioneer over someone's bed and their bed. Many but we were put up for the winter. Occasionally a tin dipper, unexpectedly dropped by a weary traveler would run into our new place. We weren't going to be the family grave yard. The heat waves that did have any thing to do with the weather were mighty proud. It had a storm cellar filled with hot, steamy days filled with hot, steamy nights.\n\nMost pioneer life, however, seemed to be a tale of hardship and a constant battle against the elements. My parents, however, were never heard to complain. They lived literally \"in the earth.\" Their heads in the clouds. My dad, as well as his brood, delighted in the sounds of the wind, rain, and snow. My mother was often seen smiling up at the sky during cold winter evenings, holding tales of her youth\u2014her home of the prairie\u2014her childhood\u2014her memories of the prairie. Aunt Hattie lived to tell the tale but bore a scar on her face. She finally escaped death by hanging herself from an oak tree. Aunt Hattie lived to tell the tale but bore a scar on her face.\nThe Stay-at-Home\n\nOh, I'm willing to admit our house was modest, far as most homes go; as much so as the great new grow-room by room. But, by golly it did have one thing in which we were blessed. If there was a storm cellar.\n\nMost pioneer homes, I think, I am safely saying, all pioneer holes in the ground beneath the house, garages, cellars, whatever they may be called, there either. At least ours wasn't. A few rough boards over a stone foundation, and a few crude bins for the easily stored winter vegetables such as marrow, turnips, carrots, and even potatoes was more or less temporary produce was not expected to keep much longer than the first snows came down. This hole kept a small bin of potatoes handy here for ready daily access. Our house was a two-room affair, and our family was a big one; ten of us boys and girls all mixed up, alive and well, and very happy.\n\nFood, then, was today, was of vital importance. It's true my mother's cooking was rather simple, but the food was always good, and she knew how to make it taste good. She was a hard worker, and her meals were always hearty and nourishing.\n\nOne day, while we were playing outside, we heard a loud noise coming from the direction of the woods. We ran to see what was happening, and found a large tree had fallen across the road. We knew we had to get out of the way quickly, so we ran back to the house and told our parents about it. They told us to stay inside until the storm passed.\n\nThat night, we heard thunder and lightning outside, and we knew we were safe inside our house. The next morning, we went outside to see the damage caused by the storm. We were amazed at the destruction caused by the wind and rain.\n\nOur house was typical of most early pioneer dwellings. It started out being a squat two-room cabin built on a hillside, and was banked with nature's bountiful prairie soil\u2014plain, ordinary dirt. Thirty miles by sleigh or wagon horse team to the nearest railway.\n\nThe Stay-at-Home\n\nThe Canadian Film Guild comes of age\n\nBritain's oldest film society, The Edinburgh Film Guild, this year celebrates its 21st anniversary.
