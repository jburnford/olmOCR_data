They would have all kinds of old overalls, smocks, shirts, etc. Buttons, thread, buttons, and just about everything that would be suitable to a housewife. Pubs kept these supplies. They would do a big turnover. The tea and coffee came from before we had very decorative ornaments practically to the house. Of course, Eaton and Simpson's Catalogues were the family book, so the old copy.\n\n17. **Give a typical day's menu (breakfast, dinner & supper) for the earliest year you can remember. Give the year and list the members of the family with their ages at the time. State the approximate month, e.g., winter or summer.**\n\n   We eat pretty well the same as now. Of course we had all our comforts to make our selves, our own Biscuits, Buns, Pies, Puddings, everything about the same only you had to do it yourself. We didn't have electricity, so we used oil lamps. We didn't stay up late at night unless neighbors came over. We were all kept busy making blankets. Building to really bubble round the stove when it was very cold, the houses then were built so very warm, one into the other would go out and back the house up with snow. But the times then people helped one another more, they were all poor, what it matters we would go with them to school house.\n\n18. **What year did you serve your first Christmas dinner in eastern Canada?**\n\n   Our first dinner on the Prairie was at one English London neighbor. They came out about 1900. We had chickens, potatoes, all kinds of vegetables and plum pudding with brandy sauce. And I remember the lady set fire to the brandy all blazing around the dish when she brought it in. Christmas was very special and Christmas Eve spent in church, pulled with oars and we sang songs to the school house for the Christmas Festival. Everybody was friendly all joining in the fun.\n\n19. **Were you ever reduced to almost starvation level living on one or two locally produced foods? Give details.**\n\n   Sometimes when blizzards or the roads were bad you got pretty low. I can remember when one of the children was very brought up on bottle, we had no milk for the bottle so we had to keep patching one bottle with another try to make it do till we could get some more. I lost one child in bad weather conditions.\n\n   Our young hero doctor for 40 miles, yes we had our experiences of love standing but through all the hard times we can look back to some very happy times.\n\n   We didn't see linoleum on the floors nor much paint on the floors or wood work, we got on our knees and crawled the floors, my first curtains were never hanging them out of these cloth I put fills around them and thought they looked the best. There was hardly houses you see curtains too. But it took a lot of patience to get along. We also sent to the mail order\nFarmers for the oxen and afterwards we went in for horses. We had oxen about 3 years we paid $50 dollars each for the first horses we got 3 mares & horse, after that we started to improve. The three mares were in foal and it wasn't long before we got stock around. But we broke the homestead with Oseen. We see many prairie fires they would come so close it would make the walls of the old shack so hot. The women then played a big part, helping in raising stocking milking and many other things to numerous to mention. Neighbors were about 2 miles apart. We had an old Bachelor 1 mile away. I did his washing and baking, and we had another good neighbor, they built us close as they could to us we were on the edge of our land, & they were too. They had 4 children, so really it didn't seem to be lonely. In the evening the men folk would sit on the doorstep and play tunes on the mouth organ, something to drive the blues away.\n\nWell I think I have told you a little of the life of the homesteading days. Afterwards my husband sold his homestead. He did carpentry work. Afterwards he helped to do building in Colgate & later Tribune.\n\nAfterwards he was agent for Lumber yard in Tribune where he was from 1928 to 1958.\n\nNow we are retired living in Waynoka.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMrs. Larry Pepper\n\nThe thing I noticed so much when I first came to the homestead was the noise of the frogs in the dews, a continual noise.\nfarmers for the oxen and afterwards we went in for horses.

Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\nThe foods of today are all prepared, meats & fish etc used to be cut up in pieces and frozen, well that had to be brought in and thawed, and then some of the stores were not made for soft coal, some times houses were terrible cold, the fires wouldn't draw. I think the homesteaders relied on milk a deal more than they do now. Children took it with their meals more, children then to my idea eat more vegetables etc. Vegetables were few, potatoes were far apart.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homemade and home prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible).\n\nLate years Bread was on the markets all the time now. But then in homestead Bread & yeast was made by the housewife who was a busy woman looking after her household, no Power Washer lots of times no Washing Machine, sometimes no churns. I had a stock & Kneader, some times Butter would come quick & some times you would be hours getting Butter. We all had to try our hands in making the comfort for the families.\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and acquiring foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include items not mentioned above, quality, methods of merchandising, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. (Use back of page if more space is needed).\n\nWe would go to the store to buy our Butter & eggs and we would bring our groceries with what we got there. I can Remember taking eggs 6 cents a dozen, Butter 15 cents one summer. It was pretty hard sometimes to keep track of the days of the week. I have heard my husband say they were invited to one house for Easter Sunday they got there on a Saturday. I know when I went first before over there we use to set our clock by the sun at 12 o'clock the sun was direct in our kitchen Window. Throwing time was lots of work and lots of fun too. The meals would be big, you would rise early Porridge, meat & eggs to fry and sometimes Potatoes lots of work and sometimes the crops would be so poor and they would have everybody worrying as to how to send meet, there was no children.\n20.
