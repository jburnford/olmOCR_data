Give a typical day's menu (breakfast, dinner & supper) for the earliest settlers in the area at that time.

Give details.\n\nIf so not recall the legendary wolf scare too close to our door, I mean starvation in its true sense of the word. However during the long and arduous winter there were times our provisions got pretty low. Nevertheless, rabbits were seen by the hundreds in the forest, so within our ammunition supply was limited to several shots out along the rabbit trail, waiting for them to come along on a bright moonlit night. I killed quite a few with a club in this manner, other times I would run away. So by doing so, I was always one step ahead of starvation.\n16. **TRADITIONS AND CUSTOMS**\n\n   Mention any customs which you recall in the neighborhood and countryside.\n\n   The food items were served in bulk prior to 1915.\n\n   As far as I recall, from then on, these items began to appear in little packages and cans.\n\n17.

Have you ever refused to almost starve on local produce foods? Give details.\n\n   If not, recall the legendary wolf was too close to our door, it meant starvation in its true sense of the word. However during the long and severe winter there were times our fellowships got pretty low. Nevertheless, rabbits were seen by the hundreds in the forest, so when our ammunition supply was limited I would set out along the rabbit trails, waiting for them to come along on a flight moonlit night - killed quite a few until a club in this manner, other times I would use a snare. So by doing so, I was always one step ahead of starvation.\n20. Noting any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the early days, compared with today.\n\nThe outstanding difference in our preparation of meals, from the early days, would seem partly due to the fact that today we use canned goods or dried foods on the table, whereas in the early days the whole family worked at one big table set on the earliest of the affairs, food was cooked by methods not now used as a result of the invention of the stove.\n\nHowever, canned goods are not nearly so nutritious as fresh foods, and I believe that the best food is still the home grown food.\n\n21. When did you begin to prepare food? (Give as many details as possible.)\n\nMy family did not rely too much on purchased or canned foods, so the years moved by, since we depended on home grown foods on the farm. Even today, although living in a modern house, I very much rely on my own grown foods.\n\nHowever, I learned to do canning and preserving home grown foods, although I do purchase numerous items from stores or otherwise.\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Nebraska.\n\nInclude items not mentioned above, quality, methods of purchasing, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. Use book of facts if more space is needed.\n\nMy early experiences as far as buying or securing of necessary or other items used in daily life were varied according to the needs of my neighbors continued until two large families in particular used eighty and nine children respectively. These families used twenty to thirty bags of flour yearly, and in order to make ends meet, they had to use the flour bags to store their clothes, since they had no means of storing or allowing these bags. The bags were cut out on each corner for a lever, a hole in the center for the neck, and pulled over each child's head, until the litter was stored away at the back. Whenever the children were lined up in the yard certainly was a queer sight. (Words of difference today.)\nMy family did not rely too much on purchased\nor canned foods, so the years moved by, since\nwe depended on home grown foods on the farm.\nEven today, although I buy a wide variety for my\nown needs, I still rely on my own grown foods.\n\nHowever, I learned to do canning and preserving\nhome grown foods, although I do purchase\nnumerous items from stores or otherwise.\n\n22. Plans add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries\nand saving food in your area during pioneer days in Western Canada.\nInclude problems of storage, quality, methods of purchasing,\nthe season, etc., and any other details. Use back of\npaper if needed.\n\nMy early experiences as far as buying\nor accumulating of groceries or other items used making\nnew homes and towns, and purchased according to means.\nHowever, I must say some of the hardships some\nof my neighbors endured well. Two large\nfamilies in particular will apply and mine\nchildren especially, their families used $10\nto $15 bags of flour yearly, and in order to make\nends meet, they had to use the flour bags to\nstore this obtain, since they had no means of\nplastic bags. These bags, the legs were cut\nout on each corner for easier access to the contents\nof the meal, and pulled over each child's name\nuntil the letters were erased. Others at the back,\nwhenever the children were lined up for the meal.\n\n(Word of advice today.)\nOxford\n\nNo. 613 S\n\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8\nOxford\n\nNo. 613 S\n\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jessylee/PioneerQuestionnairesPDFs//PioneerQuestionnaires_No.1-DietQuestionnaires_Box12938_1907M-Z_233.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 22, "total-input-tokens": 36520, "total-output-tokens": 5539, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 4], [0, 1119, 5], [1119, 2600, 6], [2600, 3887, 7], [3887, 5008, 8], [5008, 5791, 9], [5791, 6810, 10], [6810, 7685, 11], [7685, 9542, 12], [9542, 11517, 13], [11517, 13217, 14], [13217, 14096, 15], [14096, 14722, 16], [14722, 16027, 17], [16027, 17898, 18], [17898, 19958, 19], [19958, 21333, 20], [21333, 21488, 21], [21488, 21642, 22]], "primary_language": ["None", "None", "None", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, true, true, true, true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]}}]
