In the first few years, how many homes were near enough to you for visiting back and forth? How many of these were bachelor's homes?\n\n2. How often did you usually visit neighbors? It was mostly casual visits when you found it convenient to go.\n\n3. Did you usually visit on a Sunday, or other days? Mostly on Sunday.\n\n4. Were you often invited to other homes, or was most visiting done without an invitation? You can say everyone was glad to see each other in those days.\n\nWhat time of the day did you go, - in the morning and spend the day, or in the afternoon, etc.? Always in the afternoon so we could get home again before dark.\n\nWhat about meals? Did you stay when not invited beforehand? Not in the very early days; most people had enough to do to provide for themselves.\n\nHow was the invitation to a meal worded when people had come unexpectedly? (that is, was the term to \"take potluck\" used, or was some other expression common?) Yes, take potluck was often used if you didn't stop for dinner.\n\nDid there ever be a \"pot luck\" and some bread & butter if that was all you had? Or if the folks thought that meant too much?\n\nIf no meal, what other refreshment might be offered to visitors who had \"dropped in\"?\n\n5. Did the whole family go, or did someone stay home to \"look after the place\"? Everyone went, but children were very scarce prior to 1909.\n\n6. Did you ever have \"bees\" when groups of neighbors came together to put up a building, make quilts, or other such activity? No, but people were always ready to pitch in a helping hand when needed.\n\nTell what you remember about such gatherings, giving dates if possible, telling what the \"bees\" were for, and how often they occurred.\n\n7. In the earliest years that you were here, were there many parties, whisky drives or dances in homes? Describe. From 1907 up to 1909 there weren't, there was not the room for parties, as the shacks were too small and people so scarce, you did well to see one another now and again for a friendly chat.\n\nWere these more frequent in later years? Give dates. From 1915 after we got the telephones came in which made it easier to arrange social events.\n\nDid you follow any kind of informal schedule, such as going by turn from one home to another at definite times, - every two weeks, once a week, once a month, etc.? We had lots of surprise parties at our home and we had the music for them. There were several places where we had bridge parties & dancing too which made one think we were coming back to civilization.\n2. Tell what use was made of the school house for community dances, box socials, and other activities. (Include also the school Christmas tree, picnics, etc., if you have not described these on the School Questionnaire). Give dates.\n\nOur school in our village was near our present village of Zelma and most social events were held there although we had our school picnic at the end of the term when they usually got to take a vacation where they had races, games, skating in the winter, etc.\n\nThere were few dances in the school or school yard but between 1915-1920 how much of your social life was centred around the school, and within the school district? Describe.\n\nEvery year had our annual Christmas. We could not forget that the children got up the programme along with the teacher, and sometimes came out in the community when it was dismissed.\n\nThe old times as well as the community hall built in 1910 a hall was built and used as a school and gymnasium. Special events were the opening of the school.\n\nWhat material was it made of? How large was it?\n\nWho built it - the community through special funds, the municipality, some organization, etc.?\n\nWas it built in the village or town, or was it a country hall?\n\nTo what extent did it take the place of homes or the school house as a place for social gatherings and parties? (For example, if you lived in the country, did you continue to use the local school house for district gatherings, and came to the hall in town for other functions, or were you close enough to make use of the hall for all gatherings, etc.)?\n\nAfter we got a hall, most social events were held there, but all the schools in the surrounding district would have their annual Christmas and sometimes a dance and always a school picnic for the district after the school term ended.\n\n10. When parties, dances, etc., were held in homes, school houses or halls (as referred to in question 8, 9, and 10) did the entire family attend? Went in groups, loud, pool tables to help but there weren't many babies.\n\nHow were horses sheltered and fed in the winter time at these parties? There was no shelter inside the hall.\n\n11.

Explain. No, they were very co-operative and there was a very friendly spirit among the people.\n\nWas card playing accepted by all residents in the community, or were there some who frowned upon it, either as an entertainment in the home, or for community gatherings? Explain. No, I don't think everyone seemed to attend very well and enjoy a good social evening out together and they were close to the bar, but you would hardly ever smell liquor at a dance. Men had great respect for women in those days!\n12. What attempts at formality or \"wants\" do you remember in small towns, such as getting a bath when calling, calling cards, visitors treated ceremonially in parlor, etc.?
