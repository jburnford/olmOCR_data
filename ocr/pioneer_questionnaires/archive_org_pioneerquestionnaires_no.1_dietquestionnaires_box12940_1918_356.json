Notice any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\nWe now use much more fresh fruit and fruit juices; much less meat; more soups; fewer milk puddings; more steamed or canned fruit. More varied breakfast foods replacing oatmeal in summer. Meals now are generally not nearly so heavy as in the early days, probably due to machinery having replaced heavy manual work.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homecanned and home prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible).\n\nCan't say we do. Still rely on homestead and home prepared foods, but do use more purchased foods by way of change & variety as treats.\n\nOr should I say, Nov 5-1950, when for the first time since starting housekeeping on the Homestead, we moved into the city for the winter months.\n\n22.
