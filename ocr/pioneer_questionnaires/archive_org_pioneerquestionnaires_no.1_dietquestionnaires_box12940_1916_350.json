In the Yorkton district wood was used for all heating purposes also for steam power. There were two wood yards in Yorkton; the price per cord was about $2.50 and sometimes less; it depended on the supply in this part where farm woods are plentiful. These past five years coal is used for heating and the last two years oil is used for heating in many buildings.\n\n15.

WRAPPINGS AND CONTAINERS\n\nMention any changes which you recall in the wrappings and containers received with the food you purchased (give dates where possible). In the last years of last century apples were shipped west in barrels from Ontario. In recent years apples are shipped in boxes or any other container. In the last years of last century boxes were used with newspapers, paper, then wood fibre became in general use for shipping goods, brown paper for any goods with plastic wrapping.\n\n17. Give a typical day's menu (breakfast, dinner and supper) for the earliest year you can remember. Give the year and list the members of the family with their ages at the time. State the approximate month, e.g., winter or summer.\n\n18. What year did you serve your first Christmas dinner in Western Canada? Give the menu. List those present and give their approximate ages at the time.\n\nThe year 1916 would be the first Christmas dinner we served. I was married then. I was 44 years old, two children each about forty-five old men about 55 and two girls in their twenties. We had roast turkey, plum pudding and strawberry jam for drinks. We had whisky and Adams wine.\n\n19. Were you ever reduced to almost starvation level living on one or two locally produced foods? Give details.\n\nI have been reduced to a ration owing to being burned out on the fifth of January 1905. I was homesteading in the Wadena District. We went about 100 miles from Yorkton my neighbour who homesteaded near me on the same section was sick from dysentery. The doctor sent him to hospital in Yorkton Hotel. Burnt to go out with me and stay when he could get milk as the only food for him. To take till he got much better. I shovelled logs for him to build his shack. He had a party to build his house. It was a good day and they kept the campfire in the stove down and it set fire to the shack and burnt the stable. I was away for logs to build me a house when I came home at night. I had not stable and no shack. I had two stables one for cattle and one for horses. I had to live in a tent.\n36. WHAT IFINGS AND COSTS THERE\n\nMention any changes which you recall in the wrappings and containers received with the food purchased (also dates of these periods) in the last five years.\n\nLast century coffee was shipped in boxes in barrels from Canada.\n\nor at least they were not used for anything other than coffee.\n\n37. Give a typical day's menu (breakfast, dinner and supper) for the earliest year you can remember. Give the date and list the members of the family with their ages at the time.\n\nPoveshell purchased my first coffee in the early 1890s in Canada.\n\nAnd I had to go to the store to get towels. That was the only way to get towels.\n\n38. What year did you serve your first Christmas dinner in Western Canada?\n\nGive the menu. List those present and give their approximate ages at the time.\n\nThe year 1916 would be the first Christmas dinner we served.\n\nOf course, many others have served us since then.\n\nFor drinks we had whisky and Adamantine.\n\n39. Were you ever reduced to almost starvation level living on one or two locally produced foods? Give details.\n\nI heart feel pitifully for a nation\n\nworking to bring freedom on the Western Plains.\n\nWe were halfway to the west.\n\nFor many years I have been working on the same project.\n\nTo work till I got towels. That was the only way to get towels.\n\nHe faced a lonely battle down there.\n\nStable our for cattle and our horses. Had to live in a tent.\n20. Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\nIn the early days there were no canned goods in the west such as is today. We had canned beef from Australia, in small tins. The west at that time was vast but so much meat was plentiful when I came west on the ranches where I worked. Now we have canned pork and beans and other canned foods. Preparation of meals is much improved and takes much less work and time.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homegrown and home prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible).\n\nI do not rely on canned foods. I use beef and other foods raised on the farm such as poultry and some bacon. We purchase fish and we use the freezer for keeping our food. The freezer costs about $22 dollars per annum. In this way we do not use as much salted meat as we have the hydrogen power and we can keep a percentage of our food in the home freezer. This change has come about recently.\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include items not mentioned above, quality, methods of merchandizing, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. (Use back of page if more space is needed).\n\nWhen I homesteaded in the beginning of this century in western Canada, canned goods were not used much. On the ranches it was fresh meat all winter, frozen meat in the fall, and pork. I bought canned peas from Montana also canned salmon from British Columbia. Canned blueberries from Nova Scotia. The time I am writing about money was not plentiful as it is now. Strikes for higher wages was not known as far as I know\u2014salt beef and pork was the meat generally used. Canned beef as used in the British Isles was not used on the Western Ranches. It was salted meat in the summer time and frozen meat in the winter on the farms. Green tea was used by the Canadians from the Provinces of Ontario and Maritimes.\n20. Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today. In the early days these were our cameras.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of home grown and home prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible.)\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include items not mentioned above, quality, methods of transportation, prices, plans of storage, shortages and other details. (One sheet of paper if more space is needed.)\nOn June 16, 1958, I arrived in that time I have lived in Western Canada. It appeared in that time of summer.\n\nThe place where I lived for several years had all that time of have enjoyed good health living in the country.\n\nThe heat from the hot weather in the heat and in the heat generally from 1938 till the present time. The morning and working manner has had good times in comparing it with heat time.\nIn June 15-1953 if spared to that time I have lived in Western Canada for 59 years in that time I was on a World tour which lasted for seven months in all that time. I have enjoyed good health living in this country the best time is just now in this part and in the West generally from 1938 till the present time the farming and working mans has had good times in comparing it with past time.\nOxford\n\nNo. 613 S\n\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8\nOxford\n\nNo. 613 S\n\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jessylee/PioneerQuestionnairesPDFs//PioneerQuestionnaires_No.1-DietQuestionnaires_Box12940_1916_350.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 22, "total-input-tokens": 36520, "total-output-tokens": 5899, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 2], [0, 2177, 3], [2177, 3363, 4], [3363, 4228, 5], [4228, 4228, 6], [4228, 5900, 7], [5900, 5900, 8], [5900, 10368, 9], [10368, 11501, 10], [11501, 15979, 11], [15979, 17549, 12], [17549, 19325, 13], [19325, 20141, 14], [20141, 22208, 15], [22208, 23618, 16], [23618, 25685, 17], [25685, 26325, 18], [26325, 26730, 19], [26730, 27123, 20], [27123, 27278, 21], [27278, 27432, 22]], "primary_language": ["en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, true, false, true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]}}]
