(People you met on the way, meetings with Indians, adventures on the journey, accidents or other excitement, etc.) We had almost every type of trouble you could wish to meet. The one incident that stands out in my mind was when a few of the boys from Nova Scotia got up at a small town to get some lunch. They purchased sandwiches when they got what they wanted. They came away without paying for it. If the schoolmaster had known about it, I would have been thrown off them and then moved to settle. They said you can take stuff and if I wanted to build a house like that I would not start on a lot I would take up some one else's sign. I did not hear anyone from them.\n\n15. Where did you first stay when you arrived in Saskatchewan? I worked on a farm about four miles from Regina Junction.

Yes, I know exactly I was back in 1817 and a young fellow by name Frank Scott we stopped at some friends of mine at Regina. He got a lot of farm land and is still there. Understood the man he came with remembered him in his will at any rate he has the farm now one mile east of the Co-op building.\n\n22. If other members of your family (brothers, sisters, parents, etc.) came West tell when they came and where they settled.\n\nMy mother died when I was two years old and my father when I was four. I had no brothers or sisters. My father's brother took me in to live with him. They only had one girl and no difference was ever made between us. They said I went to school regularly till I was through school then they would send me to college. But the thought of going to Canada was too strong and I went to school.\n\n23. Is there any particular experience of pioneer days that stands out in your memory which you would like to record?\n\nOne day a friend brought me back with him. He told me how he could get a good job in the early days when Swift Current was on its feet. He knew someone who needed a hand, so I went there. He said he would work for me and he would send me back to my old life. So I went there and worked hard and stored up money. From there I moved to Regina and started a business. I could use some of these willows in my business as I could make them into nice things and sell them. I would be able to earn a living doing this.\n\n24. Did you travel about much in the early years? (for business, attending church, visiting friends, etc.). How often? How far? By what means of travel?\n\nSwift Current located a doctor just the mule in the country and had baby and asked the doctor if he could give me something to take the trouble off. The doctor said, \"This was William Orange.\" Swift Current he could give you plenty of advice.\" So I wrote him. He said yes I will give you a team and I said he said I will go to see the mule again. But he persuaded me to try them out. They didn't run away. This was a pleasant change so I took them and must say they were one of the best drays I ever had. They never walked off or down hill. Some times forty-five miles in five hours until they rested a while another mile took them back and made the trip in four hours. So I decided some mules were good any way.\n19.

If you got married, give the name of your husband or wife along with the date and place of marriage.\n\nMargaret Barbour from North Island\n\n21. Did anyone else come to Saskatchewan because of your recommending it as a place to settle?\n\nI don't know exactly. It was back in 1877 and we came by way of Regina. We stopped at some friend's place there and got a job on a farm. We then went to Prince Albert where we met another friend who had come before us.\n\n22. If other members of your family (brothers, sisters, parents, etc.) came West tell when they came and where they settled.\n\nMy mother died when I was two years old and my father when I was four. I had no brothers or sisters. My father took me to live with him. They only had one girl and no difference was ever made between us. They would send me to school regularly until I was through school.\n\n23. Is there any particular experience of pioneer days that stands out in your memory which you would like to record?\n\nThere were plenty of stories to be told.\n\n24. Did you travel about much in the early years? (for business, attending church, visiting friends, etc.) How often? How far? By what means of travel?\n\nSwift Current located a doctor and put the mule in the buggy and asked the proprietors if he could give me something to take. The doctor said he could. William Brumby of Swift Current said he could give me plenty of history if you wrote to him. He said yes. I will give you a team of mules. I said No, I never want to see a mule again. But he persuaded me to try them. They didn't run away. This was a pleasant change so I took them and must say that I was one of the best drivers I ever had. They never walked and often fell down. We drove for five miles in five hours. After they rested a while and took their break and made the trip in four hours. So I decided some mules were good anyway.\n19. How often did you write to relatives or friends in your old home?\n\n20. Did anyone else come to Saskatchewan because of your recommendation as a place to settle? If so, give the name of your husband or wife along with the date and place of marriage.\n\n21. Did anyone else come to Saskatchewan because of your recommendation as a place to settle?

How often do you travel by train, visiting relatives, etc.? How often? How far? By what means of transportation?\n\n24. Did you travel about much in the early years? (For business attending church, visiting relatives, etc.)\n\n25. In the spring of 1876, we moved from the farm where we had lived for many years to a new location near the town of Regina. We traveled by horseback and covered a distance of approximately 100 miles.\nIn early days we did not travel far or very often as we only had horses. But I must say we visited our neighbors more.\n\nThen there was when we have modern means to do our work and less to travel with. In early days we had to make our own entertainment so social life was much better than today.\n\n25. When was the first car used in the community? (Indicate how you have to run to town for entertainment.)\n\n26. If you owned a car before 1914, when did you buy it? What make?\n\n27. Where was your trading center?
