Some of the questions here will not apply to your experiences; others may prove impossible for you to answer, so don't worry about leaving blank spaces in the sheets of paper. If there is not sufficient space to answer all the questions, the answers should be written on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1924, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires:\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer Diet: What Did Western Canadian Pioneers Eat?\" is still being circulated. If you have not already answered this, and would be willing to do so, please put a check mark here ( ).\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaires on other subjects will be prepared at a later date.
