At first there were very few families to compare with the number of bachelors. Needless to say Mrs. Bjornsdahl's mother, Mrs. Anna Johnson, were especially overjoyed with the arrival of every new bride into the district.

Haaland, T.N. Bjorndahl and T. Odne, journeyed out from Davidson, Saskatchewan, by democrat, to Manitou Lake, looking for homesteads. They found good land just south of the lake and decided to settle there. However the land was not open for filing on, so they returned to their homes in Edmore, North Dakota.\n\nThe next summer the land was opened for settlement and these men returned July 4th, 1904, built sod shacks into which their families moved in the fall. In the summer of 1904 much land settlement took place and homesteaders shacks dotted the countryside for miles round. A post office was the first necessity, the nearest one being 51 miles south-east (Davidson). Application was made to open a post-office by the name of \"Mandal\", and T. N. Bjorndahl was the first postmaster. The mail route was up from Regina, Lumsden, Strasbourg, Taylorborre, Peacock, Ridgeford, to Mandal. It is hardly possible for us to realize the difficulty and danger involved in hauling mail by horse team and democrat or lumber wagon through winter snows and spring thaws -- but the mail came through regularly, twice a week, via this route and means until the steel came through.\n\nThe village of Madal popped up like a mushroom. Mr. Bjorndahl opened a general store and blacksmith shop. The next spring Dr. J. H. White opened a drug store; J. J. Abraham and J. Elsworth opened a real estate office; OmN. Bjorndahl started a restaurant and butcher shop; the North American Lumber Company put in a lumber yard. A school board was soon elected with N. Thomas, R. Wildie, and T. N. Bjorndahl as trustees. The first term was held in a sod shack on the homestead.\n\nT. N. Bjorndahl, secretary-treasurer, made up the first school board. A. J. Gordon and Miss Dainard were teachers; attendance was approximately 60.\nEARLY HISTORY OF THE TOWN OF VANDALIA\n\nOn the 11th day of November, 1903, three young men, R.B., Harold, T.N.

Ohno, journeyed out from Davidson, Saskatchewan, by canoe, to Hanitou Lake, looking for homesteads. They found good land just south of the lake and decided to settle there. However the land was not open for filing on, so they returned to their homes in Minnesota, North Dakota.\n\nThe next summer the land was opened for settlement and these men returned July 4th, 1904, built sod shacks into which their families moved in the fall. In the summer of 1904, much land settlement took place and homesteaders shacks dotted the countryside for miles around.\n\nA post office was the first necessity, the nearest one being 51 miles southeast (Davidson). Application was made to open a post-office by the name of Matrous, and T. N.

The first term was held in a sod shack on the homestead.\nof O. F\u00f8rgaard, Leo Pearson engaged as teacher of the dozen or so children of school age. The first church was organized by the Norwegian Lutherans. Reverend Carl Norum, as pastor, preached the first sermon at the farm home of Hans Johnson.\n\nIn the fall of 1906 engineers came through, surveying for the Grand Trunk Pacific Railroad, what is now the main line of the C.N.R. transcontinental. In 1907 the grade was completed and the townsite of Watrous was surveyed one mile east of the village of Mandal (on the Homestead). This location was decided more adaptable for a railroad stop, hence the village of Mandal was \"moved\" and the name changed to \"Watrous\" by the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company \u2014 thus naming the town after one of their directors and keeping this divisional point in alphabetical order in the line.\n\nThe first man to build on the new townsite was Frank Keebler who put up a small shack for a harness shop on the east side of Main Street in the late fall of 1907. In the spring of 1908 the townsite of Watrous was put on the market and the town grew rapidly. The first church service was held in Hultgreen and Thurston's lumber yard, and conducted by the missionary minister, R. Surtice, who was shortly after replaced by Reverend Vessey of the Methodist Church. The first church erected was the Anglican; Reverend H. King took charge. The (Reverend John Mason, pastor), Norwegian Lutheran, and Presbyterian churches soon followed. School was opened in the Hiltz Building on 2nd Avenue and Main Street on December 1st., 1908. O.M.

In 1907 the grade was completed and the townsite of Matrous was surveyed one mile east of the village of Mandal (on the Homestead).
