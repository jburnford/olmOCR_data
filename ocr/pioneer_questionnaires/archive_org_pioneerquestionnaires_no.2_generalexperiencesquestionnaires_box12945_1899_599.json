A brief explanation to the purpose\n\nIt is difficult to prepare a general questionnaire on pioneer life because no individual who has lived in this province will have experienced exactly the same circumstances as another. Some of the questions here will apply only to persons who have lived in the province for more than ten years; others may be applicable to persons who have lived in the province for less than ten years.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who have lived in Western Canada before 1914, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer Life: What Did Western Canadian Pioneers Have?\" is still being circulated. If you have not already answered it, and would be willing to do so, please put a check mark here (X) and one will be sent to you.\n\nSaskatchewan Archives questionnaires on other subjects will be prepared at a later date. Some of these are listed below. Please mark the ones you would be willing to answer:\n\n- All Questionnaires\n- Pioneer health conditions\n- Pioneer social life, sports and recreation\n- Pioneer housing\n- Pioneer education and churchwork\n- Pioneer farming experience\n\nPresentation of Questionnaires\n\nAll questionnaires will be preserved in the Saskatchewan Archives Board's Office at the University of Saskatchewan as part of the permanent records of our Province.

We came through the Canadian government agencies and many of them are still living on the same farms as when we left.\n\nWhen we came to Montana we took what was called \"settling rights\" for the land we wanted in this southern part of Idaho.
