I drew 8 loads of wood and two loads of hay from Crescent to Saltcoats 14 m. With this $300 bought my first suit of clothes for $300 from J. Eaton of Toronto.

Also you could get an acre of land for a discounted fee and comfortable conditions.\nAfter a long and tedious journey we arrived at Broadview. A man and team of horses from Crescent met us there and we left early the following morning.\n\nThe first great event was going down the hill into the Valley of the Qu'Appelle. Of course we kids thought it a great picnic to run or walk behind the wagon. The wheels were chained together for the steepest parts of the descent and the road was very rough.\n\nWhen we came to the river Nepapenele, the Indian ferry-man, pulled us across on an overgrown boat or barge, wagon, horses, and people all at once.\n\nGoing up the hill was quite different. We were allowed to walk again. Progress up the hill consisted of a number of spots. Some carried blocks to put behind the wheels at suitable places to give the horses a short rest. After much shouting, puffing, and laughing the top was reached. What a wonderful view to look back! Seemed as though some giant hand had scooped a huge ditch out of the level prairie.\n\nCamp was made and supper prepared soon after reaching the top of the hill. Darkness descended and beds were made up in the wagon box for the women and girls\u2014under the wagon for the men and boys. Lying under the wagon watching sparks from the campfire soon produced drowsiness.\n\nBut all at once the stillness was broken by \"Eh-oo-oo-oo-oo.\" \"What's that?\" came from mother in the wagon box. \"Oh, that's only wolves,\" was the driver's unemotional\nAfter a long and tedious journey we arrived at Broadview.

Progress up the hill continued, going up the hill was quite different. We were visited by a number of spirits.

Late that afternoon some tents appeared in the distance.\n\n\"We'll soon be there, that must be someone from the city having a picnic.\" \"Yes\" said the driver \"they're sure having a picnic.\" Soon he drove up beside an empty tent and said \"Here's where you get out.\" \"Oh no,\" said father, \"we must get on to the city.\" (Our few belongings were addressed to Crescent City, Athabasca, N.W.T.)\n\n\"Well this is Crescent City.\" Five tents and one log shanty with a sod roof. \"Crescent City! Where is the Crescent and where, oh where is the city? Is this a dream?\"\n\nBut the driver had unhitched his horses and we must stop here. So we got out and the children proceeded to have a very hilarious time after all the restraint of the journey.

So we got out and the children proceeded to have a very hilarious time, after all the restraint of the journey. Supper again around a camp fire and real beds or feather ticks brought from England and laid on the ground.\nAgain the blessing of sleep, the great restorer, settled down on the tired family. But again it was broken, this time by the rumble of thunder and the flash of lightning. One of those sudden August storms rolled in from the west as though nature wished to show her anger at the intrusion into her solitude. The tent was lighted up like day by the flashes, thunder followed in quick succession, and rain fell in sheets.\n\nA pool formed in part of the tent, father dug a hole and bailed water out of the tent. That is my first and most distinct memory of Crescent. Mother was in despair. \"Well there be a flood?\" Wolves last night and water tonight, what a country!\n\nBut finally the storm rumbled off into the distance and once again quietness reigned! The remainder of the pool soon sank into the sandy soil and rest and oblivion reigned over all.\n\nIt was all gone by morning, that is all but the drops of water glistening in the early sun and smelling so fresh and sweet that all hearts were soon full of gladness. \"Oh what a beautiful morning!\" Father took his old single barrel, muzzle loading, shot gun and soon came back with two prairie chickens. Very soon mother had them frying with some pork and onions and did they smell good! They did that, but they tasted better. Already the west was showing that it had compensations, if only we had adaptability to use them.\nAgain the blessing of sleep, the great restorer,\nsettled down on the tired family. But again it was\nbroken, this time by the tumult of thunder and the\nflashes of lightning. One of those sudden August storms\nfrolicked in from the west although nature waited to show\nher anger at the intrusion into her solitude. The tent\nwas lifted up like day by the flashes, thunder followed\nin quick succession, and rain fell in sheets.\n\nA hole formed in heart of the tent, father dug a hole\nand balled water but of the tent. That is my first\nand most distinct memory of Crescent weather, wax\nin despair. \"Will there be a flood?\" Wolves haunt night\nand water tonight, what a country!\n\nBut finally the storm rumbled off into the distance\nand once again quietness reigned! If the remainder of\nthe flood soon sank into the sodden soil and next and\nallusion resigned over all.\n\nIt was still gone by morning, that in all but the\ndrops of water gathering in the barley run and\nsmelling so foul and sweet that all hearts were\nsoon full of gladness. \"Oh what a beautiful morning!\"\n\nFather took his old single barrel, mighty two prairie\nshot gun and soon on the back with two prairie\ncheekens. Very soon mother had them frying with\nsome pork and onions and did they smell good! They\ndid that, but they tasted better. Already the wolf\nwas showing that it had compensation, only we\nhad adaptability to use them.\n34. Did any people move away from your district prior to 1914?
