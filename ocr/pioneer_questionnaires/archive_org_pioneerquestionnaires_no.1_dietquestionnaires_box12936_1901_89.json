WRAPPINGS AND CONTAINERS\n\nmention any changes which you recall in the wrappings and containers received with the food you purchased (give dates where possible).\n\nGreat small brown paper bags were in use in those early days and were seeking for large amounts.\n\nwhere there was not much used.\n\nfor instance our own cattle kept pigs in sacks of fifty pounds at Locust and we do not remember the price.\n\nas some things came in a consignment or list of the crops.\n\nand the total was shipped that was settled on.\n\n17. Give a typical daily menu (breakfast, dinner & supper) for the earliest year you can remember. Give the year and list the members of the family with their ages at the time. State the approximate month, e.g., winter or summer.\n\nWith five children husband & mother we numbered 7.\n\nin all oatmeal & breakfast milk consumed for change.\n\nthis was unusual breakfast & we served a good breakfast.\n\nwith new milk & sugar. Some toast & coffee after the husband would take extra if he was working hard last nights year all our family preferred to take an extra so lunch a little later from our own folks.\n\neat their pie as the afternoons lunch.\n\n18. What year did you have your first Christmas dinner in Eastern Canada? 1928\n\nGive the menu. List those present and give their approximate ages at that time.\n\nWe have always had the pecan pudding, our very old recipe which calls for ground pecans as an ingredient. For all important meals.\n\nwe also included brown rice in our family.\n\nPecan pie - the head turkey, as well as our own lunch and if possible.\n\nwe had cornbread & fruit with all other foods as usual.\n\n& so on.\n\nwe knew our friend Mr. P. & he would make the pecan pudding in his oven with\n\nsugar & nuts, it was all we could get. I used better materials & cooked\n\nfollowed the exact measurements for all other items. It proved a most\n\ndelicious pudding.\n\n19. Were you ever reduced to almost starvation level living on one or two locally produced foods? Give details.\n\nFor some years when we first came to Canada we lived off the farm\n\nso to speak. And we just called our store empty. We just superstitious\n\nsalt pepper & soap. At one time for sometime there was a year when we could\n\nnot get the cash for even this. We had no flour, none was all gone. It came to\n\nthe time when we did not know what our next meal was coming from.\n\nwe worried about the children. We worked hard to save our savings,\n\nrather they never knew how hard we were. My husband went to a neighbor who\n\nowned him more. The man refused to settle and it seemed like starvation.\n\nwe ate neighbors' food and let it happen and he paid so we got through alright.\n\nI found articles in the Montreal Witness of that date on buying the\n\nFarmers' coop helped and our meals were made up of all kinds of vegetables.\n\n& wild fruits which I canned by the gallons. They were very beautiful things with eggs.\n\nwhile the 4-H Club College cheese at sell time. Having beef during the winter.\n\nwe were satisfied since our cows were able to produce milk during the winter.\n\n& we were not buying but enjoying them.\n20. Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\nThe use of Celotexene is much better and also in better quality. I think now because of the quality, we always would want to get something like that. We used to get them in store. Now we're short supply.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homemade and home prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible).\n\nWe do not get prepared foods very yet, and our children are grown up. The older ones in our northern homes with our little boys who farm their own places, but our store will pick up. They pay, but we only put sugar into it. So on with fruit, we could not get any apple this year because an insect came out and went. I find those who sell wild and all currents, make a very nice jam. We must have our milk and canned fish when it's nothing left from the bottle. We always have good food.\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include items not mentioned above, quality, methods of merchandising, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. [Use back of page if more space is needed].\n\nNote: Mr. Archibald 300 lbs of white sugar 1896.\n\nIn earlier days I found buying a difficult problem because of the high cost. It was very slow. At first I liked the fruit, always we used soft water.\n\nLater we have in the northern fresh strawberries, but except for the wild fruits, canned fruit is not so easy at the price. To make a store need the store keeper must take the risk of buying fruit, but cannot profit off the low, the low, the low of course still.\n\nHome made oatmeal cereal for breakfast.\n\nHave been eating chicken noodle soup packets which is served as a supper dish.\n\nWe of course bake our own bread, but we purchase for the soup.\n\nAt present Rabbit is very good, but we may use the same chip on any food and are very plentiful. We cook them in salt water, then strip in bread with eggs, onions or again make a meat pie.\nThe use of Celery in the preparation of meals is not recommended due to its high water content and low nutrient density.\n\nFor example, celery can be used as a garnish or added to salads, soups, and stews to add flavor and crunch.\n\nCelery is also a good source of vitamin K, which is important for bone health.\n\nIn addition, celery contains a compound called apigenin, which has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties.\n\nCelery is also low in calories and high in fiber, making it a great snack food.\n\nHowever, celery should not be consumed in large quantities as it can cause digestive issues in some people.\n\nOverall, celery is a versatile and nutritious vegetable that can be enjoyed in many different ways.\nPutting aside the need for cleanliness,\n\nI would like to add that even after some real hard times in those days of 1912-14, when we could keep our well supply fairly clean and without sickness, we did make some meals that happy people enjoyed. The little Scotch women could bake nice scones and all, and in those days had learnt how to cook, before we came. It was often very hard for them who depended on the allotment, so my mother and my husband called on a family who first had dry bread and tea. Early in the summer they would be out gathering berries which we buy at the store. Then their crop was dried up, they did not have any choice of wild fruit or vegetables to fall back on, nor money to buy at the store. It all made such a difference having the cellar full of wild fruit, cannot also keep them with milk to make the most delicious jam.\n\nA Russian driver who had his caravan full of flour sacks fell, he had painted a lot of wheat, and when flour ran out he could not lend even a baking powder he claimed he needed it for his family. I remember there was much discussion about it, as this Russian was a bookworm.\n\nAgain the next day they were about in the district, no meat was available again there was almost no food. This man's other wife shortly thereafter fell sick, but there to their neighbors asked the men, lent him some money to buy them eggs & milk perhaps, always came to his own rescue so he said \"there was nothing.\"\n\nA man from England who had his own number of cows, and he went around amongst the neighbors and bought eggs instead where they had milk & vegetables, so on, he never paid either the other when they needed something. He was a much better plan as the self-sufficiency was distributed among all members amongst the neighbors & saved the money. I cannot state for further that this was a year when drought made most impossible to get.\n\nCrop failures came the most unsightly, but we quickly answered the help badly needed something to eat with their pasture.\n\nWe all looked upon this wonderful appearance of the mushrooms as something that had come from just straight from above. We cooked them in milk or they were put for puppy.\n\nThat was when the church made it so hard for even the creatures.\n\nI hope the Editor will forgive me in this page-long tale of the problem of food as a neighborly problem, etc.\nDuring the early 19th century, the need for convenient transportation of goods and people became crucial. The invention of the steamboat revolutionized river travel, allowing for faster and more efficient transportation of goods and passengers.\n\nIn 1812, the United States declared war on Great Britain, leading to a significant increase in trade between the two nations. The steamboat industry flourished during this time, with many companies competing to build the fastest and most efficient boats.\n\nOne such company was the New Orleans Steamboat Company, founded by John James Audubon. Audubon was not only a renowned ornithologist but also a skilled boat builder. His company produced some of the fastest steamboats on the Mississippi River, allowing for quicker delivery of goods and passengers.\n\nThe steamboat industry continued to grow throughout the 19th century, with new technologies being developed to improve efficiency and safety. By the end of the century, steamboats had become an integral part of American life, playing a vital role in the growth and development of the country.\nPellucy aside the need for consciousness.\n\nI would like to add that we often spent some real hard time in those days of 1912-13. Even if we could keep our small supply of milk and flour intact, we did make some meals that hungry people enjoyed. The little Scotch women could bake nice scones and sell them in those days, but we didn't have the same luck. We were very hard up then who depended on the store, so I mentioned my husband called me family who just had dry bread and tea. Early in the afternoon they came back and said we weren't what we buy at stores. Then their crop was dried up, they didn't have any choice of milk or vegetables to sell back to us, nor many to buy at the store. It all made such a difference having the cellar full of milk and vegetables, with milk to make the most delicious and flavorful tea. We had no money either, but our family was well fed and kept in good health.\n\nA Russian driver, the day he had his grainery full of flour sacked up, he had plenty of wheat, but when flour ran out, he could not send even a baking flour. He claimed he needed it for his family. I remember there was much discussion about it, as this decision was a Bolshevik.\n\nAgain the meat supply ran short in the district, so meat was available again, but it was scarce and very few. The men and others were shooting their game for meat, but there was never enough to feed the men. But in times of war, it was common to kill animals, always tame to their owner. So he that \"there will be no end\" a combination of English blood had the same number of men fed by him around amongst his neighbors and loomed up pigs, cows, sheep, and other animals. This was before we met better the others when they reached the market. During a week, cattle, pigs, and the food problems were distributed in small amounts among the neighbors and the men.\n\nI cannot state further that this was a year when almost all meat was impossible to get. Yet there came the most wonderful crops of mushrooms that year. We were rather than say the big puddles and passively thrown into the sack, and family who had badly needed something to eat with their potatoes. The meal looked upon this wonderful appearance of the mushrooms as something that had come from the earth straight from above. We cooked them in milk as they were not fit for anything else. That was when the church made it too hard for even the creatures. I hope the Editor will forgive me in this case, so long last of the problem of food was a neighbor's worst problem too.\nPoetry aside. The need for convenience.\n\nI was only 15 when I joined the army and had little time\nfor my own interests. We worked hard and made many\nfriends along the way. Life was tough, but we stuck\ntogether through thick and thin.\n\nWe faced many challenges, from the cold\nwinters to the heat of summer. We learned\nto be strong and resilient, and we never\ngave up.\n\nOur bond grew stronger as we fought\nside by side. We became family, and we\nwould do anything for each other.\n\nWe returned home as heroes, and we\nwere celebrated as such.
