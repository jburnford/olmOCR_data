If there is not sufficient space to answer the question, use extra sheets or write details, or describe in particular events, etc., they help to answer the question.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1914, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nSelect those questionnaires which have been prepared or projected are listed below.
