Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\nWith me there was much difference in preparing meals, as I worked out in the field with my husband and had to bake bread and so forth at night. Set better the night before and rise at midnight and coffee, put in pans in morning first thing at 5 o'clock. Back in those days I went to town only took off one day a week to wash, iron, churn and other things needing attention. Always raised around 350 chickens and had them to feed. Raised from 10 to 70 turkeys, according to the luck I had. I always prepared my meals from the beginning.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homemade and home prepared foods? (Give as many details and tales as possible).\n\nWe never lived on prepared foods. Always raised our own and bought fruit began. We learned later from 1912 to send to B.C. orchards for fruit.\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Eastern Canada. Include items not mentioned above, quality, methods of purchasing, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. (Use back of page if more space is needed). Under the sod house in dug basement we left our potatoes in 1909 & 1910 when we went home to Kansas and only covered them with paper and blankets and only lost a bu. or two, around the edge where we were careless in covering them. In 1908 when we bought our pig to raise from, she used to get out and she dug all of our potatoes that year. We had to go out and dig potatoes on shares to get ours that year. Potatoes were small that year and we could have sold them all that fall. I was afraid and we had to peel marbles all winter. Next spring the store got in some nice sized ones for $1.00 a bu. After that experience we always raised enough potatoes for our own use. Used garden truck and sold to the Hotel and stores. I never felt we could pay for eats out of our crop. I always sold butter and eggs an cheese and garden crop to meet such costs. I even paid for my piano in later years by raising turkeys, also for my own false teeth by raising turkeys. Quite a few people made ice-wells, in the ground for storage. They dug a hole and adjoing leading down and flooded it in winter, in zero weather and got sandust to cover it with. We had our shallow well, and was such a good cooler, we never fixed a well.\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and comparing them in other towns, including prices, quality, methods of payment, etc.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to express my gratitude to all who have supported me throughout this journey.
