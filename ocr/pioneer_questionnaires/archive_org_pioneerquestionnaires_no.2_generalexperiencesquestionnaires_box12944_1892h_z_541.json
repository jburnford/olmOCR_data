(Through other people? Reading about it? Railroad or government information?)\n\nI can't say that I ever heard about the West. For River Valley I was always interested in the territory of the Saskatchewan. My brothers and I were born there, and we knew nothing else.

The American Church asked him to go to the mission well to work among people whose language no spoke fluently.\n11.

Peter Taylor in Battleford, taking two risks, a wagon which he drove, and a buckboard for our furniture, which had been bought at Leask's and supplies. On the last leg of our destination, one hundred and ten miles from Battleford, what was the journey like? Do you remember? (People you met on the way, meetings with Indians, adventures on the journey, accidents or other excitement, etc.)\n\nMy husband had made the same trip so often that it was almost common place to him, and carefully planned. We met old friends along the old trail, and even though there were no white settlers all along to Colon Lake, and again I had my husband as interpreter, we made it all quite matter-of-fact.\n\nTo book us three days to make the journey, to allow the out-going missionary who was to meet us at the river to serve us, crossing the river three times, late in spring, and once more our last thirteen hours old boat and broken down buckboards, when we arrived, our trip was made very slowly, and it was to take the river for all. On the way we emerged an Indian to drive on the bank. We raised our goods which we had to leave flat, and were up at sunrise and slept on the floor of the mission house, and arrived in the night.\n\n14. Where did you first stay when you arrived in Saskatchewan? When we reached Saskatoon we started at the stopping-place for the men who were working on the railroad. But we couldn't sleep for the bedbugs, and there was nothing else to do, so we went outside and walked about till midnight. In the morning we drove to Battleford to stay with my husband's brother and his wife, stopping one night first at Eagle Creek, where they supplied us with food.\n\nThere were no white settlers until I pondered to help us pitch the tent.\n\n15. Where did you settle or take up land? There were no white settlers until 1905 around Union Lake.\n\n16. Mention any other places where you have lived since coming to Saskatchewan.

After completing high school in Manitoba and Winnipeg, I taught school for three years in Manitoba to pay my expenses at Queen's University where I began the study of Medicine in 1895, not completed my studies until after my marriage to Dr. Thomas O'Connell in 1898 and was called to the Bar. I married the mother of Mrs. O'Connell and the family from Toronto (Trinity O'Connell) in 1908 and was called to the Bar. After my husband's death in 1916, I took my family to Winnipeg, where I was medical inspector with the Winnipeg Public School Board.\n11.

(People you met on the way, meetings with Indians, adventures on the journey, accidents or other excitement, etc.)\n\nMy husband had made the same trip so often that it was almost commonplace to him, and carefully planned. We met old friends or his old neighbors, but there were no white settlers all along the old trail, and I don't remember meeting Indians until we came to Onion Lake, and even then I had my husband as interpreter, which made it all quite matter-of-fact.\n\nThis took us three days to make the journey. After the overwhelming thirst, we were able to meet us at the river to save us from a poor night's sleep. We met an Indian in the morning, and came upon a poor woman who was very slow, and a broken down buckboard. Our last fifteen hours were made very slow, and we were thankful when we arrived.\n\nOur goods which we had to leave piled up on the bank. We spent the night on the floor of the mission house, and were up in the morning.\n\n15. Where did you first stay when you arrived in Saskatchewan?\n\nWhen we reached Battleford we stayed at the shopping-place for the men who were working on the railroad. But we couldn't sleep for the bedbugs, and there was nothing else to go, so we went out and walked about all night. In the morning we started to Battleford, where we met my husband's mother and his wife, stopping one night to stay with my husband's family. First supplied us with provisions.\n\nThere were no white settlers until we got to the first town.\n\n16. How did you settle or take up land?\n\nThere were no white settlers until 1905 around Onion Lake.\n\n17.

I graduated finally from Toronto (University College) in 1889 and was called to the bar in 1890. Later appointed registrar of the Union League's store. I had been practising medicine without registration until other students came.\n\n19. How did you earn a living before coming to Western Canada? How after you came?\n\nI was a child in Ontario.
