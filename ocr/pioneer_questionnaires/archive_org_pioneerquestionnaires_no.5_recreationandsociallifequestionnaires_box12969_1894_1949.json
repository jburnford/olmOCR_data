Give dates.\n\nIt was used a lot at times - for box socials etc., we had a very jolly library club during the society. A patch of a big gate night, and a fairnight. It was always used for the School Christmas tree and concert.\n\nHow much of your social life was centred around the school, and within the school district? Describe.\n\nFor a long time it was the only building we had for public meetings, political etc., although not very convenient. The school (in some years extended to the floor) was not complete for adults - we'd bring plates & pans across them.\n\n9. When was your first community hall built? In 1916, we had a Community Hall, we built it in 1916.\n\nWhat material was it made of?\n\nWho built it - the community through special funds, the municipality, some organization, etc.? We used stones from the river bed & other materials.\n\nWas it built in the village or town, or was it a country hall? We have no village hall or school hall, but a large hall in the town.\n\nTo what extent did it take the place of homes or the school house as a place for social gatherings and parties? (for example, if you lived in the country, did you continue to use the local school house for district gatherings, and come to the hall in town for other functions, or were you close enough to make use of the hall for all gatherings, etc.)?\n\nThe Hall was used for meetings, dances, etc., we made a small charge to others than Great Green Members.\n\nThe Hall was built about 8 years ago. It was partly owned, nothing has been done about the insurance policy yet. The town can build a large hall closer to us here that now. This was a good idea.\n\n10.

Explain.\n\nNot much.\n\nWas card playing accepted by all residents in the community, or were there some who frowned upon it, either as an entertainment in the home, or for community gatherings? Explain.\n\nSome were a little more strict than others.\n\nBut, on a rule, things went off fairly well.\n12. What attempts at formality, or \"swank\", do you remember in small towns, such as gloves and hats when calling, calling cards, visitors treated ceremonially in parlor, etc.?\n\nNot in a rural community like Red Deer Hill.\n\nWe are 15 miles from Prince Albert, our nearest town.\n\nI had some visiting cards, handed to my wife when we were married.\n\n13. Was the chivaree known in your community? Describe what you remember about chivarees, telling how common they were, any incidents connected with them, etc.\n\nPersonally I did not believe in chivarees. But they do have them.

I have known cases, after a wedding where the groom has gone out and thrown all kinds of rubbish; but of later years, this custom disappears.\n\n14. Describe any other details of visiting, parties, etc., that you remember, telling of any games or amusements not already mentioned that were popular at parties and give approximate dates whenever you can when some changes in visiting or social life became noticeable.\n\nI don't see much difference. People knew each other well at home made chairs, benches, etc. If you wished to make presentations, they always helped you just the same. As a young schoolteacher of 20, when I arrived here, it appeared to me homely. They were very generous, made time in any form if you were always made very welcome.\n\nORGANIZATIONS AND MEETINGS.\n\n15.

The men had been out for several days. They came back with a load of buffalo meat. We had no food except for the deer. We went to town but no one had heard of a large herd. That fall, I went to school and met many farmers. They came down to town before the plains began to turn brown. They came down to meet us and we talked about the harvest. He said he was very hungry. We had to wait until the crops were ready to harvest. We had no food except for the deer. We went to town but no one had heard of a large herd.\"\nOxford\nNo. 613 S\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jessylee/PioneerQuestionnairesPDFs//PioneerQuestionnaires_No.5-RecreationandSocialLifeQuestionnaires_Box12969_1894_1949.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 30, "total-input-tokens": 49800, "total-output-tokens": 9935, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 4], [0, 1247, 5], [1247, 1247, 6], [1247, 2744, 7], [2744, 4050, 8], [4050, 6195, 9], [6195, 7702, 10], [7702, 10627, 11], [10627, 10627, 12], [10627, 13321, 13], [13321, 14107, 14], [14107, 16006, 15], [16006, 16896, 16], [16896, 19350, 17], [19350, 21174, 18], [21174, 23457, 19], [23457, 24588, 20], [24588, 26766, 21], [26766, 28465, 22], [28465, 29976, 23], [29976, 30977, 24], [30977, 32821, 25], [32821, 34532, 26], [34532, 36842, 27], [36842, 38609, 28], [38609, 38609, 29], [38609, 38760, 30]], "primary_language": ["None", "None", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false, false, true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]}}]
