The country has changed, the outlook, living habits of the people have changed, education in the schools different, the old neighborhood has become a thing of the past. I believe that the custom of visiting on Sunday has vanished. If you do visit now, all you do is sit down, listen to the radio or play a rubber of bridge. Too bad but such is so-called progress.\n\nPlease give the names and addresses of other pioneers who could answer this questionnaire.\n\nR.H. Story\nGeorge Delday\nWm.

A. McLEOD,\nEagle Creek, Sask.\nJuly 30, 1908.\nWhen the Railroad Comes\n\nThere was at least one homesteader in the early years of the 25th century who found time after time to write poetry and other pioneer tales. W. A. McLeod, of Eagle Lake, was one of these writers.\n\nThe railroad comes, and we shall see how it will affect our lives. We will have to move for fuel or a market, and our troubles will go from us with the coming of the train.\n\nWhen the railroad comes, you can buy your food and have something left besides. Our trials will be over then. We'll fret no more for fuel or a market, and our troubles will go from us with the coming of the train.\n\nWhen the railroad comes, we will have wheat to fill the ear. We need never fear for trouble\u2014trouble's busy hunting him. Between the things we hope for and those we fear, we really are; we worry then for fear we won't have wheat to fill the ear.\n\nWhen the railroad comes\u2014it cannot come to all of us. Some will mourn in far-off valleys, some will curse on distant slopes, and the thought of the hammering filling many hearts with rapture.\n\nWhen the railroad comes, it will shake us most unpleasantly. The greedy grocer man will still want money for his provisions. When the railroad comes, some will find to their astonishment that trains may come and trains will never wait on the man who has no wheat to sell.\n\nAnd for honest western-bound express will bring no wealth. Our quarter section will shrink up\u2014first it looks so immense to us. And we'll plan to have a thousand-acre crop before we die.\n\nWhen the railroad comes, we have no more of batching it. We know by satiety experience the woes of single life.\n\nFor the girl who'll brave the West with us will make the finest wife.\n\nWhen the railroad comes, we will see a handsome exodus, and the immigrants and the droopers, the discouraged, and the lazy ones will pack their trunks and sell their bulls, and seek an easier store.\n\nWhen the railroad comes, we will boil with care our blankets, and each evening after supper we will read our daily mill.\n\nAnd however great our hurry, we would wait for a season. There's a Chippewa hunter \"out beyond\"\u2014the square of Bayley, and Sutton and Van Eaton where we ate and drank our fill.\n\nTo the Bad Hills bush with rod and gun their merry way they'll rush the black-bellied trout that swim in limpid Lake Opinata.\n\nAnd fish for hand-locked salmon on the shores of Eagle Lake.\n\nWhen the railroad comes; How this refrain wearies us all.\n\nWhich east newcomer with a fond anticipation hums:\n\nAnd our homes will be filled with a better land.\n\nAnd our homes will be filled with a better land.\n\nW.

Clad in our shapely skirts we'll go home and pick the best of them. For the girl who'll brave the West with us will make the finest wife.\n\nWhen the railroad comes, we will see a glad train exodus.

You may work but haven't got to. Your luck will turn a somerault and show its brightest side.\n\nMy friends, these dreams are foolish ones; since Eve first climbed the apple tree. And Adam are the core which Eve so kindly saved for him. Poor man has had to till the soil with sweaty brow and anxious toil. He need never hunt for trouble\u2014trouble's busy hunting him!\n\nWhen the railroad does come, we will notice quite a difference between the things we import for our use and those we send away.
