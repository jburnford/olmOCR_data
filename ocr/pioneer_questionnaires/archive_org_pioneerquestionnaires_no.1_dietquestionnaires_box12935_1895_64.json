FUEL\n\nWhat fuel did you use in the earliest days? Wood. Some coal in 1901.\n\nWhere did you get your fuel? The wood grew on our farm and the coal came from the Red Deer River 35 miles away.\n\nMention any changes in the use of fuels which have taken place since you first started housekeeping, giving dates where possible. Gasoline and coal oil stoves. Coal oil stoves were not much used in the prairies until about 1910. Gasoline stoves were used much later, perhaps twenty years. We have propane gas stoves, lights radiants, furnaces and refrigerators since 1928 or 1949. Many farmers have had electricity in their homes since 1928. The plants are mostly Delco engines.\n\n15. METHODS OF COOKING AND TYPES OF UTENSILS\n\nFor cooking, did you use an indoor fireplace or open hearth in the earliest days? (Give dates) Open fireplaces were used in 1892 and earlier. 1889.\n\nDid you use an outdoor fireplace or bake oven? (Give dates)\nNo., I always used a wood stove until 1901. Then coal and wood.\n\nBy whom was your first cook stove made? McClary's, London, Ont.\n\nWhat year was it purchased? September, 1893. Price? $20.00.\n\nWhat types of utensils did you use? (iron, copper, tin, homemade)\nIron and tin saucepans, iron cooking kettles, copper tea kettle and also an iron one, tin pie plates and basins.\n\nFor preparing food? (china, earthenware, wooden bowls, other)\nEnamel basins, earthenware bowls and pudding dishes, covered small crocks and jars.\n\nWhen did you first see enamel ware? ...........................................\n\nAluminum? ........................................................................................\n\nWe used mostly tin and iron cooking utensils in 1892 and until 1910 on the prairie. Crocks were used to put milk in to \"set\" and also for pudding dishes etc. Crocks were used for stews made in the oven. They had a crock cover. These were used by the settlers from 1889 to about 1910. Crock jars were also used for packing down butter for winter use, and cooked meat in the summer. Latter were filled in with melted fat. It kept well when stored in cold, dark cellars and took the place of fresh meat. This report covers a space of fifty years.\n\n16. WRAPPINGS AND CONTAINERS\n\nMention any changes which you recall in the wrappings and containers received with the food you purchased (give dates where possible). Mostly paper was used to wrap parcels of food. Much stronger paper than is used today. Tea was always in a tin caddy, except the green tea, called uncolored Japan, which was in stiff paper or thin cardboard packages. Jam was in small wooden pails and imported jam in large tins. Flour, cereals, salt, sugar, all in 100 pounds were in strong cotton and burlap bags and barrels held larger quantities.\n\n17. Give a typical day's menu (breakfast, dinner & supper) for the earliest year you can remember. Give the year and list the members of the family with their ages at the time. State approximately the month, e.g. winter or summer.\n\nBreakfast (continued next page)\n7. FUEL\n\nWhat fuel did you use in the earliest days? Wood, coke, coal.\n\nWhere did you get your fuel? The wood grew on our farm and the coal came from the Red Deer River 35 miles away.\n\nMention any changes in the use of fuel which have taken place since you lived around here. Coal was used until about 1900. Gasoline stoves were not available then. We had an electric stove until about 1905. Gasoline stoves were not available then. We had an electric stove until about 1905.\n\nWhat types of utensils did you use? (iron, coppery, tin, homemade)\n\nFor preparing food? (stove, earthenware, wood, glass, other)\n\nFor cooking? (earthenware, wood, glass, other)\n\nWhen did you first see enamel ware?\n\nAluminum?\n\nWe used mostly tin and iron cooking utensils in 1892 and until 1910 on the prairie. Crocks were used to put milk in to store and also for pudding dishes etc. Crocks were used for stove made in the oven. They had a crock cover. These were used by the settlers from 1899 to about 1910. Crock jars were also used for pickling down butter for winter use and cooked meat in the summer. Later they were filled in with melted fat. I met well when stored in cold dark cellars and took the place of fresh meat. This report covers a space of fifty years.\n\n14. METHODS OF COOKING AND USES OF UTENSILS\n\n15.

Black tea for beverage.\n\nThis was our menu all the year round with more cold meats in the summer and hotter dishes in the winter varied with pork and beans, head cheese, scrambled eggs and salads.\n\n18. What year did you serve your first Christmas dinner in western Canada? ....... Give the menu. List those present and give their approximate ages at that time.\n\nOur first Christmas as a family was in 1895. There was my father aged 42 years. My brother aged 21 years. Myself aged 17 years. My sister aged 14 years. We had two guests. An elderly gentleman aged 50 years and a younger one aged 22 years. Our dinner was roast beef, potatoes, carrots and turnips boiled and mashed together, gravy, Christmas pudding and white sauce with apples, nuts and homemade candy and a little Port wine. I was the housekeeper and cooked the dinner myself.\n\n19. Were you ever reduced to almost starvation level living on one or two locally produced foods? Give details.\n\nNo we were never in that condition but a good many of our neighbors were as we afterwards found out. One family in 1895 existed that winter on rabbits, turnips, potatoes, black bread made from 4X flour (that the Indians used), coffee made from roasted barley. They had no milk, butter, sugar or fruit of any kind. Some fish had been caught early in December and some of the neighbors gave them beef fat to fry them in. Of course everyone had salt. One family, I heard of fat to the south of us, lived on rabbits and turnips for weeks having neither potatoes or bread and barley coffee which was a favorite drink with all of us. The new settlers suffered great hardships in the early days and would have starved but for the results. In 1896 all the gardens were frozen. We had no vegetables of any kind. Grain was only fit for cattle feed and poor at that. The winter of 1896-1897 rabbits had a disease and were unfit for food. There was great hardship as well among the Indians on the reservation north of Lacombe.\n\n20. Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\nOne great difference was the lack of fresh citrus fruits. Corn, cucumbers, and tomatoes could not be grown in ordinary gardens about 1910 on account of the June frosts. Then, in the early days we could not buy glass sealers to preserve our fruit, meat, vegetables and pickles. A few had brought Mason jars from the United States in the \"nineties\" but these were inadequate as no fresh rubber rings could be purchased. We preserved our fruit as our grandmother did and put the vegetables in the cellar.\n17. (continued)\n\nThis was our menu all the year round with more cold meats in\nsummer and hotter dishes in the winter varied with pork\nsausages, head cheese, scrambled eggs and salads.\n\n18. What year did you have your first Christmas dinner in\nour new home?...1925\n\nOur first Christmas dinner was eaten by my parents and two\nsisters. My father was 47 years old, my mother 36 years old,\nand I was 17 years old. We had roast beef, potatoes, carrots and\ncabbage, and a little Port wine. I was the housekeeper and cooked\nthe dinner myself.\n\n19. Were you ever dependent upon your parents for food?\n\nIn the early days we had no vegetables of any kind. Some fish had been\ncaught and some of the neighbors had been able to trade for\nvegetables. In 1966 all the gardens were frozen. We had no fresh\nvegetables or any kind. Some fish had been caught and some\nof the neighbors had been able to trade for vegetables.\n\nThe winter of 1966-1967 rabbits had a disease and were unfit\nfor food. There was great hardship as well among the Indians\non the reservation north of Lacome.\n\n20. Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals\nin the earliest days as compared with today.\n\nOne great difference was the lack of fresh citrus fruits.\nCorn, cucumbers and tomatoes could not be grown in ordinary\ngardens about 1910 on account of the June frost. Then, in the\nearly days we could not buy glass sealers to preserve our fruit,\nmeat, vegetables and pickles. A few had brought season jars\nfrom the United States. In the \"nineties\" but these were\ninadequate as no fresh rubber rings could be purchased. We\npreserved our fruits as our grandmother did and put the vegetables\nin the cellar.\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homegrown and home prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible).\n\nAs we were not fond of canned foods except salmon, corn, tomatoes and applesauce we did not buy any others. I always canned at least a hundred quarts of fruit, vegetables, meat, chicken, etc. Made lots of jars of various kinds of pickles.\n\nA farmer's wife was a very busy person in the old days. Money was too scarce to spend on food in cans that we could and did cure and preserve ourselves.\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include items not mentioned above, quality, methods of merchandising, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. (Use back of page if extra space is needed).\n\nWhen I left the settlements around Lacombe in 1903 we went seventy miles south and east and built up a ranch. A fairly large log house, lots of other buildings and corrals. We had to take enough provisions to last for six months so bought everything in bulk. Of course our first year was the hardest for we could not tell exactly how much we needed. However, we started with 1,000 pounds of flour, 2-30 pound sacks of Rolled Oats, 10 pounds black tea, 5 pounds coffee, 10 pounds cocoa, 25 pounds rice, 25 pounds beans, cases of dried apples, peaches, apricots, pears and prunes, cases of canned corn, tomatoes and salmon, 2 barrels salt and 20 gallons of coal oil, 8 cans of lye for soap making, 20 bars of soap (laundry), 20 cases of toilet soap, 5 pounds currants, 10 pounds raisins, 3 pounds candied peel, 5 pounds cocoanut and other small items. Winter clothing, towels, etc. In February we ran short of coal oil, cattle salt and sugar (we had taken 200 pounds) and had to make a trip out to the nearest trading post 25 miles away. A bad blizzard came on. There were no trails in those days as the country was settled until two years later. It was travelling as the crow flies and hard on for anyone who was caught in a blizzard. A good many people owed their lives to the sagacity of their horses on trips like that one. My husband's favorite mare brought him safely home. How she picked out the way he never knew.\n\nIn the early years of the \"nineties\" there were very few cattle among the early settlers and very few pigs and chickens. Eggs were scarce and considered a luxury so was beef and pork products. The American settlers came in covered wagons and perhaps had a cow and a calf and sometimes a sow. The horses were not acclimatized and many of them died the first winter. The sufferings of some of the settlers was intense owing to the lack of proper food and severe cold. Wood was plentiful and so were the rabbits which were a Godsend to many. It was late in the fall when the settlers finished the long trek from Iowa, Kansas and Nebraska to Alberta and winter was upon them. Some went back to the United States to work there a while and came back. The settlers who came later on from the United States came by train shipping horses, cattle, pigs, chickens and machinery in box cars. They also brought money with them and bought up the homesteads from the earlier settlers. They and their descendants are some of our best citizens today. There are still some of the real old timers from the United States here and their families. Great praise is due to the women of the early pioneer days for the privations they suffered, the hardships they endured and the fine families they raised.\n\nThe way we canned fruit in 1896 (if we had plenty of jars) was to put hay in the bottom of a wash boiler we had. On this we put our jars filled with fruit, sugar and water. We used Mason jars and old rubbers and metal caps. We filled up the boiler with water to the caps and then boiled them for two hours.\nLet cool and stored in cellar. We canned wild gooseberries, saskatoons, raspberries, made preserves of strawberries, currants, and blueberries. Jelly and jam of cranberries. Preserved rhubarb out of our own garden. All the fruit we canned and otherwise preserved was wild fruit we picked around and in the vicinity of our home.\n\nI am sorry I can not remember the exact prices. Ten or fifteen years ago I could have filled it out better.\n\nMrs. John Jamerson.\n\nIt is to the amazing courage and endurance of the early United States settlers that Alberta owes so much. They were wonderful pioneers taking their experiences as a matter of course without complaining, as so many of the later settlers did, who came came ten to fifteen years later. This small tribute I pay to them. Many of the children and grandchildren of the early United States pioneers are some of our most prosperous and enterprising farmers of today.\n\nWe also burned grease lights made of any kind of grease but mostly beef tallow. This we melted and put in a saucer with a piece of cotton an inch wide. We lit the cotton which hung over the side and the grease would burn for hours. One of our neighbors from Ontario had a mould and could make a proper wick. Sometimes the roads were very heavily drifted and our coal oil done so we kept a few wax candles and burned grease lights.\n\nThe men, when out of tobacco, smoked kinniknack leaves dried, also the inner bark of the Red Willow dried. An old Indian told my father about this.\n\nMrs. John Irwin Jamerson\n\nBox 67, Repemoon, Alta.\nIt is to the amazing courage and endurance of the early United States settlers that Alberta owes so much. They were wanderers without complaining as so many of the later settlers would have done. We who came ten to fifteen years later, this world seemed to be filled with opportunity and adventure. For the early United States settlers, however, it was a struggle for survival.\n\nWe also burned grease lamps made of any kind of grease but mostly beef tallow. This we melted and put in a saucer with a piece of wood and the grease would burn for hours. We hung over the stove and the grease from Ontario had a mould and could make candles. The candles from Ontario were very heavily dripped and not done so we kept a few wax candles and turpentine candles.
