Willow Bunch was one of the first settlements in the southern part of Saskatchewan, and was thirty miles from my homestead. I started out right after dinner, about one o'clock, with a horse and buggy. The neighbor for whom I was making the trip insisted that I take his horse and buggy. I arrived at Willow Bunch around five o'clock in the afternoon.\n\nOn arrival, I fed my horse but she didn't seem to want to eat. When the doctor arrived in from the country, he gave me a bottle of medicine to take back, saying he didn't think he could make a trip back then. I started for home, and after having gone two or three miles, I noticed the horse didn't want to travel. About that time I met a man along the trail, with a yoke of oxen. After talking to him a few minutes, and telling him my difficulties, he advised me to go on a mile or two up the road where I would find a shack. I continued on my way, and arrived at an old sod shack about 10' x 12'. When I drove up to the door a man and woman came out, who happened to be early French settlers that couldn't speak English. To make them understand what my trouble was (that my horse was sick), I pointed to my mouth with my finger, and then to the horse. The man went in the shack and came out with a small box of ordinary table salt. While he was handing the salt to me, the horse started to stagger, so I dropped the traces and ran the buggy back - then the horse dropped dead. So here I was, still twenty-five miles from home, my horse dead, and nowhere to stay all night.\n\nI started out to walk, and had gone probably a couple of miles when I noticed a team and buggy coming behind, which turned out to be the doctor from Willow Bunch. He said he would come up and see the sick neighbor, so gave me a lift on home.\n\nNaturally, I had to go back for my buggy and harness, so leaving home next morning around eight o'clock, with a team and wagon, I arrived at my destination around noon. In driving up to the sod shack again, I saw a man and woman come out of the door; each with a large butcher knife about a foot long. They made signs at me which I took to mean they wanted my permission to skin the dead animal. I gave them the nod to go ahead. Then after feeding my team, and eating my lunch, I decided to watch them. After skinning the horse, and spreading the skin on the ground, they cut the tenderloin off one side of the back, rolled the carcass over and cut the tenderloin off the other side. They then placed both pieces on the skin, and dragged it over to the shack, and this I presumed they planned on using for food.\n\nI decided then it was about time to start for home, so I hitched up my team, tied the buggy on behind, and started down the road - twenty-five miles to go. I arrived home around supper time, and figured I had had quite an experience.\n\n33. When you came to Saskatchewan the first time was it with the idea of staying permanently? Or did you make up your mind after trying it out? When did you make this decision?\n\nCome with the idea of staying permanently.\nOne experience I might record was the time in the year 1910 that I drove to Willow Bunch for the doctor for one of my neighbors.

After talking to him a few minutes and telling him my difficulties, he advised me to go on a mile or two up the road where I would find a shock. I continued on my way, and arrived at an old sod shack about ten o'clock. When I drove up to the door a man and woman came out, who happened to be early French settlers that couldn't speak English, to make them understand what my trouble was (that my horse was sick), I pointed to my mouth with my finger and then to the horse.

I saw a man and woman close our of the door, each with a large butcher knife about a foot long. They made signs at me which I took to mean they wanted my permission after feeling my veins, and appealing to them, I decided to wash them off, cut the tendon on one side of the neck, pull out the head over, peel out the inner skin of the other side, they then patted both fleas on the skin, and charged me over to the shack, and said I presumed they planned on cooking for food.\n\nI hitched up my team, tied the buggy behind and started down the road - driving five miles to go. I arrived home around supper time and figured I had had quite an experience.\n\n33. When you came to Saskatchewan the first time was it with the idea of staying permanently?

Conley\nOctober 23/54\n\nTo Mr. Secretary,\n\nI am writing to you in response to your request for information regarding the current situation in Assiniboia. I have been informed by Mr. Smith, who is currently serving as the Assiniboia County Commissioner, that the county is experiencing a shortage of funds due to the recent drought conditions.\n\nMr. Smith has also mentioned that the county is in need of additional support from the provincial government to address these challenges. I urge you to consider providing assistance to ensure the well-being of the citizens of Assiniboia.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEmery Isaac Selby\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8\nOxford\n\nNo. 613 S\n\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jessylee/PioneerQuestionnairesPDFs//PioneerQuestionnaires_No.2-GeneralExperiencesQuestionnaires_Box12945_1900_607.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 26, "total-input-tokens": 43160, "total-output-tokens": 7061, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 4], [0, 1975, 5], [1975, 3919, 6], [3919, 5371, 7], [5371, 6440, 8], [6440, 8040, 9], [8040, 9395, 10], [9395, 10528, 11], [10528, 11612, 12], [11612, 14778, 13], [14778, 17556, 14], [17556, 19011, 15], [19011, 19949, 16], [19949, 21199, 17], [21199, 22079, 18], [22079, 23306, 19], [23306, 24346, 20], [24346, 24791, 21], [24791, 25225, 22], [25225, 25681, 23], [25681, 26344, 24], [26344, 26480, 25], [26480, 26634, 26]], "primary_language": ["None", "None", "None", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]}}]
