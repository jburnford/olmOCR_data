Some of the questions here will not apply to everyone; others may prove impossible for you to answer. You should therefore fill out only those questions which you can answer accurately or completely. The questionnaire is intended for those who have lived in Western Canada before 1924, and may be answered by anyone who has lived there for more than one year. If more than one person lives in the same house, they should write their answers separately.\n\nOther Questions:\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire\n\nWestern Canada and the Prairies is still a new country, and many things are still being discovered. We would like to hear from you about your experiences in Western Canada. Please complete the questionnaire and return it to us.\n\nPreservation:\n\nAll questionnaires will be preserved as part of the permanent record of our office at the University of Saskatchewan.
