Were you often invited to other homes, or was most visiting done without an invitation?\n\nWhat time of the day did you go, - in the morning and spend the day, or in the afternoon, etc.?

Did you stay when not invited beforehand? Nearly always.\n\nHow was the invitation to a meal worded when people had come unexpectedly?
