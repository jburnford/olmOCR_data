We had nothing to fight a fire with & no guards placed around, as the nearest neighbor who was to do the fire-grounds had not come. The only thing was to get our things out of the shack on to the garden path. My oldest sister called me to take my brother's watch repairing tools & put them in my knapsack & told me to put them on the garden path, while she tried to get his clothes, but she failed to get it out & I just dumped the tools just over the fence & the handles got burnt off of most of them & I got a good scolding from my eldest sister. In the meantime they had got a blanket out & tied a calf but I also got Brother & her chair out here in the middle of the garden. They got a few other things out, but nearly everything was burnt bedding & clothing except what we were wearing. The three cows & horse ran away & we wondered if we would see again, but they returned after the fire had gone. After the fire our neighbors came & took us to his place, where one of my brother's had been working & he had been caught in a whirl of fire, helping to stop it from jumping their fire-grounds, & got his hands full burns, so he could not see for 10 days.\n\nMy oldest sister & I were taken to another farm 4 miles away & she had to go every day to attend to my brother. My other sisters & mother were at another farm for 2 weeks, until the neighbors for miles around had a bee & built a dog-house with sod roofs, mother said she could see the stars shining through the roof, but glad to have that, we dug the stove out of the ruins & some of the legs were broken off so we had to set it on stones. The neighbors gave us a few things to get on with & we had to buy a number of neighbors gave us a few more tons. Have ended the recording of the Prairie Fire of May 1891, by Sarah Park Net Sarah common & written by her husband Stephen Park.\nI have been working on this project for the past few months.\n\nIn the beginning, I was unsure of how to proceed. However, after much research and planning, I have finally completed the task.\n\nThe project has been challenging, but I am proud of what I have accomplished.\n\nI would like to thank everyone who helped me along the way.\n\nThank you.\nThe number being so high made my feeling colder.\n\n1847 January 2nd\n\nThe following paragraph of an old manuscript:\n\nI was fourteen years of age in 1681 by which time I had seen many things that would have been shocking to me at a later date. The world was very different then, and I often thought about how much things have changed since then.\nRef. to the particulars of our first experience.\n\nThe fire was burning on Friday morning about 10 o'clock. We heard a noise outside, which we thought was a fire alarm. We went out to see what was happening, but there was no fire. We then heard a loud noise coming from inside the house. We rushed in and found the house on fire. We tried to put it out, but it was too late. The fire spread quickly, and soon the whole house was engulfed in flames. We managed to escape, but many others did not. The fire was caused by a spark from a nearby power line. It was a tragic event, and we will never forget it.\n\nThe fire was reported to the authorities immediately. Firefighters arrived on the scene and worked tirelessly to put out the fire. Despite their efforts, the fire continued to grow, and soon the entire neighborhood was engulfed in flames. Many homes were destroyed, and many families lost everything they owned. The fire was a devastating event, and it will be remembered for years to come.\n\nIn conclusion, the fire was a tragic event that will be remembered for years to come. It serves as a reminder of the importance of safety precautions and the need for quick action in the face of disaster. We will always remember those who lost their lives and homes in this fire, and we will continue to work towards preventing similar tragedies in the future.\n19.
