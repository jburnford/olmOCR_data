Fraser\nDear Sir,\n\nLakota Sioux were very much like the pioneers in Manitoba years ago. Vegetables were a daily part of their diet, more attention was paid to their cultivation than now.\n\nBreakfast: Pancake (pancake) Bacon & Eggs\n\nTea or Coffee\n\nMeat: Beef, Pork (chicken)\n\nPotatoes, Carrots, Cabbage\n\nCarrot Pie, Baskatoon & Rasberry\n\nDinner\n\nCold meat, vegetables, fruit all served\n\nSupper\n\nShort amused conversation but all served\n\nGood cooked over a wood fire for the plenty of united fruit and flour for the hearty appetite.\n\nW.O.
