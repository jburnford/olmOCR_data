During the past two years the Saskatchewan Archives Board has carried out a policy of distributing questionnaires to old-timers of the province, in order that experiences and events of pioneer life may be recorded and preserved, and we hope that you will assist in this enterprise.\n\nThese three questionnaires, No. 3 on pioneer schools, No. 4 on pioneer churches, and No. 5 dealing with recreation and social life, have been sent out as a group, since these are phases of pioneer life in which there was a distinct overlapping of activity. Each questionnaire is complete within itself, but by having the three of them to answer at the same time, it was thought that the person answering them would find it easier to avoid repetition from one questionnaire to another.\n\nWe realize that the answering of these will take some time, but you may be sure that your effort will be appreciated, and that all questionnaires which are completed and returned to the Archives Office are valued as part of the permanent record of our province, and provide an important source of information on early provincial settlement. If you wish, you may have someone else write your answers for you. If it is hard for you to write in English, it is quite all right to answer the questions in your own language.\n\nPlease give below the names and addresses of other pioneer who could answer these questionnaires. (You may send this form in with your completed questionnaires or may send this in now if you wish, and the questionnaires later).\n\nTwo other questionnaires which have been distributed within the past two years are still available; No. 1, \"Pioneer Diet: What Did Western Canadian Pioneers Eat\", and No. 2, \"Pioneer Experiences: A General Questionnaire\".
