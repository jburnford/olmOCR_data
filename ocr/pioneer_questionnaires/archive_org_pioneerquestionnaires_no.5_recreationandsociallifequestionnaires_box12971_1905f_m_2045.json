Afternoon\n\nWhat about meals? Did you stay when not invited beforehand? Yes, people would have been hurt if you did not.\n\nHow was the invitation to a meal worded when people had come unexpectedly?

Lunch of sandwiches, coffee, tea, candy, homemade cake, etc.\n\n5. Did the whole family go, or did someone stay home to \"look after the place\"?
