Bridle Emily Flora (Mrs. Charles)\nIt is difficult to prepare a general questionnaire on pioneer life because no individual who is asked to answer it has exactly the same experiences as another. Impossible for you to answer, so don't worry about leaving blank spaces where you may have to guess or pass. If there is not sufficient space to answer the questions, the extra answers of paper if there is not sufficient space to answer the questions, they should be written on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1914, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experiences of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer Diet: What Did They Eat?\" is still being circulated. If you have not already answered this, and would be willing to do so, please put a check mark here (X) and we will be sent to you.\n\nA later date, some of these are listed below. Please mark the ones you would be willing to answer:\n\n- All questionnaires\n- Pioneer health conditions\n- Pioneer schools, 1875, sports and recreation\n- Pioneer housing\n- Pioneer religion and churchwork\n- Pioneer farming experiences\n\nPreservation of Questionnaires\n\nAll questionnaires will be preserved in the Saskatchewan Archives Board Office at the University of Saskatchewan as part of the permanent record of our province.
