Give details.\n\nThe first year, mother & father were in the west; we only had 12 acres of grain and the gophers were so plentiful, in spite of our snaring and trapping, drowning them out etc. They ate it nearly all. Saved a bit for seed and forage meat. Had a year supply of flour, syrup and dried apples with us from Oct. But in coming out our train was wrecked between St. Paul & Winnipeg, a signal, can of coal oil got spilled and our supplies got more or less spoiled so it was only dire necessity forced us to use them. Not much money to get more. We grew a winter supply of potatoes but they got frozen. Mother put them inside of all into a large crock pot with boiling water and cooked them. They were sweet but we enjoyed them with roast rabbit and brown gravy. Had only one cow, sow with her litter, ox in which got killed in the wreck bought a mule before selling the next year; done some more breaking, plowed with a pony & cow. Drive to Qu'Appelle valley 1/4 mile to pick saskatoons, cooked & dried them in ovens in the sun.\n12. How did you serve your first Christmas dinner in Indiana? Give details.\n\n13.

What was the most challenging aspect of growing up in Indiana?\nmy mother when she was young bought all her necessary groceries by exchanging or selling butter, eggs, chickens, ducks early vegetables, and corned beef. Not all our wants were supplied, many times we went without butter, eggs or chicken to have enough to buy some print, shirting or stockings usually wool as we kept stockings socks and mitts for 10 cents. After I was married in 1908, I did the same though we never went quite so short. I packed butter and sold it privately for 10\u00a2 a lb. Eggs for 5\u00a2 each, a dozen. Chicken for $1 and 10\u00a2 lb., for a good many years, in 1903-1906 farmers all had to run a bill at the store through the summer. It was risky business for the store keeper who carried it for several years losing in the end. Those people who did that were extravagant and careless, machinery had to be bought on time very often and if the crop was badly frozen or ruined it was just as bad on both sides. Our first year was bad we bought a team of horses harness and binder depending on the crop to pay for them. Our grain was all scattered over the road into ditches etc., with a cyclone and...\nHail, it came the day we bought the horses and harness; it was a very disheartening sight. We met on the morning of the day our grain was nearly all cut but the stubble was beaten into the ground. You knew how badly the grain was needed in the market. My husband went right back the next day to the man from whom we got the horses and asked him to take them back, as paying for them was out of the question. So he took them back. The harness maker let us keep the harness & the machine agent, the binder until we could pay. We paid part that fall and earned some money by going out harvesting with the neighbors to pay fellows who took the risk. In 1928 we were able to pay off the mortgage on the house. It was good to get back all the money we had lost.\n\nWe made most of our clothing except pants overalls underclothing for men and tops coats smocks and men's suits. I sewed everything for my 6 children until they were 14 or 15. I made shirts for myself up to 1930. Did not sleep sheep but some of our neighbors did. I spun the wool into yarn, twisted it to make comforter. I was glad when in about 1932 I could buy wool balls all ready to use for $2.50. The first print I bought to line a quilt about 1924 was 8\u00a2 a yd.; good heavy 36\" stuff.\n\nWe worked hard for everything we had. Those days no dole, if crops were poor in 1923 my husband worked for his bread and 25\u00a2 per day. Every child knew how to work. We were not running all over. Our social activities were centered around home and church. One of our neighbors kept a post office, when a mail man from Wapella brought the mail to Christians. In 1903 the C.P.R. built the railroad branch line and Rockville started. Not too long after we got our mail from there, Mrs Robert Christian named that district Prosperity, which is 6 mi west of Rockville. I was the first teacher in this district 1897-1899. Taught at Setlock N.E. corner. Was married to John Christian Aug 1900 and came back to live in Prosperity Dist where we made our home until 1946 when my husband died and I moved to town. During our life here we helped build a church and hall, served on church board. I was a member of the Prosperity H.M.C. organized in May 1907 also helped organize the I.S.W.A. Q.W.M. S. served as Pres. 4 Sec for several terms.\n\nChildren were members of larger families and were more obedient, worked so much than most children today. Very few used tobacco or liquor. A law forbid merchants selling the stuff to juniors. Now it is a common sight to see children on the way to school smoking a cigarette. In my opinion it is a most subtle enemy of mankind. Know one little boy of six who smokes regularly. He is making little progress in school and is very much undersize. Another thing I notice is that the women take the lead in training children for leadership. The teenage girls can take a meeting, give papers on different topics and boys don't know...\nHail. It came the day we bought the horses and harness. It was a very disheartening sight, we met on the morning of our wedding day. Our grain was nearly all cut but the stubble was beaten into the ground, you knew how badly the grain was shelled in the rain. My husband went right back the next day to the man from whom we got the horses and asked him to take them back, as paying for them was out of the question. He said he could pay, so he took them back. The harness maker let us keep the harness & the machine agent, the lender, and earned some money by going out to work on other farms. We were able to pay off the mortgage on our land.

My mother & father had very little education only read and write a little. But we went to school & S.S. When we came west in 1883 one of our bachelor neighbors taught us to read. There was 2 & us and 6 other children went to his house. He always went away in winter so my oldest sister taught us at home. Another family from England came, he taught and we had S.S. in our house.
