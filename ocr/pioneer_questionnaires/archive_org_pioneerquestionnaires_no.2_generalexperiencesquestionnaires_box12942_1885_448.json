I did not start school until I was 8. I helped mother as a housemaid & helped to mind cattle for father, so they were not enclosed in fences always, but although busy, had fun & peace. We lived near the school which served for church & Sunday school & young people gatherings for any reason. Here is a picture of the first school built in 1884 before I was born. The father came there in 1882. They had 6 children older than I was & 4 ready for school. Our first teacher I know nothing of, as he or she only taught 3 months. I call Mrs. Keith Webster our first teacher. She was Miss Moran & her home was there also. I remember her family. I met one of her grandsons here in Wadena in the bank. The pioneers of Morrison & Rocanville districts meet & knew each other by the name. We the girls are not easily tracked, but quite a number of us know where they are. One of the Rice's daughters was here too from Morrison. I had Mr. Rice in before he died. She is Mrs. Hal Johnson. We also had a daughter of Mr. Douglas, our pioneer minister. He said we were all christened, as we had students quite a while.\n\nOur parents were particular, so to have us well cared for & had fun arranged for us too parties & picnics, as well as the Educational affairs. We later about 1894 had an additional factor, by the father of one family. He was a total teacher & taught a class, so we had a very good child. Our special picnic was the Rocanville picnic held three days yearly & by the banks of the Dr. Affell & there we had our quota of Indians as now, but we now minded their own affairs, unless molested, which some of our young half grown boys did. The Indians did get across & gone there, they dreaded scare, as they had horses, dogs, & plenty of good whips.\n\nThis picnic was annual about the 26th June & at\nI have a great many memories of my childhood, but nothing there ever helped in another thing. We grew up in a wonderful time, we were always busy, I did not work hard until I was 16. I helped mother as a housemaid & helped to mind cattle for father. As they were still enclosed in fences, always, but although busy, had fun & games, we lived near the school which assured for advanced & Sunday school training.\n\nIn 1884 before I was from 6, father came back in 1882. They had 6 children then. I was 8 & ready for school. Our first teacher I knew nothing about her or she only taught 3 months. I call Mrs. Wilbur our first teacher.\n\nSecond teacher, she was Mrs. Supplee & how Rome wooed them. I remember his family. He kept one of his horses here in addition to the fourth. The horses of Mr. Johnson & Rosencrans died. I met & knew each other by the name, we the girls are still so easily traveled. But, built a number of houses there. Miss Mrs. Rice, our teacher, she was Mrs. Wilbur from Wisconsin. She also had a daughter of Mrs. Johnson, our friend, named Mrs. Johnson. We were all educated, as we had attended public schools arranged for us too. Part-time teachers, as well as the Educational Affairs. We left about 1894. Had an additional teacher, Mrs. Johnson.\n\nOur family. He was a total teacher & taught a class, as we had a very good class. Our school house was the Rosencrans house. Built three days yearly, by the hands of the Rev. Ashby & Mrs. Ashby.\n\nWe had our Pueblo Indians over 1890, but as soon as needed, they moved. They Indians did get ours & gave them their deceased wives, as they had homes, dogs & plenty of good utensils.\n\nThis house was owned about six & 8 farms, and at...\n& am time, a heartbreak for the children, that had to write,\nbut at our grade & exam time, we were lucky enough to have a\nSunday school teacher, with a boy in the class, & they were kind &\nsmart both. So Mr. Sutton was a artist, also the oldest son, & the\nMother, a wonderful cook, so we had a big dinner prepared at their\nhome & a artistic sketch with our names on presented to each of us.\n\nI remember more by hearing than seeing, the wealthy men from\nManor & the Remittance men. I knew one as 9 ft. older, & have\na memory picture of Capt. Price. He lived by Mossomin, & mixed\nwith the Manor folk, so we always went to Mossomin on their\nspecial days. The Mrs. Price had stayed English & had nice horses\n& dogs, Ride a horse & carried his little whip.\n\nSo far worries I suppose our parents had more than I knew\nabout; parents generally do, so I learned, pioneering, 3 times, as I see\nit. I married in 1908 & went to learning. The sons of the first pioneers\nmoved on there & settled there, coming back for us. We were homesteaders\nthere but we managed a farm near by for an American for a number of yrs\ngot too heavy & we went to Regina, as Will was a machine man, so went\nthere to get better money further, but went back to the farm later & bought\nother land, was fine until the 30's, could see no future to that, so\ncame north by car, content to travel, until we saw good straw piles. Watson\nhad them, so here we found the home, took us 4 days, rented for a\nnumber of yrs then bought it, our son came after the second war, so he was\nin the Air force, he took the farm & we moved to town, while he was looking\nfor the place, first night we slept in the car, second night the hotel, 3rd\na group from Mossomin, was in the Auto Camp, if we all decided\nwe would sleep in it unless we were asked to get out, but no others\ncame, so we were comfortable all night. We have been comfortable ever since.\nAt am time, a heartthrob for the children, that kind to write.\n\nBut at our grade 8 exam time, we were lucky enough to have a\nSunday School teacher, with a boy in the class. He wrote him a\nletter. We wrote it down. We wrote it down. We wrote it down.\n\nMother, a wonderful cook, so we had a big dinner prepared at 6 o'clock.\nSome is a anticipated sketch will our names on presented to each of us.\n\nI remember my first hearing than during the warranty room from\nmy name on the Remittance man. I knew one or two other names\nwith the names of the people who went to Morrison on Stairs.\n\nSpecial days. The 27th Price head. Flagged, English & hard nice brown\n& drop. Ride a horse & Christened into little white\nOn the morning of our parents had more than I knew\nabout. Parents generally do go I learned. Hurrying. Stmuo, so I am\nIf-9 married in 1908. We went to learning. The owner of the farm-farmers\nmoved on three. A called. There - coming back for us. We were there outside\nthere. But we managed a farm near by for an American. You a member of you\nnot too heavy & we went to Peggy on all was a marvelous move. We went\nthis to get better money husband. But went back to the farm latter although\nother land was fine until the 30's, could not go further to travel to\ncome write by car. content t travel, until we said good-bye like. Watson\nhad them. So here we found the home. took us 4 days, rented for a\nnumber 6 for then bought it. Our poor name off the second away so he wore\nin the Air force. He took the house to live around to them while the looking\nfor the place, final night we left on the very, burned right the Hotel. God\na great farm merchant, was in the Auto Camp. If we are decided\nwe would stay in it unless, we were asked to get out. And no others\ncame. O we were comfort-able all night. We have been comfortable ever since\nGoing back to the early pioneer days, one worry was fire. We generally, at seasons, went to bed seeing fires about four miles. Can remember some close ones. Another one was gophers. As the farms had small fields at first, & the gopher got more than the farmers, but they crushed their hindrances, & it was in a wonderful district\u2014father built a new stone house (standing the Platte, a bit battered as its old) in 1895. A few yrs. later he sold out & retired to Mosomin. For a yr or so then went out to Vancouver. Father & mother both gone now. But mother lived to see 92 & some months. Another worry for we children, if we happened to be left alone was peddlers. More frightened of them than Indians. In winter we had bad blizzards, I remember them quite well. If our younger Bros. were out-in-one, they stayed together & have even travelled on hands & knees to right them selves.\n\nMother had to learn how to make bread from her Ontario friends but, they admitted she could make the best tea.\n\nAnd our trading or buying was always done in the P.D. McNaughton store in Mosomin. I have a Bx. between always & Mr. Abery. On his home was, the sons work it was & he moved to Mr. Riley. Mr. Fisher has a cousin in Mosomin & son & Mrs Joseph Fisher our nearest neighbor & came in 1882 also.\n\nMrs Eliza (Stewart) Fisher.\nGoing back to the early pioneer days, we were very few in number, adventurous, willing to find away from the city for miles, can remember none other than Captain Ben was captain of the farm. Land owned by Mr. and Mrs. John Johnson. They purchased their land in 1898. A new house was built in a wonderful district. Father built a new house.\n\nLeaving the Platte, we returned to Nebraska. We lived there until 1920 when we moved to South Dakota. We had a hard time adjusting to the new climate. Our young boys were out in the world. If our children were able to adjust, they would have been successful, but, they admitted she could make the best tea.\n\nP.D. We thought about buying an old house in the city, but, we always came home. We moved to South Dakota in 1970. I believe there was a reason in moving there. A son of Mr. Joseph Fisher also moved there in 1882.\n19. How often did you write to relatives or friends in your old home?\n\n20.
