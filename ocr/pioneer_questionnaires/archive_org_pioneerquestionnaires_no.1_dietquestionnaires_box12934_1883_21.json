Use of gas, electricity, and oil reduces the heat of cook stoves in summer, reduces the heat of kitchens.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of home grown and home preserved foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible.)\n\nWe still prefer our own home grown vegetables, when we can grow them; also buy eggs and make our own butter. We've bought quite a bit of bread in local stores but still bake new times as often as before.\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and acquiring foods in your area during pioneer days in eastern Canada.\n\nIn the early days vegetables were usually stored in cellars or sometimes root houses if yield of garden was the normal amount of meat because harvests till canning of fresh beans and later quick freeze beans in early days of the year and shortages in early days of the year.\n\nAs to shortages in early days of the year was poor, so many were for winter, and practically no vegetables although often not enough potatoes, although after 1887 I think we always had some. In that case canned tomatoes were used more than anything else to help out.\n20. Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the past.\n\nPoveshull day cooking utensils are much lighter and more easily handled, and the usual new ones quicker and more efficient in burning charcoal elements. Use of gas furnaces and oil or kerosene in burners reduces the heat of the kitchen.\n\n21. What did you begin to rely on pure and proper foods instead of canned and preserved foods? (Give as many details and things as possible.)\n\nWe will have our own home grown vegetables when we can grow them; also buy cream and make our own butter. We've bought quite a bit of bread in local stores but take every chance to make our own bread as often as possible.\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and purchasing foods in other places, quality, methods of preserving, prices, etc., if more space is needed.\n\nIn early days vegetables were usually stored in cellar or sometimes root house. If yield of garden was the normal amount of meal became hard to find. Summer meal storage was the usual method of canning or freeze plants. As to shortages in early days of the year and later quick freeze plants, it meant practically no vegetables at all through after harvest not enough potatoes, although after 1887 I think we always had some in that case canned tomatoes were used more than anything else to help out.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jessylee/PioneerQuestionnairesPDFs//PioneerQuestionnaires_No.1-DietQuestionnaires_Box12934_1883_21.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 28, "total-input-tokens": 46480, "total-output-tokens": 5911, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 4], [0, 569, 5], [569, 1050, 6], [1050, 1403, 7], [1403, 1767, 8], [1767, 2655, 9], [2655, 3482, 10], [3482, 4747, 11], [4747, 5596, 12], [5596, 6162, 13], [6162, 7372, 14], [7372, 8371, 15], [8371, 9545, 16], [9545, 10556, 17], [10556, 11496, 18], [11496, 13259, 19], [13259, 15180, 20], [15180, 16503, 21], [16503, 16503, 22], [16503, 17352, 23], [17352, 17906, 24], [17906, 19343, 25], [19343, 20717, 26], [20717, 20717, 27], [20717, 20717, 28]], "primary_language": ["None", "None", "None", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "None", "None"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, true, true, true, true, true, true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]}}]
