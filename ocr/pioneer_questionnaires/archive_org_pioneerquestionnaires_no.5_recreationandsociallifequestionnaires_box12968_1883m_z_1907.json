In the first few years, how many homes were near enough to you for visiting back and forth? It was a new colony, so the number gradually increased. How many of these were bachelor's homes? Many of them.\n\n2. How often did you usually visit neighbors? The visits were spontaneous, no schedule was kept.\n\n3. Did you usually visit on a Sunday, or other days? Both.\n\n4. Were you often invited to other homes, or was most visiting done without an invitation? Often invited and often went without an invitation.\n\nWhat time of the day did you go, - in the morning and spend the day, or in the afternoon, etc.?

In the earliest years that you were here, were there many parties, whist drives or dances in homes? Describe.\n\nThe young people used to get together for a dance or a sing song, but in the early eighties parties were unknown.

Give dates.\n\nNo, these gatherings gradually ceased and invited parties became more general.\n\nDid you follow any kind of informal schedule, such as going by turn from one home to another at definite times, - every two weeks, once a week, once a month, etc.?

Give dates.\n\nOur pioneer school house was the community hall, and was used for socials and concerts, but not for dances. There were annual picnics, not held indoors but out in the trees. Box socials were unknown in our part of the country, and Christmas were memories of days in England.\n\nHow much of your social life was centered around the school, and within the school district? Describe.\n\nNo, I do not think the social life centered around the school, more around the church, or understand that it was the Primitive Methodist Colony, so dances and cards were frowned on, and people were very narrow in their views.

When parties, dances, etc. were held in homes, school houses or halls (as referred to in question 8, 9, and 10) did the entire family attend?\n\nHow were babies and small children provided for?\n\nAny meetings that demanded the attendance of both parents, would necessarily include the children, such meetings were held in the daytime.\n\nHow were horses sheltered and fed in the winter time at these parties?\n\nThere was stable room available for horses when meetings took place in the community hall, but the stable was privately owned.\n\n11.

There was no disagreement.\n\nWas card playing accepted by all residents in the community, or were there some who frowned upon it, either as an entertainment in the home, or for community gatherings?

It caused lots of unhappiness and hard feeling amongst the young people.\nHow much of your social life was centered around the school, and within the school district?

What was the name of the first organization of any kind that you can remember becoming established in your community?\n\n\"Patrons of Industry\"\n\nGive the date and reason for it being organized.\n\nAs far as I remember it was about 1890, and it was organized to try to find better marketing conditions for our produce.\n\n16.

Did parents ever use their children's school text books as additional reading material? Yes our parents used the school readers.\n50. Has there ever been a community library in your district or town?\n\nThe S. School Library was more or less of a community Library.\n\nWhen was it started? 1896\n\nWho started it? Mr. Chas. Hewson as Secretary of the Sunday School.\n\nIs it still in existence? I think not. I went back to live in 1946 and tried to find traces of it but no one seemed to know what happened to it.\n\nIf not, when was it discontinued, and why?\n\nI must have been moved to one of the small towns that sprang up like mushrooms when the railway went through.\n\nGive any other details which you can about the library - how many books it contained, how many people used it, where it was kept, who acted as librarian, and what arrangements were made for borrowing books.\n\nI have already said that the Library was started by the diligence of Mr. Chas. Hewson. He was a bachelor, worked for my father, and lived with us drove the stage in the summer time. He was a wonderful man, and his name should go down in history. He bought many books out of his own pocket and some of the more successful settlers made contributions toward the library. I clearly remember Mr. H. giving Mr. Hewson a $20.00 bill saying \"For the library, Charlie\". Others did likewise.\n\nEveryone used it, but it was primarily a Sunday School library. It was kept in a cabinet cupboard, made by this same Chas Hewson, and it was kept in the one and only community Hall. Any one could have a book as long as they were known and did not fail to return it. It was a small community and everyone knew Everyone.\n\n51. What newspapers or magazines did you subscribe to when you first came to the west?\n\nThe Farmer's Advocate was the first magazine I can remember, except those that came from England, such as \"The Graphic\" and \"The Sketch\". The S.S. Papers were those authorized by S.S. headquarters in Toronto. They were \"Onward\", \"Pleasant Hours\", \"Sunbeams\", \"The Winnipeg Free Press\" was our newspaper; it was a weekly at first. The Regina seemed to start as a weekly early in the picture but cannot remember the year it started, nor find any record of it.\n\n52. Describe later changes in your subscriptions, telling why you stopped certain subscriptions and added others.\n\nI do not think these subscriptions ever were discontinued, they became daily papers, and were added to by others such as \"The Family Herald and Weekly Star was in almost every household. It contained much information about all farm problems as well as household activities. It contained poetry, stories fashions and a medical column. Mother subscribed to a fashion magazine, the \"Bazaar\" which was loaned all around the colony.\n\n53. Did you ever obtain the free monthly Lady Aberdeen packages of reading material? Yes.\n\nGive dates and tell how and where you got them.\n\nThey were started about 1895, and were mailed from Ottawa.\n\n54. What books or papers that you brought to the west with you do you still have?\n\nI think the Family Bible is the only Book in the family now that was brought from England. Seventy years is a long time.\n\n55. Did you find a lack of reading material or sources of information in your early days in the west a hardship? Explain.\n\nAs far as I can remember we always had reading material. Mother's people were Cambridge people and sent us a lot of reading material, books, magazines, and newspapers. English boys were always arriving from England and they always brought some books with them and had others sent Capt. Rickard had Bulwer Lytton's books and Rider Haggard, which were loaned around.\nMUSICAL ENTERTAINMENT.\n\n56.

Give dates, prices if possible, and tell where you bought them.\n   About 1898 Mr. Chas. Newton, who lived with us bought a small melodeon from a group of wandering evangelists who were hard up, for $30.00. We used to carry it to the \"Hall\" for religious services. Dad bought a parlor organ from an agent in Walsaley about 1894. I think the price was $600.00 but it was taken in exchange for groceries.\n\n59. How large a part did singing and other forms of music play in your home entertainment in early years in the West? Describe.\n   As I have already described, the Post Office was connected with our home, just a door between. There was a Mr. T. A. Briggs from Toronto, a music teacher, who came out for his health, and took up a Homestead. He led the young people in many a sing song while waiting for the mail.\n\nIn the community? (were there musical concerts, was there group singing at parties, etc.) Describe.\n   In the community there was much group singing. Another home where there was an organ early in the history was the Jones home, where a family of boys were all musical, besides the organ they had several violins. There were some wonderful evenings spent in that home.\n\n60.
