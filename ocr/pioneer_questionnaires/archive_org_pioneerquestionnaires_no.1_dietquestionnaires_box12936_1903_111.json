In around 1903 my husband was a teamster, he made large galvanized iron tanks, some would hold 50 barrels, there was abundance grain in those early days so many of the new settlers bought the large tanks. This was my share of household water supply until 1912 when the town installed waterworks.\nApples - fresh\ndried\n\nLettuce\nTomatoes - fresh\n\nOther general\n\nBananas\nLemons\nOranges\nCorn Flakes\n\nOther prepared\nBreakfast foods\nCereals - fine\n\nPearl tapioca\nMinute tapioca\nSago\nDates\nSalmon\n\nIcing sugar\n\n12.

We got a sawing machine run by horse power to cut it into stove wood lengths. I remember what a time my young husband had to buck saw enough wood on Saturday to do other Sunday work upstairs over the tin shop, so it had to be carried upstairs as well.

How many times have you been forced to eat bread and butter?\nWhat we called \"the pasture\" in Oct., but \"Kiddal\" was the new name brought to western Canada by boys returned from the South African War.\n\nA memorable experience of the first winter I spent in the new house, 1913-14, was having all our food frozen to death. My husband had built a two-roomed house, with living quarters upstairs. This building could not be finished that fall. It had a tarpaper roof. Star paper, with one ply boards covered by sheet metal, but the downstairs downstairs were not finished nor the roof. We could look up and see stars through cracks in the roof and look down and see snow through other cracks. While there was plenty of wood most of the time it had to be buckwheated. We had an air tight heater my husband had made in the township, a good clay stove, but even with these it was not possible to keep cooked. But even with these, it was not possible to keep cooked.\n\nI had considerable difficulty trying to make bread under the above conditions, also as I was the fourth daughter of the Eastman family and married at the early age of 18, I did not have much experience in bread making. If there was no bakery near then.\n\nBruce Albert.\n\nMy husband applied for injuries received in a fall in July 1939.\n\nHis picture and an early biography is in Volume 2.\n\nPage 778: History of the Province of Saskatchewan.\n\nOnly three of our children are mentioned there as William, Edith and Inez. We later had another son George Gordon who is now working for his Masters degree in Education at the University of Saskatchewan.\n\nWilliam is a member of the Associated Commercial Travellers working for a Saskatoon firm while living in Prince Albert. Edith is Mrs. Stewart Cushing, Caribou Lake, Alberta. Inez is Mrs. W.E. Peterson, Melgort. I have continued to make my home in Melgort, with the exception of two years in Moose Jaw, with my son George when he was an instructor in the Dominion Provincial Youth Training School there. He later served in the R.C.A.F. until the finish of World War II.\n\nIf Volume 2 History of Sask. should ever be rewritten would like to have George Gordon's name included in the biography on Page 778.\n\nTo the Editor, Jameson, Melgort, Sask.\n\nJanuary 1957\nWhat we called \"the great hall\" was the rear room. It was a large room with a high ceiling and large windows overlooking the town. The walls were painted a light color and there was a fireplace in the center of the room.\n\nThe room was used for various purposes throughout the year. In the fall, it was used for classes and meetings. During the winter, it was used for social gatherings and parties. In the spring and summer, it was used for outdoor activities such as picnics and barbecues.\n\nThe room was also used for special events such as the annual town fair. The fair was held in the fall and featured games, rides, and food booths.\n\nIn conclusion, the great hall was an important part of the town's life and was used for many different purposes throughout the year.\nWhat we called \"the pasture\" in Ont., but \"Kaal\" was the new name brought to Western Canada by boys returned from the South African war.\n\nA memorable experience of the first winter spent in the new farm, 1903-04, was having all our food frozen. Each night, my husband had built a truck shop, 20 x 24, with living quarters upstairs. This building could not be finished that fall, so it had a tar paper roof. Star paper, with one ply boards covered by sheet metal, but the windows downstairs were not finished nor the roof. We could look up and see stars through cracks in the roof and look down and see snow through other cracks. While there was plenty of wood most of the time, it had to be buckwheated. We had an air tight heater my husband had made in the truck shop, a good fireplace heater, any husband had made in the truck shop, a good fireplace stove, but even with those, it was not possible to keep bread, milk, &c, cakes from freezing in an unheated house.\n\nI had considerable difficulty trying to make bread under these conditions, & also as I had the fourth daughter of the Canadian family and married at the early age of 18, I did not have much experience in bread making. So there was no baking sooner than Prince Albert.\n\nMy husband applied for injuries received in a fall in July 1939.\n\nHis picture and an early biography is in Volume 2, Page 778. History of the Province of Saskatchewan.\n\nOnly three of our children are mentioned there as William, Edith and Inez. We later had another son George Gordon who is now working for his Master's degree in Education at the University of Saskatchewan.\n\nWilliam is a member of the Federated Commercial Travellers working for a Canadian firm while living in Prince Albert. Edith is Mrs. Stewart Cushing, Caribou Lake, Alberta, & Inez is Mrs. W.D. Peterson, Wilford. I have continued to make my home in Wilford, with the exception of two years in Moose Jaw with my son George when he was an instructor in the Dominion Provincial Youth Training School there. He later served in the R.C.A.F. until the finish of World War II.\n\nIf Volume 2 History of Sask. should ever be rewritten, I would like to have George Gordon's name included in the biography on Page 778.\n\nEthel E.

Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include items not mentioned above, quality, methods of merchandising, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. (Use back of page if more space is needed).\n\nIn 1900 my father made eleven trips to Prince Albert for supplies that was about 90 miles, with horses & wagon. There had been a hailstorm through the district in 1899 which destroyed any small amount of grain the settlers had tried to grow. By 1901 my father had some wheat which he took to the mill in Prince Albert & bought back flour. By 1916 there was a flour mill in operation in the young town of Delport, but by that time we could also get flour shipped in.\n21.

Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in your town or nearby places. In Southern Canada, Indians have not had much choice in quality methods of purchasing food.\n\nIn 1900 my father made eleven trips to Prince Albert for supplies that was about 90 miles north by horse and wagon. You could have a habitation through the district in 1899 which destroyed any small amount of grain the settlers had back at the time. By 1916 my father had somewhat started to grow his own food in Prince Albert's hayfield. By 1916 there was a flour mill in Prince Albert and the young town began to grow.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jessylee/PioneerQuestionnairesPDFs//PioneerQuestionnaires_No.1-DietQuestionnaires_Box12936_1903_111.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 26, "total-input-tokens": 43160, "total-output-tokens": 6853, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 3], [0, 50, 4], [50, 1560, 5], [1560, 2611, 6], [2611, 4055, 7], [4055, 5331, 8], [5331, 6944, 9], [6944, 7991, 10], [7991, 12328, 11], [12328, 12640, 12], [12640, 16781, 13], [16781, 17173, 14], [17173, 18683, 15], [18683, 19571, 16], [19571, 20690, 17], [20690, 21288, 18], [21288, 23487, 19], [23487, 24259, 20], [24259, 26524, 21], [26524, 26524, 22], [26524, 27725, 23], [27725, 28520, 24], [28520, 28520, 25], [28520, 28520, 26]], "primary_language": ["None", "None", "None", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "None", "None"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, true, false]}}]
