When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homestead and home prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible).\n\nI still do all my baking except bread. I buy my butter and live in town (for a year). I also buy own chickens and eggs. Buy some breakfast cereals, cornflakes, flour, shredded wheat, cheese, peanut butter. Which by the way came in about 1918-19. We had an old man from the States with us for us and he was always talking about it. We asked our guests and he asked\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include items not mentioned above, quality, methods of merchandising, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. (Use back of page if more space is needed).\n\nThis traveller and finally got us some. We didn't like it but have acquired the taste since. I can and dry corn & corn peas beans etc.\n\nIn the really early days we didn't know anything concerning it. We didn't get much till the Americans began to come up from the better farming ports. The U.S. I learned from an American. There was very little livestock and stock was kept for them & heifers & cows till we built up a little surplus. The houses were hard with earth floors and if we got a very hard floor it was very rough but spoken of also with more respect than\nhardwood nowadays. They were mostly one room, blue houses where we used to stay and hold services had the well water right in the kitchen, so we were going out in the winter when housekeeping needed water, since we had to use while someone else used her rope to pull up the water.\n\nWhen potatoes were first grown the farmers gave a banquet and invited the neighbors. Here Potatoes!!!\n\nThen came the electric power both on the farm and on the roads. Our family drove an ox and a cow and he could give the children a drink of milk.\n\nThere was no railway into Canada and supplies had to be hauled in from Carlingford Manor, Missouri.\n\nThere was very little furniture mostly beds built of poles and straw ticks. We kept a piano the only one for years. Then Dad had a small folding organ that was after 1900. He used to put it in a case he made and strap it on the back of the buggy and how it was appreciated at the various houses we stopped at.\n\nHis parish was from Estevan to Gainsborough, Postal to Carlingford Manor. Everyone came to church and it was held just wherever he was, I don't know how the word got around but it did. We got an occasional paper from England.\n\n[Signature]\nThey were not used mostly in town, but horses were used at a stage and hotel service. And the well water was used in the kitchen to save getting out water from the well. William needed water, so he held the pipe until Emma came back with her hopes to pull up the water.\n\nWhen potatoes were first grown by farmers, they grew a few and saved them for the winter. When potatoes were saved, they were stored in the cellar. The family would then eat them during the winter months.\n\nThe children had a chance to milk cows when there was no railway into Canada and supplies had to be hauled in from Cambridge.\n\nThere was only little furniture bought, such as chairs, tables, and chairs. The house was only one story high.\n\nPaul had a small growing organization in his garden after 1900. He used to put it in a box to move and ship it on the train. He bought various flowers in a shop at this time.\n\nThis period was from 1875 to 1890. Everyone came to school, but there were few people who attended. It was very hard to keep the school going around that time.\n\nIt was an occasional trip from England.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jessylee/PioneerQuestionnairesPDFs//PioneerQuestionnaires_No.1-DietQuestionnaires_Box12935_1892_54.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 24, "total-input-tokens": 39840, "total-output-tokens": 5024, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 4], [0, 1352, 5], [1352, 1595, 6], [1595, 3008, 7], [3008, 3886, 8], [3886, 5032, 9], [5032, 5032, 10], [5032, 9666, 11], [9666, 9850, 12], [9850, 13656, 13], [13656, 14464, 14], [14464, 15885, 15], [15885, 16616, 16], [16616, 17524, 17], [17524, 17748, 18], [17748, 19311, 19], [19311, 19311, 20], [19311, 20493, 21], [20493, 21586, 22], [21586, 21586, 23], [21586, 21586, 24]], "primary_language": ["None", "None", "None", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "None", "None"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, true, true]}}]
