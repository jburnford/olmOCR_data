(pail, barrel, tank) ...........................................\n\nRegarding water supply, mention any changes which have taken place since you first started housekeeping, giving dates where possible. We are still handling water in a small tank in the truck. We have a soft water cistern with hot and cold taps in wash room and bath room. Our water system was installed in 1926.\n### Food Items\n\n| Item                  | Approximate Price at the Market | From the last report to-day |\n|-----------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Onions & Iron         |                                 |                            |\n| Carrots               |                                 |                            |\n| Other canned          |                                 |                            |\n| Fish, bulk only      |                                 |                            |\n| Potatoes              |                                 |                            |\n| Apples - fresh       |                                 |                            |\n|                      | dried                           |                            |\n| Lettuce               |                                 |                            |\n| Tomatoes - fresh     |                                 |                            |\n|                      | canned                          |                            |\n| Bananas              |                                 |                            |\n| Lemons                |                                 |                            |\n| Oranges               |                                 |                            |\n| Cornflakes            |                                 |                            |\n| Other prepared        |                                 |                            |\n| breakfast             |                                 |                            |\n|                      | coriander - pipe                |                            |\n|                      | water                           |                            |\n| Pearl tapioca         |                                 |                            |\n| Emu tapioca           |                                 |                            |\n| Sago                 |                                 |                            |\n| Dates                |                                 |                            |\n| Walnuts              |                                 |                            |\n| Icing sugar           |                                 |                            |\n\n### Water Supply\n\nThere did not get water for drinking and for cooking?

In the early days we used sour docks and lamb quarters for greens (we still use them as they come earlier than the garden kind). Mushrooms were very plentiful, and for those who liked them made a welcome change of diet.\n\nThe homesteaders here made what they called homesteader's butter, bacon fat, and syrup beaten up together. 1/2 cup fat to 1/2 cups syrup.\n21. Than did you begin to roll on prehistoric forts and prairie forts instead of horizons and prairie prairies (there are many prairies and prairies as prairies).\n\n22.
