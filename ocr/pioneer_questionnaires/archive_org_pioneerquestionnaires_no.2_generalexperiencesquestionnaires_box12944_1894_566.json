Some of the questions will not apply to your experiences; others may prove impossible for you to answer so don't worry about leaving blank spaces. If you have sheets of paper, if there is not sufficient space to answer the questions, just initiate to give details or describe particular events, if they help to answer the questions.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1924, and may be either very young or old, and personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires:\n\nSaskatchewan Archives has a questionnaire No. 1 entitled \"Pioneer Diet: What Did Western Canadians Eat?\" It is still being circulated.

What do you think are the most important changes in your community since you first came West?\n\nProbably not the most important, but perhaps the most easily seen and having a most important, fresh in other improvements, are the improvements in transportation and communication. When I stood on the platform at Indian Head and looked down the track of the C.P.R. on March 19th, it looked like a wire fence blown down compared to the tracks I had left in England. Now we have tracks on all sides of us capable of carrying 180 car loads. In place of the rutted roads, we now have good gravelled roads, with many of them gravelled and black top coming nearer to our suburbs. Buses and motor cars make it possible to reach centres in a fraction of the time necessary in the warm and buggy days of the 1870's. Telephones have cut the isolation of the early days but still in some ways we seem to lack the human intimacy of the early days. Education has made great strides since the little red school house defended for its life on the injuries of war in a small district. His assistance of support today has made a great improvement, but I wonder that field must be widened until it includes the nation.\n\nPlease give the names and addresses of other pioneers who could answer this questionnaire.\n\nMr. A.J.
