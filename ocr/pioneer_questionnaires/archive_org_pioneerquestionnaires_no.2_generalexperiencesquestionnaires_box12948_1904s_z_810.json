Some of the questions here will not apply to your experiences; others may prove impossible for you to answer, so don't worry about leaving blank spaces. Use extra sheets of paper if there is not sufficient space to answer the questions. Don't hesitate to give details, or describe particular events, if they help to answer the questions.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1914, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer Diet: What Did Western Canadian Pioneers Eat?\" is still being circulated. If you have not already answered this, and would be willing to do so, please put a check mark here ( ) and one will be sent to you.\n\nSaskatchewan Archives questionnaires on other subjects will be prepared at a later date. Some of these are listed below. Please mark the ones you would be willing to answer.\n\n( ) All questionnaires\n( ) Pioneer health conditions\n( ) Pioneer social life, sports and recreation\n( ) Pioneer housing\n( ) Pioneer education and churchwork\n( ) Pioneer farming experience\n\nPreservation of Questionnaires\n\nAll questionnaires will be preserved in the Saskatchewan Archives Board's Office at the University of Saskatchewan as part of the permanent record of our Province.

We did not need two-hand plows.\n\nThe first years we got more work than we could handle by breaking 5-10 or 15 acres for new settlers. Of one party I want to mention had a homestead along the telephone track near what we called the\nSaskatchewan Archives Questions\n\nMy name is Wm VAN VLIET.\n\nI was born in Holland in\nthe year 1877.

Sisters.\n\nIn 1909 they built the first R.C. Church which soon became too small to accommodate the congregation.\n\nThe pros held monthly service conducted by Prof. Smith at the Southern College.\nWe had made up our mind to stick together as much as we could so we went to N Minnesota\u2014a place called Hendley\u2014where 10 years before a big bush fire destroyed timber and land and property in great number. There a big part of land was being settled with Dutch and Michigan Dutch but even my friend\nThe $5 next time you come to town when we need may not be for the next 5 or 6 months \u2014\nOur winter and spare time was spent in clearing land as this being part land the sections \u2014\n24, 73 and 25 had more than their share at once \u2014\nIn fact we had no more than about 35 acres of land we could work\nwith all his desire for farming found the heavy attempt and burdens\ntimber & cattle too much for him.\n\nI never intended the farm\nstill having in mind he\nstart in the bakery business.\nwhen ever I had money\nenough saved for this venture\nIt is however a long road\nwith wages in those days\nat $1.50 for a ten hour day.\nfor our cow -\n\nThe woman said she was sorry but the boys wouldn't\nwant sell the cow for less than\n35\u00a2.

It took 8 days by train from Elkhorn to Leptown having to shift from caboose to box car several times although we paid for our tickets and there\nI know it was a very cold night but being younger as I am now it didn't hurt me any.\n\nI kept regular correspondence with my relations back home although not writing as often as the first because father died the second year as was living on the farmstead.\n\nSo far I don't have much to write about going ahead in the world and I sure don't\nwas at that time no regular service.\n\nWe were traveled light\u2014having all our belongings in one trunk\u2014\n\nArriving at Repton there was only a tent where served at that time for dining hall and store being closed partly kept open for business\u2014\n\nThe morning after we came to Repton we started\nToo uncomfortable.\n\nDuring the evening I heard someone sneaking\nthe sleep and found next morning when I was\ncooking my breakfast of cornmeal, that it had\nbeen Mr. (I won't mention\nthe name) who had came\nto see how I made out.\nHe told me he had never\nbeen so worried in his\nlife.\nout on foot for our prospective new homes\u2014\nWe were able to get some information about tracks\nto take as a party of six Hungarians had gone that\nway about two weeks before.\nWhen about 8 miles out\nof Lepton at the point where\nat present Dysart is located,\nwe saw a woman working\nin the garden near the\ntrack.\nThe new Mrs. would not have any strangers at dinner so I was out in the cold.\n\nI asked and got permission to put up in a cattle shed so I could be out of the wind and at least under a roof although the shed was open at one end.\n\nI had hay for my axes and plenty left in the sleighbox so I was out.\nTo make sure we were on\nthe right road we accosted\nthe woman.\n\nThe people's name was Mitchell.\nComing from Austria and\nhaving settled there the\nprevious year.\n\nWe were on the right trail\nbut the woman asked to\navoid till noon when\nthe husband would be\nhome it was time who\ntook that party at\nfamilies or friends\ntry to make South of\nGordons and stop at\nsome ranch house -\nOne particular trip\nI came South of Gordon\nintended to stop at a\nranch I knew several\ntimes and was told\nI could stop any time.\nThis time however it\nwas different;

Feed bought at the bourse from shipments of corn from either Argentina or the U.S., and also with meal feed from local flour mills and flour cakes from Russia.\n\nI always did consider father to be well off and I guess was justified in thinking this way, looking at the company we kept.\nahead improving \u2014\nAs I mentioned the first\n1947 was a complete loss.\nThis put us back quite a little.\nI could not pay for the\nteam of horses so went to\nsee the contractor offering\npayment for the use if he\nwanted to take them back \u2014\nhe expected it would be\nbetter for me to keep the horses\nand pay whenever I could\nbe able too \u2014\nand our way of living in general.\n\nAfter leaving school at 16 I was apprenticed to learn the baker trade with the object of starting business for myself when coming of age.\n\nAt the age of 20 I was drafted in the army for two years having drawn a very low number with the option to serve\nUntil then there was no post office here and we had been at Kudowa where mail came from the post twice a month.\n\nNow we got a new post office at the place of the immigration agent Mr. Wolf mentioned at the beginning, called Wolfheim.\n\nThis was six miles nearer so we were quite\nMy time in the Dutch Indies at 7 cents per day which appears of displace.\n\nAt that time something happened what changed my course of life entirely.\n\nWe loved and respected father very much, my mother I don't know having died when I was very young.\nand when I went with my first load to Gavon where the elevator agent paid me 15 cents a bushel for wheat what costed me 12 cents to have it threshed alone plus taxes and the meals for the threshing crew whom came from the Gordon reserve with a horse power outfit. Well we all have to learn the hard way of equity.\nBy some unfortunate speculation father became bankrupt\u2014\nNow that may not seem so disasters here\u2014but in the old country (Holland) it meant a step or more down the ladder and a breaking up gradual with people you used to live with on the same footing.\nRemember when we were stacking the wheat someone drove up to the stack we were building and had a look at the grain. It was done from the open west of us and he knew more about horses and wheat than we did. So his advice was to put a watch to the whole thing to save money. Now right he was I found\nIt was then that I made up my mind to some other country to avoid being swept by former friends and acquaintances. South Africa (the Transvaal) just after the Boer War was closed for emigration to the Dutch so I had to look around for some other place.\n\nFather first was very much opposed to the idea.\ngreat acre was a complete failure although we didn't know it at the time.\n\nWe bought a binder with little down and with our team and one borrowed horse we cut our crop and several 10 and 15 acre plots from
