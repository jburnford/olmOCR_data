AIM OF QUESTIONNAIRES FOR THE DESIGN\n\nIt is difficult to answer a general questionnaire on pioneer life because no individual who is asked to answer it has exactly the same experiences as another. Some of the questions here will not apply to your experiences; others may prove impossible for you to answer, so don't worry about leaving blank spaces.\n\nInstitute to five details, or describe particular events, if they help to answer the questions.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1914 and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer Diet: What Did Western Canadian Pioneers Eat?\" is still being circulated. If you have not answered this, and would be willing to do so, please put a check mark here ( ).\n\nSaskatchewan Archives questionnaires on other subjects will be prepared at a later date. Some of these are listed below. Please mark the ones you would be willing to answer.\n\n- Pioneer health conditions\n- Pioneer social life, sports and recreation\n- Pioneer housing and churchwork\n- Pioneer farming experience\n\nPreservation of Questionnaires\n\nAll questionnaires will be preserved in the Saskatchewan Archives Board's Office at the University of Saskatchewan as part of our permanent record of our Province. Please send your completed questionnaire to:\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Office,\nUniversity of Saskatchewan,\nSaskatoon, Sask.\nSASKATCHEWAN ARCHIVES QUESTIONNAIRES\n\nNo. 2\n\nPIONEER EXPERIENCES: A GENERAL QUESTIONNAIRE\n\nNOTE: Please print all proper names and place names in capital letters.
