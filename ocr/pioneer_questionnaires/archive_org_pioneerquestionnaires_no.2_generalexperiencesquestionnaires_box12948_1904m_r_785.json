The experiences of these children will be quite different from those of their parents.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1914, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether they are still living or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer Tales: What Did Western Canadian Pioneers Have to Say?\", is available. If you have not already\nreceived this, and would be willing to do so, please sign at the bottom of this page.\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaires on other subjects will be prepared at a later date. Some of these are listed below. Please mark the ones you would be willing to answer.\n\n- All questionnaires\n- Pioneer health conditions\n- Pioneer social life, sports and recreation\n- Pioneer housing\n- Pioneer education and churchwork\n- Pioneer farming experience\n\nPreservation of Questionnaires\n\nAll questionnaires will be preserved in the Saskatchewan Archives Board\nin the Provincial Archives of Saskatchewan.
