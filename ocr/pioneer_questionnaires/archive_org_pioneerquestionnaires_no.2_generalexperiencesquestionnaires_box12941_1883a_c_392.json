Baines Fred S.\nThis contribution was written by myself twenty years ago presumably for presentation at an entertainment in Saltcoats. It concerned the status of the North American Indian of Canada and in perusing it, I thought it might be of interest to some who delve into ancient history and is a resume of the Indian situation past, present and future.\n\nOf his past, there is much of colorful interest, of his present state there is much that is but little known or cared of and his future is stamped with the seal of early extinction.\n\nLike the Dodo and the Great Ark of the bird kingdom the North American Indian is doomed as a distinct race of pure blood to utter extermination.\n\nA study of the Indian races of North America shows a mortality, a death rate abnormally high, a decrease so enormous that, like the buffalo, soon nought but a remnant of a once powerful race will remain. In looking up statistics of the numbers of Canadian Indians, this is what I record in 1917, 14 yrs. ago a census showed a numbering of 105 thousand souls in the whole of Canada. About 2 yrs ago an educated Indian, a Rotarian, visited the Rotarian club in Yorkton. He spoke at length and his speech was printed word for word in the Yorkton Enterprise. His statements were extraordinary, his statistics appalling, at that time he gave a number of 87,000 remaining Indians this was a decrease of 10,000 in eleven years so at this rate of loss approximately 55 years will consume the remaining residue of the once nominal owners of this Canadian country.\n\nShall we as a people view with complacency this passing of a once, in many respects noble race. My own personal observations of the Indian, a Metis nation extends back to the years 1883, nearly 48 years ago when, I, as a boy, came to Canada as a British immigrant. Arriving at Broadview on the main line C.P.R. we journeyed by covered wagon to Crescent city as it was termed on the gorgeously red inked map, a distance of nearly 50 miles, and my first sight of N. A. Indians was at the ferry crossing the Qu'Appelle River. A tall, blanketed moccasined representative carrying the inevitable muzzle loader met us, and upon payment of the usual fee, ourselves, wagons and belongings were ferred across the stream.\n\nWe were destined in the next ten years to come in contact with them almost daily, at certain season of the year and had first hand opportunity of studying and becoming acquainted with the life and habits of the noble red man as he had been termed by writers of song and story.\n\nAfter nearly fifty years of acquaintance with these people as I have found them as a nation, they are honorable, they are honest, to a certain extent trustworthy if you do not tempt them too long, too far. And among the true blood Indians that I have known, their mortality is of a higher standard that that of the whites. I have never lost a dollar either by theft or by trade with them very much more than I can say in favor of the trade and barter with Canadians. The Indian is a shrewd bargainer, a habit rendered necessary in order to compete successfully with those ready to fleece him. A faithful friend to those he deems worthy and he will suffer in silence extremes of hunger or cold, before he will ask for assistance from unsympathetic sources. He is at all times ready to accept gifts of food or clothing suitable to his needs, but cannot accustom himself to foods and clothing such as some people might think acceptable.\nThis contribution was written by myself twenty years ago presumably for presentation at an entertainment in Salt Lake City.

He is at all times ready to accept gifts of food or clothing suitable to his needs, but cannot accustom himself to foods and clothing such as some people might think acceptable.\nWith the advent of aggressive immigration and exploitation of Canadian resources, the Indian was forced more and more into the background of the reservations, set apart for them, a space entirely too small, for a people used to large open spaces, providing a hunting and fishing range, many times larger than the requirements of the farmers of the present day. The buffalo once so numerous were practically exterminated as early as 1880 and in some parts of Canada even earlier than this. There is at present in the Crescent reserves, a halfbreed whose name is Flameau, he told me of the last hunt of the buffalo and in which he participated, a small party of breeds of which he was one were travelling south, crossing about now is the district of Willow Bunch. Sheltering in a low brush covered Rovine, they started a small bunch of seven buffalo. Quickly taking to their swiftest saddle horses they soon overtook the bank, being early spring the buffalo were reduced in vitality and easily overtaken and the whole bunch killed and made into leather and pemmican. Upon questioning him closely, I figured this occurred in the month of March, 1886. As it was the year following the Indian Rebellion of 1885 only the prompt action of the Canadian government in purchasing a remnant of a herd conserved by a halfbreed, named Michael Pablo saved the buffalo from becoming extinct, and as we all know a very numerous and every increasing herd has its headquarters at Warnigight and also in the region of the Slave River.\n\nRight here a reference to the Reil rebellion of 1885 is timely.

The Indians at this time, numerous and powerful as they were, amply supplied with food and clothing by the enormous herd of buffalo at that time darkening the plains. The woods and prairies furnished unlimited supplies of furs and small game. The rivers and lakes teeming with fish were disturbed by the reckless wanton destruction of the natural food supplies. As they saw their hunting grounds invaded the buffalo decimated, the furs and small game destroyed by the profligacy of the whites and whole districts devastated by uncontrollable prairie fires. The Indian as a whole became restless and concerned for their future so it required but a little to stir up the fires of revenge and hatred of these white men, with their destructive weapons and rapid fire munitions. In the years 1884 to 1885 several partly educated fiery tongued orators inflamed the slumbering hates of the red man to a fiery flame and the effort and oratory of two halfbreeds, Gabriel Dumant and Louis Reil were responsible for an outbreak of violence and rebellion against the government of what was then the Manitoba and the North West Territories.\n\nOf that Rebellion lasting less than a year much has been written that you already know, but the effect of the suppression of revolt by the banishment of Gabriel Dumante and the hanging of Louis Reil was amply sufficient to prove to the Indian Nation that their means and men were too limited to make an effective resistance and the Rebellion was soon put down with the loss of comparatively few lives.

In the years 1884 to 1885 several partly educated flirty tongued orators incited the slumbering hates of the red man to a fiery flame and the effort and crativity of two half-breeds, Gabriel Dumont and Louis Riel were responsible for an outbreak of violence and rebellion against the government of what was then the Metis toba and the North west territories.\n\nOr that Rebellion lasting less than a year much has been written that you already know, but the effect of the suppression of revolt by the establishment of Gabriel Dumont and the hanging of Louis Riel was simply sufficient to prove to the Indian Nation that their means and men were too limited to make an effective resistance and the Rebellion was soon put down with the loss of comparatively few lives.

No Tommy range guns capable of throwing shells 75 miles, no poison gases, creeping up like a fog, stifling and choking and burning up all life that came in contact with it.

True this disease does finish them off, but what the Indian dies of is mainly starvation of sufficient nutritious food, he becomes reduced and constitutionally weak and run down and any disease at all will kill them off like flies. Tuberculosis, small-pox, fever, dysentery, measles pneumonia, common cold anything at all seems to be sufficient, when an Indian becomes sick he is stoical, silent, despondent, he is confident of a future happier hunting ground therefore he is hard to restore. Then there is in their life no appetizing tasty food to tempt the appetite, consequently he drinks a little bark tea, the Medicine Man performs a few incantations and the Indian dies, they keep their troubles to themselves and some months afterwards you ask for so and so and a few gestures show he has made his last hunt, so many moons or so many suns have passed, he has passed on to his future estate and Christianity takes little account of his passing.\n\nAnd so today the Metis nation is waning fast.

The Indian rebellion under the direction of Louis Riel was causing considerable trouble on the plains of the then Assiniboia. I, a boy of 10, left alone in charge of my younger brother and sister, was startled by a young man rushing into the house, badly frightened and in fear of his life. He was quite new to the country and what he had seen seemed to him to be an approaching massacre. He had run two miles to tell his news, which was a mass demonstration by the local Indians, aided and abetted by some young men of neighboring tribes who had incited them to violence. My father was contacted and, leaving the young man from the East with the two younger children, my father and I set off for the settlement where the Indians had congregated. On the way we met a good Indian we called John coming to see us to tell us he was doing all he could to keep the others in hand but wanted my father to be there and assist Mr. Eakin, the head of the colony, in controlling the bad element among the throng. Before reaching the Village of Crescent Lake (two or three houses and some tents) we heard the discharge of firearms and feared the worst. Upon arrival we were just in time to see a body of Indians, four abreast, about 30 men in all, headed by one Indian chief, Oka Neesh, (In English, \"little bones\") of the local reserve, trotting into the main thoroughfare before the Hotel maintained and operated by a huge man of 300 pounds known by the sobriquet of \"Jumbo\" Salisbury. Scattered about were 100 squaw-men, women and children, their ponies, travois and two-wheeled Red River carts with colts, dogs and the commissariat of a large tribe of natives. The fighting men and their leader, Oka Neesh, were stripped to breech-clouts and moccasins and painted to the full in war paint - red, black and yellow. Also, some of the large papooses were similarly painted in imitation of their fathers. An interpreter, John Fox by name, dressed in white man's clothes, and a half-breed, stepped forward and was met by Mr. Eakin, my father, Will Anderson, Switzer and Thompson.\n\nAccosted by Mr. Eakin (a fearless, forceful man, later a member of the Provincial legislature) as to what this demonstration meant, the half-breed gave this explanation.\n\nThe rebellion of Louis Riel was on, some local successes had made the Indians war-mad. The object was to subdue the white man by force if necessary and this was a start locally to help the uprising along. The Indians wanted arms, ammunitions and food in large quantities. If refused, they meant to use force to acquire it. Some of the younger men were hard to control. Some people might get hurt. Better to agree to their demands and save bloodshed. Mr. Eakin (a diplomat) listened carefully and said \"Yes, but first, let us hold a council campfire and a pow-wow. Let the people form up and get the music of the tom drums going. Then we will talk the whole thing over.\" The interpreter explained fully to Oka Neesh the suggestion, and after some bantering, he finally agreed and gave the order to the tribe to get busy. Instantly, as evening was approaching, everyone got busy gathering firewood and, selecting a site for the pow-wow on a long hillside. Mr. Eakin then issued some rations to the Indians, flour, tea and sowbelly, and wisely first fed and watered the hungry hoard.\nIt was the year 1865.

On the way we met a good Indian who called John coming to see us to tell us he was doing all he could to keep the others in hand but wanted my father to be there and assist Mr. Takin, the head of the colony, in controlling the bad element among the Indians. Before reaching the village of Crescent Lake (two or three houses and some tents) we heard the discharge of firearms and feared the worst.

Instantly, as evening was approaching, everyone got busy gathering firewood and selecting a site for the pow-wow on a long hillside. Mr. Takin then issued some rations to the Indians, flour, tea and something wisely first fed and watered the hungry herd.\nAfter the multitude had devoured the loaves and fishes a council fire was lighted and the chief, Oka Neesh, the leading fighting men, and the most important man of all, the half-breed interpreter, John Fox, circled the council fire. An outer ring of the main body, the pow-wow circle, consisting of the squaw-men, the squaws, young and old, ranging down to papooses, wapoooses and even some babes slinging in their cradles on the backs of their devoted mothers, made up a concourse of approximately 75 souls. The musicians, with their tom-toms and beating sticks, squatted cross-legged on the ground within the outer circle and, at the order to let loose, the din began. \"Tum-tum, tum-tum, tum-tum\". As the Scotch sons of the bag-pipers respond, so did the Indian nation, and in a short time every man, woman and child in the outer circle were swaying and weaving to the monotonous vibrations of the tom-toms. \"Tum-tum, tum-tum\". They were inspired. An aged man in breech-clout only sprang up, gesticulated loudly and fired his musket in the air.\n\nThe pow-wow was on and round and round the natives girated. Fifteen minutes or so and a halt was called. Silence. The chief\u2014Okan Neesh, the interpreter and Mr. Wm. Eakin advanced to the centre. As it was a war-time gesture, no pipe was offered, which was synonymous and not to the occasion. Oka Neesh spoke first. He was a fiery man, six feet, raw boned and not at all handsome. A typical savage, dressed in belt and war bag with the raw-hide sheath and big knife hanging handy, he also painted red, black and yellow, with eagle feathers in his hair hanging in two plaits down his back. He summarized briefly. The Indians had a grievance. The Government had not lived up to its promises. It had usurped their lands. The whit man had killed off all the buffalo, had burned up the prairies destroying all the natural game. The Indians were starving, were, in fact, desperate, so leaders had undertaken to drive out the white man and bring things back, once more, to a normal condition. Now, they wanted arms and munitions. They wanted all the food there was, and, in short, were there to take possession by force, if necessary. He fired his gun off into the air. The Chief had spoken.\n\nMr. Eakin asked for No. 2 to speak. He was ready. He sprang into the circle. He was a hot rod. First he gazed up into the ether where the stars were twinkling. He made mystic grimaces. He gesticated to an unseen audience. The spirits apparently responded and gave him inspiration. He fired his gun into the air. He drew his big knife and whirled in menacingly round and about. Mr. Eakin ignored him, then told him to quit and speak his piece. He did, and the interpreter did his best to convey his harangue. It was idle boasting and he finally blew up and sank down with a sense of duty well done. No. 3 followed, No. 4 after him, until about six had spoken. The Chief called a halt and handed the floor to Mr. Eakin (later Speaker in the Provincial legislature).\n\nEakin started slow. He reviewed the grievances, he explained that the Government had taken steps to remove the injustices but, at the same time, they did not intend to have a few savages dictate. He told them to restrain themselves or it would be the worse for them.\nAfter the multitude had devoured the loaves and fishes a council was called and the most important man or all, Oka Neesh, the leading fighting men, pow-wow circle, consisting of the squaw-men, the squaws, young and old, raising down to purposes, weapons and even some babies lying in their cradles on the backs of their devoted mothers, made up a concourse of approximately 75 souls. The musicians, with their ton-ton and beating sticks, equated cross-legged on the ground within the outer circle and, at the order to let loose, the din began. \"Tum-tum, tum-tum, tum-tum\". As the Scotch sons of the bag-pipers respond, so did the Indian nation, and in a short time weaving to the monotonous vibrations of the ton-tones, \"tum-tum, tum-tum\". They were inspired. An aged man in breech-clout only sprang up, gesticulated loudly and fired his musket in the air.\n\nAs it was a war-time feature, no pipe was offered, which was synchronous and not to the occasion.

He reviewed the grievances, he explained that the Government had taken steps to remove the injustices but, at the same time, they did not intend to have a few savages dictate, he told them to restrain themselves or it would be the worse for them.\nThen he warmed up, snatched the cap off his head (snow-white from 70 summers) jumped on it and defied the whole bunch. He said \"Let one hostile act be perpetrated, one shot fired to kill, and then - his rifles would speak\". He said \"Ten repeating rifles are in the surrounding bush awaiting the signal to fire, and the first to fall will be the Chief Oka Neesh and his merry men\". This was a colossal lie, but the bluff worked admirably. The Indians looked over their shoulders but did not offer to touch a gun (muzzle-loaders only).\n\nMr. Eakin said further: suppose they did shoot to kill and someone was hurt, the white Queen Victoria would send thousands of red-coats to avenge them, the chiefs and leading men would be taken, hanged from the poplar trees and the crows would pick their eyes out.

Baines\n\nPoveshell Sask.\nHaving been urged to recount incidents of long past years, my memory reverts to the days of the year 1885, reminiscent of the Indian Rebellion of that time. Being a resident in the school district of Crescent Lake, contiguous to the Indian Reservation of Little Bones Reserve.\n\nThis Reserve (since liquated) held a roaming population of close to one hundred souls, plus a large band of Cajuse Shaganapps, and a motley collection of the manjiest half-starved mongrel curs it was possible to acquire.\n\nA visit to the reserve at this time revealed a menagerie of Indian Flatsman and Jetsona, once seen not easily forgotten. At this time and place you saw the population at its worst and best. Some well dressed young bucks, plus Blanket & Bshirt; buckskin leggings and of course moccasins with elaborate beas-work in various designs; a belt from which hung a war bag as it was termed, containing gun caps, pipe (Shawgun), Kini Kini or Indian tobacco, made from the inner bark of the Red willow Bush, a few matches or flint box, and moss just in case\u2014but no birth certificate or coin of the realm. Also in a rawhide was a sheath, a big IO inch knife, sharp, capable of cutting down a young tree, skinning game, cutting tobacco, or scalping an enemy. I once saw severed very nice ones, this pastime is now held in abeyance.\n\nThe squaws were a sorry lot, several maidens of age to sit upon the brush were passable, but for the most part were burden bearers, and looked it. They never rested, always getting firewood, making fires, but very little dishwashing as the mongrel curs were very helpful and easily obtained. Cooking was a simple matter, a huge iron pot held a collection of comestibles, difficult to obtain at local stores, but greedily devoured by all and sundry. Choice pots often contained portions of skunk or badger, a few gophers or squirrels, these smaller ones invariably evisterated but usually left with the skins on, hair scorched off, this adding a distinct flavour reminiscent of pepper, no salt used. Anything else digestible was liable to be added as occasion warrant.\n\nAnd swift the happy days of long ago sped, no taxes, no rent to pay, a hunting credit at the H.B. stores long past overdrawn, and the Indian was a happy man but always ready to acquire more credit.\n\nBut I started to recount a little episode that occurred to me personally. It was about the month of August 1885. The Rebellion was in full swing. Some outlying settlers had been brutally murdered, some soldiers had been ambushed and slain, officered by men who knew little about hunting so men were knocked off like pins or bush rabbits. They had to learn the hard way and officers don't like to be told by ordinary people how to go about taming the savage who liked to kill at close range with ineffective weapons.\n\nI being an oldster of 12 years was left alone in charge of two younger children, &c. Our parents were away working at the village of Crescent Lake, comprising a store, and an immense Hotel of two stories, dimension of 18 by 22 feet, with an addition of a log kitchen paved with logs rudely flattened in which building appetizing meals were served ad libitum.\n\nIt was an afternoon, a fine day for anything. Having fed, we were just mangering around when our attention was drawn to a horseman approaching. As he drew near I exclaimed, \"It's an Indian\". Instantly my little sister screamed and vanished. We discreetly retired to the house and waited for developments. The Indian had probably seen us before we saw him so after thinking the matter over I decided to go out and see what was to be done about it. Putting on a brave face I accosted him with the usual salutation \"Bon jour Nichi\". He looked at me in apparent disdain, but failed to return my salutation. I tried again \"Bucketi Nichi\", again no response. I a little paleface and he a well built savage in full Indian Regalia\u2014little clothing, war bag, sheathknife, gun, and in full war paint, red, yellow & black. A nimble little pony completed a perfect picture of a fighting native, completely overawed a little mone-ass papoose, i in short I was beneath his notice and apparently he was deciding what was to be done about me.\n\nI was distinctly perturbed myself and while I was used to Indians I didn't like the looks of this guy.\nHaving been urged to recount incidents of long past years, my memory reveres to the days of the year 1885, reminiscent of the Indian Rebellion of that time, being of little bones Reserve.

(People you met on the way, meetings with Indians, adventures on the journey, accidents or other excitement etc.)\n\nVery rough trip, eight of us in one wagon, oxen and horses. We mostly walked, Indians at times helped all except gun and provisions. Prairie chickens were everywhere, ducks crowded the roadways. We stopped at a very large lot of them would weigh a thousand pounds. We camped at least 10 miles out, we could not find any water. We put up a tent, no water, no wood, no money, no men, no food, only oxen and horses. We had to go without. We were very lucky, we found a little stream near a little brown house.

I shall be spending the rest of my days doing business in Montana.\n19. How often did you write to relatives or friends in your old home?\n   For the first two or three years, very seldom, the price of a 3 cent stamp made it prohibitive.\n\n20.

Parents both dead, one sister also, the others reside at Sattocats and Melville.\n\n23. Is there any particular experience of pioneer days that stands out in your memory which you would like to record?\n   I have recorded much enough to make a good sized book. My son John Barnes has many writings, which he intends someday compiling. Some of my writings have appeared in the local Sattocats paper and also the Yorkton Enterprise, Indian tales of bygone days particularly of the Rebellion Era. Have also headed Indian Parades and Blood brother celebrations before grandstand in Sattocats. As my early acquaintance with the local Indians was extensive, and I was well and favorably known to them, the leading Chiefs and men however are nearly all dead.\n\n24. Did you travel about much in the early years? (for business, attending church, visiting friends, etc.) How often? How far? By what means of travel?\n   Having only an ox team for several years, and later my Indian ponies our travels were of a very local nature. We always attended church and Sunday school, but invariably walked 2\u00bd miles which was held in a building intended for a flour mill, which never materialized. A certain young lady by name, Miss Julia Nelson (who may be still living in B.C.), was an exemplary character and left an impression of Christian piety unequalled by any. And carried on Church and Sunday school for several years. We had a mule a week driven by an old fellow with a mule. Later a vehicle called a Bus manned by Indian ponies officiated.\n19. How often did you write to relatives or friends in your old home?\n\n20. If you got married, give the name of your husband or wife along with the date and place of marriage. I was married to James Kate Parker in Rigby, Montana.\n\n21. Did anyone else come to Saskatchewan before or after you? We had two more guys who died May 4th, 1957.\n\n22. If other members of your family (brothers, sisters, parents, etc.) came to Saskatchewan, tell when they came and where they settled.\n\nOur family of parents and four children came out together. Parents both dead, one sister also. The others reside at Saskatoon and Humboldt.\n\n23. Is there any particular experience of pioneer days that stands out in your memory which you would like to record? I have recorded much.\n\nEnough to make a book, which he wrote himself. My own children have been very useful.\n\nSome of my uncles have appeared in the local Saskatchewan papers and also the Greater Saskatchewan Tribune. They also heralded in the history of the Red River Era. They also heralded in the Panhandle and the Bozeman brothers helped found and run Salt Lake City. Do you have any experiences that you would like to share?\n\nThe leading church and town historian are generally known by all.\n\n24. Did you travel about much in the early years? (for business, attending church, visiting friends, etc.) How often? How far?\n\nHaving only an area of a very local nature, we always traveled to provide our needs and school. But unusually worked in which was held in a building intended for a house, which was used as a schoolhouse, a certain building in Humboldt, an example of the pioneer spirit.\n\nCalgary, the city of dreams, the dream of education first realized by many.\n\nAnd I am proud of the school in which I taught for a number of years.\n\nWe had a vehicle called a bus named after the pioneer officials.\n25. When was the first car used in the community? About 1912\n\n26. If you owned a car before 1914, when did you buy it? What make? Owned the second car in the settlement, a huffmobile in 1913. Later purchased a larger car an Overland.\n\n27. Where was your trading center? How far from your home? First a little store in Crescent Lake settlement, in 1889 at Saltcoats, the railroad came to it in 1888, 13 miles to Saltcoats.\n\n28. Did you continue to trade there? (Indicate any changes due to new towns appearing, better means of travel, etc.). We traded at Junction Rodeo and Saltcoats, intermittently. Myself and family moved to Saltcoats on October 1919, did some farming and stock raising in the village, owned a garage, later sold it.\n\n29. How often did you shop in the early days? Only seldom, as we had little to sell, and lived mostly on the land. Later, hogs, chickens, and cream and beef came along and our shopping became more pronounced.\n\n30. When (if ever) did people in your district first start going to town regularly on Saturdays? We did not regard Saturday in particular. But all people then did observe the Sabbath, and for many years, no one worked on Sunday, visiting church and Sunday School, was the order of the day.\n\n31. When (if ever) did you first begin to buy through the mail order catalogues? What kind of articles did you buy in this way? Indicate also what fraction of your total purchases were by mail order and any changes in the proportion of purchases made by mail order since the pioneer period.\n\nMail order catalogues came along about 1900, and it was a godsend to us for we obtained goods about 50% cheaper and the local stockkeepers had to drop prices or close up. The profits charged by the local stores were outrageous. And for several years the mail order served the people at least 50%. Today comparatively little is bought that way. Partly by the wholesalers was becoming unbearable of late years, but already the new laws are beginning to bear fruit. But prices for several years made the stock keeper excessive profits.\n\n32. When did you first have a telephone and what company provided it? We formed our own local telephone system, about the 1910-1912.\n\n33. When you came to Saskatchewan the first time was it with the idea of staying permanently? Or did you make up your mind after trying it out? When did you make this decision? When we landed in Crescent City (by pardon), we didn't have a dollar to our name, and by the time we could buy a ticket, we had got used to it, and did not wish to leave our log shacks, and sod buildings, had got into credit and did not leave it for many years. As our children grew up and married and the second generation got the hang of things, we prospered and today after 67 years we are well off, and charitable government gives us old fellows $40 a month. Ed Wheat\n25. When was the first car used in the community? About 1912.\n\n26. If you owned a car before 1914, when did you buy it? What makes you think you purchased a car before 1914?\n\n27. What was your trading contact? How far away from here? How far away from here? How far away from here?\n\n28. Did you continue to visit the store? (Indicate any changes due to new terms, prices, etc.)\n\n29. Better means of travel, and how did you get there?\n\n30. Did you continue to visit the store? (Indicate any changes due to new terms, prices, etc.)\n\n31. Did you continue to visit the store? (Indicate any changes due to new terms, prices, etc.)\n\n32. Did you continue to visit the store? (Indicate any changes due to new terms, prices, etc.)\n\n33. Did you continue to visit the store? (Indicate any changes due to new terms, prices, etc.)\n34. Did any people move away from your district prior to 1914? What reasons did they have for moving?\n\nSome people are always on the move. Some young men homesteaded several times, but for the most part the older settlers died there, and the later generations still represent the family name.\n\n35. Did many people move away during the 1930s? Did many return?\n\nMost people stayed and made good in later years. Land values increased, cattle were easily raised, horses were in demand, and the war made profitable markets for anything grown. Settlers came in from the U.S. and showed us how to do things. They were great educators, and knew much more than the ranch and field of humble beginnings of which we were active in any organizations, mention it here, giving dates wherever possible.\n\nWe have all held Local offices, in both state and church organizations, which all helped the social structure. In farming both grain and livestock raising we have done our share. Of my two sons, one is the Bank manager at Kelowna B.C., the younger one is also qualified for a similar position. I have sold out, and am retiring to Kelowna at 77 years old.\n\n36. If you or some member of your family have held public office, or have been active in any organizations, mention it here, giving dates wherever possible.\n\nWe have all held Local offices, in both state and church organizations, which all helped the social structure. In farming both grain and livestock raising we have done our share. Of my two sons, one is the Bank manager at Kelowna B.C., the younger one is also qualified for a similar position. I have sold out, and am retiring to Kelowna at 77 years old.\n\n37. If you or any of your family or friends were \"first\" to have or do something in the district mention it here giving dates wherever possible. (Such as owning the first automobile, combine, organizing the first lodge, etc.)\n\nWe were just people, there are no Hitler, or Churchill heroes in our family. Just plain folk who upheld the law and the church, as far as we could. My Brother Don was a hero in his own right, like many others. My Brother Don Elwin K. Barnes of Tisdale won for two years in succession the International Money Prize in London England a feat that has never before been accomplished. He is the only King of Saskatchewan.\n\n38. How did the places in your community get their names? (School districts, Post Offices, villages, railway stations, creeks, hills, etc.). Try to give: (1) name and occupation of person suggesting place-name (2) origin and meaning of the name (3) date of its adoption (4) any changes in names since the first name was given, date and reason for change. Give facts of new name as above in (1), (2), (3).\n\nCrescent Lake settlement was named because of the contour of the lake, therefore Brent School district became known as such. Salt Lake, our nearest town, was first named Stanley. This was afterwards changed to Salt Lake, because a man from Salt Lake, Scotland was given the job to name it in the year 1887. Stanley conflicted with some other town.\n\nNothing suggestive in the name or place; Salt Lake borders Anderson Lake from a man who homesteaded part of it, and one of his daughters became the wife of...\n34. Did many people leave your district prior to 1941? That reasons did some carry men homesteaded elsewhere, but for the most part the older settlers died there, and the total population fell.\n\n35. Did many people move away during the 1930s? Did many return? Yes, we had good crops in lots, prices were high, and values increased. Cattle was easily raised, there was demand, and the area made profitable markets for anything grown. Settlers came in from the US and showed us how to do things, they were friendly and educated, and brought much new knowledge.\n\n36. If you or some member of your family has held public office or have been active in any organizations, mention it here, giving dates when possible.\n\nWe have all held local offices in both state and church organizations which affected the social structure.\n\n37. If you or any of your family or friends were drafted to have or do something in the district mention it here, giving dates whenever possible. (Such as own)\n\nWe were four people, three were Hutterites, one was an Englishman.\n\n38. How did the places in your community get their names? (School districts, post offices, villages, railway stations, creeks, hills etc.)\n\nCrescent Lake settlement was named because of the curves of the lake, therefore the school district was named after it.\n\n39. What was the population of your community at its formation? Give date and reason for adoption.\n\nThis was officially changed to Selkirk, because of a man named Selkirk who lived there.\n\n40. Did any conflicts exist in the name or place?\n\nAnother Anderson took over when homesteaded next of kin, and one of his daughters became the wife of brother Andrew.\n39. Questions regarding historical source materials:\n\nDo you have in your possession or do you know the whereabouts of diaries, old letters, old posters and programs, minute books of community organizations, old pamphlets, old photographs, written recollections and reminiscences? (Describe).\n\nAs I stated before, my son John has in his possession writings I made several years ago, and from them much interest would be of interest to historians. Having an excellent memory I could give plenty of information even yet on conditions and causes of fear subsequent to 1885. Particularly of 1886 the year of the Indian Rebellion, and I may enclose with this a copy of one story I had looked for once.\n\nWould you or the person who owns them either\n\n(1) be willing to lend them to the Provincial Archivist for copying? Yes.\n\n(2) be willing to present them to the Archives Division of the Legislative Library, Regina, or the Archives Office at the University in Saskatoon? Yes.\n\n(Indicate your preference, if any). Either.\n\n40. If you have children or grandchildren, please give their names, where they live and occupations.\n\nMy oldest son Fredric Perkins Bourne, 30, etc.\n\nKelowna B.C., medical manager, with 24 employees under him. He has two sons under 6 years of age. His son John is in the superintendent head office, Western Health Dept. at Montreal. He has a daughter of 6 and a son of 4 years of age.\n\n41. What do you think are the most important changes in your community since you first came West?\n\nThe financial standing of the people of large farms is very good. Farm homes are good, the standard of living is high, nearly all own food cars, combines, and farms large acreages. Banks are doing well, and the only fly in the ointment is the F and M disease, which so far has not spread this district. Crop prospects never looked better, and the dry spring has enabled the farmers to secure all crops wanted even\n\nPlease give the names and addresses of other pioneers who could answer this questionnaire.\n\nMy brother Francis lives in Salt Lake. Most of the pioneers are dead, and the next generation knows little about the old days.
