We bought fresh vegetables from our own garden and canned them for storage. We also bought canned goods such as applesauce, peaches, and tomatoes. These were cheaper than buying fresh produce.\n\nWe also bought eggs from local farms and used them to make cakes and pies. The eggs were fresher and cheaper than store-bought eggs.\n\nIn addition to these items, we also bought flour, sugar, and other staples from local stores. These items were cheaper than buying them online or at the supermarket.\n\nOverall, during the Depression years, we were able to save money by buying fresh produce and using it to make our own meals. This helped us to stretch our food budget and save money.\nDuring 1914 after the drought hit and crop failure we had been convinced a little over a year ago that to obtain employment in the South Bank mining town was our best chance. We moved about three miles west where we bought a small farm from Mr. and Mrs. Johnson. The rancher had come in when Mr. and Mrs. Johnson moved away. He went on a trip for a year and he showed me a list that they used for a yearly supply. I don't think I had it for the records. The building used a pack of chickens there were three eggs cream milk until a child fruit they grew an abundance of potatoes or vegetables. We had fruits and games made our own ice cream.\n\nThe rancher was from the northern states he taught me to fry chicken southern style, to cook several potatoes and hominy, the largest one to make good coffee, fajitas, tacos and fried potatoes. They used straw dough before I had gone there. The next one wrote was so good they could not get it. People came and went out of nearly all countries. No cold but they made every week end for light rainy coyote games.\n\nThey dug up old bacon and out of the animals each week the thieves lived mostly on beans. The ranchers never drank them, always coffee. He told me even if I was alone on the ranch and a stranger walked up if it was noon meal time he would feel his horse and come and eat. The paid if were any remuneration ranch land. The R.R. M.P. always claimed and the rancher under he paroled the river county always on horseback. When Rancher visited each other they stayed for several days you could in a corner usually find chickens and any tobacco that you had in storage Rancher claimed and home stake coming in and were never an exception. It was to the rancher. Rancher loved much better than homesteaders.\nDuring 1914 after the drought hit and crops failed we had been employed to make a living. We got work on a ranch about five miles from town. The owner was a man who had come to the south from Illinois. He had come to Texas looking for work and found it here. He had heard about the good weather and the opportunity for work. He came to Texas in search of a better life.\n\nThe rancher had come when maple syrup was yearly surplus. He had heard that there was plenty of work available at the ranch. There was a large house and the buildings were in good condition. There were plenty of trees and plenty of water. They grew an abundance of vegetables and fruit. We had plenty of room to make our own ice cream.\n\nThe rancher was from the north and liked the living. He liked to fry chicken something style, to cook several potatoes and hominy. He taught me how to make good coffee, flapjacks and fried potatoes. They said straw dough before I had gone there. They said one winter was so cool they could not get the people enough snow.\n\nI mainly sell vegetables. No doubt they made my wishes out for buying eggs. They dug up old bones and out of the animals.\n\nThey lived mostly on beans. The rancher always cooked beans. He said if he was alone on the ranch and on his own he would have more meat. He said it was to feel his home and come and eat. The rancher was an excellent rancher. He paid all the men equally and fairly. When Rancher visited each other they always stayed at the ranch when he paid all the men equally.\n\nAnd any business that you deal in relaying Rancher always and every time coming in and never ever an exception. Rancher was much better than homesteading.\nOxford\n\nNo. 613 S\n\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8\nOxford\n\nNo. 613 S\n\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jessylee/PioneerQuestionnairesPDFs//PioneerQuestionnaires_No.1-DietQuestionnaires_Box12940_1913_340.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 24, "total-input-tokens": 39840, "total-output-tokens": 4348, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 2], [0, 1639, 3], [1639, 2498, 4], [2498, 3314, 5], [3314, 4196, 6], [4196, 6114, 7], [6114, 6114, 8], [6114, 7559, 9], [7559, 8924, 10], [8924, 8924, 11], [8924, 10647, 12], [10647, 10647, 13], [10647, 10647, 14], [10647, 10647, 15], [10647, 11557, 16], [11557, 11557, 17], [11557, 11557, 18], [11557, 12349, 19], [12349, 12349, 20], [12349, 14106, 21], [14106, 15780, 22], [15780, 15935, 23], [15935, 16089, 24]], "primary_language": ["None", "None", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]}}]
