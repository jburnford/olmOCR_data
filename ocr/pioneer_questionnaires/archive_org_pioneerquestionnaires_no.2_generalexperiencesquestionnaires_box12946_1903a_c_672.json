Some of the questions here will not apply to pioneer life in other areas, but prove impossible for you to answer, so there is sufficient space to mark blank spaces. The object of the questionnaire is to give detailed or descriptive particular answers, if they help to answer the questions.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1914 and may be answered by anyone who has personal experiences of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nFirst Questionnaire\n\nWestern Canadian Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled Pioneer Diet: What Did Western Canadian Pioneers Eat? is still being circulated.
