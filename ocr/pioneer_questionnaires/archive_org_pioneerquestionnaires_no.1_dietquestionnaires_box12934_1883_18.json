We dug a well for water to drink. The water for household purposes came from the creek, which was very muddy and full of silt. Later when these drains were free of silt, which was new and clean, we used the creek. Our household water came from the creek, which was very muddy and full of silt. In winter we melted snow for household use. All barrels as containers.\n13. SOAPS\n\nDid you buy laundry soap or make your own? If you made your own, did you use lye?

WRAPPINGS AND CONTAINERS\n\nMention any changes which you recall in the wrappings and containers received with the food you purchased (give dates where possible).\n\nIn the early days I do not remember any food in packages or any kind of container except a box. It was all put up in paper bags.\n\nAll kinds of preserves had to be washed and put up in paper bags.\n\nIt was not until the late 1890's that we saw any canned fruit, and in the small wooden pails. The changes came so gradually until even the grocery products were in packages ready for distribution. Quite early in the pioneer days table salt was sold in little cloth cotton bags. I remember we used to try these bags to form a square and use them for hundreds of years.\n\n17. Give a typical day's menu (breakfast, dinner and supper) for the earliest year you can remember. Give the year and list the members of the family with their ages at the time. State the approximate month, e.g., winter or summer.\n\nI will try to give a typical menu for the year 1894, which is about the earliest I can remember, so it will be autumn and winter menu, for my family:\n\nMother, Mrs. Jas. Francis, aged 59\nFather, Mr. Francis, aged 65\nChildren: Len, aged 6; Ethel, aged 4; Neil, aged 2; and Betty Lawrence, Mrs. L. A. Francis, Stratford, Sask.\n\nA typical breakfast for the children at that time would be a bowl of oatmeal (not rolled oats) porridge, with brown sugar and milk, a second helping if we wanted more. Mother and Dad would have a cup of tea, and toast made in front of the fire. (The cookstove we had had a grate in the front where we could make toast.)\n\nWhat year did you serve your first Christmas dinner in Western Canada?\n\nGive the menu. List those present and give their approximate ages at the time.\n\nIt was the same year that we had our first Christmas dinner and invited the Jones boys on a homestead two miles north to have dinner with us. We had a rabbit cooked from an old English recipe still utilized here. Our pudding was a plum dumpling, very good and very moist. Rich plum pudding with a vile plum border. All she had saved from her tea set, which was badly broken on transit from England. One plate had rickety backs, the other nuts. The Jones boys were Alfred, Fred, Charlie, Agnes, Walter, etc.\n\nThe boys had a good time playing all kinds of games afterwards. In the evening mother made some party and we had a taffy pull.\n\n18. Were you ever reduced to almost starvation level living on one or two locally produced foods? Give details.\n\nWe always had food of a kind, but not much variation. Our main meal for the children would be a pudding, rice, or steamed dried apple, roly-poly or a steamed bread pudding. The barrel potatoes would be frozen in the cellar almost just eating. If they were put in cold water they were soft and sour then. Leaving them eatable but not very palatable. Old cows' milk was short in the winter. We would even be short of milk in the afternoons. Old cows had to be dried off for a time. When we had the \"L.I.R.\" we used to have big raised ride quilts made in a large milk pan. We were all very fond of the \"L.I.R.\" as it was called, so mother had to arrange that we had this in turns. When it had to be dried off we had to take turns to have those when we had \"L.I.R.\" The few bones made very good imitation gums.\n\nWe soon acquired several cows so that we had milk and cream. As a special treat we would have cheesecake cream with our bread, when we turned against dried apples and prunes.\n16. WRAPPINGS AND CONTAINERS\n\nRetain any changes which you recall in the wrappings and containers received with the food you purchased (give dates where possible).\n\nIn the early days I do not remember anything from an industrial standpoint. All kinds of government stores had to be used and put up in lower bogs, and in the 1950s when we first had the late 1950s that we saw any kind of food was in small wooden boxes. The changes were so gradual until in the winter months ready for distribution, quite early in the year you can remember. Give the year and list the numbers of the family.\n\n17. Give a typical day's menu (breakfast, dinner and supper) for the earliest year you can remember. Give the year and list the numbers of the family with their ages at the time. State the approximate month, e.g., winter or summer.\n\nI will try to give a typical menu for the year 1954, which is about the earliest I can remember, so it will be autumn and winter menu for my family.\n\nMother, Mrs. Jan.

What year did you serve your first Christmas dinner in Western Canada?\n\nIt was the same year that we had our first Christmas dinner and invited the James boys on a houseboat two miles north to have dinner with us. We had a rabbit cooked in an old kettled called \"Wigged Boar\" rich plum pudding and onions. Our pudding was a plum tart, very good and nice. We badly broken on transit from England, all the plates had been broken, but the other nuts, the pongs boys were AIPed French, Charles, Alfred, Walter, etc., for about 17 to 19. We had a good time playing billiards games afterwards. In the evening mother made some candy and we had a party pill.\n\n19. Were you ever reduced to almost starvation level living on one or two locally produced foods? Give details.\n\nWe always had food of a kind, but not much variety. Our main meal for the children would be a puddings, rice, or stewed apple with only almost pure oatmeal. They were put in cold water, they were put out of them, I say they were put out not very palatable, they were put out, and our next would consist of fat bacon and game, turkey, rabbit in the winter. We would even be short of milk in the winter when the cows had to be dried off for a time. When we had the milk we were all very fond of the homogenized milk as it was called, so mother had to arrange that we had this in winter. Rabbit had never a favorite, too cold imitation game.\n\nWe soon acquired several cows so that we had milk and cream. As a special treat we would have sweetened cream with our bread, when we turned against dried apples and prunes.\n20. Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\nThere are no points upon which meals can be compared. Everything we had to eat we had to make. There were no canned vegetables to fall back on. If our potatoes and turnips were frozen we did without. After 1894 we raised our own pork and mother salted and cured the bacon and ham herself. I have never tasted any commercially cured ham; that tasted anything like as good as mother's. She made head cheese and sausages, pork pies and hard cheese. These were put out to freeze and brought in as required till the deep freeze came along.\n\nWe had no flour, sugar, bread, tea, etc., no bakery where one could get a loaf if we ran out of bread; we made scones. We did not just make a pie for dessert, but what we called a batch of pies, and they were kept in the milk-house; we had to have extras in reserve because the \"law of the prairie\" demanded that there would be a meal for any callers in.\n\nThe extra roosters and older hens would be killed off, plucked and frozen in the early winter. These were not fit to roast but we boiled them and served them with parsley sauce. This is an exotic dish.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homegrown and home prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible).\n\nWe were able to get Paulin's soda crackers, ginger snaps and sultana biscuits about 1896 or 1897, but never bread or any baked food. Gradually we were able to get canned tomatoes and fruit, but have these was a special treat. Jam in small wooden pails was available about 1899 or 1900. Apples in barrels were shipped from Ontario. I think this started about 1890, certainly not before. We always had to get them in before the frosts because of the long journey from Wolseley.\n\nAbout 1890 and from then on we were able to get corned beef in cans. This helped out very nicely with the fat bacon.\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include items not mentioned above, quality, methods of merchandizing, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. (Use back of page if more space is needed).\n\nPerhaps a short account of the little pioneer store and Post Office that Dad and Mother took over from Mr. Peregrin in 1887 would be as enlightening as anything. This little store supplied the groceries and other things to settlers for many years.\n\nThe Post Office necessitated a stage to and from Wolseley to bring and take the mail to the railway station. We never thought of this as a burden or an inconvenience. It was just accepted. This stage was run twice a week. It was about forty miles by the route the stage had to go, in order to cover the other small Post Offices from Pheasant Forks to Wolseley. It was never known to miss a trip in spite of weather, cold or bad trails. There was no main road, just prairie trail made by a repetition of journeys over the same route. The little Post Offices in between were Lorlie, Chickney, Hill Farm, Millboro to Wolseley and back the next day in reverse order.\n\nBesides carrying the mail orders for groceries were left by the settlers at the Post Office, which orders were put up at the little store and taken back the next trip. The settlers when they called for their mail would also pick up their order. I remember, as a child helping to put up these orders ready to go out on the stage in the morning. The trip to Wolseley, to call at the four in between Post Offices took all day, with one hour's rest at Hill Farm for lunch.
