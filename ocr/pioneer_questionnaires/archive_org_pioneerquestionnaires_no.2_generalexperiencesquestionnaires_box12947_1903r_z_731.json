Stewart Clarissa Antoinette (Mrs. John Arthur)\nPIONEER EXPERIENCES: A GENERAL QUESTIONNAIRE\n\nIt is difficult to prepare a general questionnaire on pioneer life because no individual who is asked to answer it has exactly the same experiences as another. Some of the questions here will not apply to everyone; others may prove impossible for you to answer. You may wish to explain about having blank spaces, but it is desirable to give detailed or descriptive particular answers, if they help to answer the questions.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1914, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experiences of the pioneer past whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOTHER QUESTIONNAIRES\u2014\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer Diet: What Did Western Canadian Pioneers Eat?\" is still being circulated. If you have not already received one, and are willing to do so, please put a check mark here ( ).\n\nSask Archives will be sent to you.\n\nLater data, some of these are listed below.
