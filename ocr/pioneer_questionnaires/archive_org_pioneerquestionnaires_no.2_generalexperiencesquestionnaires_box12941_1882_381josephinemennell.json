Thomas\nDear friend,\n\nMy Wesley has filled in your questionnaire. The best I could remember to tell him, which I don't think will be very helpful to you. However, if I was talking to you, I could tell you many sad stories, which I would not like to go through. I will enclose you a stamped envelope so I would like if you could let me know if there is anyone old there out around the North-East corner of Sask and their name, please.\n\nYours,\nJosephine Mennell\nMy dear friend,\n\nMy Wesley has killed in your Questionnaire. But I could think out all the answers. Would you like to hear it? Could tell you many good stories.\n\nI would not like to be away from you. If you could let me know if there is any old man or woman who would carry of back and their names please.\n\nYours,\n\nJosephine Mennell\nA word of explanation to the person answering this questionnaire\n\nIt is difficult to prepare a general questionnaire on pioneer life because no individual who is asked to answer it has exactly the same experiences as another. Some of the questions here will not apply to your experiences; others may prove impossible for you to answer, so don't worry about leaving blank spaces. Use extra sheets of paper if there is not sufficient space to answer the questions. Don't hesitate to give details, or describe particular events, if they help to answer the questions.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1914, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nSaskatchewan Archives questionnaires which have been prepared or projected are listed below. Please mark the ones you would be willing to answer.\n\n( ) All questionnaires\n( ) Pioneer diet\n( ) Pioneer schools\n( ) Pioneer churches\n( ) Pioneer recreation and social life\n( ) Pioneer farming experiences\n( ) Folklore in Saskatchewan\n( ) Pioneer health and housing\n\nPreservation of Questionnaires\n\nAll questionnaires will be preserved in the Office of the Saskatchewan Archives at the University of Saskatchewan as part of the permanent record of our Province.
