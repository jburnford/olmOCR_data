All the wheel, cogwheels and all were wooden, and the wonder of it was, it worked. The kids started to come to our school. The bread they brought for their lunches was coal-black.\nMr Stocks had forgotten to clean the wheat before grinding it. The bread was much like the oil cakes we fed our calves, in appearance, but not nearly so pleasant to taste. Needless to say, he was one of the first to abandon the farm. But, the worst part of that was, he abandoned the family of small children too. My mother was largely responsible for the placement of them, and it turned out to a fine family. They all became splendid citizens.\nMr Stocks had forgotten to clean the wheat before grinding it.

The same is true about the coin collection.\n\nNo doubt, I became interested in coins because of my banking experience. And speaking of coins, in those early days we had York shillings which were half the value of a shilling. Several theorists tried to have the term \"two bits\" originated, have been paid here but I am still of the opinion that because it took two of the York shillings to make up a shilling, the expression \"two bits\" was coined.\n\n68. These York shillings were silver of course, and were called bits on land. In 1904 or thereabouts, the silver was replaced by copper.\n\n69. James McInnis, Moose Jaw, Sask.\n\nMint at Oleren, and was informed that copper coins had always been a girt with them up to Eaton's opening in Winnipeg, and that since then up to this time (1920) they had never been able to catch up with the demand.\n\n70. And talking about banking in those early pioneer times, reminds me that in 1903 the bank authorized my signature on their currency notes. They send out the unsigned script in sheets of five each. During the grain marketing season, these small tickets arrived almost daily, because we had to pay for the grain tickets in cash. This meant, we had to sign up enough every night to take care of the next day's business. The signatures had to be written in India Ink and allowed to dry without blotting. In the small hours of the morning spread out to dry. Then find a newspaper officer open in order to correct numerical order, have them cut into bundles of a hundred bills each and be on deck to back into the vault, snatch a hour or so sleep and be on deck to start paying them out for wheat tickets by ten o'clock in the morning.\n\nNow what do you think of that for a true \"mankato\" story?\nOxford.\n\nNo. 613 S\n\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nESSELTE\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8\nOxford\n\nNo. 613 S\n\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jessylee/PioneerQuestionnairesPDFs//PioneerQuestionnaires_No.5-RecreationandSocialLifeQuestionnaires_Box12968_1883M-Z_1910.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 54, "total-input-tokens": 89640, "total-output-tokens": 16208, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 4], [0, 1267, 5], [1267, 1267, 6], [1267, 3554, 7], [3554, 5077, 8], [5077, 6781, 9], [6781, 8487, 10], [8487, 9877, 11], [9877, 11215, 12], [11215, 12528, 13], [12528, 13600, 14], [13600, 15671, 15], [15671, 17592, 16], [17592, 19136, 17], [19136, 20607, 18], [20607, 21961, 19], [21961, 23307, 20], [23307, 24315, 21], [24315, 25289, 22], [25289, 26605, 23], [26605, 26605, 24], [26605, 28946, 25], [28946, 30591, 26], [30591, 31037, 27], [31037, 31483, 28], [31483, 31483, 29], [31483, 31483, 30], [31483, 33270, 31], [33270, 34992, 32], [34992, 36524, 33], [36524, 37957, 34], [37957, 40318, 35], [40318, 42405, 36], [42405, 43118, 37], [43118, 43831, 38], [43831, 45374, 39], [45374, 46871, 40], [46871, 48253, 41], [48253, 49537, 42], [49537, 51060, 43], [51060, 52503, 44], [52503, 53797, 45], [53797, 55132, 46], [55132, 56135, 47], [56135, 57161, 48], [57161, 58897, 49], [58897, 60511, 50], [60511, 63165, 51], [63165, 63165, 52], [63165, 63328, 53], [63328, 63482, 54]], "primary_language": ["None", "None", "None", "None", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false, false, true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, true, true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]}}]
