In these early years there were no strangers in our community. We not only knew all our neighbors for miles and miles around, but we often knew their parents and grandparents as well.\n\nThere was no compulsory schooling for my generation; most of us barely received the equivalent of grade three, our main education was one of hard work & early responsibility. Relatives and neighbors went out of their way to help each other and to share what little they had.\n\nEvery religious holiday, anniversary or name day was a reason for gatherings and celebrations; there was no generation gap, everyone was welcome from great grandparents down to the newest baby.\n\nWeddings especially were well celebrated events; often lasting for three days, with huge quantities of food prepared by willing hands of friends and relatives, it was always an honor to be invited to help.

So many people of all ages died, there were times when there was no one strong enough to dig the graves.\n\nIn some instances people who died during the winters were stored in granary or barns, to be buried the following spring. Sometimes the body was attacked by mice by then.\n\nSome of my pleasantest memories are of early morning shooting trips, ducks, geese, prairie chickens were so plentiful around the lakes & sloughs where we lived, it was not uncommon for two or three neighbors to get together and come home with fifty birds before breakfast time.\n\nMethods of election campaigning were unusual in the very early days, I recall a couple of election years.\nthree generations, the older members always reviewing respect until removed from the youngest ones.\n\nPossibly the flu epidemic after the first world war was the most difficult experience of our generation, entire families were ill at once; our dear doctor Dr. Bostin had to work round the clock just possibly get around to see the sick people in the wide area had to travel by horse & buggy. Too many people of all ages died there were times when three and four are strong enough to dig the graves.\n\nIn some instances people who died during the winter were stored in a barnyard or house to be buried the following spring.
