My eyesight is not too good since last few years and my hand writing is not so good.

While there we rented land 12 miles from Portage la Prairie. In the spring of 1903 we moved by train to Carlyle Saskatchewan where my youngest had a homestead preemption. This was \u00bd section 2 miles north of the town of Carlyle. We also bought 4 sections of grazing land on the foothills of Moose Mountain where we pastured our cattle in the summer months. Our youngest son was born in Carlyle in 1905. So I really had eight to keep house and cook for, and did all my own work and sewing without help except a girl for a few days at threshing time or a few weeks if the weather was bad, and she had to board about 25 men until weather was fit to thresh again.\n\nMy husband passed away on Jan 27, 1940 and since that I have made my home with my daughter Mrs. G.A. Reeves in Regina and my son Archie Young in Carlyle. I spend the winters in Regina and most of the summers at Carlyle pretty and beautiful Carlyle Lake.\n\nMrs Catherine Young\nRegina Saskatchewan\nOur two sons and three daughters were born there. While there we rented land 1/2 mile from Portage Lake.\n\nIn the spring of 1913 we moved by team to Carlyle, Saskatchewan where Mr. Young had a homestead near town. We went west to auction 2 miles north of town early. We also bought fourteen acres of land on the still of Morar Mountain where we operated our cattle in the summer months.\n\nOur youngest son was born there early in 1908. He finally took flight to help house and work and acquire without help except a girl for a few days of the winter. Home for a few weeks that I could was hard, and you can imagine about 25 more until we met our first threat again.\n\nMy weekend passed away on June 27, 1940 and since that I have made my home with my daughter Mrs. G.A. Raine in Regina and my dear Archie Young in Carlyle. I appreciate the winters in Regina and most of all the summers at Carlyle particularly beautiful Carlyle Lake.\n\nPeggy Young (signature)\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jessylee/PioneerQuestionnairesPDFs//PioneerQuestionnaires_No.1-DietQuestionnaires_Box12936_1903_122.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 24, "total-input-tokens": 39840, "total-output-tokens": 5645, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 4], [0, 1566, 5], [1566, 2231, 6], [2231, 3511, 7], [3511, 4636, 8], [4636, 5780, 9], [5780, 6872, 10], [6872, 11520, 11], [11520, 12511, 12], [12511, 16277, 13], [16277, 16742, 14], [16742, 18264, 15], [18264, 18879, 16], [18879, 20452, 17], [20452, 20818, 18], [20818, 22323, 19], [22323, 22846, 20], [22846, 23851, 21], [23851, 24807, 22], [24807, 24807, 23], [24807, 24807, 24]], "primary_language": ["None", "None", "None", "None", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "None", "None"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, true, true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, true, true]}}]
