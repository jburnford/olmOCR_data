Use extra sheets of paper if there is not sufficient space to answer the questions. Don't hesitate to give details, or describe particular events, if they help to answer the questions.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1914, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer Diet: What Did Western Canadian Pioneers Eat?\" is still being circulated.

We'd no spare moments.\n\n(Knight spent most on the way; meetings with Radhakrishnan, adventure on the journey; accidents, a little excitement, etc.)\n\n(1) Let me say why Radhakrishnan took these views about 25 or 30 young girls and of whom the same age, I would imagine they were from some 6 or 7 schools, these girls were not the students to see the new arrival in this country, and you can not give information as to the correct remarks & etc. that would be forward from me to another within young people meet in this way. (Signed handwritten name and signature)\n\n(2) When at midnight Radhakrishnan there were 3 girls who had come to the station to see the \u2014 (signature unreadable).\n\nGreat hope our U.S.A. More 3 girls heard on their hearts and felt this evening station and we didn't expect to see them any more back, close to the station there was a tall, huge light was mounted by the side and on the far side there was a house, we could see the lights shining through the window, and what was a tall man outside, and as our train slowly pulled away we caught sight of three girls send away in train heading across the lake towards their home, it was the first time I have ever seen, and it was kept hidden in my memory for 45 years. I shall often think about it and talk to friends about it even after...\n14. What methods of the journey? (Not to give names.)\n\n(Knight goes out on the way; meeting with Braden's advance)\n\n(1) All the journey, accidents, a little excitement, etc.\n\n25 or 30 young girls all of whom are about\n\nand they were known to be about the same age, I would\n\nnot be able to tell them apart even though there were\n\nmore out the station to see that they arrived at this country,\n\nand you can not guess immediately as to the correct\n\nname of each other without the proper phone call to announce\n\nwithin thirty-five minutes in this way! (Handwritten phrase)\n\n(2) When at Newcastle Roadway Station there will be great work\n\nand come to the station to see the \u2014 train come in.\n\nGreat expectations that these girls had on their hearts\n\nand kept this waiting until we didn't want expect\n\nit was almost more than what else is the station then\n\nwere a fair stage both remarkable by time and on the\n\nfor and three were a person because she could see the\n\nvisible changes through the window, and that was a\n\nfull moon outside, and no new trains usually handled\n\naway the freight except of those three said arm in arm\n\nstanding across the Lake (Handwritten Phrase) But now\n\nthe finished flight 9 hour trip near end of the day\n\nright back in my memory for 45 years. I heard often\n\nthroughout 9 months God's name at dawn of the dawn plane\n(3) Off our head of our journey we were going through heavy thunderous country. If we say that on the turn and we had our misfortune after, our delay came and there was a Bear over there, and immediately one young fellow who had a right knowledge of the place took the gun and fired at the Bear but missed the Bear. But the thunderous turned the subject of the right and could have to bring and hold him not to do that again. For the next third night's house there was no threat and you might have known that thing and then you would be in trouble.\n\n(4) When was known satisfied for weeks as what nothing is let another turn happen if it was not a chance to get out and gather sticks and small pieces of wood to find in the house which was on the house inside them, where there was thick for us to do some cooking or such as keeping Bacon & Eggs and for making tea etc.\n\nBut the thunderous got us anxious early and late long as we did not go forward. But on evening the Bear came by they did not realize that the morning there was no more, within the middle of the town.\n\nThey saw the Bear leaving down close upon them. There was no time to handle or to turn back they had\n(2) All our hearts of love yearning for new glory through\nheaven's tenderest sympathy. If we ever feel on this earth\nwe have heard the message often, surely they will come\nand find their place there, and immediately if not\nyoung followers who heard a reply, \"Praised be Thy name!\"\nthe great multitude and found at the throne the names\nof those that had been delivered from the hand of the\nreaper and counted them to him and told him not to\nrise that again, for the second time might have been\na moment in their death and yet might have been\nsaved then and now in eternity.\n\n(3) When men tremble stricken for sinless or who nothing\nin that matter know, how is it that men must continue\nto put out and gather stalks and small pieces of wood\nto fuel in the flame which was on the divine candle\nthen, what times will there be to do some\ncooking or work as playing? But even a rope used for\nmaking the rope\nBut one thought not a certain activity and fine care\nas when their own mind would forget itself off the\ntears to gather provisions. Instead of evening the tears\nnow by they did not realize that the morning\nhours was so near, when the multitude of the tears\nthey knew the tears leaving them alone upon them\nthere was no time to hesitate or to turn back. They had\nto keep on going or else they might have been struck. When they were safely on the other side of the train they looked underneath the Box cars and saw that our or this train had begun to move so they started to run in the same direction as fast as their legs could carry them. We told the conductors about these two boys. Our train was moving very slowly and when we were clear of the other train he (the conductor) stepped our train and the two boys closed in what might have been a tragedy ended all right. These two boys were very tired and played out after their hard run, but now I would imagine much nicer boys next time. I bet they looked after they landed. Nothing very exciting about these stories but they were the only things out of the ordinary that occurred on my journey West.\n\n15. Where did you first stay when you arrived in Salt Lake City?\n\nMy first stop was at Regent, here I stayed just one night and I must put in a good word right here for the Salvation Army.\n\nI was standing on the Station Platform looking around. Picture a young lad of just 21 years arriving at a strange place. I didn't know a soul here and didn't know hardly which way to turn. Then a man approached me in Salvation Army uniform and asked me if I had just come out.\nTo keep me going no end they thought to any keen interest.\n\nWhen they were employed in the other work of the team\n\nthey looked anxiously at the Ban base and over their\n\nheads at what didn't seem strange to me so they started\n\nto turn into the same direction so that as their eyes\n\ncould carry them, we could see something very clearly and when\n\nwe came close of the other time, he (the traveller)\n\nstopped our things and the two dogs admired us.\n\nWhat might have been a trip ended all expectations\n\nafter two days and every travel and played and\n\nafter they heard some words about I couldn't make\n\nsense of what they said. They were the only things that\n\nwere there around them.\n\n15. Where did you find anything when you arrived in\n\nLondon? How long was it?\n\nMy friend stayed near Regent's Park. It stayed\n\nright next to the Salvation Army. It was\n\na nice place to stay. It was a bit\n\nstrange place. It wasn't known to\n\nmany people. It was a hard place to come and\n\nwithin a few minutes I found myself there.\nfrom the Old Country (he guessed this when he noticed\nthe steamship labels on my Portmantries (Indicat)\nand also asked me if I had any place to stay.\n\nIt was supper time and the night was not far off. I told him that I was an absolute stranger\nto the place. He then took my heavy Portmantries\n(Indicat) and said you just come along with me\nI'll take you to a good place and he came did.\n\nIt was a boarding house that he took me to. There\nwas a long table in the dining room, seated at\nthe table were several young ladies and I believe\nthat were some young ladies there also, a place\nwas set for me but I was too tired to eat\nafter my long journey. The kind Landlady\nnoticed this and asked me if I would like\nto go to my room. I said I was weak, all right\nshe said come along and get into bed and in\nabout 5 minutes I will bring up a little lunch\nfor you, and this she did. I shall never forget\nher kindness. She could not have treated me any\nbetter had she been my own dear mother.\n\nTherefore my first experience on landlady on\nSouth African soil was the meeting of these two\nvery noble christian people, an officer of the\nSalvation Army and the kind Landlady who was\nno doubt a member also of the Salvation Army.\nI have great respect for the Salvation Army\nthey are doing a very noble work.\nfrom the old churchyard he passed that within the woodland\nthe streamside coals on any Rendamnstown (Guthrie)\nand why would me if I had any talent to stay\nfor more than three and the night was not far\nto the place. At then took my driving Rendamnstown\n(Shepherd) and every year come when nights are\nbut take me to a good place and the same side\nof me a thousand times that the teeth me to place\nwere a long while in the churchyard same, waited at\nthe meet there twenty and three also a little\nafter my journey. At third Sheard took\nnot for some but 9 came the third to see\nit go to him twice. The armed come along and said\nabout 6 minutes 9 worth telling and a little count\nfor you, mind this is not. G which never forget\nshe had she been Ben\nperhaps my first friend\nShepherd's name was the only thing I could hear\nmy noble shepherd's feet, 17th police of the\nGuthrie's thing and he heard something make more\nno doubt a member also of the Guthrie's thing\n& there great respect for the Guthrie's thing\nthey are doing a very well work.\n19. How often did you write to relatives or friends in your old home?\n\nFor many years I wrote to my parents every week, after that not quite so often but I always kept in touch with them and did not keep them waiting too long for a letter.\n\n20. If you got married, give the name of your husband or wife along with the date and place of marriage.\n\nWe were married in Saskatchewan on the sixteenth day of December 1912.\n\n21. Did anyone else come to Saskatchewan because of your recommending it as a place to settle?\n\nNot that I know of.\n\n22. If other members of your family (brothers, sisters, parents, etc.) came West tell when they came and where they settled.\n\nOne brother came here in 1905 first worked at Brandon Man., as a carpenter, then came to the Selma district and started farming.\n\nAnother brother came out 3 or 4 years after and worked in Winnipeg.\n\n23. Is there any particular experience of pioneer days that stands out in your memory which you would like to record?\n\nThere are many, many events that stand out in my memory of the pioneer days. Please refer to question 39 also I will send you a letter explaining things more fully.\n\n24. Did you travel about much in the early years? (for business, attending church, visiting friends, etc.) How often? How far? By what means of travel?\n\nWe traveled about to Dundurn 30 miles west of here and got our provisions from there we would make about 4 or 5 trips a year with team & wagon, also I used to drive by horse & buggy about 10 miles to serve in a school house about 4 or 5 times a year taking my Victoria along and playing the hymns for the service.\n\nMost of the visiting was done between neighbors within a radius of 4 or 5 miles.\n19.
