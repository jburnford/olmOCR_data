I heard our family physician at Hillburn, and wrote often.\n\nThat summer 1892 I had a cow by mail. The next year I worked for a Canadian (not a green-eyed Ishmael) or $3 per month. (1893)\n\nI paid back up new land with New Mexico.\n\nThe settlers in this district came there in 1882.\n\nMy uncle, Mr. Eddy, lived at South Elmo, about 1 mile west of Ontario.\n\nIn 1894 I bought a farm (240 acres) for $880 in the Hillburn District. Buying it to farm, I lived in a log shanty on the farm.\n\nI was watching a child out in the spring with 25 cents. I met a Canadian (not a pioneer) before he started his own claim for a pre-emption. That summer, I was so hard up the friend turned hunt my first through the hole in my head, and I was thrown down on my back.\n\nNext, it was hard work clearing heavy brush with an axe or bucking the land with two horses in the fall. The rain came all bundled in bales of hay, shipped from the carriers in boxes of dirt and always a bad dream.\n\n(Mr. North Star, Alta.)\nIt is difficult to prepare a general questionnaire on pioneer life because no individual who is asked to answer it has exactly the same experiences; others may prove less experienced.\n\nIf you were a boy in the family and the question came from the head of house, you would probably have a good copy of what you had to write.\n\nAnd if you had a good copy of what you had to write, you could use it to make a good job of answering the question.\n\nYou could also use your own handwriting if you thought it looked good enough.\n\nI couldn't have done that without the guidance of my parents.\n\nI was delighted to receive your kind letter.\n\nYour son's name is mentioned by Mr. Roy F. Hannah.\n\nHe became No. 18969 and was named at the age of 14.\n\nHe died in 1952.\n\nI am glad you wrote back so soon.\n\nI wonder how you are doing now.\n\nI hope you are well and happy.\n\nI am looking forward to hearing from you again.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\n[Signature]\n\nOctober 11\n\n[Signature]\nThere was a farm on the farm and the Indians came there to pitch tents at noon. While bathing I liked for syrup or tea. Mulling am. Prunes of rice. So I had a good crop that fall but the wheat had a brown frost. I heeled it 15 miles to Hopilla near of the farm and sold it for $366 per bus.\n\nand sold goods from the store. In 1895 I was buying around 14 hours a day. On morning I went to the store of this man in a Red River cart. The pull-up three days in a printed shirt and pants. I walked away toward the poplars.\n\nOn December 4th 1895 I was married at the Methodist Church at Millburn. There was a Methodist Church at Millburn at this time which we attended.\nPIONEER EXPERIENCES: A GENERAL QUESTIONNAIRE\n\nNO. 2\n\nA CASE OF IMPEACHMENT TO THE PERSON\n\nANSWERING THE QUESTIONNAIRE\n\nSASKATCHEWAN ARCHIVES QUESTIONNAIRES\n\nSASKATCHEWAN ARCHIVES OFFICE,\nUNIVERSITY OF SASKATCHEWAN,\nBASILIANOON, SASK.\n\nAll questionnaires will be preserved in the Saskatchewan Archives Board's Office at the University of Saskatchewan as part of the permanent record of our province.
