Cooper helped dad.\nI remember the first time we saw Mrs. Condie. She called one evening, said she was looking for cows, saw our light the night before.

We had never eaten much oatmeal before, and Mrs. Condie told how to buy in quantity and the cheapest ways to eat on the prairie. She was a wonderful pioneer and about mother's age, and had 3 children who got to be our constant companions. Mrs. Condie was the first woman in the whole township. It took mother quite some time to get used to the fuel. She was sure she could taste it in the food.\nI remember the first time we saw Miss Condie, she called one evening. Said she was looking for someone who knew about running cow ships (mormon) windmills over quite hilly because she had no room to burn. And she told us a lot of things to help out.

She was a wonderful pioneer and about mother age and had 3 children who got to be our Companions. Miss Condie was the first woman in the whole township. It took months quite some time to get used to the fuel. She was sure she could taste it in the food.\n13. SOAP\n\nDid you buy laundry soap or make your own? If you made your own, did you use soap?

The Cowan was always friendly and we always laughed when he did the store paperwork.\nThe bachelor neighbors bought eggs, butter, bread from mother. Even chickens in springtime at $1.00 each. We found them all very honest. No one locked the door, and one time we were away, when we returned a bachelor had went down cellar & helped himself and left the money there.\n\nAn old German neighbor in Ontario had a big box made on legs, put in a whole 100 lbs of flour and set her bread yeast in the nest in the middle to keep it warm. Mother thought it was a grand idea, so dad made her one. The yeast never chilled.
