From people coming out on their own.\n\nSignature: [Signature]\n11. What did your friends and relatives think of your decision to come to Western Canada?\n\nWell as we were a whole family going there wasn't much to say but it sure seemed to be for my dear mother and father that had worked so hard to make nice homes and then leave it for the worst kind of conditions in the west and the friends said they could not go and with very little money little I could.\n\n12. Did you travel by yourself or with a party (family, friends or other group)?\n\nMy brother and I came in a box car with cattle and four horses in our car and I in the other was 14 and he 19 and father and my three sisters also coming brother by passenger train. My mother came.\n\n13. What means of transportation did you use?\n\nWe had to carry water to the stock. In my car had four cattle and a crate of hens. The oxen were very well broken 8 years old. Colonel they called with no yokes and would do what everyone asked them to because they had nothing else to do than that they would come right up and get out than you could sit in the wagon and drive them without any trouble.\n\n14. What incidents of the journey West do you remember? (People you met on the way, meetings with Indians, adventures on the journey, accidents or other exciting events etc.)\n\nAs we were traveling by train we didn't meet many but when we were side tracked we had lots of drunks come along and ask for whisky. I remember once a man came to my car and had a quart bottle. It was a whisky bottle full of coal oil like they thought it was whisky. I said he couldn't have any anyway. I said you have a flask in your pocket he took it out and drank it. Now he said can I have a drink of yours. I said I am sorry but mine is coal oil and he cried. Another time our fellow workers made a place where lots of stock to put hay so he would have more room too fellows wanted hitch a ride so he let them ride. So every once in a while the CPR fellows would send the settlers cars to the Blue Car always be said no more CPR fellows would send the settlers cars to the Blue Car always be said no more.\n\n15. Where did you first stay when you arrived in Saskatchewan?\n\nWe unloaded at Davison Lake.\n\n16. Where did you settle or take up land?\n\nAt Lucky Lake Lake 70 miles from Davison.\n\n17. Mention any other places where you have lived since coming to Saskatchewan.\n\nAt Lucky Lake Lake.\n\n18. How did you earn a living before coming to Western Canada? How after you came?\n\nI worked at harvesting and threshing in the fall and at times I worked at the drag and express at Davison Lake, and was very good with horses and the people. I worked for bad lovely horses and as I didn't drink or smoke I had no trouble getting jobs. Wages were very small as there was so many young fellows looking for work. $1.50 per month, I paid $2.00 for room and board so you see I just lived as I had to clothe myself.\n12. What did your friends and relatives think of your decision to come to Western Canada? Well as we were a while formerly going there.\n\n13. Did you travel by yourself or with a party (family, friends, strangers)? By Brothers and Cousins.\n\n14. What means of transportation did you use? We used to go by train and then by boat.\n\n15. Where did you first stay when you arrived in Saskatchewan? At Lucky Lake.\n\n16. Where did you settle or take up land? From Clarence.\n\n17. Mention any other places where you have lived since coming to Saskatchewan.\n\n18. How did you earn a living before coming to Western Canada? How after you came?\n\nI worked at harvesting and threshing in the fall, and of course I worked all the day and nights at harvesting, as I was very good with horses and the people I worked for had lovely horses and as I didn't think at work I had no trouble getting a wage, but very few said their was so many young fellows looking for work, so for quantity, I paced off for some and found it very difficult living at work.\n19. How often did you write to relatives or friends in your old home? Not often.\n\nAnd after a while not at all as I had a housestead 10 miles from town and had no money and was very busy and times was very hard.\n\n20. If you got married, give the name of your husband or wife along with the date and place of marriage. My wife's name was Sarah Halls of Maple Creek. She had a college training and a very lovely girl she passed away on June 17th.\n\n21. Did anyone else come to Saskatchewan because of your recommending it as a place to settle?\n\nThere was no one else came to join like as there wasn't any land in our part for homesteading.\n\n22. If other members of your family (brothers, sisters, parents, etc.) came West tell when they came and where they settled.\n\nWe all came at the same time.\n\n23. Is there any particular experience of pioneer days that stands out in your memory which you would like to record?\n\nThe winter of 1906 and seven was very bad and we had narrow escapes of being froze to death. I went out by myself in 1908. Had a team of bulls, the were not castrated and I thought a lot of them they were coming three years old, one was a dam and the other was a heifer. I broke them which was a terrible job as they wanted to fight. They weighted 2-800, and were coming three years old. They were very strong. I had a 44 rifle loaded my own bullets and shot most of my killing. I built my self a barn 18 x 40 and hauled the poles from the river 13 miles away. For the roof I made my self a sod shack and very seldom fell any one.\n\n24. Did you travel about much in the early years? (for business, attending church, visiting friends, etc.) How often? How far? By what means of travel?\n\nWe didn't travel much as we had to walk and not be many had any way of going. It just depended if a settler place had church going people. Elbow was our first town 35 miles away; a big hotel was about the first thing to build, a lot of the house builders would go in and think as they thought it was smart. And some of them ruined their health that way, but I never drank or smoked as I was afraid of sickness. I tried to tell the boys that it was better to leave it alone, a lot of them died quite young with cancer. In fact there hardly any often left now. My brother left and went to Montana and lived near Chinook Montana. He never drank or smoked he is 79 years now.\n21. Did anyone else come to Saskatchewan because of your recommendation? If so, name them.\n\n22. If other members of your family (brothers, sisters, parents, etc.) came West, tell when they came and where they settled.\n\nWe all came at the same time\n\n23. Is there any particular experience of pioneer days that stands out in your memory which you would like to record?\n\nThe winter of 1906 was very hard and we had marrows, leaves of being froze to death. I went out by my self in 1908 - Shad a house by the river. Got frustrated and through a lot of them they were country. Three years old, owns a claim and the other was a hayfield. We had two acres, and area enough. They were all they were very strong. Had a quarter 16-40 - had to build the house from the river up. We had no money. We didn't travel here as we had to work hard not at many. Had any way of growing. It just started off a season, then hard ended going. People, Elmo was our first. From 35 miles away a big house was about the first thing to build a lot of the love. A small garden and ditch, as they thought it was there. And some of them needed their health. The surgeon but never drank or danced. As far as I know of older I tried to tell the boys that they felt to have it alone a lot better than they did. They were very good friends. We hardly ever gotten together now. My other friend worked his 79 years near...\n25. When was the first car used in the community? Around 1912.\n\n26. If you owned a car before 1914, when did you buy it? What make? I had an old hearse and a head ack.\n\n27. Where was your trading center? How far from your home? At Lucky Lake, about three miles. Just a post office and store.\n\n28. Did you continue to trade there? (Indicate any changes due to new towns appearing, better means of travel, etc.). The railroad came in 1920 to Lucky Lake, just a mile from the old store where the town started.\n\n29. How often did you shop in the early days? If the weather was good we would go in to town Saturday night.\n\n30. When (if ever) did people in your district first start going to town regularly on Saturdays? Around 1920.\n\n31. When (if ever) did you first begin to buy through the mail order catalogues? What kind of articles did you buy in this way? Indicate also what fraction of your total purchases were by mail order and any changes in the proportion of purchases made by mail order since the pioneer period. After I was married we would send orders and have it shipped to Riverton that was across the river and we got quite a lot of things from them, but money was very scarce as crops were poor at times and although it was lovely wheat it was bought at a low grade as they could get it and a lot of distress was practiced.\n\n32. When did you first have a telephone and what company provided it? I am not sure but I think around 1920 it was on the telephone board for four years.\n\n33. When you came to Saskatchewan the first time was it with the idea of staying permanently? Or did you make up your mind after trying it out? When did you make this decision? We came with the idea of staying but I think if my folks hadn't sold all their things they would have gone back as it was too tough on people that had borrowed often at times and then having to start from scratch again so water just always well was of a very poor quality.\n25. When was the first car used in the community? (Answer 1912)\n\n26. If you owned a car before 1912, when did you buy it? What makes it special?\n\n27. How far from your home is your nearest grocery store?\n\n28. Did you continue to ride there?

It quickly became popular.\n\nWas just 3 miles from the old store where the train started.\n\n29. How often did you shop in the early days? (If ever) did people in your district start going to town regularly on Saturdays?\n\n30. When did you first begin to buy through the mail order catalogs? (If ever) did you buy in this way? Indicate also what fraction of your total purchases were by mail order and any changes in the proportion of purchases made by mail order.\n\nCoffee was classified as an ordinary household item and was quite a lot of things from their first discovery.\n\nIt was usually bought at local stores or by mail order.\n\nThey could go to St. Louis a lot of times, mostly by bus.\n\n31. When did you first have a telephone and what company provided it?\n\n32. When did you first have electricity? (Answer 1920)\n\n33. When you came to Saskatchewan, the first thing you did was to build a house.\n\nWe came with the idea of staying but we think they'll be back.\n\nHardly had all their things they would have gone back.\n\nOr they could have bought or people that lived here.\n\nA few years later they moved to East Regina. So we went to town and then moved to East Regina. We bought a very fine quality.\n34. Did any people move away from your district prior to 1914? What reasons did they have for moving?\nNo not many just a few moved up and went back to where they came from.\n\nA quite a lot left in the 80's too this, as I have was tough I moved to Penticton in the fall of 1936, but I wasn't broke. I rented my farm to my brother and sold it in 1942 and I was in Penticton yet an old man and alone.\n\n35. Did many people move away during the 1930's? Did many return? Yes No 10th June 1964\n\n36. If you or some member of your family have held public office, or have been active in any organizations, mention it here, giving dates wherever possible.\nMy Father was P.C. at Lucky Lake for quite a few years. John Couch and my brother was P.C after he passed away and after I moved away from there his name was W.C. Couch.\n\n37. If you or any of your family or friends were \"first\" to have or do something in the district mention it here giving dates wherever possible. (Such as owning the first automobile, combine, organizing the first lodge, etc.)\nI was among the first to own an automobile, and I lent money to finance the first school buildings, and I bought all but $5.95 out of $1600. I also lent them money to build the fellow hall at Lucky Lake got the most of that.\n\n38. How did the places in your community get their names? (School districts, Post Offices, villages, railway stations, creeks, hills, etc.). Try to give: (1) name and occupation of person suggesting place-name (2) origin and meaning of the name (3) date of its adoption (4) any changes in names since the first name was given date and reason for change. Give facts of new name as above in (1), (2), (3).\nAs far as Lucky Lake there was a large blue or lake just three miles north of where I have located. It had springs on the north side year around and in the spring after the snow went it was full of water, but as the summer advanced it grew up into rushes with quite large patches of water. I would say it was four miles wide and about long, and I think some one just had the bright idea of calling the post office Lucky Lake, like a place just below me four miles they called it. It takes after a family by that name and just south of Lucky Lake the Colville little grain station became in after a man by that name, like Elmo. It is built on the edge of the river, where I lived just south of the lakes, so a hundred feet for ducks and geese, they would come out to feed, thousands of them. I would shoot just what we could eat with my rifle before the train came and before was moved the rest of my brothers were two hunters so I did the hunting. I had some wonderful times.\n34. Did any people move away from your district prior to 1914? What reasons did they have for moving? (Do not name just a few persons if you want to be very brief.)\n\n35.

What do you think are the most important changes in your community since you first came West?\n\nOf course I live in the Okanagan Valley now but I think the tractors and trucks and combines, the corn harvests so much more work in a short time. I am starting now of what I hear the fruit growers say men get over a dollar per hour in $1\u00bd and then they want more and they get $1\u00bd come hear from 20\u00a2 to 35\u00a2 per hour and very little complaint.
