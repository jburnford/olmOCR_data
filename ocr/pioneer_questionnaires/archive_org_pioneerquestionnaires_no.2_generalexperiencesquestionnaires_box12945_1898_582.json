I went some time with them while the American cattle were all cut out and driven south, then the Canadian cattle were all cut out according to their different brands and taken to where they belonged and where all the cattle would be penned. The Canadian cattle were all mixed together, there were all colors and were far superior to the American cattle. They were very large and deep horned, very tall, very long and very heavy. They were very fine animals and bucking less than the American cattle and could run like deer. When much lighter than the Canadian cattle and could run like deer. When thrown into the air they would break, their hoofs click and their horns clatter making quite a clatter.\n\nThe Canadian horses were unruly. The Canadian horses were also much better than the American ones. The food on the round-up was good, plenty of fresh meat, difference fruit and some canned stuff. The cook made a lot of difference, while their supplies were about the same except the cook on the 76 wagon, was a fine lady. She was an old negro called Deason. He made very fine biscuits. This negro was a very interesting man to talk to; he had been a slave and could remember all the tough times the negroes went through after the Civil War when they were given their freedom.\nIn the end of June and beginning of July 1869 the 47th (now 43rd) Battalion Land Militia (now 50th) and the 47th Battalion (now 52nd) proceeded on a march about four miles below Brandon, the toughest hard work I ever saw. Several thousand head, I spent some time with them while the Canadian cattle were all out according to their different brands and taken to where they belonged and when all the cattle were branded and were found superior to the American cattle which were all long-horned, very strong and hardy. The cattle were very tall and thin, but they were in excellent condition. The cattle were very brown and black and they were in fine fettle. The Canadian cattle could run like deer when driven and the cattle would break their hoofs off and their horns would fall off. The Canadian cattle all had a big six shooter on their bellies but the Canadian gunners were unarmed.\n\nThe Canadian horses were also much better than the American ones. The food on the round-up was good, plenty of fresh meat, vegetables, fruit and some canned stuff yet the cook made a lot of it himself. While their supplies were about the same as ours on the 76 wagon, there was a big difference. The cook was an old negro called \"Old Negro\" who cooked very well. His cooking was very tasty and he could remember all the tough times the negroes went through after the Civil War when they were given their freedom.\nWhile I never saw any range in Ohio district, it was very bad in others and spreading further every year. In order to try to control it, the Dept. of Agriculture made a population test all entries were to be divided into three sections. The first year was 1904 and the last 1907.\n\nThe experiment started in the fall of 1904 when a stock breeder, a local boy, bought a cow from a neighbor who had been raising cattle for years. The cow was healthy and well cared for, but unfortunately she fell ill shortly after being purchased. The breeder took her to the vet, who diagnosed her with mastitis. Despite treatment, the cow continued to deteriorate and eventually died.\n\nIn the spring of 1905, the breeder decided to breed his new cow to see if he could improve the herd's genetics. He selected a bull from a neighboring farm known for producing high-quality beef. After several months of careful breeding, the breeder noticed that the cows were producing more milk than usual. He attributed this increase to the improved genetics of the herd.\n\nAs the summer progressed, the breeder began to notice changes in the behavior of the cows. They seemed more active and energetic, and their milk production continued to rise. The breeder was pleased with the results and decided to continue breeding the cows with the same bull.\n\nBy the end of the year, the breeder had a herd of healthy, productive cows. He was confident that he had found a solution to the problem of mastitis and was eager to share his findings with other farmers in the area.\n\nIn conclusion, the experiment demonstrated the effectiveness of breeding healthy cows with high-quality genetics. The breeder's success led to a surge in demand for his cows, and he became a respected figure in the farming community.\n\nReferences:\n\n- USDA (2005). \"Breeding Healthy Cows: A Guide for Farmers.\" Available at: [link]\n\n- Smith, J.

We traveled down the river to the mouth of the creek, which would not all disappear. We passed by the remains of the old fort at the end of March and one horse was the manager for cowboys. The remains of the fort were quite new and used to ship in cattle from Montana to be turned loose on the range along the Grand River. Shortly after we arrived there, I had just received a shipment of three hundred head and being short handed was quite pleased to get what help a green kid could give. If it was only keeping the fire going and the branding iron hot. After the cattle were branded a horse and saddle was provided for me and I was to help. It was necessary to take me to my destination. The cattle were brought back to the fort having lost a lot of weight. So why go back? So many little things that will happen when you are young and not willing to work. The year went by and cattle were all gentle and more serious for the hard work.\n\nThere was quite a bit of work to go through before we got to the summit but we managed to get through it alright without losing any. I do not think he had ever laughed in his life. He was about 35, spoke with a strong Irish accent and started everything he had to say with an \"Ahmed.\" When I noticed a peculiar sound, I got up on a hill. I asked Sandy if he could find no rode towards it, he said \"no.\" I thought I'd better go to the top of the hill. I looked around, when I got right up to it, it looked like a huge pile of rocks, scared my horse so badly that I tried all night. Sandy felt like to be \"filled,\" about two miles before we thought it might have been better than that. That evening we went to Mr. Harry Cross's ranch where we corralled the cows and they got them to the Pecos River Valley and turned them over to me.\n\nMy destination.\nEastend had its beginning in a coulee about four miles north of the present town. This coulee is now known as Chimney Coulee and was evidently a favorite camping spot of the early pioneers and takes its name from the stone chimneys that were left standing after the abandoned shacks of these pioneers had disintegrated. The last of these chimneys collapsed in 1915.\n\nJesse Cowie in his book \"Company of Gentlemen Adventurers\" reports having built a Hudson's Bay trading post at the east end of the Cypress Hills and from his description of the site it could only have been in this coulee, as he particularly mentions a lake that drained off from both ends, the north end running into the Swift Current and so to the Hudson Bay, the south end into the Frenchman and so to the Gulf of Mexico. The only lake in the country of this nature was opposite the Chimney Coulee on the east side of the valley and which has since been drained by the C.P.R. He records that during the winter of 71-72 he purchased 750 large grizzly bear skins, one of them measuring 13 feet from tip to tip and 1500 elk hides and that independent traders purchased as many more. Owing to the hostility of the Blackfoot Indians the post was abandoned in the spring of 1872 and was afterwards burned by the Indians. In 1873 some sixty families of Metis built a village and Roman Catholic Chapel in this coulee and was called by them Chapel Coulee. Mr. John Laframboise who lived there when a young man informed me that they were visited by two priests, Fathers Lestan and De Corby. There was also a cemetery with some six graves which can still be discerned. There had also been an Indian massacre in this coulee, the bones being gathered up and buried by the N.W.M.P., and since the time of the writer, Indians have held pow-wows here and on leaving, left the trees decorated with blue and yellow streamers and packages and plugs of tobacco for the departed.\n\nThe Cypress Hills always abounded with game, they also contained a plentiful supply of lodge poles, berries of all kinds, spruce gum used by the Indians for chewing and plants used by them for medicine, dye and eating. They were claimed by the Piegans and Blackfoot from the west and the Cree and Assiniboine from the east and whenever Indians of these different tribes met in them, there was always a fight. On the occasion of this massacre a band of Crees were camped in the Chimney Coulee, the squaws, old men and children were picking berries while the young men went out on the east bench to hunt. They were spotted by a band of Blackfoot from the hills near Eastend, who went out after them and defeated them. They then followed the Crees' tracks back to their camp and promptly cleaned up.\n\nThis story was gleaned from Indians with a Metis as an interpreter.\nEastend had its beginning in a coulee about four miles north of the present town.

He found the country very dry and hay too scarce, so he moved to be nearer hay and built his cabin in a coulee behind Mr. Topham's ranch which is still known as Doyle's coulee. In later years he moved to Skull Creek where he lived till his death in 1922. With the advent of the C.P.R. and after the rebellion of 1885 came a great change in the work of the N.W.M.P. Chimney Coulee was found to be too out of the way and in 1887 the Post was moved down to the Frenchman river. They took possession of Mr. Doyle's vacated cabin which was always used by them as the mess room. The rest of the detachment buildings were built by the Police. This detachment was about 200 yards south of the east railway bridge.\n\nThe first permanent settlers of the Eastend district were Miles Bolton (now W. Eaton) and Spencer Pearse (now J. Howard) who came in 1895, soon to be followed by others. By the spring of 1896, starting at the head of the little Frenchman were the following ranches: Harry Cross (now W. White), Frank Cross (now Noland), Hill (now Topham), Spencer Pearse (now J. Howard), E. Potter (now Stredwick), Pollock and Axton (now Frances Baird), in Jones' Coulee, Sterns and Sons, on the North Fork of the Swift Current, Jack Clark. There was no other settlement between here and Wood Mountain.\n\nAt this time, other than the few cattle owned by the settlers, the bulk of the cattle were owned (first) by Gordon and Ironsides of Winnipeg who had about 2000 head branded T H. They had no ranch but were managed by Mr. Charles McCarthy of Bear Creek, who used to keep a rider, who boarded at Mr. Pollock's. Spare hay was bought up from the settlers and any cattle that needed feed during the winter were run into the nearest ranch at which hay had been bought by this rider. Then there were hundreds of big long horned Texas steers, principally from Montana. The Montana range had been fed off by sheep and the Montana cattlemen depended on this country for their beef.\nIn 1876 the North West Mounted Police established a detachment in this coulee and was called by them East End as it was situated at the east end of Cypress Hills and was also the east end of a police patrol from Fort Walsh.\n\nThe first white man to attempt to settle in the district was Mr. Tom Doyle who came from Montana with cattle and built a cabin on the bank of the Frenchman river in 1883.

Howard) who came in 1885 soon to be followed by others. By the spring of 1886, starting at the head of the little Frenchman were the following ranches: Harry Cross (now W. White), Frank Cross (now Roland), Hill (now Topham), Spencer Pearson (now J. Howard), E. Potter (now Shredlock), Pollock and Sexton (now Prince Barra), in Jones, Cooley, Sterns and Sons, on the North Fork of the Self Current, and Jack Clark. There was no other settlement between here and Wood Mountain.\n\nAt this time, other than the few cattle owned by the settlers, the bulk of the cattle were owned first by Gordon and Ironside or Winnipeg who had about 2000 head branded T.H. They had no ranch but were managed by Mr. Charles McArthur of Bear Creek who used to keep a herd of cattle who boarded at Mr. Pollock's. Spare hay was bought up from the settlers and any cattle that needed feed during the winter were run into the nearest ranch at which hay had been bought by this rider. Then there were hundreds of big lots located Texas steers privately from Montana. The Montana range had been fed off by sheep and the Montana cattlemen depended on this country for their beef.\nDuring the summer of 1900 Mr. Harry Cross succeeded in getting enough signatures to a petition for a post office and a weekly service was started from Maple Creek during the 1900-01 winter, with Mr. Harry Cross as postmaster. In 1904 Ben Rose was postmaster for one year, then Mr. George Bolingbroke was postmaster until the Post Office was moved to the Town in 1913 with twice weekly service from Maple Creek.\n\nIn 1901 Mr. George Watson built a ranch on the north bank of the Frenchman opposite where Fred Williamson is now. At this time complaints were made about the great number of Montana cattle that were feeding on Canadian grass, which caused the enactment of new laws. To overcome these the American cattle men had to have a Canadian brand which resulted in the Bloom Cattle Co. buying the George Watson ranch in 1902 and also the cattle and brand of Mr. Colony Campbell of Piapot, Morgan as foreman, after his term the job fell to Buck Hardon now of Shaunavon, then to Harry Otterson now of Climax.\n\nIn 1901 two men named Surrey and Meneley built a ranch near the Eastend police post. In May 1903 these men sold out to Messrs. Elliott & Syring who were bringing in 800 head of cattle from Montana. They were unloaded at Glasgow, Montana, and brought overland. At the time of the purchase of the ranch they were being held on the border at White Water. After the ranch had been purchased, the writer was hired to help drive the cattle up to Eastend and arrangements had been made for the Police to inspect the cattle at Eastend on May 28th. Mr. Hurt (Earlight and Strong's foreman) and I left Eastend to fetch the cattle one beautiful sunny May morning. We travelled all day in our shirt sleeves, little expecting the trip would be so hazardous that only great good fortune prevented tragedy. The day after we arrived at the camp a terrific wind blew the entire day and no move was made. During the night a cold fog drifted in. Being on night guard at daylight I could just see the camp and saw the horses driven in for the riders to change horses. I noticed the horses suddenly stampede, so I lifted the cattle and followed the horse, which I was just able to keep me in sight. It was followed by another man who was only able to keep them off and the other man to several miles before I was able to herd them off and was the only catch up with me. He was riding bareback and was the only other man with a horse and he had not had time to put a saddle on his horse.\nDuring the summer of 1900 Mr. Harry Croas succeeded in getting enough signatures to a petition for a post office and a weekly service was started from Maple Creek during the 1900-01 winter with Mr. Harry Croas as postmaster.

In May 1903 these men sold out to Messrs. Enright & Strong who were bringing in 600 head of cattle from Montana. They were unloaded at Glasgow, Montana, and brought overland. At the time of the purchase of the ranch they were being held on the border at White Water. After the ranch had been purchased, the writer was hired to help drive the cattle up to Eastend and arrangements had been made for the police to inspect the cattle at Gastown on May 28th. Mr. Hurst (Enright and Strong's foreman) and I left Eastend to fetch the cattle one beautiful warm May morning.\n\nWe travelled all day in our shirt sleeves, little expecting the trip would be so hazardous that only great good fortune prevented tragedy. The day after we arrived at the camp a terrific wind blew the entire day and no move was made. The next day was cloudy and cold but a good move was made. During the night a cold fog drifted in. Being on night guard I noticed the riders to change horses. I could just see the camp and saw the horses driven in for the riders to change horses. I noticed the horses suddenly stamped, got up, lifted the saddle and followed the horses, which I was just able to keep in sight.

He was riding bareback and was the only other man with a horse and he had not had time to put a saddle on his horse.\nWe had the horses but had come miles losing all sense of direction and could see nothing. We headed out on a guess and by good fortune came across the wagon track which we had only to follow about half a mile to reach camp. We made good progress that day but the fog stayed right with us till the next morning when a violent wind rose and bombarded us with lumps of clear ice about an eighth of an inch square. This soon turned to snow and it was all we could do to hold the cattle against the storm. For the next forty-eight hours it was so bad that antelope would drift past and stand for several minutes in the shelter made by the cattle. On the third day the storm moderated and it was decided to move to try and get the cattle to a more sheltered spot. We did not know where we were but figured that if we followed the draw we were in it would eventually take us to the river. The tent was hopelessly snowed in so we left that standing, hogtied a couple of calves, put them in the wagon, but cut a few of the weaker cattle and left them. The cows following the tied calves in the wagon gave us a good lead. The draw led us to a coulee that by another piece of luck brought us into the river bottom about a quarter of a mile from the Stone Pile Police Post.\n\nAfter getting the cattle across the river which was very high, we were able to leave the cattle in the bush and get into the police post for a well-earned rest. Then the storm started again as badly as ever. On waking in the morning the cook and Mr. Huff were the only ones that could see. The eyes of the rest of us were so badly swollen and inflamed from the snow. On going back for the tent we found all the cattle we left behind had died.\n\nWe arrived at Eastend two days late but an hour ahead of the Police & Vets who were followed by Messrs Enright and Strong who were driving a democrat with a very interesting load. They in turn were followed by Mr. John Sevant, the manager of the Bloom Cattle Co., in a buggy also with a load. The cattle were soon pronounced O.K., and after a two-day celebration the Z-X ranch was declared open.\n\nThe Summer of 1906 was very wet.

It seemed to rain for weeks on end and the coulees ran knee deep and the Frenchman river was as high as a spring flood. The dirt\nroofs of the log houses or that day became so sodden that water dripped from them whether it rained or not. It stayed so wet that we had difficulty getting the hay in. The winter started in early with a light snow fall on the fifth of November followed by a terrific three day blizzard that started on the 11th. From then till Christmas was a succession of bad storms. The range cattle were dying in December. One would see the head of a big steer sticking out of a snowbank and on going up to it all it could do was roll its eyes at you. Others that had lain down would be half drifted over with snow. The heat of their bodies would thaw the snow and it would then freeze leaving them helpless in a cast. In other places one would see a bunch of 30 or 40 head all dead drift into a bend of the river and get snowed in. The willow bushes would be all they had to chew on, some branches as thick as a wrist would be chewed. Some of these cattle died on their feet partly propped up by a bush. When spring came much of the country looked like a battlefield and one could not get away from the smell of carrion. In one coulee I saw where some cattle had died on deep snow and when the snow melted, it left their carcasses lodged in tree tops.\n\nThe spring was very cold and fences were still out of sight in snow on the open prairie in June. Many of the coulees had deep snow in them in July and trees sticking out leaf. This hard winter put nearly all of the big cattle out of business.\n\nAlthough the summer of 1907 was very cold, it was also very dry but there was so much moisture left from 1906 that we had a crop. 1908 was very dry and hot, nothing grew. On making a trip to Maple Creek I stopped at Mr. Charles Mcarthy's ranch for lunch and he told me that it was the first crop failure he had had for 14 years. It was the first of a succession of droughts and the water level has been dropping ever since.\n\nThe railway was surveyed during the summer of 1907. The dump was built in 1913 and the town of Eastend surveyed and building started. The steel was laid down in 1914 and the police staff cut to one man who was quartered in the town. The old Post was abandoned and used by volunteers for the first World War. The Post buildings were sold to Mr. Phil Lott and the house now occupied by Mr. & Mrs. J.

After a few years he moved to the Saskatchewan Landing where he became partner in a firm known as Jones & Smart.\n\nJumbo's Butte\n\nOne of the N.W.T.Y. who did the freighting for the force was a very big man nicknamed Jumbo. (I do not know his proper name) On one occasion he left Maple Creek with supplies for the Farwell, East End and Stone Pile detachments. After delivering the Farwell and East End supplies there was only a light load left at Stone Pile was only a small post and was occupied only during the summer months. He piled this light load onto the East End detachment's buck-board and left for Stone Pile. This was the last seen of Jumbo. The trail to Stone Pile passed near a butte. The East End buck-board and load was found on top of this butte. On top of the load was the horses harness and Jumbo's uniform. Jumbo had turned his horses loose and left his load where it would be easily seen and deserted. Hence Jumbo's Butte.\n\nAnxiety Butte\n\nAt the foot of this butte is the ranch of Mr. Don Pollock who was a man that had to always be worrying about something. This earned him the nickname of sometimes Old Anxious and sometimes Old Anxiety. When one of the early topographical survey parties came through, they camped near Mr. Pollock's ranch. The boss of the party was so amused when he heard Mr. Pollock's nickname that he promptly put Anxiety Butte on the map.\n\nBone Creek\n\nThis creek is known locally as the North Fork of the Swift Current. It is always on the map as Bone Creek, so named by the first Geological survey party that came through this country in 79 and 80 because of the large amount of fossilized bone to be found along its head waters.\n\nCalf Creek\n\nIn this coulee there used to be a large cattle shed with corrals that were used for weaning calves.\nOrigin of some of the place names of the Eastend District\n\nJones Conley\nA man named Jones settled in this coulee in 1885.\nAfter a few years he moved to the Saskatchewan Landing where he became partner in a firm known as Jones & Smart.\n\nJumbo's Butte\nOne of the N.W.M.Y., who did the freighting for the force was a very big man nicknamed Jumbo.

This incident is known as the Cypress Hills Massacre and was instrumental in the North West Mounted Police being rushed in. When these men were brought to trial nothing could be proven against them. This massacre took place on Battle Creek.\n\nOld Man on His Back\n\nOn the west end of this ridge is a sugar loaf butte which when viewed from certain points gives the ridge a rough outline of a man lying on his back with his knees up.\n\nP.S.: Farwell Creek\n\nThis creek had been known as Farwell Creek since the earliest times.
