(Give name of place and country) .................................................. 32 Avenue Road, Toronto, Ont.\n   in Edinburgh, Scotland\n5. What was your father's name and occupation? .................................................. John Wood, Commercial Traveller.\n6. When did you come to Saskatchewan? (Give month and Year) .................................................. At the beginning of April 1892\n7. Mention any other places where you lived before coming to Saskatchewan, giving dates wherever possible. .................................................. When I was about a year old my parents moved to Glasgow, Scotland, where we lived about ten years. We then moved to Dundee where we lived till my brother and I immigrated to Canada. While in Dundee I was a pupil at the Harris Academy there.\n8. How old were you when you first came to Western Canada? (You do not need to answer this question if you would rather not or you may use \"I was a small child\", \"I was in my teens\", etc.) .................................................. I was sixteen years old.\n9. What were your reasons for coming West? .................................................. At that time (in the 1890s) a great many of the young people of the British Islands were thinking of emigrating. The old land was getting crowded and stories were coming through about the fine opportunities in the colonies, and particularly in Canada, where a quarter section of good land could be got free by performing certain duties.\n10. How did you learn about the West? (Through other people? Reading about it? Railroad or government information?) .................................................. My father, in the course of business, knew a merchant in Bath, Scotland, who had a son in the Oak Lake district of Manitoba, Canada. This son was about to strike out for himself and take up a homestead somewhere in the Prince Albert district. Then a part of the North West Territories. My brother and I decided to follow his lead and settle in this district also. Also at that time Clifford Hilton was doing his best to attract settlers to the West and had put on a strong advertising campaign showing how a man could, without land (if he worked) become prosperous and independent in a short time. The quarter section of land, seven free, was, of course, almost mathematical certainty, played quite a strong part too. Now for three hopes were realized in the story of the West for the next twenty years. According to the story (quite ignored by Hilton) had something to say about it in the form of nature (quite ignored by Hilton), also low prices - 35\u00a2 per barrel for wheat and drought, dust, frost also hail, also low prices - 35\u00a2 per barrel for wheat and drought.\nPIONEER EXPERIENCES: A GENERAL QUESTIONNAIRE\n\nRCIE: Please print all proper names and place names in capital letters.

What did your friends and relatives think of your decision to come to Western Canada?\n\nI believe they thought it rather risky as we were so young. I was sixteen years old and my brother seventeen.\n\n12. Did you travel by yourself or with a party (family, friends or other group)?\n\nWe travelled by ourselves but knew another person on the boat we sailed on, the \"Sardinian,\" this being Rev. John McKean, Methodist minister at Moose Jaw and formerly a missionary among the Indians in the West.\n\n13. What means of transportation did you use?\n\nWe sailed on the \"Sardinian\" from Liverpool to Quebec. Then from Quebec to Prince Albert by train via Regina. Went from Prince Albert to the Stoney Creek district - as it was then called (now Melrose district) by team and wagon.\n\n14. What incidents of the journey West do you remember? (People you met on the way, meetings with Indians, adventures on the journey, accidents or other excitement, etc.)\n\nDuring the sea voyage the Rev. John McKean, previously mentioned, prevailed on us to visit the Moose Jaw district before we went north to Prince Albert. There were lots of homesteads available in that district then and he thought we might decide to settle there. We therefore went on through Regina to Moose Jaw, then a village. One look by us at this country was enough. Not a tree nor even a shrub to be seen anywhere. Nothing but prairie and not even nothing, after one night in moose jaw we went back to Regina and continued our journey north from there to Prince Albert. Here we were joined by the young man whose lead we were following and who had already been out to the Stoney Creek district locating homesteads for himself and his brother. My brother, being only 17 years old, was too young to homestead but the rule was waived in his case as the boat was anxious to get settlers. We at Prince Albert were advised to take a team and wagon and also supplies and the three of us started off. We bought a team and wagon, and also supplies and the three of us started off. Stoney Creek eighty miles away by the nearest road - 60 miles by the present railway. Among our supplies we had a pair of oxen, which had been sold, and some time about April 10th, 1892, we arrived at my brother's homestead - the NE\u00bc of sec 28 - um 19 - w2 - located this time and established ourselves.\n\n15. Where did you first stay when you arrived in Saskatchewan?\n\nWe never arrived in Saskatchewan, we arrived in Prince Albert about April 5th, 1892 but Prince Albert was then situated in the North West Territorial and it was not until 1895 - thirteen year later, that the Province of Saskatchewan was formed. On our arrival in Prince Albert we stayed at the Belland Hotel, run by David Pelletier.\n\n16. Where did you settle or take up land?\n\nWe settled on my brother's homestead - the NE\u00bc of sec 28 - um 19 - w2, about 90 miles southwest of Prince Albert.\n\n17. Mention any other places where you have lived since coming to Saskatchewan.\n\nAt Melrose (which was founded in 1904 - twelve years after I arrived in Canada), at Kinistino, Northern Regina, Medicine Hat, Calgary, Toronto, Aldershot Camp, N.S., and Quebec.\n\nAlso since coming to Canada in 1892, I have made three trips overseas - two of them to Britain and Europe and one (in 1953) to Britain, Europe and the Near East.\n\n18.

How, after you came?\n\nSee separate sheets enclosed.\n19. How often did you write to relatives or friends in your old home?\n\nGenerally once a week. But this schedule was interrupted mid-winter for a month or about two months when the railway line between Regina and Prince Albert was completely snowed up and no mail passed through.\n\n20. If you got married, give the name of your husband or wife along with the date and place of marriage.\n\nGry D. Fox were married at the Methodist Church, Melville, Sask., on Dec. 1st, 1915.\n\n21. Did anyone else come to Saskatchewan because of your recommending it as a place to settle?\n\nThree of my cousins in Scotland followed us out\u2014James Leslie, now of Orillia, Ontario, Mr. Walter Mansell, now of Winnipeg, Man., and Mrs. Graham, now somewhere north of Prince Albert, Sask.\n\n22. If other members of your family (brothers, sisters, parents, etc.) came West tell when they came and where they settled.\n\nSee separate sheet enclosed.\n\n23. Is there any particular experience of pioneer days that stands out in your memory which you would like to record?\n\nSee separate sheets enclosed.\n\n24. Did you travel about much in the early years?

(For business, attending church, visiting friends, etc.) How often? How far? By what means of travel?\n\nSee separate sheet enclosed.\n25. When was the first car used in the community?\n   I believe about the year 1917. It was owned by John Hatton, a liveryman, was painted a bright red and made a noise like a threshing machine.\n\n26. If you owned a car before 1914, when did you buy it? What make?\n   Did not own me then\n\n27. Where was your trading center? How far from your home?\n   At a place called Pilot Springs, about twelve miles distant and with no trails. Used to ride there for supplies. Our main trading center was near Albert, approximately nine miles distant on the way to trail and with the South Saskatchewan River nearby.\n\n28. Did you continue to trade there? (Indicate any changes due to new towns appearing, better means of travel, etc.)\n   My brothers and I traded at these points till we had finished homesteading. After that my brother Will and I were away for about six years. When we returned to town, Melfort had been started. (It was started in 1904).\n\n29. How often did you shop in the early days?\n   As rarely as possible. Maybe once a month.\n\n30. When (if ever) did people in your district first start going to town regularly on Saturdays?\n   Cannot say. No town here at first.\n\n31. When (if ever) did you first begin to buy through the mail order catalogues? What kind of articles did you buy in this way? Indicate also what fraction of your total purchases were by mail order and any changes in the proportion of purchases made by mail order since the pioneer period.\n   Never bought through the mail order catalogues at any time that I can recall.\n\n32. When did you first have a telephone and what company provided it?\n   Cannot recall the year that telephone was installed in Melfort. Would be between years 1906 and 1910. Was owned at first by Mr. McFerran.\n\n33. When you came to Saskatchewan the first time was it with the idea of staying permanently? Or did you make up your mind after trying it out? When did you make this decision?\n   Yes.\n25. When was the first car used in the community?\n\n26. If you owned a car before 1914, when did you buy it? What make?\n\n27.

Did any people move away from your district prior to 1914? What reasons did they have for moving?\n\nI cannot recall any settlers moving away from the Melfort district prior to 1914. And very few after that until about 1950 when a number of them, having by that time become independent, retired to the coast and are there now.\n\n35. Did many people move away during the 1930's? Did many return?\n\nSo far as I know no settlers moved away from here during the 1930's. A number of settlers came in during that period from the drought stricken areas of southern Saskatchewan and Alberta. I remember talking to one of them and he told me about his well built up section of land he had left in the south. Said he could not raise any crops etc. in the drought.\n\n36. If you or some member of your family have held public office, or have been active in any organizations, mention it here, giving dates wherever possible.\n\nSee separate sheet enclosed.\n\n37. If you or any of your family or friends were \"first\" to have or do something in the district mention it here giving dates wherever possible. (Such as owning the first automobile, combine, organizing the first lodge, etc.)\n\nI was the first one to break land in that part of the Stoney Creek country later called Pleasant Valley. I did this breaking thirty acres on my brother's homestead the NE\u00bc Sec. 28-14-19-1901 in the summer of 1892 with a team of white oxen, the largest team I have ever seen. I was sixteen years old at the time. My brother and I raised oats on this land in the spring of 1893, doing the sowing broadcast in the old fashioned way. There was a good crop.\n\n38.

On our arrival in Canada my brother took up a homestead and we lived three years on this homesteaded (SE\u00bc 9 sec.32-43-19-w2) and we put in three years together on this land till I got my title deed. There being nothing in farming then owing to low prices and the distance we had to go to market (160 miles round trip to Prince Albert and back) we both decided to try something else.\n\nI read up for a Teachers examination during my last year on the homestead, succeeded in passing my examination (held at Prince Albert) and got a Permit to teach.

For about two months that fall I drove the team for a lumber company, unloading cars on the track and delivering lumber round town.\n\nThe pay was still $1.50 per day but it was a twelve-hour day as the team had to be looked after. This team (a heavy one) was finally taken away to work in the bush during the winter. There were no more jobs available as all building construction in the town had stopped for the season, it being then about the middle of November. I therefore bought a buck saw and for over two weeks sawed stove wood from dawn to dark at the rear of different houses.\n\nIn this job I was paid by the cord and I had usually to work till well after dark to make up my living wage $7.50.

Just then I met a man named Bob Pelloway who wanted to go into the bush at Reddeck - about\nTwenty miles north of Roscher - and get out two car loads of cordwood. We needed another man and I took the job. We drove to an abandoned lumber camp two miles out of Balluck - taking half a load of hay with us - and our first job was to build a small log shack. This we did in one day, all complete and chinked with moss. We had a small tin stove with us and when this had been set up were quite comfortable. The horses lay put in a broken down stable. In two weeks we had cut a carload of tamarack cordwood and a car load of pine. Our greatest trouble was with the pine which was rather knotty and had to be split and for days we were sawing our axes at each end of a cordwood stick.

He was a very rugged individualist, seventy years old, a six-footer and his hair still black as a crow. He was quite illiterate but knew everything about the repair of track, building a railroad switch, etc. When the gang would be slowing out along the track tamping ties and other work he and I would sit on a rail and discuss things in general. One day, from a chance remark I made, the question came up as to the shape of the earth. When I made the statement that the earth was round a look of incredulity came over his face and he flatly disbelieved it. From that time the battle was on and we had many a terrific argument about it. Sample Question by Tweedle - If the earth is round, as you say, how is it that the people on the other side of the earth don't drop off into space? No, of course, never heard of the laws of gravity. And so the fight raged on all their summer. But it was no use and I never could convince Tweedle that the earth was round.
