Some of the questions here will not apply to your experiences; others may prove impossible for you to answer, so don't worry about leaving blank spaces. Use extra sheets of paper if there is not sufficient space to answer the questions. Don't hesitate to give details, or describe particular events, if they help to answer the questions.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1914, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer Diet: What Did Western Canadian Pioneers Eat?\" is still being circulated. If you have not already answered this, and would be willing to do so, please put a check mark here (X) and one will be sent to you.\n\nSaskatchewan Archives questionnaires on other subjects will be prepared at a later date. Some of these are listed below. Please mark the ones you would be willing to answer.\n\n( ) All questionnaires\n( ) Pioneer health conditions\n(X) Pioneer social life, sports and recreation\n(X) Pioneer housing\n(X) Pioneer education and churchwork\n(X) Pioneer farming experience\n\nPreservation of Questionnaires\n\nAll questionnaires will be preserved in the Saskatchewan Archives Board's Office at the University of Saskatchewan as part of the permanent record of our Province.

All were born here in this district, as our parents resided here continuously after arriving here in 1886 and 1887 respectively.\n\n23. Is there any particular experience of pioneer days that stands out in your memory which you would like to record?\n\nI remember when I was a small child, at two story terrifying prairie fires, and having to help put them out by wetting potato sacks to beat out a back fire from about 5 am. One of the times my father was away, my mother hitched a horse to the walking plow and placed a fire guard around our buildings four furrows deep. I believe the regulation was along with the width of a tree. The flames were approximately eight feet high and rolled in like the waves of the sea, licking up all before them. I also remember the kindness of the people and how they shared and helped each other in everything. The community spirit was something to be desired. The men who came to exchange work at the long parade was something an event in our childhood. Oliver had a mill long the road and formed a little bond between us.\n\n24. Did you travel about much in the early years? (for business, visiting friends, church, visiting friends, etc.) How often? How far? By what means of travel?\n\nWe attended church regularly in the summer time, but it was a bit difficult to continue doing so in the winter, on account of the heavy snow we used to have those years. I can remember our one storey log house being covered in, as were the barns and granaries. My father had to dig tunnels in order to get the stock from the barns to the well and also to enable to get the feed from the granary, for the horses must have their oats.\n\nWaiting was quite a regular event, and the main source of pleasure, when we would pull stuff to have a game of cards.\n\nWe used to start to Wundurn to visit an aunt and uncle in the fall. McCordick live or three times in a summer, when it would be an all day trip and we would picnic halfway for a rest from riding. This was truly an event for us children.\n19.

If you owned a car before 1910, when did you buy it? What make?\nMy father bought our first car about 1912 and it was a Model T Ford.\n\n27. Where was your trading center? How far from your home?\nIn my time we were able to buy our groceries here, but we usually got our clothing and staples from a small storehouse until the town became a village which was about 1918. I believe that my parents used to take from three to five times a year.\n\n28. Did you continue to trade there? (Indicate any changes due to new towns appearing, better means of travel, etc.)\n\n29. How often did you shop in the early days?\n\n30. When (if ever) did people in your district first start going to town regularly on Saturdays?\nIt was the custom as long as I can remember.\n\n31. When (if ever) did you first begin to buy through the mail order catalogues?\nWhat kind of articles did you buy in this way?

If I remember correctly, the order usually came by freight, being quite a sizable one for a large family. This also was an event, to see what we had got and if it was stylish enough. It was almost as if there were three Christmases in the year.\n\n32. When did you first have a telephone and what company provided it?\nI cannot remember exactly, but about 1920, we got the first rural telephone line in this part of the country. However, according to the records, there were some telephones in the town of Willow Bunch.\n\n33. Why did you come to Saskatchewan the first time was it with the idea of staying still permanently?

(Such as owning the first automobile, combine, organizing the first lodge, etc.)\n\nMy Father and Mother were charter members of the Royal Orange Lodge, and Ladies Orange Breastwork association respectively. My Father's grandfather had the contract and helped to build the first frame church. My grandfather's name was William Stephenson. My Mother who was Belle Edgett at that time, also helped in this project by going about the country with a horse and buggy collecting from the different farms contributions to make this work possible.\n\n38.

Give facts of new name as above in (1), (2), (3).\n\nI remember that what is now called Buttena was the original Saskatoon, and how upset the Buttena people were when the North side of the River took the name and gave the South side the name of Saskatoon. I believe that was in the fall of 1899. I know the name of Saskatoon was taken from the Saskatoon berry, but I really don't know the origin of Buttena, only more than it is an Indian name.\n\nThe village of Sutherland was named after the Hon. W.G. Sutherland by popular vote by the people residing there at that time. He was a well respected farmer, sound mind, hard worker, of which he had many beautiful sons. South Saskatoon on the G.T.P. used to be called Earl, as the names came alphabetically, and this one happened to be E.\n39.
