H. Bocking\nAssistant Provincial Archivist\nMr. D.H. Bocking\n\nDear Sir,\n\nTrusting to your better knowledge of this work than my understanding, I begin this narrative hoping results or effects will not be disappointing.\n\nJ.E. Edward Nelson was born Nov. 11th, 1880, on a farm in Kansas County of Saline, location of farm near New Cambria.\n\nMy father, Rasmus Nelson, was born in Denmark. Mother was born in Germany. Father first purchased land was in Ottawa County near Niles a point on Union Pacific Railroad. Before this farm, I, sister older than myself, 4 brothers younger than myself, & 3 sisters grown up. Youngest brother became owner and is still living thereon.\n\nI first saw Canada in Sept. or Oct. 1906. Grown up as a neighbor boy in my district was one who when mature homesteaded in N. Dakota where he farmed several years. Later deciding to homestead in Canada, I decided likewise. Having then plans for marriage at early desire to obtain a home of my own. Rather than continue farming rented land, therefore a brother next in age to myself serving as hired man on farms arrived in Swift Current at time above mentioned. Where in presence of Government Land Agent William Milburn, one filed entry upon homestead. The man above mentioned was also a brother of mine, who was years older than myself had located in this district, we therefore did likewise. March or April 1907, this brother and myself through railway station in Car, loaded a grain car with settler's effects consisting of 4 work horses, 2 yearling colts, 2 cows & a crate of hens, a buggy with top and side curtains also arrangements necessary for driving a single horse or a team as preferred, and harness for both purposes.\n\nSuch plans as we loaded we learned later were not suitable for use in Saskatchewan soil. This car accompanied by my brother was remembered nightly reached Oliff 10 days after loading and 10 days in transit.\nD. H. Bocking\n\nTrue to your better knowledge of this work than my understanding.\n\nJ. E. Edward Wilson was born 1870-11-20 in Kansas.\n\nMy father Rasmus Nelson was born in Denmark.\n\nMother was born in Germany.\n\nFather purchased land in Ottawa County, Kansas.\n\nNiles is located on the Missouri Pacific Railroad.\n\nWe saw Canada in October 1906.\n\nI came to Canada in 1907.\n\nI married personal friend.\n\nI later decided to move God in Canada.\n\nI have a brother living in Canada.\n\nWe arrived in Swift Current at time of mountains.\n\nO'Brien in possession of government land and a good William Milburn.\n\nThe man above mentioned was a brother of mine and was killed by Indians.\n\nMarched on April 1907.\n\nRailway Station in Canada had a grain elevator.\n\nCanada was with God and side curtains also arrangements for driving.\n\nSuch place was we loaded our horses.\n\nThis can be confirmed by Mr. Brodie.\n\nI'd rather be working on the farm after loading.\nHanging near hand in my room is my certificate of marriage dated March 20th, 1907 written by Rev. H.A. Ott Pastor of St. John's Lutheran Church, Salina Kansas. Myself and wife a few days after Brother, a dear friend, boarded a passenger coach stopping in Kansas City where through an immigration office we arranged the route we were to follow. Through part of entry, DAKOTA to Webb Portal. Where at that date the only building to be seen was a house. Imagine our surprise looking out of train window while traveling through the Dakotas and at some distance seeing what appeared to be farm buildings surrounded by snow to a depth that every little more than roof could be seen. Weather in Kansas at time we left was warm enough to start growth in soil. Moving of our freight by wagon from Webb to homestead being delayed by depth of snow so a later date reached the homestead delivering some low grade lumber of which we constructed a one-room house and a cheap stable in which our horses the first few nights felt so cold we in the house could hear them in attempt to fight off cold pawing to relieve their discomfort. Having never before been exposed to such low temperatures.\n\nI have mailed from your office March 18th Questionnaire No. 23 is the one having lead me to undertake this extensive narrative which I hope does not make me appear as a NIT WIT.\n\nThe answers to other questions written before beginning this may prove to be difficult to read as my writing was somewhat disorderly. I have therefore tried to do qualified for your purpose. I could attempt correction if other forms should be sent me.\n\nThis one room with small rough addition was our only place of residence until the late fall of 1917 when on a very cold stormy day hurriedly gathered the most necessary articles or materials which we carried the short distance to the new yet unfinished 28 x 28-room house equipped with coal furnace hoping thereby to give better protection against cold to our two living girls the latest addition to our family. Our first daughter born Oct 16th, 1908 Olga Marie now keeps house for myself and eldest of 3 sons. My noble wife after 22 yrs of faithful companionship and at times working almost equal to a man developed a heart condition requiring\nHang on a year and we'll be married. I'm sure of it. We'll have a baby in the spring.\n\nAfter that, we'll move to North Dakota. We'll start out with a few acres of land and build a house. We'll work hard and save money. We'll be happy and content.\n\nI'm sure of it. We'll be together forever.\nHanging near hand in my room is my Certificate of marriage dated March 20th, 1907 written by Rev. H. A.

Referring my attention question no. 23 will relate my experience in filing and obtaining title to preemptive, as I remember instructions read as follows, a person may file on preemptive a quarter within same section or homestead. Or in an adjoining section separated only by road allowance. Due to difficulty in obtaining a water supply with only such a shovel, I hoped land of lower elevation would provide better chances for locating a well. Entering an office in Salt Lake, I therefore stated my desire to file on a quarter containing my homestead. The agent in charge stated it is useless to write such an application; it will only be thrown out. Inquiring of the neighbor who had prior right to make entry upon said quarter, I learned he had no intention of preempting. I believe it was to O. Howard then wrote explaining my desires and my reasons for such requests.\n\nThe reply I received as I remember was in these words:\n\nThe law of 31-12-16 was of 8th in being reserved for you as preemptor until a date then specified. My next move then that to go to Surf Current where after hearing information from Mr. Milburn, who expressed his willingness to aid my application, I made time. I later went to Surf Current where I met Mr. Dodds who for a time served as homestead inspector. I also met a younger man whose name I fail to remember. Dodds immediately realized the situation and asked, How did you that? Would I then show him the letter shown William Milburn. Some confusion may have been avoided. Dodds asked the younger man, What are we going to do with this. (turn over)\nDoctor said due to overexertion in performance of house hold duties caused her admittance to Salt Lake Hospital.

On or that date it had been predicted by a Prophet who, I have not spelled correctly Hally or Halla, that somewhere a comet would fall upon earth. Well toward the end of that day a cloud rapidly rolled upon us causing me hurriedly finish chores and seek the shelter of our house.\n\nSoon after while seated where best light for reading could be had I suddenly heard sharp snapping sound which I thought was lightning. I also thought daylight had been suddenly blotted out. My wife at almost the same moment exclaimed something is burning. I immediately answered the stable, and hurriedly opened the door to see the stable inflamed. Therein were my only 7 work horses 3 colts and our poultry all were lost, a pair of year old colts being away from were spared.\n\nThree dead horses were then not paid for this along with having to replace the 7.

I hope you by much perseverance will grasp the meaning. I wish my words to bear\nI have earlier mentioned the presence of Elder Daughter at Elder's home in our home. The second son had likewise all his life shared the home with us. In spring of 1960 he as in other years proceeded to crop his cultivated land consisting of half or more of 6 quarters. Having accomplished this with exception of flax which he one day made preparations to begin on; in the noon hour of that day he did not appear at home. We found he was lying beside truck used for handling seed, other machinery standing near. Beside his dead body lay a rifle and in cab of truck a note expressing thanks for all that had been done for him in various ways; but not a word as to what was the cause or his reason for giving up life.\n\nThat reason was and is yet unknown to the mind I believe unknown to all others. For his sisters & Brother as well as myself this was a shock from which we have as yet not regained perfect freedom. I am unaware of the present whereabouts of Vernon Thierman\u2014 I know he for years lived in Saskatoon & perhaps does yet. His father homesteaded near me, Clifford, but the accident of Swift Current also grew up on a farm joining Thierman's which lay nearer Well than my location. But Mr. Thierman or both may be able to be more helpful to you than myself. I still have a married son of Clifford, Batz, here a neighbor. I have not completed reading the copy of Jack at the ward library which arrived in my mail since receiving the questionnaire. Part of what I have read leads me to question whether my writing will all become Public reading matter.\nI have been in the presence of God, my Lord, and I am in His house. The second son had a house full of sheep. He knew nothing about anything. In the spring of 1960, he was in other years he worked to work his cultivated land. Cultivating of hay or more of 6 quarters having accomplished this with exception of flax which he one day made pharaohs to begin on. In the house house of Pharaoh did not appear at home. When found he was lying beside much wood for handling wood, other machinery standing hours; beside his dead body. As a rule and instead of truth a hate expression thanks for all child had been done for him in various ways! But not a word as to what was the cause of his reason for giving up life.\n\nThat reason was hard to get unknown to the mind of Arlenia working on to all others. For two sisters Brother can not as long as they work. A clock from which we have a photographic picture of freedom. I am unaware of the present situation outside of Mormon. The man of former life for years living on plantations. Bullets also for a father homesteaded near New Mexico. Despite a wilderness. Sharp current to grow on a farm farming. Throwing off the Mormon on little may be able to be missed. Half acre to you than yourself. Say still have a business on a field. Say you a huge forest. If have not completed building the old yashatee country. Without a number in my mind since accepting the questionnaire as part of what I have heard. Ready to go to school.
