Notice any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\nA warm semi-modern house, and the advent of quick yeast in bread making has been a big help. Also we have learned to freeze bread, pies, cookies. We used to cut beef into \"joints\" and files of slabs of steak and spread on boards. We kept them turned then packed them in snow in boxes.\n\nWe still freeze some for winter, but our meat for summer will go to the locker plant 20 miles away. It's far, but we feel it's worthwhile.\n\n21. Did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of home grown and home prepared foods?
