first tractor and separator in the district; a two cylinder Rumley \"Universal\" tractor and a 28 inch Amulay separator. Adam Jerry O'Connor, by name, had been recommended as a first class engineer. He arrived from Hamilton, Ont., along with one John Watt, from Almonte, Ont., on a \"harvester's excursion.\" O'Connor was a book-read engineer and failed to do the work expected of him. He advanced the spark so far one of the exhaust valves was burned out as the motor was working against the stroke. Watt was a good worker and he marvelled at the long and large wheat fields. When he returned to his home in Ont. and verified his tales. The brother too, was astonished. One day when the outfit was idle, owing to rain, O'Connor and Watt went for wild ducks, but, in error, they shot all of Mrs. Lee's tame ducks, as they knew no difference.\n\nRe. SOCIAL LIFE.\n\nFor social life, we played crokinole for many, many nights. We attended concerts and box socials. At many of the concerts, I rendered many recitations, my preference being the poems, \"Old Ace,\" \"1837,\" \"The Women or Humble Head,\" (a Welsh narrative) and \"Let Women Vote.\" At home, we often had sing-songs of old time songs and ballads. Reading was done considerably by my brothers and parents. Personally, I had stamp-collecting as a hobby.\n\nRe. SIDE WALK WORK.\n\nIn June, 1910, father had the contract for sidewalk construction in the town of Strassburg, and we worked for about three weeks. I received $2.50 per hour for ten hours' work and had to pay $25.00 per meal out of my wages. One day a \"Land Seeker's\" excursion train arrived with many farmers from Iowa. It was sponsored by the William Pearson Land Company. Ted Edwards was the local agent. When the land seekers started from town, the procession of buggies and democrats was almost a mile in length. They went westward to view the land holdings and many sales were made, \"on the spot.\"\nDuring July, 1915, father purchased the first tractor and separator in the district, a two cylinder Rumley, \"Universal\" tractor and a 28 inch Rumley separator.

Pelle home, 2\u00bd miles North and \u00bd mile West. About 4:30 p.m., a heavy, rolling cloud was seen in the far South-west. About 5 o'clock, we decided to start for home, possibly near or around 5 o'clock.\n\nWe hitched out driving team to the two seated democrat and started for home. We drove the half mile East and when we turned to go South, the storm broke and rain piled down in very heavy sheets or torrents. So much so, that the water ran on our way. We stopped at the William Snow farm until the rain stopped. This was the storm that caused the Regina cyclone.\n\nRe. STONES. When the homestead was being \"broken up\", or the virgin sod turned over, there were many stones to be dug and hauled away. The usual day's haul was ten wagon loads. Many small piles - perhaps 60 to 80 small stones were often found in one heap.\n\nReported to us by other settlers as being Indian grave markers. In our haste to clear the area, no effort was ever made to ascertain if this report was truth or fancy. When loading the wagon, large stones too heavy to lift were rolled up on a plank. Very large stones were rolled out of the ground by the use of a logging chain and horse power. When the land was being plowed the first time (breaking) a man would follow the plow to dig out the stones that the plow had struck. The task of stone hauling was very heavy and very tiring.\n\nRe. FAIRS. The Strassburg Agricultural Fair was an eagerly anticipated annual event, when nearly everyone in the district would go as to a celebration. It was another holiday of the midsummer. The Fair Grounds would be decorated for the occasion and the admission charges assisted the Society to meet the financial needs.\n\nRe. RINK. An early Strassburg store-owner was Mr. Ed. Morton, who was also on the committee formed in town to have a Curling and Skating rink erected. Rather draw a rough sketch of a truss form of rink rather to span the 50 feet of the skating area, to be free of any post support. Construction began during November and was completed on December 31st, 1909. We had gone to town that day to get father and his other helpers on the rink. The morning was very mild and around 3 p.m. it started to cloud over. Never having experienced a blizzard, we started for home, wax as there was a blizzard starting. After supper in town, we started for home with the storm breaking. The horses kept the trail for about 2 miles until we got to the hills where there was more bush shelter. The storm increased steadily. When we were about 7 miles from home, one of our horses slipped on ice, and with a bad leg condition, was unable to get up without help. The men helped to get her up and we eventually got home. The storm lasted for two or three days, and caused a lot of suffering.\nRe. STORM.

DOG.\n\nAn uncle of mine, Louis Strickert of Sebringville, Ontario, (near Mitchell and Stratford, Ont.) arrived at our home after a rail trip in charge of the Clydesdale stallion, \"Kinniard Chief,\" and he brought a two year old Scotch collie dog, called \"Fred\" by name. The morning after his arrival, I walked to the nearby pasture and milked two cows. I then opened the pasture gate and allowed the herd of about fifteen cattle to go out to better grass. All of this action could be seen from the farm dwelling. The dog had been with me all the time. I walked back to the house with the milk. Uncle Louis told us the dog could be told to go back and put all the cattle in the pasture again. This, none of us would believe, but as Uncle insisted on doing so, father consented at last. The dog was told to, \"Put those cattle back in the pasture!\" Away went the dog and gently nosed the cattle back and then came to the house. Watching this performance, father bought the dog that morning for $50.00, and he was a good, faithful dog for many years until his death about the age of fourteen or fifteen years.\n\nRe. WAR.\n\nIn the early days of road construction, horses were used with \"slushers\", or \"fresnoes,\" with the operator walking behind. Certain road construction was being done near the corner of Sec. 36-24-21 W2nd, when one of the workmen got a newspaper in the mail delivered by a neighbour, telling of the outbreak of World War I. This was hard to believe but it was a true fact. There was no telephone system in the district at such time. During the following days of War, the weekly papers carried long lists of casualties, those killed in Action and Wounded. Full pages of names were common and it was the practice to closely scan through the lists for the names of district volunteers who had gone Overseas.\n\nRe. HUNTING.\n\nHunting in the early years was a help in the food supply. Our hunting as principally for wild ducks, partridges, Prairie chicken and rabbits (both cottontail and jack), all used for food. There were many ducks on the sloughs of the Last Mountain hills, around here. Some people were able to obtain venison, but all we ever had were gifts from neighbours. Coyote hunting was more as a protection of the poultry than for sport. However, with coyote pelts being worth $8.00 each, whenever a horse or a head of cattle died, either naturally or by accident, the carcass was placed in a spot screened from sight by the coyote eating on it. We had a .32 calibre Winchester rifle and a .25-.20 Savage carbine, also an old Swiss army rifle which was very heavy and unreliable for discharge. Ammunition was very cheap and much was used for target practice. One of the really active hunters of the district was one, Charlie Lee, who did his hunting on horseback and who was a very good shot with a rifle.\nRe: DOG.\n\nAn uncle of mine, Louis Strickert of Beringville, Ontario, (near Mitchell and Stratford, Ont.) arrived at our home after a rail trip in charge of the Clydsdale stallion, \"Ramford Cigar\" and he brought a two year old Scotch collie dog called Weazelboy by name. The morning after his arrival I walked to the nearby pasture and killed two cows. I then opened the pasture gate and allowed the herd of about fifteen cattle to go out to better grass. All of this action could be seen from the farm dwelling. The dog had been with me all the time. I walked back to the house with the milk. Uncle Louis told us the dog could be told to go back and put all the cattle in the pasture again. This none of us would believe, but as Uncle Irving insisted, on doing so, father consented at last. The dog was told to, put those cattle back in the pasture! Away went the dog and gently nosed the cattle back into the pasture. My father bought the dog that morning for $50.00 and he was a good fatherly dog for many years until his death about the age of fifteen or fifteen years.\n\nRe: WAR.\n\nIn the early days of road construction, horses were used with messengers, or messengers with the operator walking behind. Certain road construction work done near the corner of Sec. 36-24-21 W2nd, when one of the workmen got a newspaper in the mail delivered by a neighbour twirling it up in his feet. This was hard to believe but it was true enough.\n\nThere was no telephone system in the district at such time. There was no wireless during the following days of WWI. The weekly papers carried long lists of casualties, those killed in action and wounded. Full pages of names were common and it was the practice to closely scan through the list for the names of district volunteers who had gone overseas.\n\nRe: HUNTING.\n\nHunting in the early days was quite extensive for wild ducks, pheasants (both cottontail and jock), all used for meat, and rabbits (both cottontail and jack). There were many ducks on the sloughs or the East Mountain, thin hills around home. Some people were able to obtain venison, but we all was here used for the people's\u5f71\u89c6. Coyote hunting was more for protection of the poultry than for sport. However, width coyote pelts being worth $8.00 each, whenever a horse or a head of cattle died, either naturally or by accident, there was a hinges on it. We had a No. 252 carbine, also an old Swiss army which was very heavy and unreliable for discharge. Ammunition was very cheap and much was used for target practice. One of the men active hunters on horseback and who was a very good shot with a rifle.\nRe. FIRE.\n\nOn April 5th, 1910 there was a heavy growth of \"prairie-wool\" covering the land on the Last Mountain Hills. On this date a big fire was burning North of Strassburg, fanned by a South wind. It burned on towards the town of Drayton. On April 6th, the wind shifted and came from the West, driving the fire to the Last Mountain hills. We had been hauling stones in the forenoon. About 4 p.m., an arm of the fire passed to the South of our homestead, but the main fire was still to the West. About 5 p.m., if was coming and we tried to back-fire to check it by firing along the plowed fire-guard, but our effort was too late for the fire jumped the 24 furrow guard and passed on out barnyard. The hay stack was soon afire, and our sheep and horses and a cow but lost a calf in the ensuing fire. The new farm dwelling was endangered but the piles of cellar clay did help to protect it. The fire did reach one part of the house but a few shovelfuls of clay extinguished it. The horses and the cow were held on the field of breaking South of the house. The fire raced Eastward but left a large area of prairie wool along the East side of our homestead. At near 10 p.m. the fire was backing up against the still high wind and we plowed a furrow to check the back-fire. This was the only area of native grass left for many miles around, and it was needed for stock feed. A hand scythe was used by us the first few days after the fire to give to each horse and to the cow, a bag full of hay. We lost a pile of oats, covered by a tent, some harness and parts; the poultry house and the stable. Around 10 p.m., the fire was burning towards the Touchwood Hills and the flickering lights were like a distant city. The fire was reported to have started at Mr. Christoff's farm and it caused many farmers to have a heavy loss. Mr. William Snow lost all his buildings except his dwelling. Others lost buildings and feed. Animal feed was at a premium and was hard to acquire, and much driving to get it.\nRe.
