We were mostly single young men and women in the community who helped each other before a farm was blessed with young families of marriages age.\nIn this way, the minister was sure of a good attendance. The people came on foot, on horseback, with wagons and buggies. One time I was to church, when a sleek team of Black Oxen came along pulling a wagon with 4 young men and a lady along.\n\nWhen we had a picnic, people came from all over the country sometimes from a distance of twenty miles.\n\nThe most travelling I did was when I worked on the Land Survey.

Mr. Belanger surveyed the Second Meridian and Base Line north of No. 40.\n\nWe used wagons when we could, in the bushy country we used pack horses. In swamps where we could use no horses at all, we had to pack it all on our own backs, and in winter we had each man a sleigh. When we started out these sleighs were loaded quite heavy as it was figured that each man had to load enough provision to last him till spring for pulling the instruments etc. We had a sled with 4 dogs.
