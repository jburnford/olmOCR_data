What year did you serve your first Christmas dinner in Western Canada? ...................... Give the menu. List those present and give their approximate ages at that time. Our first Christmas dinner was 1902. I came home from school @ Ouappelle for the holidays 40 miles from Wolseley by team & sleigh\u2014sitting on a box & hot feed oats, froze my nose and drove me\u2014walking behind the sleigh most of the way. We had our own roast turkey, veg. soup, vegetables, cranberry sauce, fruit pudding, mince pie, all kinds of candy, apples, oranges nuts, etc. We had in grand presents for all. In addition to our own family mother invited two bachelor neighbors (in their twenties) to share dinner. We had built our piano & had a lovely time. Mother was really an excellent cook. I never knew anyone could beat her pie\u2014lemon especially. Her recipe for it used milk not water yet I never excelled.\n\n19. Have you ever reduced to almost starvation level living on one or two locally produced foods? Give details. Never. We had excellent food always.\n\nThe only hazard we ever had was fuel shortage. Usually several neighbors went together for wood\u2014two trips taking 3 days. Once they were delayed by blizzards & mother had bed-in the last armful of wood & planned to go to bed early if they did not arrive. However, a young student minister knocked on the door asking to stay the night. He was on horseback & he went to the barn & removed a manger & cut it up. The men got home by daybreak. The coal was not hauled as winter set in early that year (1904) so they hauled back coal from Wolseley as they hauled the grain there. We always had excellent food.\nup all 1912 a great many foods were sold in bulk which was not available previously. Also were a terrible menace also mosquitoes nowadays they are practically a thing of past thanks to D.D.T.\n\n17. Give a typical dinner menu (breakfast, dinner, and supper) for the year 1912. Include the numbers of each item purchased.\n\nSummer - breakfast - grits - scrambled eggs - toast - butter - milk - cream\n\ndinner - game - vegetables - peas - ham - bread - butter - milk\n\nsupper - cold meat - vegetables - noodles - gravy - butter - milk\n\nRoast beef - vegetables (on own) baked apple - apple butter - milk\n\ncold beef - fried potatoes - pickles - apple butter - milk\n\n1903 my parents. We four girls 14 to 5, my mother 3, my half-brother Sutton who lived with us.\n\n18. What year did you serve your first Christmas dinner in western Kansas?\n\napproximately 1902\n\n19. How did you ever manage to almost starve to death living on one dollar a day? Give details.\n\nThe only hazard we ever had was fuel shortage. Usually our neighbors went together for wood - trip taking 3 days. Once they were delayed by sickness & mother had bill in the bank amount of wood & planned to go to bed early if they did not arrive. However a young student named Fernorch on the door asking to stay the night. He was on horseback & he went to the barn & removed a manager & old stove. The men returned by daylight. His case was well handled so winter aid in early fall. They hauled back coal from Weyburn as they hauled to the grain there. We always buy excellent food.\n20. Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\nThe food was better prepared then than now. Everything was given long slow cooking such as beans, tapioca, rice, roasts etc. Getting a meal was a rite that women took pride in - now its open a can or a package to hurry to catch the car or bus. There isn't nourishment in the modern food if it is far too dear for value received in nutrition. Cooking is an art not a sideline.\n\nModern meals include more raw salads such as carrot, cabbage also oranges & juices which are vitamin filled with food.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homestead and home prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible).\n\nNot until I left the farm to live alone in this village in 1945 when my children all married & I cannot cook anything in quantity just for one.\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include items not mentioned above, quality, methods of merchandising, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. [Use back of page if more space is needed].\n\nAbout 1906 when the railroad was here people began buying in quantity from J. Eaton Co Wfsg - sending as much as $100 for tea, coffee, jams, syrups etc.\n\nSince the World War II, farm people do not bake bread, make butter. Some even use canned milk. But lots of them ship cream nearly all around here keep their summer meat in deep freeze lockers & they also can lots of meat, vegetables & meats too.\nThe food was better prepared than ever before. Everything was grown long ago working much on beans, tomatoes, rice, carrots etc. Getting a meal was a real treat. Women would go out - now it's open a can or a package of broth powder in - now it's open a can or a package of beef broth in - now it's open a can or a package of canned meat. Everything was cooked and eaten without any waste.\n\nIn the modern board of directors, there was no clear plan for value received in nutrition. Everything was cooked and eaten without any waste.\n\nModern meals include more raw foods and vegetables instead of canned goods. (Give an example of how to make a healthy meal.)\n\n21. How did you feel about living alone in this small village in 1945 when my children all married?\n\n& I cannot cook anything myself for our family until I left the farm & live alone in this small village in 1945 when my children all married.\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries.\n\nAbout 1906 when the railroad was built, free people began buying in quantity from Y. E. Co. Wey - sending as much as $500 for tea, coffee, jam, syrup etc.\n\nSince the world war II, farm people do not take bread, make butter. Some even use canned milk. But lots of them ship cream nearly all around here keep their summer meal in deep freeze lockers & they also can lots of meat, vegetables & fruits etc.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jessylee/PioneerQuestionnairesPDFs//PioneerQuestionnaires_No.1-DietQuestionnaires_Box12936_1902_105.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 22, "total-input-tokens": 36520, "total-output-tokens": 6861, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 4], [0, 1808, 5], [1808, 2520, 6], [2520, 3994, 7], [3994, 5158, 8], [5158, 6805, 9], [6805, 8165, 10], [8165, 12418, 11], [12418, 12718, 12], [12718, 16631, 13], [16631, 18896, 14], [18896, 20123, 15], [20123, 20870, 16], [20870, 23509, 17], [23509, 25039, 18], [25039, 26679, 19], [26679, 28064, 20], [28064, 28064, 21], [28064, 28064, 22]], "primary_language": ["None", "None", "None", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "None", "None"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, true, false, true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]}}]
