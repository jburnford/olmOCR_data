Please add any other comments or experiences of buying groceries.\n\nIn early days we bought our large quantities of tea and coffee in tins travelling from 10 to 25 cents each. These articles were dry packed. I know they were Borson's brand. I know their price. I remember the prices. In 1918 we could get a range house well paid $3000. We paid rent in a 12 x 16 shack so that we lived in a room with a window.\nOxford\n\nNo. 613 S\n\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8\nOxford\n\nNo. 613 S\n\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jessylee/PioneerQuestionnairesPDFs//PioneerQuestionnaires_No.1-DietQuestionnaires_Box12940_1913_331.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 20, "total-input-tokens": 33200, "total-output-tokens": 4936, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 2], [0, 1529, 3], [1529, 2542, 4], [2542, 3684, 5], [3684, 4507, 6], [4507, 5775, 7], [5775, 6680, 8], [6680, 9205, 9], [9205, 9653, 10], [9653, 13187, 11], [13187, 13534, 12], [13534, 14790, 13], [14790, 15572, 14], [15572, 16870, 15], [16870, 17334, 16], [17334, 17668, 17], [17668, 18245, 18], [18245, 18400, 19], [18400, 18554, 20]], "primary_language": ["None", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]}}]
