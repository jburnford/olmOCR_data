We are able to get fresh bread here or more often, so we do quite often do so.\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include items not mentioned above, quality, methods of merchandising, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. (Use back of page if more space is needed).\n\nI might add when we were first married my husband dug a root cellar. We still have one and are able to keep vegetables fresh all winter. Have had turnips, parsnips, cabbages, beets, carrots, potatoes every year in the 40s. Also had a smoke house to smoke meats in early years. However, we do not do that of late years. We have always had a milk house with tank for ice where all dairy products could be kept in the summer.\n\nI feel we have been fortunate in these ways as I realize many throughout this district have not had those things the of late years. The greater percent are getting fridges and modern equipment.\n20. Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\nIn the earlier and earlier days we had no electricity or running water. We did have ice from the frozen well, but we also had to rely on home grown vegetables and fruits. We also had to rely on home grown flour and sugar. We did not have the convenience of modern appliances.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of home grown and home prepared foods?\n\nGenerally speaking, we still use home grown vegetables and fruits. However, in the early days, we also used to rely on purchased foods. We did not have the convenience of modern appliances.\n\n22.

Have Paul Turner's (name) cabbage rolls, carrots, potatoes every year. In the 40s, also had a little bit of meat. We always had a milk house that did not last long. We have always had a milk house with tame for our own dairy products until he kept in the summer.\n\nIf we have been fortunate in these ways so I realize many things over the decades here not had these things the 40s years.
