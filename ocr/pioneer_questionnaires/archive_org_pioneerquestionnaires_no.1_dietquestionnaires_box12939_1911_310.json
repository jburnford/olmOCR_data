This was a deep well from a spring. In 1918 we dug for a well for the stock & got a good well a half mile from building so then we moved & rebuilt where we had water for the stock & put in a cistern & filter for our own use & have had this ever since. It has always proved very satisfactory. It is deep up by pressure system & no handling of water only by taps.\n12. WATER SUPPLY\n\nThere did you get water for drinking and for cooking? (well, cistern, dugout). Would you get a well during World War II? If so, how far was this water from your house? How was it brought to the house? (pail, barrel, tank) How far was it from your house? (pail, barrel, tank)\n\nIn 1945 a well was dug in the yard, water was carried by hand.\n\nWe dug for a well for the stock, but a good well was not found.\n\nSo we used rain water for our own use, but water was also used for other purposes.\n\nWe filled from our own well, by agreement of the neighbors.\n13. SOAP\n\nDid you buy laundry soap or make your own? If you did, how?\n\nIf you made your own, did you use lye? If so, how much?\n\nWhat kinds of laundry soap did the grocer handle?\n\n14. FUEL\n\nWhat fuel did you use in the earliest days?\n\nWhere did you get your fuel?\n\nMention any changes in the use of fuels which have taken place since you first started housekeeping, giving dates where possible.\n\nStarted with a camp stove & stove burner which consisted of a barrel with a hole cut out of the end & a slide to drop over the hole after you put the stove in to burn, & from that to a heater when coal was available in 1915-16 now we burn coal oil for cooking & coal in the furnace as yet, we have not yet decided on oil as we feel it is too expensive & not very safe.\n\n15. METHODS OF COOKING AND TYPES OF UTENSILS\n\nFor cooking, did you use an indoor fireplace or open hearth in the earliest days? (Give dates)\n\nDid you use an outdoor fireplace or bake oven?

Altering?\n16. **WARRIORS AND CONTAINERS**\n\n   Mention any changes which you recall in the wrappings and containers received with the food purchased (give dates where possible).\n\n   Each bar of soap was packed in separate cardboard boxes (two bars). Tea was in bulk; coffee was in bags by the bulk. Soda was bulk, those usually kept the factory in barrels. Crochets were bought by the barrel even though syrup was sold by the barrel, my father in town run off some 80 lbs in the spring well. Neighbors helped them work hard day and night.\n\n   Butter was sold in tins, whereas meat and pickles were sold in barrel tins.\n\n17. Give a typical day's menu (breakfast, dinner, supper) for the earliest year you can remember. Give the year and list the members of the family with their ages at the time. State the approximate month, e.g., winter or summer.\n\n   Breakfast was always a hot porridge, sometimes a waffle, eggs, jam or toast as desired.\n\n   Dinner consisted of potatoes, meat, always once a day, veg of some kind, but no green veg only in summer from the garden.\n\n   There was always a dessert of some kind, it could be pie, rice, tapioca, plum pudding which was always a favorite.\n\n   Supper consisted of leftovers, fried potatoes, cold meat, pickles, applesauce with fruit or some cake of some sort. Milk was served 5 times a day for the children.\n\n18. What did you serve your first Christmas dinner in eastern Canada?\n\n   Give the menu. List those present and give their approximate ages at that time.\n\n   **House present**\n   - Uncle Jerry: 40 + 42\n   - Mother & Dad: 50 + 48\n   - Aunt: 45\n   - 7 Children ranging from 15 to 6 months\n\n   In 1913 or 1914, we ate our Christmas dinner until the dining room door was wide open, and the grass was green outside. It was so warm at June was here this year.\n\n19. Were you ever reduced to starvation level living on one or two locally produced foods? Give details.\n\n   No, I can't say we ever had starvation. It was very trying in the dry '30s (thirties), as there was 10 of us to eat around the table every meal. We had relief, of course, they allowed us 35 cents per meal for each child and adult. Can you imagine serving 36 meals on a $2.50 per day? Well, I did it, and I'll admit it was grim sometimes, but I had to conserve everything possible, and I never regretted the lessons my mother taught me on economy and management. I may say clothes were even worse than eats, as children do romp and tear. Continually wear out clothes $90 per year was our allotment! I think God was not in this day age or it would not buy their shoes today.\n20. Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\nI may say there is very little difference for me, as we learnt to be thrifty then. Those years 45/6 still took delight in preparing my own eggs, etc. I still prepare my own noodles & macaroni, make my own butter, etc., etc., etc. In our house, we had no luxuries, but we could feel the admiration of all my friends to nothing. We knew how to cook, and we did it ourselves. Perhaps it was not because they were so good, but that they knew that home-cooked food is better than packaged foods can produce.\n\nI'll admit it is easier cooking today if you cook from the shelf, but I don't let myself drift into the habit! Give me flour & I can make anyone a meal! And even the very rich would envy.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homemade and home-prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible).\n\nI just don't\u2014still buy my visions in 60\u00a2 bags. Make my own succotash, pickles, dills or sours, making my own chocolate, peppermint patties, etc. Can my own chickens, meet make our own sausage & clean the animals myself, render the lard & make soap from the crooklings. If the land is squeezed out of us, I have all my own home-made quilts & wool comforters from our own sheep, wool, washed, carded at all ourselves!\n\nSo you see, the time quite independent of the industrial life of our times, I don't spin or weave, but would like to learn even at my age as I feel it would be a very fascinating hobby.\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include items not mentioned above, quality, methods of merchandising, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. (Use back of page if more space is needed).\n\nI can never remember of shortages in the early years. There may have been shortages, quite unknown to us as we always have lived a very independent life, as I have explained & if we didn't happen to have a certain ingredient, we could always fix up the situation.\n\nIf there was not a veg in the house & had flour as I said, I could fix up a dinner that no one would go hungry or not enjoy. We would turn wiggy noodles, potato pancakes or a potato cake. Dumplings, noodles, etc., as we call it, & many more dishes just too numerous to mention here. They are so good in themselves that vegetables just take a back seat when they are served.\n\nPerhaps this is not the information you are looking for.\nI am never remebered of aborigines in the early years\n\nThere may of been shanty towns, quite unknown to us as we always thought we lived a very undemanding life as we have complained. If we did not happen to be in a certain ingredient, we could always find work.\n\nSituation:\n\nIf there was not a way in the house & food flour or y said, I could try to a dinner that no one would go hungry or not enjoy. We would turn living noodles.\n\nTo mention here they are so good in the middle of anything\n\ngood luck a fresh self when the case occurs.\n\npreserves this is not the information you are looking\nforward too, I am sorry I cannot give perhaps more what you would like to have.\nPerhaps some one else can. However if there should be any other information I could give I would be only too glad to do so.\n\nSincerely yours\n\nMrs H.
