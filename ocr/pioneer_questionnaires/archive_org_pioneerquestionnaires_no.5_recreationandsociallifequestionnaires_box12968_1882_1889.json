They had started out early in the morning for Indiana, where they had heard there was a good market for their horses. After several days' travel they had arrived at their destination, but instead of finding work, they found themselves in a difficult situation. They had no money and no place to stay. They decided to return home, but before they could do so, they were arrested by the police for vagrancy. They were taken to court and sentenced to six months in prison. They appealed to the courts, but their appeals were denied. They were finally released after serving their sentence.\n\nThe farmers were very concerned about their situation, and they decided to form an association to help them. They met with Mr. Williams, Mr. Dayman, Mr. Miller, Mr. Indian Head, Mr. Baldwin, John Miller, and others to discuss their problems. They agreed to work together and to find solutions to their difficulties. All the farmers were willing to help each other, and they worked hard to improve their situation.\nAbout the middle of the winter of 1900 Bill Mottawell (so call the house) then \nLester Hornor (the M.
