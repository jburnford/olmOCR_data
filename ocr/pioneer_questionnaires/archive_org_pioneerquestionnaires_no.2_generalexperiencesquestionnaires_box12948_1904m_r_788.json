Some of the questions here will not apply to your experiences; others may prove impossible for you to answer, so don't worry about leaving blank spaces. Use extra sheets of paper if there is not sufficient space to answer the questions. Don't hesitate to give details, or describe particular events, if they help to answer the questions.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1914, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer Diet: What Did Western Canadian Pioneers Eat?\" is still being circulated. If you have not already answered this, and would be willing to do so, please put a check mark here ( ) and one will be sent to you.\n\nSaskatchewan Archives questionnaires on other subjects will be prepared at a later date. Some of these are listed below. Please mark the ones you would be willing to answer.\n\n( ) All questionnaires\n( ) Pioneer health conditions\n( ) Pioneer social life, sports and recreation\n( ) Pioneer housing\n( ) Pioneer education and churchwork\n( ) Pioneer farming experience\n\nPreservation of Questionnaires\n\nAll questionnaires will be preserved in the Saskatchewan Archives Board's Office at the University of Saskatchewan as part of the permanent record of our Province.

We bought our combine three years ago. But had a car and truck previous to that\u2014It used to be all hand\u2014a threshing in the early days.\n\n38. How did the places in your community get their names? (School districts, Post offices, villages, railway stations, creeks, hills, etc.).

Yes.\n\n(2) be willing to present them to the Archives Division of the Legislative Library, Regina, or the Archives Office at the University in Saskatoon? Yes.\n\n(Indicate your preference, if any).
