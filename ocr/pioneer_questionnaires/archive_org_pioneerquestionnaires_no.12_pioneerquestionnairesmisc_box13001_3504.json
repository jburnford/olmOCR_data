Again when I was about 7 years old I went out in holidays with my older brother when he was drag harvesting. As about 10:30 AM on a hot day we would turn around about halfway up the field when our father asked us why we said we didn't get hungry, then we would finish the other after dinner.

When we first went from Brandon, there was a great deal of excitement. We were very young then, and all the people we knew from our own town. And all the things we heard about the family, I could not believe.\n\nThe house we lived in was very small, but my parents were very kind to us. They always made sure we had enough food and clothes. We went to school every day, and my father taught me how to read and write.\n\nWe also had a garden where we grew vegetables and fruits. It was very productive, and we always had plenty to eat.\n\nOne day, we decided to go on a trip to see the countryside. We took a train and traveled for several hours. It was very exciting, and we saw many interesting things along the way.\n\nWhen we arrived at our destination, we were very tired, but we were happy to be there. We stayed for a few days and visited many places.\n\nOn our last day, we said goodbye to everyone and returned home. It was a wonderful trip, and we will always remember it.\nThe family went from London. Then to Australia.\n\nWhen we landed in the country, we were all together.\n\nWe were then in the family. We had a house and land.\n\nThe first year was the hardest. We had a hard time.\n\nWe traveled on foot. Our brothers could not go out.\n\nHe helped them hunt the black bears. It was hard work.\n\nIt was nearly living in a shack. We had to work two days.\n\nWe lived in Greenfield, or was just off the road.\n\nWe had to work all day. We had to go to work.\n\nThen finally we moved. And my father took to Buffaloes.\n\nBut they were hard to catch. They would run away.\n\nWe would catch them and would be very happy.\n\nThe hello! How times have changed. How things have changed.\n\nAnd then we came to a place where they were friendly.\n\nIn the old days, when they were savage, they were very cruel.\n\nAbout 1870, the savages were very cruel.\nWe ended the day at the Pearl City Hotel. The family of Mr. Petersen held us in high regard. We visited their residence and had a delightful visit.\n\nThe next morning we returned to Mount Carmel Church where we heard a very moving message. It was a time of great spiritual renewal and inspiration.\n\nAfter lunch, we visited the Muir National Monument. The natural beauty was breathtaking.\n\nAs we left the area, we stopped at a nice restaurant for dinner. It was a wonderful meal, and we enjoyed each other's company.\n\nBefore heading home, we stopped at the visitor center to purchase some souvenirs.\n\nIt was a wonderful trip, and we are grateful for the opportunity to be able to visit such a beautiful place.\nThe sleigh. But they wanted the meat to them. But my feet they said no they would just go to work. And he was sure they would not go. They heard the dogs bark and they heard the dogs bark. We had a couple of dogs and I walked to look and went to meet the dogs. When we got back and took off different ways, after that we generally carried a flashlight if we were coming home late at night. You if a wolf came near we carry our meat. You if a wolf came near when we were also when we were there. There was a house by the time we got there one cent a tail. So we got home time got plenty and shipped the tails. To get our things to a little joke here one day. We were taking them to town made money. He said. We were taking them to town and put the tails in and let them hang. Another tail. Back again a couple of hours. Back and then was back. Back and we went to try and find some over my head. We saw one in a field under my head. A badge. He said. When he saw it the school was man was calling. He said. He said a badge or what was it was was he was far from the east and you see he was out of them. Hope you can make a few odd note out of all.\nThe sleigh party wanted to throw the meat at them, but my father said no, they would not eat it in worse, and he was sure they would not eat it in the yellow dog. But time had a couple of dogs there, and they heard the sleigh bells, and started to bark. We went to meet the sleigh to within about 300 yards from where it was, and the woods turned back and forth off different ways, after that we generally carried a flashlight, if we were coming home late at night. If we didn't want anything and meant you of a wolf, sometimes he would come near when it was dark.\n\nAlso when we were young, there was a lot of goatherds, and their dogs would bark all the time. We got one cent a tail, so we got our money to get a little for the house. Dad said he was going to get a little for the house. The man was taken the tail off the fellow's small money, killing them and taking them to prison and not killing them and taking them to prison.\n\nAnd then was Backer, a couple of Buffaloes and his friend, my buck, and we were for a long time came over my house, when he saw the thought of a badge. He saw one in a picture window, and said, \"Man was killed by a Buffalo or what was it?\" To see how good they were, I thought.\n\nHope you can make it. Paul added parts not of all.\nThe story goes that they wanted to throw the meat out to them, but my father said no, they were told just go away, and he was sure they would not take it.\n\nThe fellow who had a couple of goats dropped them, and they heard the always help, and wanted to take what they went to meet the day.\n\nAnd the words, turned back, and took off different ways, after that we generally carried a shotgun, if we were coming down late at night, afraid of anything.\n\nWe were coming down late at night, afraid of anything, and we were coming near where we were.\n\nWhen we were leaving them, there was a lot of goatherds, and there was a friend for three times.\n\nWe got the one cent a tail, the next time we got plenty and shipped the tails to pay our money.\n\nA little for the saddles, taken the tails off the saddles, small money, the saddles, and getting them to pay, and not shipping them, and getting another tail.\n\nAnd then was back, a couple of tails, and they came, and they were back, and we were in a place where we could get a badge.\n\nIt was a badge, when he saw it, he thought it was a badge, that a badge or what.\n\nTo see her, he was just from the eastward.\n\nHope you can make a few old parts of all.\nOxford\n\nNo. 613 S\n\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8\nOxford\n\nNo. 613 S\n\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1MS", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jessylee/PioneerQuestionnairesPDFs//PioneerQuestionnaires_No.12-PioneerQuestionnairesMisc_Box13001_3504.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 34, "total-input-tokens": 56440, "total-output-tokens": 6770, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 4], [0, 1173, 5], [1173, 2316, 6], [2316, 3104, 7], [3104, 3961, 8], [3961, 4884, 9], [4884, 5921, 10], [5921, 6776, 11], [6776, 7530, 12], [7530, 8153, 13], [8153, 8839, 14], [8839, 9533, 15], [9533, 10162, 16], [10162, 10813, 17], [10813, 11594, 18], [11594, 12193, 19], [12193, 12193, 20], [12193, 13534, 21], [13534, 15983, 22], [15983, 15983, 23], [15983, 18167, 24], [18167, 19155, 25], [19155, 20005, 26], [20005, 20005, 27], [20005, 20713, 28], [20713, 21860, 29], [21860, 21860, 30], [21860, 23124, 31], [23124, 24317, 32], [24317, 24472, 33], [24472, 24626, 34]], "primary_language": ["None", "None", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false, true, true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]}}]
