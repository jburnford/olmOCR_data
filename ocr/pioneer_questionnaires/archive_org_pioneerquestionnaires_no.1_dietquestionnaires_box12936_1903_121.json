More salted meats were used in summer especially. Children's appetites were not so finicky as now. If you don't eat, someone else will, that's it.

When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homestead and home prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible).\n\nSince 1912, I have reared a family of nine children, on our original \u00bc sec. my husband's homestead.

Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Eastern Canada.

Then the railroad came thru later that year, + we had several stores near. Butter + eggs were given in trade for the weeks groceries - when they could be spared. Crockery was much used for butter packing + the pork was brined in barrels. In winter Beef was hung by the quarter + frozen, also cut up + frozen. Fish was purchased at 4c a lb frozen - from settlers or Indians that went north to fish. Quality of foods was very good - but not so refined + handled in larger bulk than at present. Matches were made of sulphur - that really fizzed + choked you when lit.\n20. Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the early days as compared to today.\n\nHomemade bread was the first meal cooked for breakfast. As the weather got colder, we also had pancakes and hotcakes. Potatoes were used extensively in the winter months. Children often helped with the cooking, especially when there were no adults around.\n\nIf you don't eat some other way, then it's hard to believe how much our lives have changed over the years.\n\nSince 1973, I have raised a family of nine children on our own land. We could never afford to buy prepared foods, so we relied on our own grown fruits, vegetables, and meat products. Only three times did we buy packaged foods or soups, etc., for a little extra meat in summer.\n\n21. What changes occurred in the consumption of food during your lifetime?\n\nIn the early days, people ate mostly what they grew themselves. Today, we rely on processed foods and convenience items. The variety of foods available has increased dramatically.\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and earlier foods in other ways, including plans for the future.\n\nIn the early days, people bought their groceries at local stores. Today, we rely on supermarkets and convenience stores for our food needs.\n\nIn 1905, there was a local store where most needed groceries were purchased within five miles of us. Then the railroad came through, and we began to buy our groceries from larger stores. The quality of food improved significantly, and we could buy fresh produce year-round.\n\nBeef was always a favorite, and we would often buy it by the quarter. Fish was purchased at the market, and we would freeze it for later use.\n\nThe quality of food was very good, but not as refined as it is today. Matches were made of sulphur, which really burned and smelled.\n20.

Bread Powder (unbleached) + 3am. water = white flour substitute\n2. Also Pancake + Egg Yolks, Flour + 3 am. water = meal\u2014hot too much cooking of any kind wastes\n   more valuable nutrients used in our diets.\n3.
