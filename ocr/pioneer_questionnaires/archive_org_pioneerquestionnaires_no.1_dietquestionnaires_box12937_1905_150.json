Were you ever reduced to almost starvation level living on one or two locally produced foods? Give details.\n\nNo, my grandparents came well provided with dried stuff galore - grandfather had planted 100 potatoes in June - and from the next spring on Grandmother Kerns supplied all the bachelors and many families with garden stuff and flowers. The poppies in the Mennonite reserves mostly came from seed they begged from grandma who had a square of them gathering at one time. Remember, I remember the quaintly clothed women in our garden exclaiming!\n17. What year did you serve your first Christmas dinner in Western Canada? Give details. List those present and give their approximate ages at the time.\n\n18. Were you ever reduced to almost starvation levels living on one or two locally grown foods? Give details. No, my grandparents had planted all the food we needed and we had a good garden.\n\n19. How did you make do without electricity?\n\n20. What was your favorite childhood memory?\n20. Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\nGrandma chopped her vegetables in an old wooden bowl I remember - and I was only a tot when it became my job. She often spoke of her horror of the \"cow chips\" and we never had toast until I was a big girl, except toasted on top, for someone else. She saw someone roast toasting over hot \"cow chip coals\" and that finished it. The \"oven thermometer\" was her hand. I never did master that! Many things had to be soaked.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homegrown and home prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible).\n\nIn 1907 after we moved into Swift Current, but we grew all our vegetables in the town garden until 1934.\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include items not mentioned above, quality, methods of merchandising, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. (Use back of page if more space is needed).\n\nRemember chewing gum when I was 4. \"Tutti Frutti\" in a single \"slab\", and in 1909 \"Violet chips\" came in small purple tin boxes (I still have one!). I remember the hard candies - and at Xmas the long strips of candy \"beads\" in grocer's windows (in the dust!) There were flat candies (not very tasty!) with silly verses and mottoes on them. In 1909 there were \"bull's eyes\" huge white things with green rings on them and a cardamom seed in the centre. If you ever reached it because the teacher usually got it - either selling the lump.\n20. Mention any interesting differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\n21. Did you learn to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homegrown and home prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible.)\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include items not mentioned above, quality methods of merchandising, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. (Use back of page if more space is needed.)\n\n\"Jellies,\" \"Fruit\" in a large \"slosh\" and \"Winter chips\" (gum in small purple tin boxes [gosh have one]). I purchased the hard candies and at times the long shining \"card\" beads in grocers windows (the other) Five very flat cardios (not very tasty.) During really freezes and molasses for them in 1909 there were \"full eyes\" shape in what they call with good recipes on them and a can hammon seed in the centre. If you ever wanted it because the teacher obviously got it - under seeing the lump\nin your chest - or it rolled on the floor out of your desk at school. We used to trade \"sucko\"!! Also there were huge black \"jaw breakers\" and bright red, hot cinnamon candies. Horsehore candy and licorice (the sour stuff!) was a standby. Remember peppermints in 1912. There were \"chocolate drops\" in bulk in 1905-06. There was popcorn with elaborate Japanese tops in in 1909, I remember, also jelly beans about that time, and candy-coated peanuts. I don't remember jujubes until about 1914. Baker's chocolate had a picture of two monkeys - one pulling the other's tail until it bled! Water softener was \"Long Tom washing soda.\" - toilet soap was transparent, highly colored and scented by 1911 - either \"Pears\" - or \"Granum.\" Up till 1914 and beyond \"Fairy Soap\" - It floats! Currants were almost as much sand as fruit - and raisins had to be seeded. I hated the sticky job! Grandma never had a cream separator she skimmed by hand as long as we were on the farm 1905 - 1907. She made butter in a dasher churn. Salt Valvap baked in the salt cellar! Mustard was homemade - and hot! Oysters frozen were cheap enough to serve every Sunday in winter when frozen. We made a huge root house on the farm for storage, and it was full. But grandmother often spoke of how \"helpless\" her neighbors were, and how she gave away many times as much as she used, because others couldn't make a garden grow.\"\nOur dear chum - we visited on the floor\nout by your feet! It also where we met\nour dear friend, and thought about\nhim. We missed him so much.\n\n1912 - Our new cottage was built in\nJune.
