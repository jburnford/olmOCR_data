Toppings Jane (Mrs. William H.)\nPIONEER EXPERIENCES: A GENERAL QUESTIONNAIRE\n\nA word of explanation to the person answering this questionnaire:\n\nIt is difficult to express a general questionnaire on pioneer life because no individual who is asked to answer it has exactly the same experiences as another. Some of the questions here will not apply to your experience; others may prove impossible for you to answer, so don\u2019t worry about leaving blank spaces. Use every space at your disposal, even if there is not sufficient space to answer the question. Don\u2019t hesitate to give details, or describe particular events, if they help to answer the questions.\n\nThe questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in eastern Canada before 1875, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questions:\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \u201cPioneer Past and Present Canadian Pioneers East\u201d is still being circulated. If you have not already answered this, and would be willing to do so, please put a check mark here ( ).\n\nPioneer conditions\nPioneer social life, sports and recreation\nPioneer housing\nPioneer adaptation and craftwork\nPioneer farming experience\n\nAll Questions\n\nPreservation of Questionnaires\n\nAll questionnaires will be preserved in the Saskatchewan Archives Office, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Sask.\n\nProvince.
