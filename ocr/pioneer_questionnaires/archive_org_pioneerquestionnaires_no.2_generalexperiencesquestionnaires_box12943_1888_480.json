Some of the questions here will not apply to your experience; others may not apply to anyone else's experience. Others may require more than one answer.\n\nIf more than one answer applies, please list them in order of importance.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who have lived in Western Canada before 1911, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires:\n\nWestern Canadian Pioneers' Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer List: What Did You Answer This?\" and would you be willing to do so? If you have not already answered this, and would you be willing to do so? Please put a check mark here and one will be sent to you.\n\nSaskatchewan Archives questionnaires on other subjects will be prepared at a later date. Some of these are listed below. Please mark the ones you would be willing to answer.\n\nAll questionnaires:\n\n- Pioneer health conditions\n- Pioneer social life, sports and recreation\n- Pioneer housing\n- Pioneer education and churchwork\n- Pioneer farming experience\n\nPreservation of Questionnaires:\n\nAll questionnaires will be preserved in the Saskatchewan Archives Board Office at the University of Saskatchewan as part of the permanent Provincial Archives.
