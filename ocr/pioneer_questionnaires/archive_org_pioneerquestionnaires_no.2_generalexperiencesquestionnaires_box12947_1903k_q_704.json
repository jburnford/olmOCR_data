Kemsley (Mrs. John Richard)\nDear Sir,\n\nI have tried to answer your questions to the best of my memory, but I have kept two souvenir books of the churches & how they were built there were no churches in cracks when we got there but one or two were built the next year, also the souvenir of the old town, it was wonderful how the town grew up in a few years. Of course everyone coming in would lend a willing hand & when there is cooperation there is unity & things get done. When we first got to cracks I thought the prairie looked like the ocean, never a house or a tree except just the few buildings in town.\n\nThe prairie fires were bad every spring & fall till the land got broken up. My husband, myself & our two boys had to fight prairie fires for 7 years, even after we moved out to the homestead, May 29, 1907.\n\nThe road across Squaw Creek was blocked with snow so we had to make a trail 3 mile north & come along the valley bottom. That ride I never will forget there were millions of mosquitoes every time the ocean moved their feet through the long grass & scrub. I had my little 8 year old girl with me in the wagon trying to protect her from those pests. I decided there then if those were some of the things we had to face life was not worth living by two boys, their father kept saying cheer up we will soon be there not far from the top of the valley only 3 mile but I thought it was a pretty long 3 mile. Then after we finally got home...\nDear Sir,\n\nI have tried to answer the question in the best way I can. You two\n\nwere born in the church, so they were\n\nlucky there that you or two were built the next year.\n\nI also wonder what you did then? You\n\nwere over there for a few years. You\n\nwere working like the ocean, over a house or a tree\n\nfor a few years. You were there for a few years.\n\nThe road across quarry creek was broken\n\nsouth from us we had to make a trail\n\n3 miles north to come along the valley bottom\n\nthat ride I never will forget there were\n\nmillions of mosquitoes every time the open\n\nmoved their feet through the long grass.\n\nOn the way back, I met my friend with\n\nthree pugs, I decided where I was going to go.\n\nThen we went down by two boys' house\n\nfather kept saying \"Come up we will soon be\n\nthere not far from the top of the valley only\n\n3 mile today it took us over a pretty big\n\n3 mile. Then after we nearly got home\njust a few of a mile there was another deep slough to go through & when we got to the middle those ovens decided to stop. The water coming up through the floor of the wagon, did not look so good to me. We had a crate of ducks, as soon as they saw the water they tried their hardest to break out of the crate, so we covered them over but such chorus of squack, I had never heard, but ducks are like ocean, they like water, well after a while one of our boys took some shots off I got into the slough & led those ovens out.\n\nThat was my first ride behind ovens and thought it would be my last\u2014however we finally got to our house which looked a real refuge to me after that trip, then there was no water for they had not yet got a well. Dad says to our brother you will have to drink slough water it's clear oh yes after I had strained the wrigglers out of it they do say one can drink slough water if they are real thirsty then I thought of the poor fellows on the desert how glad they would be to see even slough water what was the end of my day going out to the Homestead, only Henry seemed to be getting settled till our Kemsley started to plow a piece for garden with the ovens there was a slough at the end & the ovens were really good till they saw the water then they started off on the gallop right into the middle of that Deep Slough.\nAnd so we came to the end of our journey. We had walked for many miles, through fields and forests, over hills and valleys. The sun was setting behind us, casting long shadows across the landscape. We were tired but happy, knowing that we had accomplished what we set out to do.\n\nAs we sat down to rest, we looked back at the path we had traveled. It was a difficult journey, filled with challenges and obstacles. But we had faced them all, and emerged stronger because of it.\n\nWe knew that there would be more adventures ahead of us, and we were excited to see what they would bring. For now, though, we were content to simply sit and enjoy the peacefulness of the moment.\n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, we knew that it was time to say goodbye. We stood up and bid farewell to each other, promising to meet again soon.\n\nAnd so we parted ways, each going off in our own direction. But we knew that we would always be connected by the memories of our journey together.\nTaking our Remsley, slow right in with them water wards high I wondered what had happened when Mr. K came up the house and asked me for his gun. I looked at him in amazement and thinking he had lost his mind, he was really angry said he was going to shoot those ovens, however I said never mind the gun get into some dry clothes, then you will feel better. Afterwards he said I will sell those ovens to the quiet man that comes along but I knew he would not do that because he thought too much of them did not like me to say anything about them. I am sorry I have not got the snapshot of that time they really were large. Doyle, the next year he bought two more, the following two more that made six, that was the way our farm got broken long ago late & early but that's the way I've been seen.\n\nNow here is where I must stop not forgetting to tell you we spent many hard & many happy years on the old farm in the Cralie District. I hope some information may be of use.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJim John R. Remsley\n3343 Maplewood Rd\nVictoria\nDear John R. Kennedy,\n\nI am writing to you from Victoria, where I have been spending my holidays. It has been a wonderful time, and I hope you are enjoying yours as well.\n\nThe weather here has been quite pleasant, and we have been able to spend a lot of time outdoors. The old farm in the Galt district is still very much in my thoughts, and I often find myself reminiscing about the good times we had there.\n\nI am looking forward to seeing you soon, and I hope you will be able to visit me here. It would be a great opportunity to catch up on all the news.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n3343 Maplewood Rd\nVictoria\nSASKATCHEWAN ARCHIVES QUESTIONNAIRES\n\nNo. 2\n\nPIONEER EXPERIENCES: A GENERAL QUESTIONNAIRE\n\nA word of explanation to the person answering this questionnaire\n\nIt is difficult to prepare a general questionnaire on pioneer life because no individual who is asked to answer it has exactly the same experiences as another.
