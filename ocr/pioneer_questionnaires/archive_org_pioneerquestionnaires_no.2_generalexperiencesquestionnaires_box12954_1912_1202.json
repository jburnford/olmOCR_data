Some of the questions here will not apply to your experiences; others may prove impossible for you to answer, so don't worry about leaving blank spaces. Use extra sheets of paper if there is not sufficient space to answer the questions. Don't hesitate to give details, or describe particular events, if they help to answer the questions.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1914, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer Diet: What Did Western Canadian Pioneers Eat?\" is still being circulated.

They called the hamlet Birdview. There was no station when I built my general store in 1912. I took over the post office and moved it into the hamlet.\n\nDue to the confusing of the names Birdview, Bridgview, Brookview, the post office department advised me change the name and suggested I send three names which I did and they chose DONAVON. Here is how I got the name. I spend a year attending business college in Stratford, Ont., and there is a lovely little stream, which the city has improved, running through the city called the Avon. And there is the river Don running in to lake Ontario at Toronto. So I joined the two which made DONAVON. The first name Birdview was called after the first postmaster's wife whose first name was Birdie. He was W.D. Pattison whose farm was 3/4 mile from the site.\n39.
