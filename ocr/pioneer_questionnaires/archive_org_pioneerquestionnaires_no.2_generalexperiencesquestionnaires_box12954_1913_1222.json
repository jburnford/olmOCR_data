Some of the questions here will not apply to everyone; others may prove impossible for you to answer, or do not refer to your experiences at all. You should therefore be prepared to leave blank spaces to answer the questions.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1914, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of this pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nSaskatchewan Archives questionnaires which have been prepared or projected are listed below. Please mark the ones you would be willing to answer:\n\n( ) All questionnaires\n( ) Pioneer diet\n( ) Pioneer schools\n( ) Pioneer churches and social life\n( ) Pioneer recreation and experiences\n( ) Folklore in Saskatchewan\n( ) Pioneer health and housing\n\nPreservation of Questionnaires\n\nAll questionnaires will be preserved in the Office of the Saskatchewan Archives at the University of Saskatchewan as part of the permanent record of our Province.
