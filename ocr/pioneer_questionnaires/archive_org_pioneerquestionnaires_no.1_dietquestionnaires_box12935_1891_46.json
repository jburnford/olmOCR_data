Some people obtained the chickens and just used the breast and perhaps legs but my mother always pickled them, stuffed them and cooked them with a slip of fat pork tied on each side of the breast and they were really splendid, and never tired of them.\n\nStoring vegetables was always a problem. Potatoes would have to be packed and a couple of times before spring and nothing else packed out also sprouts excepted. But potatoes usually kept well and cabbages would usually get soft about February. Carrots usually kept fairly well but tubers were hazardous.\n20. Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\nThis is a list of my list.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homestead and home prepared foods?
