E.E. Gray, 101-27th St., Saskatoon, Sask.\nElrose\n\nElrose was known originally as La Berge, after Albert La Berge who was a pioneer farmer here and who operated on a large scale. The question of changing or not changing the name came up at a meeting of the people in the late fall of 1913, and a Louis Chibert, who was in the building and contracting business at the time, suggested Elrose and this was favored by the majority and accepted by the C.M.R. The coming of steel in 1912 speeded up the growth of the little burg and establishment have continued to expand to this day. The first train came in 1913.\n\nThe first settlers were all squatted on the area east of the present site (what is now No 4 Highway east of town) when the C.M.R. surveyed they chose the present location and they all moved. It was an spectacular race for first rate business locations for those who got the first rate business locations through Elrose and Highway No 44 is 1/2 mile north of Elrose.\n\nAbove is information spot from old timers here.\n\nJ.E.C.\nElmo\n\nElmo was founded by Mr. Albert de Ruyter who came to Texas from France. He bought land and built a house in 1893.\n\nThe name came up at a meeting of the building committee who were in the building and contracting business. The name was suggested by Elmo and the name was accepted by the C.M.R. Railroad Company in 1912.\n\nThe original townsite was located near the railroad tracks. The town was incorporated in 1913.\n\nThe first settlers were Mr. and Mrs. Smith. They came from Illinois. They arrived in Elmo in 1914.\n\nThey moved into the present location and they built their homes there.
