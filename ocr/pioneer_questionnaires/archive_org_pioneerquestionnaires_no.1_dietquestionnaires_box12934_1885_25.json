WRAPPINGS AND CONTAINERS\n\nMention any changes which you recall in the wrappings and containers received with the food you purchased (give dates where possible).\n\nWe did not notice when the fancy goods first appeared, being as far from stores & not accustomed to anything except what was absolutely necessary.\n\n17. Give a typical day's menu (breakfast, dinner & supper) for the earliest year you can remember. Give the year and list the members of the family with their ages at the time. State the approximate month, e.g., winter or summer.\n\nBreakfast: Porridge, bread & butter, sometimes syrup for the youngest & bacon & eggs for the working boys, same at noon except when we could get game or fresh killed hams in season. Winter time we enjoyed hot pancakes for the night meal. We also had soup once a day, vegetable or split peas, bailed with a piece of salt pork & onions.\n\n18. What year did you serve your first Christmas dinner in eastern Canada? Give the menu. List those present and give their approximate ages at that time.\n\nIn the year 1886, there was father & mother, my fianc\u00e9 Frank Gordon, Ruthie Napoleon, Mildred Virginia Erica, Victoria, Almina & baby Frederic. At this age, we had roast pork & chicken with onion gravy, a large plum pudding made from the directions brought from England by Frank; it had to boil for 6 hours steady. We had doughnuts & raisin pies at other meals.\n\n19. Were you ever reduced to almost starvation level living on one or two locally produced foods? Give details.\n\nOnly once, when father had waited too long to go for groceries, no bread or flour for a whole day, we boiled washed wheat for hours, but the grains didn't soften as our spring water was acidic & we didn't know how to soften it safely. Being out of oatmeal, beans, split peas, or rice, it was a pretty dreary day, till father arrived with the flour, then we had hot pancakes. Our main meal for Sundays was baked beans. My mother had a sore shoulder & she depended on me, her oldest girl, when baking bread, to work the dough & general house work. When I married in 1887, my sisters took my place, while my life took a sudden change in many different places, far less comfort.\nWe did not meet within the family circle\nbut appeared deriving no benefit from it.\nNor was a connection to anything established\nabsolutely necessary.\n\n17. Give a typical day's menu (breakfast, dinner & supper) for the earliest\nyear you can remember. Give the year and list the members of the family\nwith their ages at the time. Also the approximate month, e.g., \"winter.\"\n\nBarley porridge, bread & butter, sometimes\nagrup for the young & old & bacon & eggs for the\nmorning breakfast, then at noon, acclimatised, we cooked\nour game or fresh killed hares in rumour, whilst\nwe also had dumplings, a dish of vegetables or split peas\nhardly worth a knife of old hearty brown\n\nThat year did you serve our Christmas dinner in eastern Canada?\n\nIn the year 1852 there were further changes. My family\nFrancis Gordon, Robert Macpherson & Bridie McPherson, Erica,\nQuinlan, Almina & John Macdonald, all residing in the village\nhad vast quantities of chickens, no longer grown in the large\nkitchen by Frank, but fed to the chickens bought from\nEngland by Frank, it had to be fed for 6 hours daily, we had\nno flour & rice, hence at that time.\n\nOnly once, when father had visited us for a long time for\ngroceries, he brought on flour for a whole day, we baked\nwednesday without any worry, but the grains didn't stick\nhow to soften it properly. Being out of oatmeal, beans\nwere a nice, it was a pretty dreary day till\nfather arrived with his flour, then we had that happiness.\n\nOur main meal for 20 years was oatmeal baked beans\nmy mother had a new\u82b1\u6837 she depended on one her\noldest girl, when looking back, I wonder the church service\nwould have been different if I remained in 1853 my life in each\nplace, while my life with a child, while the\ndifferent places for two centuries\n20. Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\nNow we have a fine range which cooks beef much better. Doesn't burn it. We also have a roast, & the heavy aluminum saucepan for hot meat. Sometimes when in a hurry we use canned soups, canned tomatoes, Baked beans, Pears in jars, canned green peas & canned fruits, cookies, soda biscuits which can all be bought in our local store in our village. Fresh fruit in season, also lettuce, cucumbers, early cabbage etc.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homegrown and home prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible).\n\nWhen father & mother died in 1909 & 10 they had not changed in their way of living. Being pioneers from old Quebec they knew how to make the best of what they had & did not change their economic ways of preparing meals except for tomato catsup & home made pickles all the year round. There was no change.\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada.

(Use back of page if more space is needed).\n\nAfter I was married we lived for 8 years on a reserve at Fort Billy. It was impossible to buy potatoes from the Indians as they had no cellars. In 1885 we arrived in an old school house-kitchen in a wagon. For 3 months I had to use the open chimney method of baking barbecues in front of hot coals. Potatoes were cooked in an open kettle hanging on an iron bar above the fire. Very few people had cans, until we bought one in 1889. The babies had a poor chance except from mother's milk, until a year old, including oatmeal porridge & mashed potatoes from our own garden patches that first summer, when the oldest - 2 years old - got some complaint & fed him boiled rice, & that cured him. No problem, no canned milk even, at the Hard Rock Bay.\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of home grown and home preserved foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible).\n\nWhen I was a child in 1909-1910 they had not changed our way of living. Being honest from my parents they knew how to make the best of what they had. We did not change their economic ways of preparing meals. But by then tomatoes, citrus, melons, pickles all the year around, there was no orange.\n\n22. After I was married we lived less than 8 years on a farm brown the influence as they had no cellar. In 1888 for 3 months I had to use the open chimney method of taking a smoke in front of hot coals. Pudding was cooked in an open kettle hanging on an iron bar above the fire. Very few people had a stove, chances except from family until after 1910 including actual knowledge of canned potatoes from own garden. Hates that first summer when the soil was too wet and the corn plants had been killed with that kind of rain.\n\nNo problem, just canned a quilt soon at the Hardwood Bay\n20. Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\nNow we have a fine range which cooks bread much better, doesn't burn it. We also have a toaster, the heavy aluminum saucepan for fast heat. Sometimes when in a hurry we use canned soups, canned tomatoes, baked beans, canned tomatoes, canned peas & canned fruits, cookies, soda biscuits which can all be bought in our local store in our village. Fresh butternut squash, also lettuce, cucumbers, early cabbage etc.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homegrown and home prepared foods?

(Use back of page if more space is needed).\n\nAfter I was married we lived for 3 years on a homestead at Fort Riley, it was impossible to buy potatoes from the Indians as they had no allies. In 1886 we arrived in an old school house-kitchen in a wagon. For 3 months I had to use the open chimney method of baking bannocks in front of hot coals. Potatoes were cooked in an open kettle hanging on an iron bar above the fire. Very few people had cows, until we bought one in 1889. The babies had a poor chance except from onions, milks, until a year old, including oatmeal porridge & mashed potatoes from our own garden patch that first summer. When the baby - 2 years old - got sick, complaints fed him boiled rice, & that cured him. No pellagra, no cancer, until seven, at the Red River Bay.\nWhen I was a child in the early days of the 20th century, my family lived in a small town called Smithville. We had a large garden where we grew vegetables and fruits. We also raised chickens and kept bees.\n\nOne day, while I was out gathering firewood, I heard a loud noise coming from the woods. I ran back home and told my parents about it. They said it was just a bear, but I was still scared.\n\nThe next day, we went to the woods again and found a bear's paw print in the snow. We were very excited and decided to tell everyone about it.\n\nThat night, we heard a loud roar coming from the woods. We knew it was the bear, so we quickly gathered our belongings and left the house.\n\nWe walked for hours until we reached a nearby town. We knocked on the door of a kind stranger who let us stay in his house for the night.\n\nIn the morning, we continued our journey and eventually arrived at our destination. We were very grateful to have made it safely.\n\nThis experience taught me the importance of being prepared and staying calm in dangerous situations. It also reminded me of the beauty of nature and the importance of respecting animals.\n\nI hope you enjoyed reading my story. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me!\nstore 6 miles away, we bought butter & bacon which had been laying around such a long time that it was yellow colored as if smoked. Once in a long while the man would shoot a rabbit or prairie chicken & that was a real treat for us all. We did without eggs or chickens as the mothers didn't keep any hens when we bought a cow, we had no way of getting the milk for the cream to rise, except an old shed; the nights being cool we managed to get butter off of a sort. In 1882 we moved to the Sioux Reserve, store at Fort Macleod had better provisions, & I managed to buy a few hens from the Indians, they were barred Rockers, from then on I always raised chickens from that breed. In 1896 we left the school teaching job & bought 2 quarter sections already improved, 20 acres corn, fallows 20 acres stables, which had to be seeded by hand, we borrowed a binder to cut off the crop of wheat etc., the machine which threshed it, was a steam outfit but it needed 18 men to run it, the grain being stacked, when the rain came with a strong wind, part of the stacks were broken & had to spread out to dry mean while I was feeding gang, I'd boil a large plump pot dinner & reasons were cheap, spices & sugar also, & it didn't take as much time to prepare as cooking was now, I had 5 children then the eldest 8 & the youngest 9 months, milked the cows, carried the milk can to an old well, churned & sold butter & eggs to help out.\n\nI am now 80 years of age & live in the village of St. Hubert as we keep the rural P.O., I'm still on the go!

We did without\neggs or chickens as the money didn't keep very keen the\nwe bought a cow not had our way of getting the milk for\nthe cream to nine except an old dish; she might be burying\nwe'd not encouraged to get butter off a cow. In 1892 we\nmoved to the Anna Road near the old Post Office\nhad little provisions & I managed to buy a few\nhens from the Indians, they were hardworking\n& good at raising & I managed to buy a few\nthen in 1896 we left the school teaching good a big\nguaranteed motion already improved 20 acres around\nfollowing 20 acres stumps which had to be removed by hand\ntwo teams & a binder to cut two crops of buckwheat.\nThe machines which tracked it were a dream but\nit needed 16 men to run the grain during harvest.\nWhen the team came out with a driving coming hearty\nthe stalks were loaded & held as spread out to dry down\nwhile I was feeding geese.

We borrowed a binder to cut off the crop of wheat & oats, the machine which threshed it, was a steam powered, it needed 18 men to run it, the grain being stacked when the rain came with a strong wind, part of the stacks were soaked & had to spread out to dry. Mean while I was feeding gang, I'd had a large plum & apple orchard, & it didn't take as much time to prepare as making pies would. I had 5 children then, the eldest 8 & the youngest just 9 months, milked the cows, carried the milk can to an old well, churned & sold butter & eggs to help pay rent.\n\nI am now 83 years of age & live in the village of St. Hubert as we keep the rural P.O., on still on the go!

Mother's name was Natalie Laporte, born at St. Gregory le Grand, Co. Sherbrooke.\nWe moved away, but bought hogs & bacon which had been buying a cow and such a long time that it was yellow cattle as if smothered, aged and long while the man raised about a rabbit or two, we did without chickens - that was a real treat to us, too. We did without eggs or chickens as the mother didn't keep any hens. When we bought a cow, we had not enough of anything to milk for the cream to rise, except an old pig; the nights being cold we managed to get butter off a cow. In 1896 we moved to the Dixon Reserve, where at first Racineville had better provisions, I mean got to buy a few from the Indians, they were barred rocks.\n\nFrom then on, I always raised chickens because that seemed to be the best way to get meat. In 1896 we left the school teaching job to begin farming a little bit. We had 20 acres of land, which had to be cleared by hand. We learned a little bit to cut the crop of wheat and oats. The machines which turned up were a team and plow.\n\nIt needed 18 men to turn it - the grain being heavy. The attacks were made on a strong armed band of nobodies who were pushing George Red with a large plow and dry soil. We were able to turn it to improve our crops.\n\nNow overall, I had 5 children then. We were doing well and had a good harvest in the village of Racine. I am still well, about 60 years of age now in the village of Racine. As we keep the rural P.O., I'm still in the go. Because the information is from an old pioneer.\n\nP.S. My father's name was Gilbert Racineville. Born at the Quebec Du Nord, Canada; father from Pennsylvania. Mother was also from Pennsylvania.
