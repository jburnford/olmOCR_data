In early days we had to\nprepare all meals from scratch as much in\ncans and packages.

Father bought two\nand after 6 months we had our own pork as they\nalways was frozen without to find them and could\nnot sell it.\nIn early days all meals prepared were boiled, fried or roasted in tin or ironware. Now they are usually prepared in Oyex, Pressure cookers or waterless cookers. In early days we had to prepare all meals now there are so much in cans and all purpose foods that it is much easier but I still do not believe healthier.\n\nWhen did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homegrown and home prepared foods?

They took them at the time as they could not cross to the Canadian side. So we had to wait until the year 1907 when our neighbor brought some from Quebec. Father bought two and after 6 months we had our own pork as there always was frozen wheat to feed them and could not sell it.\nOxford\n\nNo. 613 S\n\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8\nOxford\nNo. 613 S\n\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jessylee/PioneerQuestionnairesPDFs//PioneerQuestionnaires_No.1-DietQuestionnaires_Box12937_1906A-D_177.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 20, "total-input-tokens": 33200, "total-output-tokens": 5033, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 2], [0, 1572, 3], [1572, 2867, 4], [2867, 3650, 5], [3650, 3650, 6], [3650, 4774, 7], [4774, 5319, 8], [5319, 6409, 9], [6409, 7492, 10], [7492, 9428, 11], [9428, 9979, 12], [9979, 10969, 13], [10969, 11935, 14], [11935, 13049, 15], [13049, 14113, 16], [14113, 14989, 17], [14989, 16374, 18], [16374, 16529, 19], [16529, 16681, 20]], "primary_language": ["None", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, true, true, true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]}}]
