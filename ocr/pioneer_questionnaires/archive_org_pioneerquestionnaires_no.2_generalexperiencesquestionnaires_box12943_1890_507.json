Some of the questions here will not apply to your experiences; others may prove impossible for you to answer, so don't worry about leaving blank spaces. If you have any questions or remarks, or desire particular events, it may help to answer the questions.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1922, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experiences of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nIf less than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should answer the questions.\n\nSaskatchewan Archives questionnaires on other subjects will be prepared at a later date. Some of these are listed below.
