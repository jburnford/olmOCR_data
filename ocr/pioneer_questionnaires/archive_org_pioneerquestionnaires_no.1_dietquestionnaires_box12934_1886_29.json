They came by boat from Roumania to Halifax, then by train as far as Qu'Appelle, which was as far as the railroad went at that time. The settlers found their way to what is now known as Edenwold District in the wagons supplied each married couple by the Federal Government, pulled by a team of oxen. Also supplied was a hand plow and a hundredweight of flour. This was their start in this brave, new land.\n\nIn 1885, when the Rebellion and other activities had taken most of the members of the N.W.M.P. up around the Battlefords, my Uncle George and my Uncle John (members of the original twenty-one) were called into the Home Guard at the Barracks in Regina, along with some of the other settlers, to protect the home front. Uncle John Seibold, a tall, dark and handsome lad of nineteen, was known as \"Black Jack\", around the Barracks.\n\nIn April, 1886, Christian and Dora Seibold, my parents, came to Canada to join the early settlers, bringing with them their two small sons, Frederick and Gottlieb, and in the Fall of that year, my twin sister and I were born in a little dug-out on the side of a hill, which was our parents' home. October 26th, 1886 -- the first twins born to white settlers in what is now Saskatchewan. My sister was named Catharine and I was named Elizabeth, after the two famous queens, and we proved to be an oddity, as often in the years when we were small, the Indians would walk into our home to have a look at the two babies who were identical twins, and be gone again almost before my mother could turn around.\n\nWith the arrival of twins in the community, the need for a cow was greatly increased, so each family put in what little money they had and between six families they were able to buy one community cow from Mr. Goodwin, who lived nearby and had driven cattle west from Ontario. The cow cost $17.00.

Our Father contracted to make the hay in the Lake and haul it down to Regina for the Mounted Police, and at the conclusion of having time all the men left their rates and mowers where they were until the following season; but when the Spring arrived, a deluge filled the Lake and they couldn't salvage their machinery.

Give a typical day's menu (breakfast, dinner, and supper) for the earliest year you can remember. Give the year and list the numbers of the family with their ages at the time. State the approximate month, e.g., winter or summer. In my very early youth our three meals were made up as follows: this was quite a general feeding for most families of that day - from 1886 on.\n\nBreakfast: - hominy porridge, soup, bread and butter and milk (and perhaps a little meat always our own) bread and butter and tea or coffee or milk.\n\nDinner: - thick vegetable soup again (possibly dumplings in it) and perhaps a little meat (always our own) bread and butter cheese.\n\nSupper: - thick vegetable soup again (possibly dumplings in it) and perhaps a little meat (always our own) bread and butter cheese.\n\nWe never ate very much meat at any time. Of course there was always homemade cheese and fancy breads on hand. Everything was made very plain and wholesome from yeast dough.\n\n18.

Yes we were reduced to almost starvation many times in the early years - living almost entirely on bread, butter, fried potatoes, and milk.\n\n(see extra story of one of my early childhood experiences on back of last sheet of this questionnaire)\n16. WRAPPINGS AND CONTAINERS\n\nMention any wrappings which you recall in the newspapers and containers received with the food you purchased (give dates where possible).\n\nMost of purchased items in the early days were put up in cardboard cartons, wooden boxes or wooden barrels.

Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the early days as compared with today. Food prepared in my early days was distinctly wholesome and was not refined in any way. People seemed much more healthy than they are today, and I feel that this was so because of the \"raw\" or \"original\" way in which we had our food prepared. Things were basically served as they were produced from nature with nothing added and nothing taken away. If we could not buy or produce a type of food we did without it. Everything possible was used and nothing was wasted. Our food was sound work for carrying it and everything possible was done to use every bit of what we would find in the basket or food if it were used in its natural form - milk - bread - butter - vegetables.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of home grown and home prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible.)\n\nWhen we moved to Regina in 1924 we began to purchase prepared foods in the stores as we did not have the space in our gardens to grow enough vegetables, etc., to keep us going all year 'round. Of course too we did not have any livestock or hens and this necessitated the purchase of meat, eggs, cheese, butter, etc. However, we did grow as big a garden as possible in the city, and make use of all the produce we received from it by canning, pickling, etc.\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include items not mentioned above quality, methods of merchandising, prices, problems of shortage, shortages and other details. (Use back of page if more space is needed.)\n\nWe always cured our own meats and stored them in the oat bins where they kept indefinitely. The foods we had to purchase in the early days were of a much better quality (not refined) than they are today. In the very early days we were able to make trades with the storekeepers for food - butter, eggs, vegetables, etc., which we produced ourselves could be exchanged for dried fruits, jam, etc. We also traded with the neighbors - a pig for a cow, etc. Our vegetables were stored in earth cellars and root houses. MILK, butter, and cheese were kept in a small place known as a \"milk house\".\n20. Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.

Things were basically served as they were produced from nature, with nothing added and nothing taken away. If we could not buy or produce a type of food we did without it. Everything possible was homegrown and absolutely nothing was wasted - if we could not make use of the particular food immediately we would find some way of preserving it. We had it proved to us many times in my youth that we could exist on the barest of food if it were used in its natural form - milk - bread - butter - vegetables.\n\n21.

Milk, butter, and cheese were kept in a small place known as a \"milk house\".\nDuring the brief time we lived in the Yellow Grass district when I was a very small child, about 2 weeks prior to Christmas that year my Father left home for Regina to get a supply of groceries. Due to the cold and stormy weather my Father did not get back home until New Years Day. While he was away we had to live on pap (made with boiling milk and enough flour to thicken it) and milk to drink.\n\nWe were down to our last spoonful of flour before my Dad got home. We all kept looking for him day after day and all day long. Finally we saw a speck on the horizon as a result of a mirage (commonly seen in the early days). He was about 10 miles from home. When we saw him coming in the early morning my Mother made we children carry hay up on to a hill and we burned it all day so my Father could see it as he was coming closer to home. He finally arrived in the house about 10 P.m. that night. For some time before he arrived we could hear the rattling of the harness and it was like music to our ears.\n\nAs soon as he got home we found he was very weary but thankful as were we all.\n\nThe horses were played out bucking the storm and snow and we took the blankets off our beds and covered the horses with them in the barn and gave them hot mash to warm them up.\n\nThis was the closest our family came to starving to death as I can recall.\n\nA few added recollections of my early life in-so-far as food was concerned are as follows:\n\nWhen I first came into the world the main foods my parents were able to purchase were flour, coffee, tea, and sugar, dried apples and prunes. Having a cow we had ample supply of milk, butter, and cheese. From these products the large bulk of our food was made. We grew our own vegetables and cured our own meats (ate very little meat), but we had 2 little pigs.\n\nMenu as I recall it for a pioneer family:\n\nBreakfast - bread, butter, and coffee. We had oatmeal porridge in the winter months.\n\nDinner - vegetable soup, bread and butter and milk\n\nSupper - same as dinner with possibly dumplings. We ate very little meat, but when we did it was some we had cured ourselves.\n\nSometimes when my folks went to shop, the storekeeper would put in the order a small bag of candies as a treat for we children (without cost).\n\nAt Christmas it was a tradition with our family that my mother would supply each child with a clean white handkerchief in which she placed fancy bread goodies she had baked and tied them in the hanky. These would be supplied to any children whom we visited in other homes at that festive season and we children would receive the same when other families visited us. On Christmas morning we would all go to Church and then would be asked to go home with a neighboring family for Christmas dinner.\n\nThis same practice was carried out at Easter time, but in addition my mother would color eggs for us (dyes were always available at the stores even in those early days) but I have seen my mother dye eggs with onion skins and odd bits of crepe paper gathered through the years and the eggs would be beautiful.\nDuring the brief time we lived in the Yellow Grass district when I was a very small child, about 2 weeks prior to Christmas that year my Father left home for Regina to get a supply of groceries.

Having a cow we purchased milk, salt, butter, and cheese. From these products the large bulk of our food was made. We grew our own vegetables and curdled our own milk (ate very little meat), but we had 2 little pigs.\n\nMenu as I recall it for a pioneer family:\n\nBreakfast - bread, butter, and coffee. We had oatmeal porridge in the winter months.\n\nDinner - vegetable soup, bread and butter and milk\n\nSupper - same as dinner with possibly dumplings. We ate very little meat, but when we did it was some we had cured ourselves.\n\nSometimes when my folks went to shop, the storekeeper would put in the order a small bag of candles as a treat for our children (without cost).\n\nAt Christmas it was a tradition with our family that my mother would supply each child with a clean white handkerchief in which she placed fancy bread goodies she had baked and tied them in the handkerchief. These would be supplied to any children whom we visited in other homes at that festival season and we children would receive the same when other families visited us. On Christmas morning we would all go to Church and then would be asked to go home with a neighboring family for Christmas dinner.\n\nThis same practice was carried out at Easter time, but in addition my mother would color eggs for us (they were always available at the stores even in those early days) but I have seen my mother dye eggs with onion skins and odd bits of crepe paper gathered through the years and the eggs would be beautiful.\nDuring the brief time we lived in the Yellow Grass district when I was a very small child, about 2 weeks prior to Christmas that year my Father left home for Regina to get a supply of grocers. Due to the cold and stormy weather my Father did not get back home until New Years Day. While he was away we had to live on pap (made with boiling milk and enough flour to thicken it) and milk to drink.\n\nWe were down to our last speckful of flour before my Dad got home. We all kept looking for him day after day and all day long. Finally we saw smoke on the horizon as a result of smoke (commonly seen in the early days). He was about 10 miles from home. When we saw him coming in the early morning my Mother made us children carry hay up on to a hill and we burned it all day so my Father could see it as he was coming closer to home. He finally arrived in the house about 10 P.M. that night. For some time before he arrived we could hear the rattling of the harness and it was like music to our ears.\n\nAs soon as he got home we found he was very weary but thankful as were we all.\n\nThe horses were played out blocking the storm and snow and we took the blankets off our beds and covered the horses with them in the barn and gave them hot rash to warm them up.\n\nThis was the closest our family came to starving to death as I can recall.\n\nA few added recollections of my early life in so far as food was concerned are as follows:\n\nWhen I first came into the world the main foods my parents were able to purchase were flour, coffee, tea and sugar, dried apples and prunes.
