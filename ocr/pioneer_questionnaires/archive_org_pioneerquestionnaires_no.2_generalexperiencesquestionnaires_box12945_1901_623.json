Life is made a perfect burden during the attacks of boiling pains which come at improper times.\n\nIt is a great mistake to imagine that the remedy which is effective in the matter of fact, they say the vitality of nature will counteract and will certainly lead to the ruination of the health. This is true of itching and pricking ingarments, ulcers, carbuncles, etc., because of the loss of blood. are more rapid and more violent.\n\nDr. Chase's Ointment brings almost immediate relief from itching, burning, stinging sensations of piles and is the best treatment ever given for every form of this wretched, torturing disease.\n\nThis has been proven in so many thousands of cases that there is no longer any room for doubt that Dr. Chase's Ointment is the most satisfactory treatment for piles that was ever discovered.\n\nMr. John Johnston, Cokely, Alta. about 20 years ago was blind of sight, of water piles of 27 years duration. I used to think that death would be preferable to this state of life, but never could get from the terrible misery of piles, which came on during fever, every time and at other times when I should be sleeping.\n\nHis Ointment was worth six dollars a box instead of six dollars a box, so I am still alive and never have known my feet to cause me pain at all. In fact, I am now able to walk around, not alone, but alone.\n\nMinard's Liniment Cures Difteria.\n\n\"It is a good thing to have a child about the house, and in case of such a child you will not have to worry about his coughing.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the unfeeling parents. \"In this case it seems better than anything else for me to pay you.\"\n\n\"I haven't any love for little puppies,\" replied Mrs. Taylor, \"but I haven't met your child either.\"\n\n\"I've been wondering where your baby is,\" replied Taylor with a smile.\n\n\"The Kitchen Asticott.\n\nMrs. Wilson, an old friend of mine, has just advised me to take hold here, because there is nothing so sure as a permit to hold that will give her the chance she wants. She is very anxious to have a permit to hold this year.\n\nSafety for Children.\n\nLiquid medicines advertised to cure stomach and bow tie complaints contain opium and are dangerous. When a mother gives these medicines to her children she does so at the urging of the druggist who says that he cannot sell them unless they are mixed with bitters.\n\nMrs. Murray, a childless woman, has made the discovery that certain drinks of water containing acid are absolutely harmless. She uses these drinks for her own consumption and those of her guests.\n\nThe Virginia sulphur is apparently unlike to endure a high temperature. During the day it is evident that she is subject to sufferings. As soon as she reaches her home she seems to receive an attack of diarrhea which lasts several days and then she suffers from inflammation in various parts of the body. This inflammation lasts until midnight or after.\n\nOur Hair Is Wretched\n\nDo you like it? Why be concerned why it? Have a nice hair! How do?\n\nAyer's Hair Vigor and Have Long, thick hair; soft, even hair; beautiful hair, with only one single grey hair; keep young just as long as you can.\n\nMy Hair is Scraggly\n\nCool the French Gripe.\n\nWhile the farmer sets away his cream to be cooled so port that will operations be subjected to the cooling medium. The water that comes from the pump is preferred to spring or river water, if you have it, is better. That water should be preserved, acidulated, and enough grams should be added so that it could be finer, and it will soon cool the hams, and the growth of the germs will be checked. - E.W. Webster, M.A.\n\nAnother Wonderful Case\n\nThere is Something Big that will be Welcome News to Many A Distraught Mother.\n\nAfter a horrible affair with the devil that had just occurred to her, this woman was told by her husband, the Devil himself, that she must go to bed immediately. This distressed her greatly, and she became very ill. This continued for several hours, when she was told again to go to bed.\n\nAstronomy in India.\n\nIndia is a great country for astronomy.

The facts of the case have not been successfully upheld. After the jury had been out about two hours the Judge delivered the verdict: We the Jury, and the defendant in possession of property and in the court of law, will be sentenced on the indictment of murder, and will be fined \u00a3150 and be sent to the prison for one year.\n\nA slight earthquake shock was reported felt at Cobalt.\n\nTrilling Axe and Fox Tail.\n\nThe female pulse always beats faster than the male's.

As a result such marriages were legalised by the Act of Parliament which came into force on the same day that the marriage was solemnised.\n\nThe case of Henry VIII.\n\nA history of the subject dates back to the reign of Henry VIII., who was peculiarly qualified as an authority on the subject. He had a son named Richard, but in 1579 such a union was declared illegal under the Statute of Wills. This was Lord Hardwicke's Act, which was passed in 1754, and which declared legal, but incestuous marriages, those between cousins, and marriages between persons of the same degree of consanguinity. It was not until the next session of Parliament that the question of marriages between persons of the same degree of consanguinity was raised again, and Lord Hardwicke refused to interfere.\n\nIn 1841 Lord Thurlow introduced a Bill to allow marriages between persons of the same degree of consanguinity. In the next year the Commons defeated a similar measure, and in 1843 a Royal Commission was appointed to consider the question. In 1844 the result was another bill, introduced by Lord Hardwicke, which was again defeated. Next year it was passed in the Commons, but it was again rejected in the Lords, and it was again rejected in the Commons. Since then the measure has been introduced several times, but always the Lords have refused to pass it.\n\nThe Law in Canada.\n\nUntil the passing of the Marriage Act in 1869, the law in England prevented the marriage of persons of the same degree of consanguinity. Mr. Justice and Father of the House, Mr. Justice Macdonald, introduced a measure to remove this restriction.\n\nMr. Cameron of North Western Victoria, who was a member of the House of Commons, introduced a measure to remove this restriction. The measure was introduced by Mr. Justice Macdonald, who was a member of the House of Commons, and it was passed by the Commons, but it was rejected by the Lords.\n\nThe objections raised.\n\nThe objections founded on medical grounds appear to be more serious than those based on religious grounds. The objection raised by Mr. Justice Macdonald was that the marriages would result in the production of children who would be unfit for life. After all, he said, it is not true that the Roman Catholic Church holds that the Church of England holds that the marriages would result in the production of children who would be unfit for life.\n\nPREMATURE BURIAL.\n\nStarting Figures Supplied by English Doctor on Tubercular Subject.\n\nSome very interesting figures have recently been supplied by Dr. Thomas J. Murray, of London, England, regarding the number of persons buried alive. The following are some of the figures:\n\nPersons buried alive, 140\nPersons buried alive after death, 217\nPersons buried alive in narrow spaces from disease, 15\nPersons buried alive in narrow spaces from disease, 15\n\nUNCONGENIAL FLOWERS.\n\nMagnolias and Roses, For Instance.\n\nThe florist frequently asks me what flowers I prefer. I always say, \"Magnolias and roses.\" He says, \"Magnolias and roses?\" I say, \"Yes, magnolias and roses.\" He says, \"Magnolias and roses?\" I say, \"Yes, magnolias and roses.\" He says, \"Magnolias and roses?\" I say, \"Yes, magnolias and roses.\" He says, \"Magnolias and roses?\" I say, \"Yes, magnolias and roses.\"\n\nIN THE NEXT CENTURY.\n\nSome of the Things That Are Foreseen for the Future.\n\nT. S. T. Years.\n\nThe future is full of surprises. In his book \"A Little Book of Prophecy,\" Mr. T. S. T. Years foresees a world with exceptional wealth and prosperity. He predicts that the world will be divided into three classes: the rich, the middle class, and the poor. He also predicts that the world will be divided into three classes: the rich, the middle class, and the poor.\n\nTHE FIRST BALLOON.\n\nResults of the First Balloon Flight of the Montgolfier Brothers.\n\nOn August 27th, 1783, the Montgolfier brothers launched their first balloon flight. The balloon was filled with hot air, and rose to a height of over 6,000 feet. The balloon was seen by thousands of people, and it was a great success.\n\nSunlight Soap.\n\nSunlight Soap is better than other soaps, but it is best when used in the Sunlight way. Sunlight Soap contains no injurious chemicals. Sunlight Soap is pure soap, scientifically made. Every batch of Sunlight Soap is watched by an expert chemist. Sunlight Soap saves labor and the wear of washing, which common soaps require in washing fabric.\n\nUSE OF THE LEECH.\n\nBled to Death in Georgia\u2014What Druggists Say.\n\nThe use of leeches is becoming more common in Georgia. Druggists say that the use of leeches is becoming more common in Georgia. They say that the use of leeches is becoming more common in Georgia.\n\nMy Hair Scraggly.\n\nDo you like your hair to be scraggly? If so, you should try Dodd's Kidney Pills. They will make your hair grow faster and thicker.\n\"Some hae meat that canna eat,\nAnd some would eat that want it:\nBut we hae meat, and we can eat,\nSae let the Lord be thankit.\"\n\nMENU\n\nWHITE BREAD  BROWN BREAD\nSLICED HAM   COLD CHICKEN\nCOLD BEEF    COLD PORK\nESCALLOPED POTATOES\nCELERY SALAD  CABBAGE SALAD\nCRANBERRIES\nPICKLES      FRUIT SALAD\nROLLS\nAPPLES       ORANGES\nCAKE         TARTS\nTEA          COFFEE\n\n\"X Gently Companie\"\n\nTOAST LIST\n\nCHAIRMAN, Joseph Kennedy\n\n1.

FROM IT'S SETTLEMENT IN 1900 TO 1914\n\nBY GEORGE A HARRIS, VANCOUVER, B.C. JULY 1955.\nSOME HISTORY AND PIONEER EXPERIENCES OF\nHEWARD, SASK. FROM ITS SETTLEMENT IN\n1900 TO 1914\n\nBY\nGEORGE A HARRIS,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\nJULY 1925.\nIn the summer of 1900, perhaps in May, William Irvin and Hamilton Caldwell filed on homestead Sec. 22-9-9-W-8, in this area. These two fellows met in Winnipeg on their way to take up land on the prairie. Bill came from Owen Sound, Ont. and Ham from Central Ireland. Heward village now stands on the land originally owned by Mr. Caldwell. While preparing to build their small house and a stable they met a Frenchman who had come to homestead too, but finally got disgusted with the country, he decided he would go back to where he came from, he had four horses and a wagon with some agriculture implements. Bill and Ham bought his whole outfit and started farming, they also bought a fine yoke of oxen from a farmer in the French Settlement near Moose Mountain Creek.\n\nMr. William McKenzie and wife and three children came too, that spring, he came from near Portage La Prairie and farmed a whole section a little south of where Heward now stands. Herb Fox and wife were the second couple to bring wives and George McCurdy the third. Herb and wife came from Rapinka, Man., George and wife and son John came from Wingham, Ontario. James and Frank Andrews also came that spring, coming in a covered wagon from Kansas, U.S.A., but they located about six miles North West. These people, as far as I can remember, were the first to locate in Heward area. Of course, many more filed on homesteads that summer of 1900, but it was a very dry summer and there was very little hay to garner for their stock feed for winter and they did not come to prove up on their land till the spring of 1901. I was one of these, having written to the Land Department for an extension of time to get on my homestead, and I arrived in May 1901, driving from Crandall, Manitoba. I bought two fine horses and a wagon at Warden, Man. and drove across West to Cannington Manor, and the new village of Arcola, which was just 35 miles from my homestead, finally reaching Mr. Irvin and Mr. Caldwell's abode after seven full days trekking and over half of this distance only a faint trail.\n\nThese men gladly gave me shelter and Mr. Caldwell, next morning came with me to find the location of my farm which was four miles North West of theirs. I at once left for Arcola, our nearest village, for lumber for my house and stable. I made several trips to Arcola for lumber and food etc. before I could begin breaking the land and we had to ford Moose Mountain Creek, as there was no bridge and the water was very high at that time. That spring and summer saw a great influx of people, mostly bachelors, to our area, but naturally some women came in June and they were my closest neighbors, only two miles away and that was fine to have a good neighbor so close.\n\nOur first Post Office was ALMA, 25 miles away and in the French Settlement, in 1902 we had one at NEW HOPE, only 12 miles away and in the farm house of William Carefoot, any neighbor going for the mail always brought each other's mail and that was good. Later, New Hope Post Office was run by Mr. Louis Siaud and he also kept a general store there which was really appreciated by the settlers and we received mail once a week, usually someone went on Saturday for it.\n\nThe crops of 1901-2-3 had to be hauled to Arcola or Weyburn which is on the Soc Line, both about 35 miles away, but I had no crop till 1902. The price too, for wheat, was around 50\u00a2 per bushel, not very remunerating but 50\u00a2 those days was really money.\n\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway surveyed the extension from Regina to Arcola in the fall of 1902, the first survey ran through one corner of my farm, but they made a second survey about a mile South, where they built\nSome History and Pioneer Experiences of Heward, Sask., from Its Settlement in 1900 to 1914\n\nIn the summer of 1900, perhaps in May, William Tryon and Hamilton Caldwell filled homesteads 22-07-02, in this area on the Prairies. The two fellows met in Winnipeg on their way to take up land on the Prairies. Bill came from Owen Sound, Ont., and Hamilton from Central Island, B.C. While preparing to build their small house and a stable they got disgusted with the country, who had come to homestead too, but finally got used to it. They decided he would go back where he came from, but bought his horse and oxen outfit and started farming. They also bought a fine yoke of oxen from a farmer in the French Settlement near Mouse Mountain Creek.\n\nMr. McKenzie and wife and three children came too, that spring, he came from near Portage La Prairie and farmed a whole section a little south of where Heward now stands. Herb Fox and wife were the second couple to bring wives and George McCurry the third. Herb and wife came from Napinka, Man.; George and wife also came that spring coming in a covered wagon from Kansas, U.S.A., but they located about six miles North West. These people, as far as I can remember, homesteaded that summer of 1900, but of course many more followed. It was very little hay to carry for their stock feed for winter and they did not have enough prairie to the Land Department for an extension of time to get on my homestead and I arrived in May 1901 driving from Cranfill, Manitoba, and drove across West to Cranfill Manor, and the new settlement of Arcola, which was just 35 miles from my homestead, finally reaching Mr. Tryon and Mr. Caldwell's store after seven full days trekking and over half of this distance only a fair trail.\n\nThese men gladly gave me shelter and Mr. Caldwell, next morning came with me to find the location of my farm which was four miles North West of theirs. I let once left for Arcola, nearest village for Lumber and food. My house was stable. I made several trips to Arcola for lumber and food etc. before I could begin breaking the land and we had to ford Moore at that mouth of Mountrail Creek, as there was no bridge and the water was very high at that time. That spring and summer saw a great influx of people mostly bronco riders to our area, but naturally some women came in June and they were my closest neighbors, only two miles away and that was fine to have a good neighbor so close.\n\nOur first Post Office was at Arcola, 25 miles away and in the French Settlement. In 1902 we had one at New Hope, only 12 miles away and in the farm house of William Carterov, any neighbor going for the mail always brought each other's mail and he also kept a General store there which was really appreciated by the settlers and we received mail once a week, usually someone went on Saturday for it.\n\nThe crops of 1901-02-3 had to be hauled to Arcola or Weyburn which is on the Soo Line, both about 95 miles away, but I had no crop till 1902. The price too, for wheat, was around $0.50 per bushel, not very remunerating but those days was really money.\n\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway surveyed the extension from Regina to Arcola in the fall of 1902; the first survey run through on corner of Ivy farm, but they made a second survey about a mile South, where they built\nthe line, in the summer of 1904. It came through Heward June 21st, 1904 and the track laying machine completed the line to Arcola July 15th and the ballasting was finished the middle of October the same year. Our wheat crop was shipped out that fall by loading on cars from the siding, and I'll say it was some job, but far superior to hauling it to Arcola or Weyburn, 35 miles, as we had been doing.\n\nThis extension of the railway, when built, was the longest, straightest railway in the world, over 100 miles as straight as surveyors could survey it. It had other special features too, for the grade up to the ties averaged only two feet, and the real grade of the railroad was only 1/10 of 1%, that is pretty level land.\n\nIn the summer of 1903 Phil Munro started up a store in a tent on Ham Caldwell's farm and soon George Docker and Kenneth Reid also a hardware and lumber store too, was started by Joseph Montjoy and Art Glover and a livery stable by Bob Adams. McDermaid and Reid had a general store at Caldwell's, but never moved to the site of Heward as the others did, but left for parts unknown. Billy Russell and Lort Williamson homesteaders christened the village CALDWELL in honor of the man who owned the land on which these stores were erected. They were all moved over to the site of the village the C. P. R. had surveyed nearby - HEWARD - in the spring of 1904. Tom Henderson on the way to New Hope April 6th or 6th 1904 was passing Phil Munro's store, Phil had his goods packed in boxes cut on the snow, ready to move to the new site Tom offered to move them for him and took them over to a stake set up by Phil on the new site on the snow, Tom dumped the load there and that was the first load of anything dumped on the Heward site. The other stores were moved over to the site by Billy Russell and Bob Adams, that day and the next. That summer Heward really grew, different stores grew up, implement dealers and others, we even had a newspaper edited by Robert Caskey, \"THE HEWARD CHRONICLE\", and our first postmaster was Richard Reilly and as he and his wife lived on the farm he had J. Morley Adams run it for him.\n\nA school house was erected and the first teacher was Miss Kathleen Lenore Cameron from Vanleek Hill, Ont. Miss Maud Kneeshaw came in January 1905 and in 1906 Miss Edith Code. Our merchant, a little later, George Docker, married her. William Irvin and George Paul were two of the trustees. Religious services were held in the school house on Sundays by the Methodists, later the Anglicans built a church and also the Presbyterians. Montjoy and Glover built a big building for their hardware store and George Paul had a furniture store in one part of this building, where the bachelors bought a bed and tore down the bunk they had on the wall with the straw tick for mattress. The Moose Mountain Lumber and Hardware Co. started up in 1904 and Herb Dickey was first manager. Frank James the second. Jack Flath was first clerk. Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Dickey had the first boarding house. Bob Adams the first Livery Stable, Fred Kneeshaw ran it later, next was Taylor brothers, George, Jim and Mel, and Hugh Wright, I believe, runs it now. Hugh is surely a real stayer, he has been there a long time.\n\nDr. Fred Hiltz was our first Medical Doctor, followed by Dr. Hamman and later by Dr. H. A. McDonald. The first child born in Heward was Irene Aldrich, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. James Aldrich in 1903, now Mrs. Bert Newett of Vancouver, B.C. The first deaths were Mr. Lee and Florence Testar in 1905, the latter was thrown off a horse and stepped on, I made her casket and buried her, she and Mr. Lee were interred the same day, the Minister having come a long distance for that duty. They were buried on their farms but later transferred to cemeteries.\n\nThere were soon three grain elevators and later farmers asked for loading platforms and many shipped from cars this way.\nthe line, in the summer of 1906. It came through Howard June 21st, 1904 and the track laying machine completed the line to Arcola July 15th and the ballasting was finished the middle of October the same year. Our wheel trip was shipped out that fall by loading on cars from the siding at Weyburn, 35 miles as we had been doing.\n\nThis railway extension of the railroad, when built, was the longest straightest railway in the world, over 100 miles as straight as the surveyors could survey it. It had other special features too; for the grade up to the ties averaged only two feet and the real grade of the railroad was only 1/10 of 1%, that is pretty level land.\n\nHam C. Munro and John Phil Munro started a store in a tent on the homestead of Mr. and Mrs. Dockery and named it Munro & Dockery. The store was started by Jesse Munro and Redd had a general store on the homestead of Howard as the General Store. The steamer \"J. J. Munro\" started for the town of Arcola and brought supplies to the town which the stores were stocked. Munro & Dockery opened their store in 1904. Tom Henderson on the way to New Hope turned north and dumped the load there and that was the first load of grain ever delivered by Robert Ciskey. The \"HEWARD CHRONICLE\" and our little post office was Richard Reilly and his wife lived on the farm he had bought from Richard Adams.\n\nJ. Morley Adams run it for him.\n\nA school house was erected and the first teacher was Miss Kathleen Lenore Gereon from Vaaltek Hill, Ont. Miss Maud Kneeshaw came in January 1905 and in 1906 Miss Edith Coe. Our merchant, a little later, George Dockery married her. William Irvin and George Paul were two of the trustees. Religious services were held in the school house on Sundays by the Methodists, later the Anglicans built a church and also the Presbyterians. Paul had Glover built a big building for the hardware store and George Paul had a furniture store in one part of the building where the straw tick for bed and tore down the bunk they had on the wall. Jack Plath started up in 1904 and Herb Dickey was first manager. Frank James was the second boarding house. Bob Adams the first Livery Stable, Joseph Dickey had the first livery stable. Bob brothers, George Jim and Mel, and Hugh Wight I believe runs it now. Hugh is surely a real stayer, he has been there a lone time.\n\nDr. Fred Hiltz was our first Medical Doctor, followed by Dr. Hemman and later by Dr. H. A. McDonald. The first child born in Howard was Irene Andrews, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. James Aldrich in 1908, now Mrs. Bert Newton of Yarrow. The latter was thrown off a horse and gyped on. I'm told Tettr in 1909, the latter was thrown off a horse and gyped on. I'm told her basket having been a long distance for that duty. They were buried on their farms but later transferred to cemeteries.\n\nThere were soon three grain elevators and later farmers asked for loading platforms and many shipped from cars this way.\nThe village soon had a cemetery, given the land on Sec. 11 nearby by the Federal Government. Typhoid Fever struck the area in 1911 and took a toll of four persons. A water well was dug for village use, but the streets were still primitive, but as the years went by they were improved, and later a new brick four roomed school was erected. Lady teachers were employed and were soon snapped up by eligible bachelors and at this date several are still residing in the village or area. Later an ice rink was erected and it surely was a splendid gesture for winter skating and curling, for sometimes in the long winter time dragged rather slowly. A baseball club was formed and together with several other villages on the line who had baseball clubs, made it very pleasant for all on Saturday afternoons during the summer when games were played.\n\nA brass band was organized also at the time. I believe by Newton Crich, who himself played the bass tuba, this added to our functions especially the baseball games.\n\nA Civilian Rifle Association was organized in 1909. The first Captain was George Jackson and the secretary was myself, we got permission from the Federal Government, to have the range on vacant school Sec. #11 and we had ranges at 200 yards 300, and 500 and practiced Saturday afternoons, and occasionally had a contest with other associations on our line, they were very interesting, the rifles at first were Lee Enfield\u2019s but when the Ross rifle came out we exchanged for the Ross, we had 32 members and when war was declared in middle of 1914, they called the rifles in and of course the club was disbanded. John Stuart was our Captain then and John Johnson, quartermaster with the same secretary as we started with in 1909. Here are the names of the members: Geo. Jackson was the first captain, John Stuart, James Stuart, T. Dempsey, R. Caskey, T. Awde, W. Reilly, B. Graham, W. Wensley, G. Reilly, G. Harris, R. Blackwell, W. Blackwell, H. Lenson, F. Smith, F. Kneeshaw, J. M. Adams, John Johnson, C. Anderson, Dr. H. A. McDonald, J. H. Dickey, Geo. Moore, E. Blackwell, Ed. Sullivan, Geo. Tupling, Steve Fox, Jim Taylor, M. Shuttleworth, John Scott, Tom Hemerson, A. Falconer and W. McKee.\n\nA Masonic Lodge was organized in the summer of 1906 by the following Charter members: Richard Reilly, Master; Joe Awde, Secretary, J. M. Adams, W. F. Hopkins, J. W. O\u2019Harrow, N. P. Crich, Geo. Docker, Chas. M. Gohn. Their first candidates at the opening were Denneth Fraser, John Flath and Bert Davinson, that was September meeting. At the October session the candidates were Geo. A. Harris and Robt. Caskey, and I was master in 1912, later became a Life member, and the Lodge at this date is still going strong and is known by Heward, A. F. & A. $29 - G. R. S.\n\nIn 1911 a neighbour Tom Awde and myself organized the Heward Rural Telephone Company, consisting of fourteen farmer subscribers, we were all on the one line in the country but not in the village. I was president and Tom was the secretary, it was wonderful to be able to talk with thirteen other farmers, especially on urgent matters which did occur sometimes. Our line was merged with other rural lines and later with the main line when extended from Regina with Heward Village. We had an exchange at the office of J. M. Adams in the village. They had three fine girls who handled it with the assistance of Ruby Reilly occasionally, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. R. Reilly. A splendid convenience to be able to converse with many in the area with long distance calls anywhere, overcoming the loneliness of early days of homesteading. The natural progress of live settlers. I understand the company is still operating. Our fourteen original subscribers were viz; Geo. A. Harris, Thos. H. Awde, Geo. Reilly, Richard Reilly, John Stuart, John McDowell, Fred Crich, Sam Dempsey, Geo. McCurdy, Caleb Cull, John Geddes, Wm. Geddes, Wm. Smith and Fred Harvie. The Northern Electric Co. erected it for us.\nThe village soon had a cemetery, given the land on Sec. 11 nearby by the Federal Government. Typhoid Fever struck the area in 1911 and took a toll of four persons. A water well was dug for village use, but the streets were still unpaved. School was erected. Lay teachers were employed, and later a new brick building was erected. Electric telephones and at this date several are still in use in the village or area. Later an ice rink was erected and it surely was a splendid feature for winter skating and curling; for some times in the long winter time drugged rathershowed a baseball club was formed and together with several other villages on the line who had baseball clubs, made very pleasant for all on Saturday afternoons during the summer when games were played.\n\nA brass band was organized also at this time. I believe by Newton Crighton himself played the base tuba, thus added to our functions especially the baseball games.\n\nCivilian Rifle Association was organized in 1909. The first Captain was George Jackson and the Secretary was myself, we got permission from the Federal Government to hold range and practice on vacant school Sec. 4/11 and we had range 200 yards 300 and 500 yards and practice Saturday afternoons and occasionally had a contest with other associations on our range, they were very interesting, the rifles at first were Lee Enfields but when the Ross rifle came out we exchanged them for Ross, we had 32 members and when war was declared in middle of 1914 they called the rifles in and of course the quartermaster with the same secretary as we started with then end John Johnson, James Stuart, T.

Shuttlesworth, John Scott, Tom Hemmerson, Tupling, Gtve Fox, Jim Taylor, M. Shuttlesworth, John Scott, Tom Hemmerson, A. Palmer and W. McKee.\n\nA Masonic Lodge was organized in the summer of 1906 by the following Charter members: Richard Reilly, Massey, Geo. J. O'Harrow, Geo. Docker, Chas. M. Gohn, W. P. Hopkins, J. W. O'Harrow, N. P. O'Harrow, Deneth Fraser, John Flath and Bert Davison, that was September opening meeting at the October session the charter Davies were Geo. A. Harris and Robt. Casey. It was master in 1912, later became a life member, and the Lodge at this date is still going strong and is known by its name.\n\nIn 1911 a new telephone company was organized the Howard Rural Telephone Company consisting of fourteen farmer subscribers, we were all on the one line in the county but not in the village. Tom was president and Tom was the secretary, it was wonderful to be able to talk with thirteenth other farmers, especially on our rural lines and later with the main line when extended from Regina to the village. We had an exchange at the office of J. M. Adams in the village. They had three fine girls, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. R. Reilly. A splendid convenience to be able to overcome the loneliness. In the area with long distance calls a natural progress of live settlers. Our fourteen original subscribers understand the company is still operating. Our fourteen original subscribers were: Geo. A. Harris, Fred Glitch, Sam Dewey, Wm. Smith and Fred Harvie. The Northern Electric Co. erected it for us.\nIn the fall of 1909 the Heward Assembly Club was formed, we met first in Montjoy and Glovers Hall on Nov. 18th and had our assemblies every two weeks till the middle of March, each year, it did much for us all during the winter months, I see by my old membership card that I was president and R. B. Evens secretary in 1909. Patronesses were Mesdames G. B. Docker, John Stuart, T. A. Neismith, J. A. Montjoy, J. H. Dickey and R. N. Caskey. When our meeting place was burned down we met in one of the unused new school rooms. About 1904 our district was formed into a Local Improvement District and Thomas H. Aude was our representative and they met in Staughton every month.\n\nIn 1905 our Territory of Assiniboia was formed into the Province of Saskatchewan and municipalities were formed in 1909, ours was called Tecumseh, #65 and our first Councillor was Richard Reilly, first meeting was held at STOUGHTON, January 1910. Other councillors were F. Marchand, Alva Cameron, Geo. J. Howe, David Beattie, H. L. Drummond. The Reeve was Edwin Slater, and the Sec. Treas. Robert McKenzie.\n\nThe Bank of Hamilton opened a branch in the village in 1909 but closed the office in April 1914. It was a great convenience while there, afterwards we had to go to Stoughton which was nine miles farther east.\n\nAs my farm was four miles N. W. of the village we formed a School District in the fall of 1913. We named it \"Hartaven\" and it was on S. E. \u00bc 18-10-9-W-2. The meeting was held at James Dykes home and he was the first Board Chairman. The school house was erected and opened early in the summer of 1914, and Miss Schales was the teacher.\n\nOur Heward Hotel was erected in 1906 and the first manager was Mr. Bice.\n\nThe soil in Heward area is a chocolate clay loam which turns much darker on cultivation. Rainfall perhaps in those early years averaged from twelve to seventeen inches.\n\nThe tax bills on each quarter for 1900 and 1901 were sent from Regina and were $2.00 per year; some difference from the present.\n\nThe mineral rights on homesteads were reserved to the Crown, but many who own C. P. R. land have the mineral rights and at this writing oil is found not very far from the village, and an extraordinary flow of oil from a well north of Forget, only perhaps a dozen miles East. Heward yet may be famous.\n\nMany of Heward's sons went to the first World War and made the supreme sacrifice. We are still working for the Peace these fine boys gave their lives for.\n\nIn the fall of 1901, we went East to Moose Mountain for wood to two abandoned Indian Reserves viz: \"Pheasants Rump\" and \"Ocean Man\" obtaining permits from the Mounted Police, gratis. This area had a bad fire a year or so before, fine poplar trees still standing and dry, the bark having fallen off, were splendid wood for our stoves and many other things on the farm.\n\nWm. Irvin and myself that fall drove to Estevan, south in Township two for loads of Lignite coal at the mines, we only paid $1.75 per ton. He and I assisted the miners in getting our two loads, I drove the mule with the small car in and out of the mine while Bill unloaded the other car while the miners were busy in the mine. It was a three day trip for the four tons we brought back.\nIn the fall of 1909 the Howard Assembly Club was formed; we met first in the fall and Clovers Hall on New Year's Eve and had our assemblies every two weeks until the middle of March. Each year, it did much for us all during the winter months. In 1909 our patronesses were Messrs. G. B. Doerker, R. B. Young, Secretary, John Stuart, T. A. Hamilton, J. A. Mortley, J. D. Dickey and R. N. Casey.\n\nWhen our meetings became too large, we met in one of the unused new school rooms. About 1910 our district was formed into a Local Improvement District and Thomas H. Judge was our representative. They met in Stoughton every month.\n\nIn 1905 our territory of Assiniboia was formed into the province of Saskatchewan and municipal offices were formed in 1909. Our first meeting was held at STOUGHTON, January 1st, 1910. Other councillors were P. Macdonald, Alva Cameron, Geo. J. Lowe, Harold Battie, H. L. Drummond. The Reeve was Edwin Slater, and the Sec. Treas. Robert McKenzie.\n\nThe Bank of Hamilton opened a branch in the village in 1909 but closed the office in April 1911. It was a great convenience while there, afterwards we had to go to Stoughton which was nine miles further east.\n\nAs my farm was four miles N.W. of the village we formed a School District in the fall of 1913. We named it \"Howard\" and it was on S.E. 2-18-10-9-2. The meeting was held at James Dykes' house and he was the Chairman. The school house was built and opened early in the summer of 1914, and Miss Schall was the teacher.\n\nOur Howard Hotel was erected in 1906 and the first manager was Mr. Dice.\n\nThe soil in Howard area is a chocolate clay loam which turns brown when dry. Rainfall perhaps in those early years from twelve to seventeen inches.\n\nThe tax bills on each quarter for 1900 and 1901 were sent from Regina and were $2.00 per year, some difference from the present.\n\nThe mineral rights on homesteads were reserved to the Crown, but many who own C.P.R. land have the mineral rights and at this writing oil is found not very far from the village and an extraordinary amount may be found.\n\nMany of Howards sons went to the first World War and made the supreme sacrifice. We are still working for the Peace these fine boys gave their lives for.\n\nIn the fall of 1901, we went East to Moose Mountain for wood to two abandoned Indian reserves viz., \"Pheasant's Ramp\" and \"Ocean Man's\" obtaining permits from the Mounted Police, and \"This area had a bad fire a year or so before, fine poplar trees still standing and dry, the bark having fallen off, were splendid wood for our stoves and many other things on the farm.\n\nMr. Irvin and myself that fall drove to Estevan, South in Township two for loads of Light coal at the mines, we only paid $1.75 per ton.\n\nHe and I assisted the miners in getting our two loads. I drove the mule car while the small car in and out of the mine while Bill unloaded the other four tons we brought back.\nThere were plenty of wild ducks in the fall of 1901 and in the fall of 1902 we had plenty of wild geese and wild turkeys. They appeared as soon as there were some cereal crops to feed on and they made a splendid addition to the menu of the early settlers. We also had the red foxes the first years but soon as it became more settled they left, never to come back, and then the prairie wolf or Coyote came in the place of the foxes. He is still there, the prairie chicken came at the same time as the Coyotes.\n\nIn 1930 in Vancouver, B. C., Richard Reilly and myself having been in the city for fifteen years, felt that we ought to have an opportunity to meet many of our old friends from the prairie who were now living here. We got together and formed the Heward and Stoughton Old Boys Association. We have a picnic in Stanley Park the second Saturday in July and also have a social meeting in a large hall during February, thus bringing together our former associates for real pleasant time. We have had over 200 present at some of our gatherings which shows it has been worthwhile. Mrs. Bert Newett (nee Irene Aldrich) of Heward, was our last president, and C. E. Allin secretary, from Stoughton.\n\nOne of our homesteaders being over zealous thought we ought to have a flour mill at Heward, organized and sold stock for the same to us fellows. Well the mill was erected about 1906, but no machinery was installed and during the next summer in July it was wrecked by a tornado. In a tall building such as this was with very heavy timbers, there should have been double bracing from the cross timbers to the supporting posts, but they were absent. Harry Falconer who was standing in the livery stable doorway just South of the mill at that time of the tornado, saw it sway first to the east then west and finally east to the ground. I understand that Charlie Dempsey and his good wife built their residence in the village on the former mill site. A few months later the wreckage was auctioned off and brought $250.00 and a lot of us farmers had a good lesson.\n\nAnother fellow a year or so later organized and sold stock for the \"Heward Steel and Wire Co.\" which included in it's charter the sale to farmers of about all the necessary articles a farmer required.\n\nThere were a car or two of fence posts came to Heward through it, then it was through and again we had another expensive lesson.\n\nIn the early days the trails of the buffalo were everywhere, some of them a foot deep, their bleached bones were numerous too and the horns of them were most splendid when scraped and polished and were quite black in color. Indian arrow heads and stone hammers were found and I still have some of them, picked up as I broke the prairie.\n\nThis is a list of the early merchants in the village, not all were in business at the same time, but all before 1908: Joseph Dickey, Real Estate and boarding house; Mr. W. Bishop, blacksmith; J. F. Robertson, blacksmith; Bob Adams, livery barn; Fred Kneshaw, Implements and livery barn; J. M. Adams, Real Estate, Insurance etc.; Taylor brothers, Jim, Geo. Mel., cartage; R. N. Caskey, publisher \"Heward Chronicle\"; T. A. Naismith, implements; Porter brothers, butchers; Mr. Tucker, barber; Mr. Cornish, implements; Frank Gorrell, watchmaker; R. Hay and John Thompson, Moose Mountain Hardware & Lumber; Montjoy and Glover, Hardware, lumber, J. A. Montjoy and Art Glover; J. W. O'Harrow, General merchant; Frank Reinholtz, baker; Joseph Awe, Real Estate; McVicar and Davidson, Real Estate; Joseph Hiltz, Grain Elevator; L. H. Perkin, blacksmith; Dr. Fred Hiltz, Medical Dr. & Drugs; Lort Williamson, Real Estate; Newton P. Crich, Postmaster and Real Estate; Robert Sawer, implements; Wm. Crosby, C. P. R. Station agent; Geo. Paul, furniture; Richard Billingsley, carpenter; Docker & Fraser, General Merchants, Geo. Docker.\nHomesteading 35 miles from a town Arcola for four years before a railway arrived and hauling grain that far to market was no easy task for any man or his horses. The hauling firewood from Moose Mountain 25 miles away or coal from Estevan 60 miles distant, though it only cost $1.75 per ton at the mines then, and the mosquitos during all the summer long, when we had to wear broad rimmed straw hats with netting over them, wearing gloves and the legs of an old sock for wristlets, even then we had plenty mosquito bites. The horses suffered too from them as soon as you unhitched them from the plow, at times they would roll with the harness on to get some relief from them. Luckily I had a sod roof on my stable keeping it cool thereby the mosquitos left the horses as soon as they entered the stable, enjoying the night in peace but had to face them again in the morning. When I now look back on what we got from this experience it really is something to remember. After filing on our homestead we had to drive to Alameda, seventy eight miles to the Land Registry Office.\n\nIn the 1914-1918 World War, many enlisted and went overseas to fight for us. Reward and area were not slow in signing up and several gave their all. God rest their souls. Here is the list of them, all with an asterisk before the names of those gallant boys who did not return. Also the list of those who signed up in the Second World War 1939-1945, many of these did not get overseas, but I do not know who they were but they were ready to go:\n\n* Wm. N. Reilly, *E. B.

I built or helped build their houses and they plowed for me in return, as most of us were bachelors and lived alone. When one had to go for wood, which we were allowed to cut in abandoned Indian Reserves viz; \"Measants Rump and Ocean Man\" by getting a permit from the Mounties, gratis. One neighbour took his extra horse and his pigs over to his neighbour to keep while away and his friend did likewise when he went for wood or to Arcola which was always a two day trip and sometimes three. It was good dry poplar, the fire having run over the forest a couple of years before, the bark had dropped off and the wood beautifully dry and firm, the size of the trees were from five to eight inches thick.\nKen B.

Adams hall;\n\nHomesteaders 35 miles from a town inola for four years before a railway was built and hauling grain that far to market was no easy task for any man or his horse. The hauling of firewood from Moose Mountain 25 miles away or coal from Steven 60 miles distant, though it only cost $1.75 per ton when we had to wear broad rimmed straw hats with netting over them, wearing gloves and the legs of an old sock for whistles even then we had unbuttoned mosquito bites. The horses suffered too much as soon as you unhitched them from the plow at times they would roll on the harness as soon as you got them off the plow from then. Luckily I had a good roof on my stable keeping it cool thereby the mosquitos left the horses as soon as they entered the stable enjoying the night in peace but had to face them again in the morning.\n\nWhen I now look back on what we got from this experience it really is something to be remembered. After filling up our homestead we had to drive to Inola, seventy eight miles to the Land Registry Office.\n\nIn the 1914-1918 World War many enlisted and went overseas to fight for us.

I built or helped build their houses and they helped me in return, as most of us were bachelors and lived alone. When one had to go for work which we were allowed to cut in abandoned Indian Reserves viz. Sergeant Bump and Orson Man by getting a permit from the Indian Reserve agent. My neighbour took his extra horse and his pigs over to his neighbour to keep while away and his friend did likewise when he went for wood or coals. It was always a two day trip and sometimes three. It was very dry in the spring, the fires burning run over the forest a couple of years before the bark had dropped off and the wood beautifully dry and firm, the size of the trees were from five to eight inches thick.\nPrairie fires swept through our area in September 1900-1-2, set by the C. P. R. engine on the Weyburn Line from North Portal to Moose Jaw; the fire of 1902 burned some of our stacks of grain, mine included, jumping the plowed fire guards aided by winds. Later years there were no big prairie fires as the land became cultivated. Our houses were always open to help new comers and never locked while we were there. For instance, the trail North West ran very close to my gateway, to my pasture field, and one night was pretty dark and a traveller coming up the trail got into my pasture field, after going around the field a couple of times he again got out and made his way to my house, knocked, waked me up, and asked me the way to Jack Geddes place, I said you better feel your way along the wall and get in with me till morning for you will never find your way to his place this dark night, which he did.\n\nPerhaps many of you who were farmers like myself and came early as settlers and homesteaders and have had some thoughts of the unfairness of the Government with us who bore the privation, loneliness and hardship and labor of early pioneers and got very little remuneration from our early day crops. Its true we got our homesteads for $10.00, but we stayed and put up with the hardships, improved our lands, which enhanced the neighbouring lands which we were not able to purchase, but the Government reserved all the Mineral rights for themselves. Its not every one that can shut himself up from the world as we did homesteading in the wilderness and take it and remain sane, and some did not. Of course at that time there was very little thought of what was under our feet and we walked around for a long time on top of a lot of money (oil) and did not know that it was there, but in the early fifties, really it was in January 15th, 1953 the \"Tide Water Oil Co.\" drilled north of the village of Forget to 3,920 feet and struck the greatest oil well in Saskatchewan and the test officially established it produced 150 barrels an hour. The oil has 29.5 gravity and comes from the Madison formation of the Mississippi zone and the well is called Tide Water Forget Crown #1 in the Willison Basin area. The company capped the well.\n\nNow the Government comes forth and tax us for the mineral rights if we hold any land taxable with those rights at 3 cents per acre per year and make those taxes retroactive back to 1945, and if not paid by May 1st they begin legal action to claim the oil rights for themselves, but this is not all either, they exonerate all the Canadian Pacific Railway who hold vast last acreage either side of their railways and all their town sites on the railways from any mineral tax of 3\u00a2 per acre. Now we, the early settlers were the ones that made their lands increase in great value. Do you not think that this is unfair and can you ever forget the injustice of it?\n\nA winter tragedy, winter of 1902-3.\n\nFrank Finn and Walter Mustard were fairly close homesteaders North West of me and Frank one evening went over to see Walter Mustard to pass the time the long winter evening, a storm arose when Frank left for home, the storm continued for a couple of days, when Walter went over to Frank's house, he was not there and his bed had not been slept in. He notified the neighbours and the Mounties who organized a general search by all of us neighbours. But no Frank could be found. When the snow began to melt in the early spring, Jack Pollok went out to get his cattle on evening, they were out on a little knoll where the snow had melted and there he found Frank's remains. He had waded through a heavy grass slough and did not get very far after that, he had wandered several miles with the storm. His moccasins which he had been wearing were found in a little pile he had been carrying when he left Walter's cabin. Dr. Roy Mustard who is living in Vancouver now was staying with his brother at the time, was the last person to see Frank Finn alive.\nPrairie fires swept through our area in September 1900-1-2, set by the C.

Name, place & county:\nFondiwick, Vernon County, Ontario, Province\n\nWhat was your father's name & occupation?\nJames Harris, Farmer\nConvention of Baptist Churches of British Columbia\n\nTo Members and Friends,\nThe Convention of Baptist Churches,\nBritish Columbia.\n\nDear Friends:\n\n\"Go in and possess the land\" was the challenging theme of our last Convention and we hope that something of the thought and vision presented on that occasion has been passed on to all our churches, by the delegates who attended.\n\nThe maintenance and steady growth of each existing church is basic to the outreach of our denomination into new fields, and this aspect of our privilege and responsibility will call for continued loyalty to our own church, in prayer, regular attendance, service and financial support.\n\nRecurring throughout the Convention meetings, however, was the expressed conviction, that, without lessening participation in the work of our own church, we must strengthen some of our weaker causes, helping them towards self-support, and in addition advance into new areas where opportunities are outstanding and needs are so urgent.\n\nIt is felt that qualified lay workers would be available in sufficient numbers for the establishment of Sunday School and Mission work as well as those ordained for the Ministry, when occasion required. In the consideration of this outreach however, a sense of frustration seems to recur when it is realized that our present Convention financial resources are quite inadequate to the requirement of an aggressive forward movement.\n\nThis gave rise to the suggestion that in addition to the stewardship of \"giving\" the question of stewardship in the use of money by way of \"loan\" might be considered, and your Board was instructed to survey this possibility.\n\nAs a result, a plan has been prepared and approved which calls for the setting up of what may be termed a Convention Investment Fund.\n\nThe suggested objective of the fund is $60,000. With such an amount available, a number of carefully selected and approved projects could be adequately launched, and with the impetus that could be expected from new causes well started, we could anticipate that in a minimum of time they would become self-supporting.\n\nThe Fund would be established from loans made by members and friends of our Convention. The loans would be repayable during ten years, an equal proportion being paid back each year, together with interest at 8 per cent. As an example, a person loaning $300 would at the end of the first year be repaid 1/10th of this amount, viz: $30 plus interest of $9. At the end of the second year another $30 would be repaid plus interest of $8.10 so that at the end of the 10th year the loan of $300 would have been repaid together with interest over the period amounting to $49.50.\n\nWe believe that there may be many persons who feel that they are sacrificially \"giving\" all that they consider possible, but who would be willing and able to \"loan\" some amount for investment in our Master's kingdom, being assured that at a stated date each year a proportion of the loan would be repaid with interest.\n\nIt is not contemplated that the total amount received in the Investment Fund would be used in outright gifts to new projects or causes requiring aid, but that at least 50% would be by way of loan to be subsequently repaid to the Fund. A proportion of the Fund would therefore be used on a revolving basis.\n\nGuarantee for the repayment to those investing will be the responsibility of the whole Convention. Not less than one-tenth of the amounts initially subscribed will be held and invested in Government Bonds to secure repayment of Principal and interest for the first year. Subsequent amounts required for repayment will be included in the Convention Budget in addition to the amounts which in due course will return to the Fund on the revolving basis referred to above.\n\nIn order to determine the extent to which our friends will participate in this Investment Fund we are asking you to give earnest consideration to this proposed plan, and complete and return the attached memorandum.\n\nYou will note that if the sum you are prepared to loan is not immediately available, a date more convenient to you may be specified.

We must strengthen some of our weaker churches, help others in their needs, and in addition advance into new areas where opportunities are our standing and needs are so urgent.\n\nIt is felt that trained lay workers would be available in sufficient numbers for the establishment of Sunday School and Mission work as well as those ordained for the Ministry. When occasion required, in the consideration of this outreach however, a sense of frustration seems to recur when it is realized that our present Convention financial resources are quite inadequate to the requirement of an aggressive forward movement.\n\nThis gave rise to the suggestion of \"giving\" the question of stewardship in the use of money by way of \"loan\" might be considered, and your Board was instructed to survey this possibility.\n\nAs a result, a plan has been prepared and approved which calls for the setting up of what may be termed a Convention Investment Fund.\n\nThe suggested objective of the fund is $60,000. With such an amount available, a number of carefully selected and approved projects could be adequately launched, and within the time frame that could be expected from new names well started, we could anticipate that in a minimum of time they would become self-supporting.\n\nThe Fund would be established from loans made by members and friends of our Convention. The loans would be repayable during ten years at an equal proportion being paid back each year, together with interest at 5 per cent. As an example, a person loaning $300 would at the end of the first year have repaid $30 (1/10th of this amount, viz., $30) plus interest of $9. At the end of the second year another $30 would be repaid together with interest over the period amounting to $18.50. At the end of the tenth year the loan of $300 would have been repaid together with interest over the period amounting to $145.50.\n\nWe believe that there may be many persons who feel that they are sacrificing \"giving\" all that they can afford possible, but who would be willing and able to \"loan\" a portion of their investment in our Master's kingdom, being assured that at a stated date each year a portion of the loan would be repaid outright and the remaining balance would be used on a revolving basis.\n\nA proportion of the Fund would be used in outright repayment of Principal and Interest for the first year. Subsequent amounts repaid for repayment will be included in the Convention Budget in addition to the amount which in due course will return to the Fund on the revolving basis referred to above.\n\nIn order to determine the extent to which our friends will participate in this Investment Fund we are asking you to give earnest consideration to this proposed plan, and complete and return the attached memorandum.\n\nYou will note that if the sum you are prepared to loan is not immediately available, a date more convenient to you may be specified. The extent to which you participate in this Fund will be confidential to small committee, and it would be greatly appreciated if with as little delay as possible you will complete and mail your response to the Secretary of the Board.\n\nAs an example the fund could be raised if:\n\n| Persons | Loan Amount |\n|---------|-------------|\n| 40      | $50.00      |\n| 100     | $100.00     |\n| 200     | $200.00     |\n| 300     | $300.00     |\n| 400     | $400.00     |\n| 500     | $500.00     |\n| 600     | $600.00     |\n| 700     | $700.00     |\n| 800     | $800.00     |\n| 900     | $900.00     |\n| 1000    | $1,000.00   |\n\n$900\n\nIt is our earnest hope that back and beyond the consideration of this project from the financial point of view, we will all envisage the spiritual returns which will result from the use of the total sum invested, believing that it will bring forth fruit, some thirty some sixty and some an hundred fold in the harvest that will be gathered for our Lord.

What means of transportation did you use?\n   Canadian Pacific Railway from Toronto to Saskatoon.\n\n14. What incidents of the journey will do you remember?\n   (People you met on the way, meetings with Indians, adventures on the journey, accidents or other excitement, etc.)\n   The bunk on the train was pretty hard for sleeping. In northern Ontario the train stopped in a sparse settled district & there were coils of hay beside the tracks, so my schoolmate George Leplam & I got some of the hay for our bunk; it was fine from then on.\n\n15. Where did you stay when you arrived in Saskatchewan?\n   At Mr. Irving & Hamilton Caldwells. Two bachelors living together, who had taken up homesteads in the district.\n\n16. Where did you settle or take up land?\n   The N.E./4-32-9-9-W-2nd. This district was called the \"Moose Mountain\" district but was west of the \"Moose Mountains,\" around twenty-five miles.\n\n   The village of Hemond, a little later was located on Hamilton Caldwell's farm and was my local village, only four miles from my homestead which was north-west.\n\n17. Mention any other places where you have lived since coming to Saskatchewan.\n   Always lived there till I left in March 1915 and came to Vancouver, B.C.\n12. Did you travel on a train yourself? If so, how did you feel about it?\n\n13. What was your favorite part of the journey? Why?\n\n14. Did you meet anyone interesting during your trip? If so, who were they?\n\n15. How long did your trip take? What was the weather like during your journey?\n\n16. Did you visit any famous landmarks or attractions? If so, which ones?\n\n17.

Is there any particular experience of pioneer days that stands out in your memory which you would like to record?\n\nYes, Homesteading 35 miles from a town viz. Arcola. For four years before a railway arrived and hauling grain that far to market was no easy task for any man or his horse. The hauling of firewood from Moose Mountain 25 miles away or coal from Estevan 60 miles distant though it only cost $1.75 per ton at the mines there, and the mosquitoes during all the summer long when we had to wear broad brimmed straw hats with nothing over them, meaning gloves and the leg of an old sock for wristlets even then we had plenty mosquito bites. The horses suffered too from them, as soon as you unwhiskled them from the plow they would roll with harness on to get some relief from them, luckily I had a red rope on my stable keeping them cool thereby the mosquitoes left the stable as soon as they entered enjoying the night but I had to face them again in the morning when I went back to what we got from this experience was worth all we went through.\n\nDid you travel much in the early years? (For business, attending church, visiting friends, etc.) How often? How far? by what means of travel?\n\nNot much, the first year no church services next year a missionary from the Presbyterian Church held an occasional service in one of the homesteaders houses he was Rev. Remie a brother of the \"Remies Seed House\" owner in Toronto. Out he road horseback farmers used their team & wagon and those never went many at the service for homesteaders were few first two years later they flocked in and we had more frequent Sunday services and the Methodists had a missionary in our area.\nConvention of Baptist Churches of British Columbia\n\nTo Members and Friends,\nThe Convention of Baptist Churches,\nBritish Columbia.\n\nDear Friends:\n\n\"Go in and possess the land\" was the challenging theme of our last Convention and we hope that something of the thought and vision presented on that occasion has been passed on to all our churches, by the delegates who attended.\n\nThe maintenance and steady growth of each existing church is basic to the outreach of our denomination into new fields, and this aspect of our privilege and responsibility will call for continued loyalty to our own church, in prayer, regular attendance, service and financial support.\n\nRecurring throughout the Convention meetings, however, was the expressed conviction, that, without lessening participation in the work of our own church, we must strengthen some of our weaker causes, helping them towards self support, and in addition advance into new areas where opportunities are outstanding and needs are so urgent.\n\nIt is felt that qualified lay workers would be available in sufficient numbers for the establishment of Sunday School and Mission work as well as those ordained for the Ministry, when occasion required.

To this day the three churches are still holding services and at late years the Pentecostal people are active too, all have places of worship in our village.\n\n25 When was the first car used in the community?\n1909 - Newton Creek our Post master had a used Ford. Did you own a car before 1914, when did you buy it? What make?\nDid not own one and never did (old fashioned)\n\n26 Where was your trading center? How far from your home?\nI was near Newton Creek, North West NE 32-9-942\n(1914) believe that ARCOIA - 25 miles distant\n\n27 Did you continue to trade there? (Indicate any changes due to new towns appearing, better means of travel, etc.)\nYes, all the villages either side of us were much alike and handled mostly the same supplies we needed. Of course for the first four years Arcola was our trading center.\n\n28 How often did you shop in the early days?\nIn the early spring, after seeding, before harvest, then as frequently as we could manage when marketing grain or what had to take our extra horses, pigs or what had of stock to be kept by our neighbors while we went to Arcola, for it was a two day trip sometimes three. We cared for the neighbor's stock where he took grain to market too.\n24 continued\n\nand soon as the village I and the Caribou II appeared it was not long till we knew these characters, the any liens too, which as some thought it was too much for such a parade. To this day the three Dene brothers of the still living married and all from the Caribou II, all have been friends of ourself.\n\n25 When was the first heard in the community? (Before 1945 when did you)\n\n1909 - Nez Perce asked our Government help and\n\n26 Did you ever own land or homestead? (Did you)\n\n27 What was your trading custom? (Did you)\n\n28 Did you ever live at Faroca? (Did you)\n\n29 How often did you adapt in the same days?\n\n30 In the winter there was no work, after we got here we had to take our extra time to work for ourselves.

When (if ever) did people in your district first start going to town regularly on Saturdays?\n\n1904 when the Railway went through that summer, we were glad to meet our neighbors there and get the necessaries of life from the merchants so near us as four miles.\n\n31. When (if ever) did you first begin to buy through the mail order catalogue? What kind of articles did you buy in this way? Indicate also what portion of your total purchases were by mail order and any changes in proportion of purchases made by mail order since the pioneer period?\n\nI bought 34 horse harnesses, which firms in the village did not carry. This, of course, was in 1905 after the Railway arrived but I bought very little by mail order though in 1910 the station agent told me there was more mail order freight came this station than all the village store bought. That was not fair to our merchants.\n\n32. When did you first have a telephone and what company provided it?\n\nIn 1911 a neighbor adjoining homestead Thomas Steele and myself organized the \"Howard Rural Telephone Company\" with other neighbors all on the one line in the country but not in the village. Tom was Secretary-Treasurer and I was President. It was wonderful to be able to communicate with thirteen good neighbors especially on urgent matters which did occur sometimes. Our line was merged in with other rural lines formed later and the main line from Regina where it entered Howard a few years after, but it had served us well.

SLOAT\nChairman of Convention Board\nWhen you came to Dakota Territory the first time was it with the idea of staying permanently? Or did you make up your mind after trying it out? When did you make this decision?\n\nNo, I had no idea when I left for the West that I was going to stay there. I went because I heard so much about it from friends who had been there. These tales of the West intrigued me that the first chance I had to go West I would take it. This opportunity came the summer of 1893 when I was visiting my home. The trip was most interesting all the way for I had not taken any very distant trips until this one. When we came to the prairie it appealed to me for its vastness, and at once my mind went back to my school days and the beautiful poem we studied at school \"THE PRAIRIES\" by William Cullen Bryant, which explains the prairies so wonderfully. Read it if you have never done so! We de-trained at Griswold. Immediately it was threshing time and when I saw the amber wheat rolling out of the threshing machine by the thousands of bushels I said to myself I am going to do this too, that's when I make my decision to have a farm in the West. No homesteads to be taken up around the area I was now located in and I had to gather a little to start farming, so I worked at carpentry work for a couple of years. Then took up my homestead.\nConvention of Baptist Churches of British Columbia\n\nTo Members and Friends,\nThe Convention of Baptist Churches,\nBritish Columbia.\n\nDear Friends:\n\n\"Go in and possess the land\" was the challenging theme of our last Convention and we hope that something of the thought and vision presented on that occasion has been passed on to all our churches, by the delegates who attended.\n\nThe phenomenal and steady growth of each existing church is basic to the outreach of our denomination into new fields, and this aspect of our privilege and responsibility will call for continued loyalty to our own church, in prayer, regular attendance, service and financial support.\n\nRecurring throughout the Convention meetings, however, was the expressed conviction, that, without lessening participation in the work of our own church, we must strengthen some of our weaker causes, helping them towards self-support, and in addition advance into new areas where opportunities are outstanding and needs are so urgent.\n\nIt is felt that qualified lay workers would be available in sufficient numbers for the establishment of Sunday School and Mission work as well as those ordained for the Ministry, when occasion required.

At the end of the second year another $30 would be repaid plus interest of $8.10 so that at the end of the 10th year the loan of $300 would have been repaid together with interest over the period amounting to $49.50.\n\nWe believe that there may be many persons who feel that they are sacrificially \"giving\" all that they consider possible, but who would be willing and able to \"loan\" some amount for investment in our Master's kingdom, being assured that at a stated date each year a proportion of the loan would be repaid with interest.\n\nIt is not contemplated that the total amount received in the Investment Fund would be used in outright gifts to new projects or causes requiring aid, but that at least 50% would be by way of loan to be subsequently repaid to the Fund. A proportion of the Fund would therefore be used on a revolving basis. Guarantee for the repayment to those investing will be the responsibility of the whole Convention. Not less than one-tenth of the amounts initially subscribed will be held and invested in Government Bonds to secure repayment of Principal and interest for the first year. Subsequent amounts required for repayment will be included in the Convention Budget in addition to the amounts which in due course will return to the Fund on the revolving basis referred to above.\n\nIn order to determine the extent to which our friends will participate in this Investment Fund we are asking you to give earnest consideration to this proposed plan, and complete and return the attached memorandum.\n\nYou will note that if the sum you are prepared to loan is not immediately available, a date more convenient to you may be specified. The extent to which you participate in this Fund will be confidential to a small committee, and it would be greatly appreciated if with as little delay as possible you will complete and mail your response to the Secretary of the Board.\n\nAs an example the fund could be raised if:\n\n| Persons | Loaned | Total |\n|---------|--------|-------|\n| 40      | $50.00 | $2,000.00 |\n| 40      | $100.00| $4,000.00 |\n| 100     | $150.00| $15,000.00|\n| 60      | $200.00| $12,000.00|\n| 40      | $300.00| $12,000.00|\n| 10      | $500.00| $5,000.00 |\n| 10      | $1,000.00| $10,000.00|\n\n$60,000.00\n\nIt is our earnest hope that back and beyond the consideration of this project from the financial point of view, we will all envisage the spiritual returns which will result from the use of the total sum invested, believing that it will bring forth fruit, some thirty, some sixty and some a hundred fold in the harvest that will be gathered for our Lord. Sincerely yours,\n\nJ. L. SLOAT,\nChairman of Convention Board.\nTo Members and Friends,\nThe Convention of Baptist Churches,\nBritish Columbia.\n\nDear Friends:\n\n\"Go in and press the hand,\" was the challenging theme of our last Convention and we hope that something of the thought and vision presented on that occasion has been passed on to all our churches by the delegates who attended. The emphasis placed on the growth of each existing church is basic to the outreach of our denomination and the expansion of its mission. We have heard much about the need for new churches and the importance of reaching out to the unchurched. However, there is another aspect of the missionary task which should not be overlooked. It is the need for the strengthening and revitalization of our existing churches. In many cases, these churches are experiencing difficulties due to a lack of leadership, a decline in membership, or a shortage of financial resources. It is our responsibility as members of the Baptist Church to respond to these challenges and to work together to overcome them.\n\nIn recent years, the Convention has focused on the development of a new generation of leaders through the training of pastors and deacons. This effort has been successful, and we are confident that the future of our denomination is secure. However, we must also recognize the need for the renewal of our existing churches. This can be accomplished through the implementation of a variety of programs designed to strengthen the spiritual life of our congregations.\n\nOne such program is the establishment of a new fund, known as the \"Investment Fund.\" This fund will be used to provide financial assistance to churches in need of help. The funds will be raised through contributions from individuals and churches throughout the province. The goal is to raise $50,000 over the next five years. This amount will be invested in a variety of projects designed to strengthen the spiritual life of our churches.\n\nWe believe that this fund will be an effective tool in the hands of those who are committed to the renewal of our churches. It will provide a means for us to work together to overcome the challenges we face and to build a stronger, more vibrant denomination.\n\nIn conclusion, we urge you to support this important initiative. Your contribution will be a significant step towards the renewal of our churches and the strengthening of our denomination. We thank you for your prayers and your support.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChairman of Convention Board.\nDid any people move away from your district prior to 1914? What reasons did they have for moving? Yes, and some of them were merchants of the village, others were men who were helping the farmers here, they moved farther west to take up homesteads too.\n\nDid many people move away during 1930? Did many return?\n\nYes! Some moved away north to the great plains to grow alfalfa, hogs, and cattle. Very few returned, this was later than 1914 you know.\n\nIf you or some member of your family have held public office, or have been active in any organizations, mention it here, giving dates whenever possible.\n\nYes! A Masonic Lodge was organized in 1906 by the following: Richard Reilly (who was first Master), Mosley Adams, Joseph Hude, George Daigle, Newton Clark, W. T. Hopkins, John W. O'Harra, Charles M. Bohm, and I was the fourth candidate to join the lodge. I took a real interest for it was a work I enjoyed to the fullest, the second year I was their secretary and was master of the lodge in 1912, they kept me as secretary afterward till I moved West to Vancouver to live, afterward I became a life member of my mother lodge Howard A.F.E.A.M., #27 (G.R.T.) I usually attended the yearly Grand Lodge meeting.\n\nIf you or any of your family or friends were \"first\" to have or do something in the district, mention it here giving dates whenever possible.

With such an amount available a number of carefully selected and approved projects could be adequately launched and with the emphasis there could be expected from time to time new avenues well suited to our own particular needs.\n\nThe board would be classified from loans made to members and friends of our Convention.\n\nThe loan would be classified from loans made to members and friends of our Convention. The loan would be repaid during ten years, with interest payable each year, except that the first year's interest at 3 per cent.

At the end of the second year another $50 would be repaid plus interest of $8.10 so that at the end of the tenth year the loan of $500 would have been repaid together with interest over the period amounting to $494.50.\n\nWe believe that here may be many persons who feel that the sacrifice, \"giving\" all that they consider possible, but who would be willing and able to \"loan\" some amount for investment in the future.\n\nMasters' mortgage, being assessed that a stated rate each year the sacrifice, \"giving\" all that they consider possible, but who would be willing and able to \"loan\" some amount for investment in the future.\n\nNot less than one-third of the amounts initially subscribed will be held and invested in Government Bonds to secure repayment of Principal and Interest for the first year. Subsequent amounts required for repayment will be included in the Convention Budget in addition to the amounts which in due course will return to the Fund or on the withdrawal of the Board.\n\nIn order to determine the extent to which our friends will participate in this investment Fund we are asking you to give earnest consideration to the proposed plan, and complete and return the attached memorandum.\n\nYou will note that if the sum you are prepared to loan is not immediately available, a date more convenient to you may be specified. The extent to which you participate in this Fund will be entirely dependent on you and will you respond to the Secretary of the Board.\n\nAs an example the fund could be raised if:\n\n| Amount | Number of Persons |\n|--------|------------------|\n| $200,000 | 40                |\n| $400,000 | 100              |\n| $600,000 | 150              |\n| $800,000 | 200              |\n\n$500,000\n\nChairman of Convention Board.\n\nJ.

How it got its name I do not know but some person had written the name \"LOST HORSE HILL\" by arranging small stones in the form of the letters as above, as I discovered in the summer of 1902. It is near the Moose Mountain Creek where it leaves the Long Lake which is really the widening of the creek to about one half a mile across and five miles long. I have often wondered if this hill rising from quite level prairie was one of the ancient \"Mound Builders\" mounds which they erected near creeks or rivers even on our prairie in Canada as at Pilot Mound in Southern Manitoba got its name.\n37.

Phil Munro had a store in a tent there was the first of merchants, there came Robert & Fraser, George Docker & Kenneth Freer, with a general store erected then (Montjoy & Flower) Joseph Montjoy & Art Flower, Hardware & Lumber, then Bob Adams' Livery Barn. These fellows came in the summer of 1903 but in the spring of 1904 the railway had been surveyed through the area and had located a townsite a little West but on McCalden's farm and all these merchants moved their building over to the townsite but the place of the first village was named \"CALDWELL\" and christened that name by Wm. L. Russell & Lot Williamson in 1903, all homesteaders nearby. The surveyed village on the railroad was named \"HEWARD\", naturally by the railway Company.\n\nTom Henderson moved Phil Munro's store goods from Caldwell to the Heaward village site, he was on his way to New Hope post office where Phil had his goods packed in boxes out on the snow and offered to move them, he put them down near a stake set up by Phil on the site and that was the first load of anything dumped on Heaward's site.
