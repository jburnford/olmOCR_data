The small would hold 20 pounds of butter next 40 pounds and large 60.\nThe ranchers milked about 6 to 10 cows so they made a lot of butter.\n\nNo separators then, set milk in pans in a cool place called milkhouse after the milk set 24 hours the cream was skimmed off with a tin skimmer about the size and shape of a saucer it had tiny holes in it to let the milk through but the cream being thicker it did not go through. A person had to do it fast putting the cream into a big crock. Then in a few days it had to be churned.\n\nIt sure looked good in nice big lumps the size of oranges and nearly the same color. After washing in a butter wooden bowl with wooden ladle with several changes of good cold water it was salted mixed hourly and packed in a ferkin when the ferkin was full a piece of white cloth called buttercloth was dipped in cold salty water then spread over the top off butter then the wooden lid put on tight. Some people kept their butter 2 to 3 months before taking to stores when sold the storekeeper would let you have empty ferkins to replace the full ones and you would start all over again. I like Dairy butter much better than Creamery butter.\nThe ranchers milked about 6 to 10 cows.\n\nNo refrigerators then. Let milk in pans in a cool place called \"milkhouse\" after the milk set 24 hours. The cream was skimmed off with a tin skimmer about the size and shape of a dinner plate. It had tiny holes in top to let the milk through but the cream being thicker did not go through. A person held a big crack them in a few days it had to be churned. Looked good on rich pig farms. The size of pans used and nearly wooden casks after washing in a salt water bath with wood lathes several mixed thoroughly and sealed in a pail when the milk was full a piece of white cloth called butter cloth was dipped in cold salt water then spread over the top of butter then the wooden lid put on tight. Done people kept their butter 2 to 3 months before taking to stores when sold the storekeeper would cut you have empty looking to replace his old ones and you would start all over again. I think pure milk's much better than Creamery butter!\n3.
