Have you ever had a telephone and what company provided it?\n    The first rural telephone line built in this entire\n    county was the Leo Qud Parlia Telephone Line. It was and is a\n    permanent fixture.\n\n34.

Give fruits of new name as above in (1), (2), (3).\n\nBecause such a large number of Sorsdahl families, all relatives, settled and grew up in the district the Sorsdahl school was named.\n\nThe Leo Qua Parle telephone Company was named because so many of the residents of the district came from Leo Qua Parle county in Minnesota.\n\nThe Leo Qua Parle school district derived its name in the same way.\n\nThe Village of Goodwater, just south of our homestead and a place we often visited was so named because excellent water was so plentiful.\n34.
