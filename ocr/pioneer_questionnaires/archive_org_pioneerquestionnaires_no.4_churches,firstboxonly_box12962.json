He was a fine speaker though, in church & well liked. On the way back on the prairie road, a bad electrical storm came up. It was dark only when a flash of lightning showed if we were on the road.

To what religious services did you go when you first settled in your district? The Presbyterian church service was held in my father's home. In the summer of 1885 a student by the name of McLeod held services. This was the beginning of the church in our district. McLeod was afterwards Principal of an Indian school in Regina. I believe he stayed there until he died some years later.\n\nWhere did your neighbors go to church?\n\nAnyone who cared to go to church came to our home regardless of religious connections. At first, until we got our story and a half house built, McLeod held service in our little, one-room log hut which would hold about 15 people if there were more came.\n\nHow long did you attend your church?\n\nThe first homesteaders came in May 1882 but most of them went back to Ont. for the winter and brought their families out in 1883.\n\n2. By whom were religious services held in your community before a regular church became established (by a clergyman from some other place, etc.)?\n\nGive details of the arrangement, telling where services were held, and give dates if possible. Mr. McLeod boarded at Carlyle, don't know where, and walked 15 miles Saturday to our home. He stayed all night, had service on Sunday morning and father drove him halfway back to Carlyle after service Sunday. An ordained Methodist minister was stationed at Carlyle too and sometimes walked approximately five miles east.\n\nSome of the congregation worshipped at the HOME MISSION BOARD, Toronto. This no doubt would apply to the Methodist minister, Wilson by name, as well as Mr. McLeod. Wilson was married and had a family and home at Carlyle.\n\n3. Was the school house used for church services? Give dates.\n\nThe Clare Presbyterian Log church was built in 1883. The school was not built until the fall of 1886 and not opened until the spring of 1887. It was the first teacher in the Clare School.\n\nWas there any congregation of more than one denomination on alternate Sundays? Yes, later on the Methodists used it; these were the two and only religious bodies at work in the settlement.\n\nDid the same congregation ever support both types of services and give equal financial support? No I should think not as there were enough of these two congregations to keep a church student in the summer if not the year around.\n\nWhere did the clergyman (or clergymen) live, and how far was it from the school house? The Presbyterian student boarded in a home or, there was a hotel in Carlyle. After the log church was built they boarded with Mr. John Hines' home on whose farm the church stood.\n\nHow did he get to the school house to conduct services? Many of the students walked as much as twenty miles on Sunday leaving Saturday morning or after Sunday service for as many as three Sunday services in the day. They might get a drive at times.\n\nWere the students in homes or supplied with accommodation for the night?\n\nThe best was always given to the minister. They were usually loved and great reverence was accorded them. The pioneers were a hospital people and no one was ever permitted to leave without a meal or bed if needed, be they missionary of Jewish packmen.\n\nWere services continued throughout the winter months, as well as other seasons of the year? Yes when ordained men were in the field. Students had to report back for study in September or October at Winnipeg or Toronto.\n\nWho put on the fire for school house services in winter? Sometimes the winter church service was held in a home because it was warmer and more a room for horses other than the farmer living nearest the church would put the fire on.\n\nWhat other charges, or appointments, etc., is a sweeping question to answer. Our two ministers were the Rev. Wm. MacKillop who had a full swing all the way to A FILE O' BONES 113 miles as the crow flies West. There was a Presbyterian man, Wm. Patterson, east and south Alameda-Orchard direction in 1882-3 and another at Mossemin north 75 miles away.\n\nDescribe the financial arrangements. I am not in a position to do this but the most of their salary came from the Home Mission Board at Toronto. I can't remember what salary they got tho I would likely know at the time. The homesteaders gave willingly what money they could but they were still striving for a living themselves and money scarce.\n\n4. Were homes or other buildings used as stores used for church services in your country? Never. Describe the arrangements. We had log churches until the railway came in 1900 and then in 1904 we built a brick building in town and it is still being used as a United Church. The first pioneer log was burned and a second one built in 1895. This was built after seeding and before having a young man Skae, by name, was student that summer. Mr. Skae retired from the ministry and now farms near Kennedy, Sask. This church was also logs from Moose Mountain taken out and built by the young men of the congregation. This was used by both Methodists and Presbyterians until the brick Methodists built their frame church in the town of Arcola in '02.\n5. If you had a church building, give the date it was built, 1885\n   Who designed the building? The young homesteaders of the district.\n   Who built it? The same young homesteaders.\n   What material was it made of? Logs. How many people did it seat? 100\n   What was the name and denomination of the church? Presbyterian.\n\n6. Describe the steps taken in arranging for the building of the church, telling who started it, how money was secured, etc.\n\n   How many families were in the congregation? 33 families\n\n7.

There would be well over a hundred people at it.\n\nJames Hay Dickie was a farmer at Carlyle 20 miles east; he took it upon himself to advertise the picnic in that district and went with his family.\n\nGoing over a boggy spot on Section 39 his wagon sank and the horses were unable to carry on. After some difficulty he managed to get help and came on up to the picnic. He acted as master of ceremonies throughout the day.\n\nJack Hislop and Jack Anderson went up and made a picnic ground by cutting trees and clearing a place in the shade to sit and built a long table with stumps and planks which they brought from home. They made seats by nailing planks to tree roots, when people arrived they took the food baskets and put them in the shade to keep cool.\n\nJack Hislop's sister, Annie (Mrs Dugald Strother) was appointed sports convener.\n\nThere was a baseball game between the Clare boys and the Carlyle boys. The Carlyle team won.\n\nAt dinner time everyone sat down to a well-set table. Long linen clothes were spread over the planks and the food was cut and put on plates and passed.

Who\nwas born, married and dead if any. There were few deaths in the pioneer days,\npossible because it was young people who had come to homestead.\n\n33.

Give dates if possible, denomination of church, and any changes which have occurred in the use of the building; that is, if some denomination other than the one who built it is now using the church, or if it is used for some other purpose.\n\nAs I have said in #10 there were many churches built later, but we would not think of them as pioneer churches after 1900. The district was developing and more or less prosperous, the long-awaited for railways were being built and little towns sprang up around some of the stations. Many foreigners came in and Lutheran and Catholic churches were built, which changed the picture, of course, but Pheasant Forks always was a Methodist district, the old memories were too poignant to permit any changes.\n\nAre all these churches in town? No If not, give distances from town, and from one another.\n\nIf not built in town, why were they not built there?\n\nThere were built many churches of various denominations to provide for the spiritual needs of a growing country.\n12. Was your church established as a home mission? The early church was.\n\nDescribe the arrangements as to finance, student ministers, etc.\n\nHave already described this.\n\n13. If families did not have a church of their own denomination in the community, did they usually go to some other church, or not attend at all? Explain.\n\nUsually they did not go at all.\n\nDid they have any special religious service of some kind in the home if they could not go to church, or if there was no public religious service?\n\nIf families had been attending and supporting a church other than their own denomination, or had not attended because their own church was not present, how well did they support their own church if it became established in their community at a later date?\n\n14. How often and at what time were services held in the church, school or other building?\n\nIn the early pioneer days the one service was held in the afternoon so the farmers could go home to do the evening chores.\n\n15. Did laymen conduct church services when a clergyman was not available? Describe the circumstances.\n\nThis has already been described.\n\n16. Did you have an organ for the service? not till Who played it?\n\nWhen was it bought? 1886\n\nHow was the money raised for it?\n\nThe organ was loaned by Mr. Chas Hewson, one of the early settlers.\n\n17. Did you have a choir? no How many were in it?\n\nWho started it? When?\n\nWere any of the persons who led the choir or sang in it trained musicians? Explain. There were several who played the organ, but no regular organist.\n\nMr. T. A. Briggs, who came to the district about 1886 or '89 was a trained musician he played the organ when he could get there.\n\n18. Was any other kind of music or musical instrument used in the services? Describe.\n\n19. What kind of religious instruction for the young, such as Sunday School or Catechism classes, were held? Give dates when they were started.\n\nThere was a Sunday School from the earliest times, about 1886 or 1887.\n\nHow often were they held? Every Sunday.\n\nHow many children attended?\n\nWho was in charge of these and helped with the teaching?\n\nMr. John Cooke was Superintendent and Mr. Chas Hewson Secretary Treasurer in fact general manager.\n\n20. What organization (or organizations) was formed to help with the support of the church? We had an Epworth League organized but not until about 1893.\n\nWhat year was it started? about 1893 How often did it meet? Weekly.\n\nHow many women or men belonged to it? About twenty or thirty.\n21. In what year was the first church picnic held? NO Where?\n\nDescribe the church picnics of early days, telling how many attended, what you had to eat and drink, what amusements there were, changes which occurred in later years, and any other details about them which you remember. (There are questions on the Pioneer Recreation Questionnaire dealing with picnics, so if you wish to give the information there, you need not repeat it here.)\n\nI do not remember there ever being a Church picnic, or Sunday School picnic.\n\nWe had an annual supper and programme for the Sunday School every Autumn, but not a money making affair. All refreshments were donated and the children served first, afterward the parents and friends.\n\n22. In what year was the first fowl supper or bazaar held? Where?\n\nWas it held every year after that? The S.S. Anniversary supper was an annual affair.\n\nWhat differences do you notice between the dishes served at the suppers in the early days, and those served now?\n\nOur suppers were sandwiches, little tarts, and cakes, not salads and such things as they are today.\n\nWhat differences are there in serving methods (help yourself, plates served already filled, etc.)?\n\nTables were set up with benches for seats and mothers and older girls and boys served the children first, then served themselves.\n\nWhat changes are there in the price of suppers?\n\nThere was no charge for these suppers.\n\nDescribe any changes which you have noticed in the needlework offered for sale, in type of work or articles brought, those that were most popular at various times, changes in price, or any other details which you may remember.\n\nThere was never a Bazaar that I can remember, no one had any money for those things in the pioneer days.\n\nWas a concert of some kind held in connection with the suppers or bazaars in the first years? Yes Describe.\n\nThere was always a programme after the supper at our annual social when the children and others would give selections of a musical nature for which we practiced for weeks, recitations, dialogues, and such.\n\n23. Describe any other activities that were carried on to assist in raising money for the church.\n\nThese were not money making affairs, if anyone wanted to make a donation to the S.S. funds they did so voluntarily. The young Bachelor farmers did this. Several Anglican families, remittance men who had money sent regularly from England used to like to help the Sunday School.\n\n24. Name any other organizations or meetings associated with the church, telling when they were started, how often they met, and their purpose and activities.\n\nThe Epworth League, which was the Young People's association in the early days met once a week, for a religious devotional meeting.\n\n25. When was any plan of systematic giving for the support of the church and clergyman adopted?\n\nI am sure there was no systematic giving, or envelopes for such\n\nOf what nature, - weekly envelopes, etc.?\n\nThere was the Missionary allowance, and the collections, if there was a shortage it was made up by some of those able to give.\n26. What interest or activity was there in the support of home missions? I do not remember there being any interest in missions except as applied to the help we received from the Missionary Society to help with our expenses.\n\n27. How far did some of the people have to travel to church service? What means of travel was used? Some came as many miles as three, five, seven ten miles. The latter not regularly but for special services when an ordained minister came.\n\n28. What nationalities were represented in the congregation, and in approximately what proportion? In the early days at Pheasant Forks the great majority were English but there were a few families from Eastern Canada.\n\n29. Were there special revival or mission services in the early days? Describe. There were very often very intensive revival or mission services when some people became very enthusiastic.\n\n30. What arrangements were there to provide for the training of the clergy? Manitoba University was organized in 1867, the Wesley College was one of the Colleges, and it was there that our young ministers went for their secular training.\n\n31. What differences did you notice in church life on the prairies as compared with the community you came from? Life started for me at Pheasant Forks. I do not think conditions regarding the Church life in England could be compared to the pioneer church as my parents knew it in the 1880's. There could be no common ground on which to make comparisons. Anyway Comparisons are odious.\n\n32. To what extent did the social life of the community centre around the church service (held in the church, school or other building) in the early days? Yes I think I can safely say that the social life of the community centered around the church in the early days.\n\n33. Is the church as important a place now of people gathering together for companionship and sociability as it was in the early years? Explain. No, I think not. Nearly all the gatherings at the church today are for money making. In the early days, after the service there would be a gathering together for a social talk.\n\n34. Is the first membership roll of your church still in the community? If you can, give the name of the person who has it. It must be there somewhere and if anyone would know of its whereabouts it would be Mr. J. W. Stillborn. Do you have any pictures or photographs of your earliest church or of homes where the first services were held, or do you know of anyone who has such pictures? Mr. Stillborn's address would be Minnie, Saskatchewan. I do not think there would be any pictures. There were no cameras.\n\n35. Describe any special features or unusual incidents of pioneer churches, or anything connected with it which you found interesting, not already mentioned. (Use other sheets, or back of this sheet if necessary.)\n39. Questions regarding historical source materials:\n\nDo you have in your possession or do you know the whereabouts of diaries, old letters, old posters and programs, minute books of community organizations, old pamphlets, old photographs, written recollections and reminiscences? (Describe).\n\nI think my brother J. L. A. Franks of Melville, Sask., would still have in his possession old minute books, letters and records, minute books of the Agricultural Society, and the Cheese factory. Unfortunately he is bedfast and cannot write, but he has a wonderful fund of knowledge about the early days. He was the first white child to be born on the colony. His birthplace was the log house which we built on the homestead, in 1883.\n\nIf it were possible for someone to call on him, he would be able to give a lot of information. He has a wonderful memory.\n\nAm enclosing a picture of what we called the new store and Post Office which Dad built in 1894. The house on the homestead built in 1883 was burned down in a prairie fire in the year 1888.\n\nWould you or the person who owns them either\n\n(1) be willing to lend them to the Provincial Archivist for copying? .......\n\n(2) be willing to present them to the Archives Division of the Legislative Library, Regina, or the Archives Office at the University in Saskatoon? .......\n\n(Indicate your preference, if any) ..................\n\n40. If you have children or grandchildren, please give their names, where they live and occupations.\n\nOn a separate sheet am enclosing a list of my parents' children and grand-children, where they live and their occupation.\n\n41. What do you think are the most important changes in your community since you first came West?\n\nWhen we went to the Pheasant Forks district in 1883, it was virgin prairie. The first very few settlers went in 1882, when the Colonization Co. was formed and the grant of land given to the Company by the Government. So there were a few little log and sod shanties or huts; one could hardly call them houses. The picture enclosed of a typical house was built by Mr. Lovendige in 1884, and afterwards shingled. It is very typical of the early houses.\n\nAbout 1890 some of the settlers who stayed built better houses, mostly lumber houses or stone and lumber.\n\nSo I would say that the most important changes were the houses. Nearly all the farms now have commodious frame houses; some of them stuccoed, others covered with the imitation brick; some are all stone. The homes and the fenced fields of waving grain and the roads that have taken the place of the prairie trails are the most important changes.\n\nPlease give the names and addresses of other pioneers who could answer this questionnaire.\n\nIf someone else has filled in this questionnaire for you, please have this person give name and address here:\n\n__________________________\n\n__________________________\nThe Primitive Methodist Colony\nW.A.

Willis\nOffice - 31 Adelaide St., Toronto, Can.\n\nThis Colonization Company was formed in the beginning of 1882, for the purpose of affording Primitive Methodists and their families and their friends of whatever religious denomination the opportunity of locating together so as to more easily secure religious, educational, and social advantages in the North West, which was then and is still attracting so many people from England and older provinces of the Dominion and the United States.\n\nIn February 1882 a grant of land was made to the Company, the land granted by the Dominion Government, being the first grant made to any company and the land granted was the first choice from among the Colonization lands of the attractive Qu'Appelle District. The company, without loss of time went to work to secure settlers. They took the lead in settlement and have been rewarded by a large number of contented hopeful colonists on their lands who speak in glowing terms of the location and their own prospects.\n\nFor many years the nearest railway station was Wolseley on the main line of the C.P.R., which was completed, from the East as far as Broadview in 1883. Settlers drove north across the Qu'Appelle Valley and river and after travelling about twenty-five or thirty miles came to the South edge of the colony, which extended some seventeen miles further north and was about twelve to eighteen miles from east to west. On the south side were the Pheasant Hills with bluffs and sloughs, part of the colony. Many of the settlers had ox teams and the trip from Wolseley to the Colony took two or three days.\n\nRev. Wm. Bee in promoting the settlement went to England and interviewed prospective settlers, some of whom paid their entrance fees for specific half sections, which they accepted on his report and recommendation. Perhaps about seventy-five percent of the early settlers and were Methodists. Others were of English stock who had lived in Ontario before coming to the Colony. Some few were Anglicans, and a number who called themselves Christians and Believers, but were known as Plymouth Brethren held service every Sunday in the log house of one of the settlers. Methodist services were held in the Hall at Pheasant Forks and in the homes of the Rev. C.S. Willis, north of the Forks, in the home of Mr. T. Pallister at the extreme west of the colony.\n\nA year or so later, in the east part of the colony service was held in the home of Mr. Thos. Loveridge.\n\nTo maintain these services, the old Methodist circuit plan of local preachers was followed. Some had been \"on the plan\" as accredited preachers in the circuits from which they came. Among them were men well read in general literature and Divinity, able preachers; men of fine sterling character, altogether an outstanding group of laymen. The list included John Allen, Richard Amy, John Barnsley, Thos. Loveridge, Henry Morley, Thos. Todd.\nWm. Watts, and perhaps others. Samuel Barnsley and Jas. Glover were young men. The plan was to put younger men, beginning their work with older men in conducting a service. W. A. Cooke (the writer) was another young man associated with one of the older men.\n\nThe Manitoba Conference of the Methodist Church, early included the Colony in its list of stations, and in the Minutes of 1885 the appointment read:\n\n\"Regina District, Fort Qu'Appelle, and P.M. Colony.\u2014Oliver Darwin under superintendent of Qu'Appelle: C. S. Willis Superannuated, The Superintendent of Qu'Appelle was Superintendent of District\". Thos Lawson.\n\nThe Company's Pamphlet named J. M. Peregrin of Hamilton, as the first settler on the Colony. He opened a store at Pheasant Forks, in which the Post Office was situated, and commenced a stage from Wolseley for mail and passengers. Others in the number of \"contented, hopeful Colonists\" named in the circular are H. G. Stillborn, and three brothers, John Allen, W. J. Hartwell, J. P. Webster, Telfer Brown, James Franks (1883) who succeeded Mr. Peregrin in 1887 as Postmaster and store-keeper. The local preachers named earlier, Geo. Glover, John Cooke (father of writer) and family were from Gainsby Lincolnshire. Other names that come to mind are Alf. and Bob Kent, Wm. Kirk, Garner, Wheelon, Ward, Benner, Teece and North, who was a carpenter and dove-tailed the corners of most of the log houses the settlers built, out of logs from the Pheasant Hills.\n\nThere are still (1952) descendents of the original settlers farming on the Colony. The Stillborns, Barnsleys, Aldous, Kirks, Wards, and others. Some became tired of waiting for the promised railway and moved away to other parts nearer to the railway.\n\nI, personally, lived on the Colony for a few months only in the summer of 1883, and the spring of 1884, (although I visited my parents there often after that) I am indebted to Mr. Albert Lovendridge, Grenfell, Sask., for reminding me of people and events mentioned in these notes.

To what religious services did you go when you first settled in your district? I went with my parents to them all.\n\nWhere did your neighbors go to church?

Give details of the arrangement, telling where services were held, and give dates if possible. Father Lemont from Fort Qu'Appelle was the first to call on us 1883 or early 1884 (I think it was in the Autumn of 1883) Then Rev. R Knowles came out as a Presbyterian student 1884. They both made our place headquarters when in the vicinity. (See Questionnaire No 3, items 19-20)\n\nHow was the clergyman supported?\n\n3. Was the school house used for church services? Give dates.\n\nWas it used by congregations of more than one denomination on alternate Sundays?\n\nDid the same congregation ever support both types of services and give equal financial support?

They covered a very large territory, it seems to me Mr Knowles was at our place most of the time.\n\nHe was quite a carpenter and got himself into hot water on more than one occasion, but he did a lot of good nevertheless, and later became one of Canada's most famous ministers, and an outstanding orator.\n\nIn this connection, I should relate that he practiced his sermons on the cattle in the barn. Miss Guthrie, my mother and the rest of us used to sneak down to the back of the barn to listen, and when Sunday came we pretty well knew his sermon off by heart. I remember him teaching my youngest brother to make a speech. He stood him on the table and said \"Now say after me: 'Ladies and Gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to appear before you today!...and so on'\". And believe it or not that boy turned out to be a good speaker.\n5.

When did you have a resident clergyman? About 1898. Where did he come from? Calico.\n\nWhat provision was made for living quarters for him\u2014a residence built, etc.? The Methodist built a house. The Presbyterians, however, had his young wife get work in a neighboring farm house.\n\n10. Did any other denomination use this church building for services? Yes.\n\nDescribe the arrangement. The Presbyterians used it for other years, paying a small rent each service being held alternately morning and evening.\n\n11. Tell what other churches were built in your community, either before your church was built, or any time since. Give dates if possible, denomination of church, and any changes which have occurred in the use of the building\u2014that is, if some denomination other than the one who built it is now using the church, or if it is used for some other purpose. The Presbyterians built a small frame church in 1909, owing to some difficulty with the Methodist between 20 times of Oliver. When Union was consecrated in 1923, this building was sold to the Methodists and demolished.\n\nAre all these churches in town? No. If not, give distances from town, and from one another. They were close together, eight miles to take miles.\n\nIf not built in town, why were they not built there? Too far to go at that time when we had no cars. The towns had churches also.\n12. Was your church established as a home mission? I believe so.\n\nDescribe the arrangements as to finance, student ministers, etc.\n\nWell, the people contributed all they could. I believe the balance was met by their own money fund. Later, they became self-supporting.\n\n13.

Explain.\n\nYes, at that time people attended church, even though it may not have been the denomination they were brought up in.\n\nDid they have any special religious service of some kind in the home if they could not go to church, or if there was no public religious service?\n\nIn the neighboring district, Chickney, they did also hold camp meetings outside. Some homes.\n\nIf families had been attending and supporting a church other than their own denomination, or had not attended because their own church was not present, how well did they support their own church if it became established in their community at a later date? I believe in most cases they stayed with the ones they had been supporting.\n\n14. How often and at what time were services held in the church, school or other building? Every Sunday. Then we had two denominations in my settlement, Methodist and Baptist, morning and evening.\n\n15. Did laymen conduct church services when a clergyman was not available?

What organization (or organizations) was formed to help with the support of the church? W.M.S., and Ladies Aid about 1898.\n\nWhat year was it started? About 1910.\n\nHow often did it meet? Once a month.\n\nHow many women or men belonged to it? All women, a dozen or more.\n\nAll other aid to Sunday School.\nI feel that with regard to Sunday School while in the first year or so the neighbors met in their homes and conducted as good a school as they could. It should be made clear here that the real father of the Sunday School was the Rev. Mr. Geo. Anderson who came to the district in 1882, one of the very earliest settlers. When the school house was built Mr. Anderson organized Sunday School under denominational, attended it every Sabbath. He presided over it until he left the district in the late nineties. Much credit is due to Mr. Anderson for his tireless efforts to have the children taught the Word of God. We used to have small tickets with a Bible verse on them. We learned them and when we had five we returned them and received a large reward card to keep. We also had prizes, \"Bible jewels.\" The King's Biscuit I believe these supplies were ordered from Toronto.\n\nIn the first years the services being held in the school house the school organ was of course used. Later when the churches were built funds were raised donations made and each church had its own organ.\n21. In what year was the first church picnic held? 1878 Where? Deerfield\n\nDescribe the church picnics of early days, telling how many attended, what you had to eat and drink, what amusements there were, changes which occurred in later years, and any other details about them which you remember.

What differences did you notice in church life on the prairies as compared with the community you came from?\n\nIt was very different from what I was used to. I am sorry to say that at this time there is not the interest in spiritual matters that there was in the first years.\n\n32.

Somers, formerly minister here.\n\n35. Describe any special features or unusual incidents of pioneer churches, or anything connected with it which you found interesting not already mentioned.\n\nI think I have told you about this. I believe this communion roll would be in possession of the United Church at Abernethy. Mr. Reid would probably be able to tell you.\nOne incident I am going to relate, whether not asked for. This is to do with the Indian Rebellion of 1835.\n\nNear the Qu'Appelle Valley, on the plains where off I have written, there were a few pioneer settlers about seven or eight families. Rumors came from time to time about the uprising of the Indians. One day an elderly Miles man\u2014John Fischer\u2014went from house to house telling the settlers that the Indians were coming to raid the plains, warning them to hide their cattle, destroy the house, and kill as many of the settlers as they could. \"Oh,\" said Mr. Fischer, \"you will all come down to my valley.\"\n\nThe men decided that a meeting should be held. They gathered together at the home of Mr. Tim Perkins on Sunday morning. The meeting was opened with prayer by Mrs. Anderson, who later organized the Sabbath School.\n\nPlans were discussed. Some spoke of building a fort, others didn't want to build anything. They came up with all their farm implements and whatever they could get. The idea was abandoned. There were small babies and it was very exciting. Without being attacked, finally Mr. Perkins stood up tall, speaking for bidding. A real pioneer man! \"Well neighbors, put your selves in my place. I have a good wife, children, and a good fight. My children come with me.\"\n\nThis seemed to decide the little meeting. They closed with the old hymn \"What a Friend We Have in Jesus.\" Oh, we weak and heavy laden, combined with a load of our precious sorrow still goes rising. Take it to the Lord in Prayer.\"\n\nThey returned to their homes. This settlement was never attacked. They did come across some Indians but they were always friendly.\nThe not\n\nIndians\n\nclaim when\n\nhorses settle\n\nrumors come\n\nthe Indians\n\nwent from\n\nthe Indians\n\nled the\n\nkilled\n\n\"of,\" said\n\n\"my valley.\"\n\nThey gathered\n\nmorning.

How often did it meet?\n\nHow many women or men belonged to it?\nNote to the Bank for $350.00: Even some old farmers didn't have to borrow; the amount got together was enough to start building a real church which is still in existence today.\n\nIn 1953, 70 years later, we moved to St. Hubert where we still live. Our parish's first church was built on the North side of the Repentance Creek by a few nobles coming from France, an ancient priest until 1803 when missionary fathers came over from France. The rich nobles had disappeared by that time, their estates divided to two dozen. The first church was built on the opposite side of creek as the population resided on this side and the river had a few small wooden bridges here & there. So the folks set to work taking church apart very carefully, saving the beautiful stained windows to use on new church. There was a fine tabernacle of the Annunciation in a coat of frame. It was set at the back of left wall in the new church. This new building had a large basement with dining room bedrooms for the priest & lay brothers who came with them to do the farm work, milking cows, gardening & cooking in kitchen. Washing, churning were also done by these non-paid brothers. These missionaries had brought money, so was put in building fund along with old material & a bit of help from parishioners & a real pine church was the result. Later they built a large cement building as presbytery. Meanwhile the sisters of Ste. Croix came also from France to start a school for the district.\n\nThey used the church basement for that purpose & also kept a few boarders at $5.00 a month! Then in around 1920 Father Bricout, the Superior of the community told the ladies they'd better ask the Dept. of Education to help us in getting a public school district & its teachers. Getting the $25.00 a month grant, this was done & in no time at all we had a school house with proper lighting from many windows & a large central furnace, surrounded by a coat of steel drum to keep the heat away from those sitting close to it. Meanwhile the sisters started building a real boarding school & convent. They had chosen a better spot next west of church where well water was plentiful out of the best, one of these wells was dug through sand & never yielded even when parched. They got the use of for horses or cattle on the dry years around 1937 when the river & streams dried out. But in 1935 the church burnt down from an lingering oil lamp burning apart from chairs, so badly hooked, the rugs were saturated with the oil & caused an awful smoke so that it was impossible to save anything, once before it had been struck by\n21.

Of pastor's pay, etc.\nlightning on the roof, but the fire had been put out by a bucket brigade. So until a new church was built we used the parish hall close to convent. In 1940 the missionaries were down their large cement building meant to lodge school boys too old for common school, but having no proper teachers, the idea had been dropped, & new church for a smaller building more in keeping with their numbers & not so hard to heat. A long time back, the dear old hardworking Brother had died here, one had left with a cure buried there. In 1940 we celebrated the golden jubilee of the parish; Bishop Matthew of Regina blessed a monument to our lady in front of the church, then we all went to the convent\u2014now the old folks home\u2014at the bishop's blessing of all its occupants. Then the crowd drove or walked across the Pigeon creek valley, up the southwest hill to the foot of a large cement cross commemorating the golden jubilee of the parish. We then returned to the church for thanksgiving & some sermon. Some old timers had tears in their eyes as they remembered the times when the only meat to be had for christening or burials could be got from the Indians mission at Crooked Lake, & one man had to be buried without a religious service. Also when 5-6 babies were christened in a row! Most likely by Rev. Father Lepage or Campbell, of Crooked Lake Mission.

Besides a good training school, we had at least two.\n\n32. To what extent did the social life of the community centre around the church service (held in the church, school or other building) in the early days?\n\n33.

(There are questions on the Pioneer Recreation Questionnaire dealing with picnics, so if you wish to give the information there, you need not repeat it here.)\n\nPicnics were common affairs usually held in the school yard following the Sunday morning church service which was held in the school building. Everyone in the community would bring what food they could. The food was all spread on blankets on the ground in one long column and everyone would sit around and chat. Groups or cliques of people going off to various corners to eat their picnic lunch was unheard of in those days. People got caught up on conversations and happenings of interest in the community this way.\n\n22. In what year was the first fowl supper or bazaar held? Where?\n\nAs soon as the Church was built fowl suppers were held. Was it held every year after that? Yes it was an annual event.\n\nWhat differences do you notice between the dishes served at the suppers in the early days, and those served now? This has not changed a great deal\u2014usually conducted in the same manner today as in the early days. Perhaps not quite so many items of food are donated today as were in those days.\n\nWhat differences are there in serving methods (help yourself, plates served already filled, etc.)? I think most fowl suppers today are served in the same method as in the early days\u2014help yourself idea. Everything is put on the tables and you take as much as you like.\n\nWhat changes are there in the price of suppers? In the early days a fowl supper cost us approximately .25\u00a2 complete compared to as much as $1.75 today.\n\nDescribe any changes which you have noticed in the needlework offered for sale, in type of work or articles brought, those that were most popular at various times, changes in price, or any other details which you may remember. We had no bazaars in the very early days where the women could display needlework etc.\n\nWas a concert of some kind held in connection with the suppers or bazaars in the first years? Describe.\n\nThe usual practice was to hold a variety concert following a fowl supper.\n\n23. Describe any other activities that were carried on to assist in raising money for the church.

Name any other organizations or meetings associated with the church, telling when they were started, how often they met, and their purpose and activities.\n\nThere was no other organization than the Ladies Aid, but they really did not make many decisions re the Church and its activities. When the people of the community attended the Sunday picnics a general discussion (mostly by the men of the community) would be held, and matters of importance were decided upon at these social gatherings.\n\n25. When was any plan of systematic giving for the support of the church and clergyman adopted? Don't know. I do know that each family in the community supported the Church in the best they could financially and voluntarily. Of what nature, - weekly envelopes, etc.?\n26.

Yes, but cannot recall the details of such services.\n\n30. What arrangements were there to provide for the training of the clergy? None that I know of.\n\n31. What differences did you notice in church life on the prairies as compared with the community you came from?\n\n32. To what extent did the social life of the community centre around the church service (held in the church, school or other building) in the early days? All community efforts held in our district centred around the Church. All social functions, such as gatherings for picnics, community singing, etc., emanated from the work of the Church.\n\n33. Is the church as important a place now of people gathering together for companionship and sociality as it was in the early years? No, I do not think so. Explain. In the early days when there was no radio - telephone - T-V or other forms of entertainment - movies, etc., people had to rely on the Church to sponsor their entertainment and social life and of course the main socials were in the form of community picnics when everyone attended to talk and associate with their neighbors.\n\n34. Is the first membership roll of your church still in the community? I don't know. If you can, give the name of the person who has it.\n\nDo you have any pictures or photographs of your earliest church or of homes where the first services were held, or do you know of anyone who has such pictures? No - no one took photos of anything in the very early days.\n\n35. Describe any special features or unusual incidents of pioneer churches, or anything connected with it which you found interesting, not already mentioned. (Use other sheets, or back of this sheet if necessary.) It seems to me that the people of the Churches in the early days were much more friendly than they are today; however, this was probably due to the very necessity of depending so much on each other. Circumstances in the early days, when people existed sometimes on practically nothing made it absolutely that all depended on one another in time of need and you could always rely on people helping as much as possibly - thus resulting in a fast common-bond friendship which does not to my mind exist today in the same degree.\n\n(see other side of this sheet for further information)\nThe following are a few other items of interest which I might mention in so far as our religion was concerned in the early days.\n\nAs I mentioned before in this Questionnaire, our particular settlement was made up of Baptists, and religion seemed to be taken much more sincerely then than they do now, and I might also state that for the most part people practiced what they preached in the community. There was a good fellowship in the Church.\n\nOnce a year there would be a Baptism Service. This would be held out in the open air near a slough or lake, etc. The people who were to be baptized would be put into a wagon to which a team of horses was hitched, and were driven to the edge of the body of water concerned. The Minister would walk into the water waist deep, and the laymen would lead the people into the water and duck them right under; then other assisting laymen would take them back to the nearest farm house to change their clothes. The women would wear pure white dresses and the men would wear an old suit.\n\nIn connection with the Sunday School Christmas Tree each year we did not have a Santa Claus. The parents used to put gifts for the children on the tree and the Minister would present the gifts to the children, calling the names. The gift in most years was a bag of candy and that was something worth having in the early days. The tree was usually decorated by the women of the Church.\nSASKATCHEWAN ARCHIVES QUESTIONNAIRES.\n\nNo. 4\n\nPioneer Churches.\n\n(Drawing by Richard Graburn)\n\nPlease print name and address in capital letters.\n\nYour full name: Charles McMillan\nPresent Address: Carrot Bank\nPioneer Address: Longabulin\nYear you came to Saskatchewan: 1886\n\n(Throughout the questionnaire, \"Saskatchewan\" means the area which is now Saskatchewan)\n\nPLEASE NOTE\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who came to Saskatchewan before 1912, and most of the questions are about that early period, although in a few questions information for later years is asked for.\n\nIf you cannot answer a question, leave the space blank.

(Use other sheets, or back of this sheet if necessary.)\nI came to country as a child with my parents in 1886. We went to the Anglican church as it was the only church here. Later I'm not sure but the Presbyterian church was built. Then my parents went there. Their church where I attended with them until... The United Church started. I went back to the Anglican church. So I speak more of those two churches that I knew. Our social life was apart from church. We considered church was for worship we were given our religious training from our parents or the minister. We hardly ever missed service no matter what the weather might be, morning or evening so people did not like being out late on the prairies. Considering all things the people gave well to their church and any work such cleaning repair work was done by the people voluntary. I know there was a good deal of help given the churches from the old country and Eastern Canada at first. Later they were self-supporting and gave to missions.

Were there special revival or mission services in the early days? Describe.\n\n30. What arrangements were there to provide for the training of the clergy?\n   The college in Winnipeg was the first place in the West\n   for training the clergy. The young students usually taught classes\n   for a few years before entering the seminary.\n\n31. What differences did you notice in church life on the prairies as compared\n   with the community you came from? There was an emphasis on\n   spiritual reflection. Churchgoing was almost made a fetish of, and was in itself almost\n   looked at as a form of worship. In this country it was treated\n   more impersonally. Some of the young people still clung to the\n   old ways, and the result was slowing of life.\n\n32. To what extent did the social life of the community centre around the church\n   service (held in the church, school or other building) in the early days?\n\n33. Is the church as important a place now of people gathering together for com-\n   panionship and sociability as it was in the early years? I do not think so.\n   Explain. There are too many places to go and the family is busy that\n   attending church is considered as something on the side and\n   somewhat unnecessary. The Lord's Day, the church, and its services\n   seem to have lost the enthusiasm that the early members gave it.\n\n34. Is the first membership roll of your church still in the community?\n   If you can, give the name of the person who has it.\n\n   Do you have any pictures or photographs of your earliest church or of homes\n   where the first services were held, or do you know of anyone who has such\n   pictures?\n\n35.

Dr. Robertson, Monday evening meetings were given.\nSettlement of the Forest district was commenced in the summer of 1882. In the spring of '83 the homesteads were entered for and cultivation of the land commenced. It is worthy of note that these pioneers like the Pilgrim Fathers of America, brought with them and established their faith and their church.\n\nThey met in the homes of Alex and Robert Martin and without the aid of a minister, held weekly services. Hymn books were sent them from Ontario by Mrs. Agnes Balfour (known to most of you as Grandma Balfour). The spring of 1884 Mrs. Balfour and Mrs. John Martin with their young children came to the settlement also Mrs. Donald Wilkie and Mrs. Sidney Armstrong. The only service led by a minister of which we have any record up to June 1884, was held by Rev. Wm. Martin of Norwich Ont. In June 1884 the district was visited by Rev. Alex Urquhart of Regina and arrangements were made for the formation of a congregation. On July 11th, Rev Dr. Robertson and Rev Alex Urquhart visited the field and a congregation comprised of the following members was formed: John Bruce, Wm. Jamieson, Arthur Jamieson, Alex Martin and wife, Robert Martin and wife, David Martin, Mrs. Balfour, Charles Sherriff, Donald Wilkie and wife John Martin and wife. Services were held once a month by Rev. Alex Urquhart of Regina in a small shack belonging to Wm. Jamieson. It was situated where Alex McEwen now lives. The shack was without windows or doors. The heat came of boards placed on blocks of wood; the building which consisted of a packing box was conspicuously low in comparison to Mr. Urquhart's splendidly tall figure. This defect was later remedied by adding a sloping stand to the top of the box.\n\nIt was here the first baby was baptized, Grandma Balfour supplying the bowl of water and towel and Mrs. John Martin the baby. The baby was named Jean Isobel and by the minister's request the name Urquhart was added. She is now Mrs. M.C. Ross of Regina.\n\nIn 1886, the year following the rebellion a small frame church was built on Section 10, north of Charles Sherriffs buildings. It was later moved to the location of our present church. It was later sold and the building is now part of Mr. R. Ralls house. It was built by volunteer labor, the lumber being hauled from Regina. Students were sent out by the Knox College Missionary Society of Toronto and for a few years there were no winter services. Rev. Peter Struthers collected students and to their splendid qualities all the pioneers testify. In April 1885 Mr. Manson was sent. He also occupied the field in '87, the year the first church was built. It was opened July 11th, for regular service, Rev. Alex Urquhart dispensed the sacrament and several new members were received. In 1887 James Drummond was the student and that year Sunday School and Bible Classes were started. He was followed by John Conning in 1888, F.F. McPherson in 1889, Mr. McPherson took up a homestead and was the second teacher in Forest School in 1891. Wm. Gauld was sent as Student in charge in 1890. Later Mr. Gauld went to Formosa after his ordination and served as missionary there for thirty years until his death several years ago. Mr. Barron held winter services in the winter of 1890-'91 and Mr. Scott came for the summer months. A session was formed at the beginning of 1891 and T.C. Tate and John Martin were elected and ordained elders by Rev. Carmichael. The winter services were supplied by Mr. Brandon. In 1892 G.A. Wilson was the missionary for the summer and Mr. Watt for the winter. A request was sent in for an ordained missionary until such a time as the congregation could call a minister. J.B. McKechnie was appointed and ordained for the work commencing his duties in May 1893 and continuing his work in '94. In 1895 Wm. McLeod was the missionary in charge followed by Rev. T. Hunter Boyd in 1896. Services were also being held at Cottonwood, Longlaketon and Stoney Beach. Carssdale was the name by which our congregation was known because...\nSASKATCHEWAN ARCHIVES QUESTIONNAIRES.\n\nNo. 4\n\nPioneer Churches.\n\nThe mail was distributed from Mr. Edward Carss's and the post office was named Carasdale.\n\nThe students all used the same means of transportation covering the ground on the back of a bay pony called \"Billy\". He had been a scout pony during the rebellion and had evidently absorbed the spirit of the times, for he was on certain occasions very hard to move; in fact he was balky. Mr. Drummond and Mr. R.E. Knowles spent one day trying to drive him. Their day was one of experiences but not of success and they decided that \"Billy\" should be re-named \"Sooner\" as they said he would sooner stand than go. Mr. Brandon also carried with him from the field, memories of a cold dip in the Wascana River when \"Billy\" decided it was the proper place in which to lie down. Billy was afterwards sold to Mr. John Martin for five dollars where some years later he ended his term of service to humanity by lying down in the deep waters of the Wascana and refusing all attempts at rescue.\n\nThe expense of the missionaries was paid by the congregation and at times it was not an easy task. Every family could tell, if it would, of sacrifices made that the work might go forward. As Mrs. Balfour wrote in a letter to relatives in the East: \"We always have enough to pay for what we eat and support our missionary. One family you know well wore homemade boots of cloth and skins one winter so that the ten dollars saved could help keep the church open. We with our comfortable homes with their modern equipment and luxuries where do we stand in this matter? Can we proudly stand by these dear pioneers and say 'I too have given till it hurts' that the work of God may go on? Who would say their sacrifices were of no avail.\"\n\nI would we could stand in the door of this little frame church on the prairie and watch the people gather for the service. Some on foot, some on oxen, some with horses, with stoneboats, wagons and buckboards. One family's appearance consisted of the wheels of a wagon with a plank from front to rear bolstered and another plank lower down for the feet to rest on. Another family came on a stoneboat as far as a nearby slough where they tethered the oxen rather than risk unfavorable comparison with more aristocratic vehicles. But they came and came regularly, and they prospered and of course their church prospered too. In 1897 thirty years ago they decided to erect a bigger and better building so they built our present church and they opened it free of debt. Volunteer labor was used as far as possible. I understand that the late Mr. George Kinnon drew the first load of gravel and I know it was a generous one like the heart of the man. The name of the church was changed from \"Carasdale\" to \"Forest\", a reminder of the town in Ontario Mt. Forest from which most of the founders of the church had come.
