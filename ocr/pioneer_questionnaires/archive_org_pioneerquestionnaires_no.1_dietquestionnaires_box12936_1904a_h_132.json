Sometimes two of us doubled up for a time and lived together.\n\nSheho was our nearest town and an ox team the means of getting there. I did not go often, but could usually send in with one of the neighbors about once a week if necessary.\n\nIn the winter of 1904-05 a country store was opened by H.A. Wall about a mile S.W. of here. He carried a stock of almost everything we needed, which he had freighted out from Sheho, for which he paid $6 per cwt.\n\nMills were opened nearer, later, Foam Lake, I think.\n\nI homesteaded here in 1903 and was one of the first in this township. Before that the only inhabitants had been the small ranchers who came here in the early '80s, a Frenchman M. Carion had this township to himself; the ranches were located 8 or 10 miles apart, but in some places they were grouped 3 or 4 fairly close together. These were the first pioneers. When the homesteaders came in some of the ranchers moved out and others took homesteads and changed their methods. Mr. B Carion, son of the old man, still lives in farming.\n\nThe homesteads were soon all taken and we had plenty of neighbors by the end of 1904. English, Scotch, Irish, Welsh, Scandinavian, German, American, Canadian and a little later a lot of Ukrainian and Polish. By 1906 we had schools. The railway was extended to Foam Lake in 1907-8 and the C.N.R. came only 14 miles South of us in 1908.\nI reached for 20 years a woman's report would be\ndifficult.

He carried a stock of\nalmost everything needed which he had freighted over\nfrom Chicago, for which he paid $10 per cart.\n\nMill was opened around 1910-11, and a small one at Millburn about 1915 or\nlater.\n\nI homesteaded here in 1903 and was one of the first\nin the Township. Before that the only inhabitants had\nbeen the overall ranchers who came here in the early '80s,\na Frenchman M. Bannier had thin township (Chimney), etc.\nranches were located 8 or 10 miles apart, but in some\nplaces they were spaced 3 or 4 fairly close together. These\nwere the first pioneers.

WATER SUPPLY\n\nWhere did you get water for drinking and for cooking? (Well, river, slough, dugout) [Handwritten: Slough]\n\nHow far was this water from your home? 30 ft.\n\nHow was it brought to the house? (Pail, barrel, tank) [Handwritten: Pail]\n\nRegarding water supply, mention any changes which have taken place since you first started housekeeping, giving dates where possible. I dug a well in 1904 and others later. Had our bond 175 ft deep in 1910 and another 79 ft in 1915 put in first pump in 1915. Bond another well in 1932 which is still used for drinking. 150 yards from house, we carry in pails. Drilled well 130 ft in 1959 but not good to drink.\nThere was no water for drinking and for cooking? (well, river, stream, dugout). \n\nIf so, how did you get your water? \n\nHow far was this water from your house? \n\nWas it brought to the house? (pail, barrel, tank) \n\nFirst started homesteading, living in tent house possible. \n\nIn 1915 first pump up - 175 deep - 1910 and another well in '32 which was drilled. \n\nStill used for drinking 150 yards from house, in spring - fairly drilled until 1909 but not good to drink.\n13. SOAP\n\nDid you buy laundry soap or make your own? ...bought...\n\nIf you made your own, did you use lye? ...wood ashes?\n\nWhat kinds of laundry soap did the grocer handle? Royal Crown, Fatal Naphtha\n\n6 bars 25\u00a2\n\n14. FUEL\n\nWhat fuel did you use in the earliest days? ...wood...\n\nWhere did you get your fuel? ...from own wood lot by hand...\n\nMention any changes in the use of fuels which have taken place since you first started housekeeping, giving dates where possible.\n\nFirst used sawed and split by hand but about 1911 gasoline driven buggies came in and later splitters. Some now use coal and there are a few oil burners, but wood is still the main and most satisfactory fuel.\n\n15. METHODS OF COOKING AND TYPES OF UTENSILS\n\nFor cooking, did you use an indoor fireplace or open hearth in the earliest days? (Give dates) ...no...\n\nDid you use an outdoor fireplace or bake oven? (Give dates) ...no, but outdoor bake ovens were commonly used by the Mormons...\n\nBy whom was your first cook stove made? ...grandma...\n\nWhat year was it purchased? ...1904... Price? ...$5 second-hand...\n\nWhat types of utensils did you use? (Iron, copper, tin, homemade) ...iron, tin, enamel...\n\nFor preparing food? (china, earthenware, wooden bowls, other) ...\n\nWhen did you first see enamel ware? ...\n\nAluminum? ...1907-8...\n13. Did you buy laundry soap or make your own?\nIf you did, what kind? Did you use it?\n\n14. Fuel:\nWhat fuel did you use in your home last winter?\n\n15. Methods of cooking and types of utensils:\nFor cooking, did you use an indoor fireplace or open hearth in the cellar?\nDid you use an outdoor fireplace or bake oven? (Give dates)\nBy whom was your first cook stove used?\nWhat type of utensils did you use? (Iron, copper, tin, homestead)\n\nPrice? $15.00\n\nYear? 1904\n\nFuel? Anthracite coal\n\nYear? 1907-08\n\nAluminum?\n16. **WRAPPINGS AND CONTAINERS**\n\nmention any changes which you recall in the wrappings and containers received with the food you purchased (five dates where possible).\n\nApples came from Ontario in barrels until about 1915 then we got BC boxes which were much higher priced and didn't hold enough water they wrapped them which added to the cost and was not beneficial. Sometimes we got apples in bulk in a box car.\n\nExported peaches were sold by the 25 lb box for $2.75 which was much better than the modern little cellophane wrapped packages.\n\n17. Give a typical day's menu (breakfast, dinner & supper) for the earliest year you can remember. Give the year and list the members of the family with their ages at the time. State the approximate month, e.g. winter or summer.\n\n**Breakfast**\n- Oatmeal porridge\n- Fried bacon\n- Bread, butter, syrup\n\n**Dinner**\n- Fried or broiled bacon\n- Potatoes, steamed dried peaches\n- Bread, butter\n\n**Supper**\n- Same as dinner\n- Other vegetables when in season\n- In winter beef took the place of pork or bacon with fish sometimes and beans as an extra vegetable.\n\n18. What year did you serve your first Christmas dinner in Eastern Canada?\n\nGive the menu. List those present and give their approximate ages at that time.\n\nIn 1904 while living with W. Littlejohn we prepared Christmas dinner. Roast beef, brown gravy, potatoes, beans, & a meat pudding dinner. When it was nearly ready Mr. Johnson came with someone in it. When he was nearly ready, Mr. Johnson came along with a load of effects moving to their homestead. We all thought they had dinner with us fortunately there was enough to go round.\n\nIn 1904 George Wright gave a bachelor Christmas dinner for the homesteaders in this section. W. Littlejohn was away but Mr. Moore joined them. George was quite a cook he gave us roast beef and real pie (apple). We went to a dinner at night at Mrs. Butten's on First St.\n\n19. Have you ever reduced to almost starvation level living on one or two locally produced foods? Give details.\n\nNo\n15. **HAPPINESS AND OPPORTUNITIES**\n\n   Plant an orchard which you shall in due time harvest and enjoy (give dates here possible).\n\n   *Apples came from Butten's house with us about 1913.*\n\n   We got 13 bushels which were a higher grade and best kept.\n\n   *Note: They were wrapped in waxed paper and no leaching took place.*\n\n   *We got 25 lbs. for $2.75 which was excellent produce.*\n\n   *Then the modern little apple tree will produce much better than the old apple tree.*\n\n16. Give a capital dinner party (breakfast, dinner & supper) for the children.\n\n   *Your family must come over. Give the roast and list the number of guests invited.*\n\n   *With both eyes on the clock, it takes the appearance to mouth, especially if numerous.*\n\n   *Breakfast\u2014continental\u2014fried bacon, bread, butter, eggs*\n\n   *Dinner\u2014fried or baked bacon potatoes, steamed vegetables*\n\n   *Supper\u2014steak, baked potatoes, bread, butter*\n\n   *Dinner\u2014other things like when in war*\n\n   *Supper\u2014steak, baked potatoes, bread, butter*\n\n   *In winter\u2014beef, pork or bacon with fresh*\n\n   *Some times and brown sauce on extra nights*\n\n17. What do you serve your first Christmas dinner in Eastern Canada?\n\n   *Appreciate to area at that time.*\n\n   *Give the menu. List those present, incl. their ages.*\n\n   *Jan. 1906 while looking out west they had prepared Christmas dinner meal but brown gravy was not ready. E.M. & Agnes came along with a load of flour. Fortunately the weather was fine and the dinner was eaten by all. Mrs. Murray & Judy for 80 cents per person. This evening we dined quickly and had a good time.*\n\n   *On Jan. 24th we started back to give details.*\n20. Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\nNo very great differences, but families are generally smaller and visiting is not as common.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homogrown and home prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible).\n\nWe have not yet. The last three or four years it has become quite common for even farmers to buy all their bread and even cakes and cookies. But there are still a lot who do their own baking. There is also a lot of bologna used now that was never seen before the middle thirties.\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Eastern Canada. Include items not mentioned above, quality, methods of merchandising, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. [Use back of page if more space is needed].\n\nIt seems very difficult now to buy anything in bulk, the merchants seem afraid to stock more of any item, than would do a good sized family for two decent meals. Most foods will improve with keeping for a time in a good basement, and then would be a great saving in cost besides the convenience of always having a supply on hand.\n\nThe old laundry soaps seem to have almost disappeared, the new powders are probably very good when each is used for the right purpose, but when used indiscriminately sometimes don't work so well.\n\nCold storage locker plants are coming to be used a lot but have hardly yet reached perfection, either in accessibility\nNo very great difference, but families are generally smaller and winters not so long.\n\nWhen did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homesteading and home prepared foods? (Give an early date if possible.)\n\nWe haven't yet. The last three or four years we have become quite dependent on farmers. But they all their bread and even cakes and cookies. They do still make their own baking flour.\n\nThere is also a lot of cottage cheese that was made before the middle thirties.\n\nPlease add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and gas for your family in other than pioneer days in Eastern Canada.\n\nInclude types of food bought, above quality, methods of merchandising, etc., prices, etc.\n\nIt seems very difficult now to buy anything in bulk at the merchants' store of which to stock more of our own. We would do a good sized family for two decent meals. Most foods will be purchased for a tin in good season, and then would be a great comfort in case of sickness. I always have a supply on hand.\n\nThe old laundry soap was probably very good when used in wash for a while, but when used immediately sometimes does not work so well.\n\nCold storage locker plants are coming to be used a lot.\n\nBut have hardly yet reached perfection, either accessibility.\nor cost of the service. With all weather roads to take us to them, and lower cost for the service which might result from more people using them, they might bring about a great change for the better in our way of living especially in the summer time.\nor cost of the service.
