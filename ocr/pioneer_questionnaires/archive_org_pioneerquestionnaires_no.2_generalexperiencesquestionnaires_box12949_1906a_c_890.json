Some of the questions will answer only his own experiences; others may prove impossible for him to answer so don't worry about leaving blank spaces. The answers should be given in detail, or describe particular events, if they help to answer the questions.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1914, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nSaskatchewan Archives questionnaires No. 1 entitled \"Pioneer Diet: What Did Western Canadian Pioneers Eat?\" is still being circulated.
