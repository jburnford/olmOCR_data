Because of the questions here will not apply to your experience; others may apply to yours.\n\nIt is impossible for you to answer, so don't worry about leaving blank any questions. Don't hesitate to give details, or describe particular events, if they help you to answer the questions.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1945. It may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years another born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer Diets: What Did Western Canadian Pioneers Eat?\" is still being circulated. If you have not already answered this, and would be willing to do so, please put a check mark here (X) and one will be sent to you.\n\nSaskatchewan Archives questionnaires on other subjects will be prepared at a later date. Some of these are listed below. Please mark the ones you would be willing to answer.\n\n- All questionnaires\n- Pioneer health conditions\n- Pioneer social life, sports and recreation\n- Pioneer school life\n- Pioneer education and churchwork\n- Pioneer farming experiences\n\nPresentation of Questionnaires\n\nAll questionnaires will be preserved in the Saskatchewan Archives Board's Office at the University of Saskatchewan, as part of the permanent records of our Province.
