We borrowed a cook stove from a neighbor and it had been used to make tea over an open fire. It was a tough time.\n16.

Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include types not mentioned above, quality, methods of merchant trading, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. (Use back of page if more space is needed.)\n\nThe folks missed their coffee. Can you remember it?\n\nWe were forced to use fruit coffee. It was nearly all we could get. We also ground our own coffee. We also made potato coffee. We cut it up into cubes and used it. This was better than nothing.\n\nIf you didn't have sugar, the coffee wasn't very good.\nThe greatest difference is in the taste.\n\nCreed, flavor, color, texture, none may be\n\nand bury, burnt, greatest difference to\n\nthis quick roast, have come down\n\nthis quick roast to our\n\nwere many times too mild to\n\nCoffee was very popular in\n\nThe folks missed their coffee.\n\nThe first coffee I ever remember or\n\nwas from the ground and all\n\nneeded for use (not coffee). It\n\nwere roasted and ground nearly clean.\n\nall of it. We called it \"coffee\" even though\n\nnone of wheat and barley. This\n\nlittle coffee, we also made for\n\ncut it up into cubes and used it. This\n\nwe were rather than roasted many\n\nwere kept from using the ground coffee\n\nnot because the people were\n\nwere three times too poor.\nThe storage of many foodstuffs was a problem. Father bought a table of proper proportions and placed our flour or rice in a cool place to keep it from getting too hot. We also stored our vegetables in the basement, much more convenient than upstairs. We had the experience that when we moved into the house, we cut up firewood piled up or raised upstairs and stacked it inside a closet or opening where it could not be seen. But after a while, we found that it was quite warm there and could get quite hot. So we moved it to another place where it was cooler.\n\nWe also had a cellar under the living room floor, which was used for some household items and meat.\nThe storage of many goods also has a problem. If there's a lack of proper food and heat in the building or it's too cold, much more expensive storage space is needed. For example, we have the opportunity to store firewood in a room that already has a fireplace. This can be used as an additional source of heat when it's cold outside. We could also use an attic or cellar as storage space for meat and other supplies. However, there are no facilities for these purposes.\n\nThe living quarters require two or three floors for some households.
