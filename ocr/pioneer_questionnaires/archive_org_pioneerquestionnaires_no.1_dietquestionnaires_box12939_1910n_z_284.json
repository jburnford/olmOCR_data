When the crops were poor we tried to have more live stock. We never bought more than we could pay for anything. In the end it pays. We didn't have to worry about our debts.\n17.

Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\nIn the early days a meal was mostly cooked the same day it was eaten.

(Give as many details and dates as possible).\n\nWe buy most of our canned tomatoes, strawberries, raspberries, jam, as for other canned goods we have never bought very much of it.

In 1912 we picked an abundance of wild strawberries on Mr John Douglas' farm at Asquith. Those are the only strawberries I ever remember picking. After that year the land was broken. The rest of the fruit we have always bought. The Asquith district has been a good place to live in. We have made many life long friends and we have the very finest neighbors. And we have prospered.\nIn the early days a meal was mostly cooked the same day it was eaten.\n\nNow we can make vegetables, fruits, puddings so that we can put a meal on any shelf in notice, do it so all prepared needing only to be heated up.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods instead of home grown and home preserved foods? (Give as many details as possible).\n\nWe buy most of our canned tomatoes, strawberries, raspberries, etc., from other canned goods we have never bought very much of it. We have nearly always had so much of our own, we try to maintain a can reserve. They were all in the place in 1910.\n\n22.

In 1912 we picked an abundance of wild strawberries on Mr. John Simpson's farm at Agincourt. Those are the only strawberries I ever remember picking. After that year the land was broken.
