Thank you very much for your interest and cooperation in completing all the questionnaires which we have issued, and thus making available this information for research purposes. All questionnaires returned to us by early settlers are permanently preserved in the Archives.\n\nUnfortunately the Archives has no funds for purchasing or reimbursing people for records or information which they supply to us. None of the other early settlers who have completed questionnaires for us have received any payment, and I am afraid we are unable to make any exception in your case. I quite realize that it required a good deal of time and effort to send in as complete an account as you have done, and we very much appreciate receiving the material. It will be of satisfaction to you to know the information of the area in which you pioneered will be available in future years to those who are interested.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEvelyn Eager\nAssistant Archivist\nAugust 5, 1955.\n\nMr. Lewis Anderson,\nBox 153,\nNakota Bank.\n\nDear Mr. Anderson:\n\nWe have received the questionnaires which you recently returned to the Archives, Nos. 1 and 3 to 10.

Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada.

In the early days Watson was our market town approximately 25 miles away. From about 1906 J.W. Hutchison operated an inland store and post office. During winter months we marketed our grain and during the fall months we would lay in a year's supply of bulk supplies such as flour sugar and coffee. Flour was usually purchased in 20-25 lb lots sugar 5-800 bags salt 2-50 lb bags Coffee 100 lbs. This stuff was stored in the attic of the house.\n20.
