Some of the questions here will not apply to pioneer experiences; others may prove impossible for you to answer, so don't worry about leaving blank spaces. If possible, try to give details, or describe particular events, if they help to answer the question.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1914, and may be still living there today. If you have personal experiences of the pioneer era which you would like to share with others, please complete this questionnaire.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Board, No. 1, entitled \"Pioneers' Plata Wt. Dld.\"\n\nWestern Canadian Pioneers' Plata Wt. Dld. is still being circulated, and we would be glad to receive any completed questionnaires. If you have not already answered this, and would be willing to do so, please put a check mark here (X).\n\nSaskatchewan Archives questionnaires on other subjects will be prepared at a later date. Some of these are listed below:\n\n- Pioneer health conditions\n- Pioneer social life\n- Pioneer sports and recreation\n- Pioneer business and churchwork\n- Pioneer farming experience\n\nPreservation of Questionnaires\n\nAll questionnaires will be preserved in the Saskatchewan Archives Board's Office at the University of Saskatchewan as part of the permanent record of our Province.
