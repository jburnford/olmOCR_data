I bought about 3 years later I discovered my can was only a wine measure while the ones used here were Imperial measure and mind you I was running an incubator & a brooder every spring. When I discovered how I was being cheated I brought in an extra two gal can. I handed them both to the merchant at once & please I think that will hold it this time and he never even cracked a smile but I got both cans almost filled.\n\nI also bought me a couple of work shirts at $1.50 a piece a few weeks late I went down at the next town and I went around looking a prices where there were 3 stores and I found the very same shirt selling for only $1.50. Oh the way our yanks have robbed us in the early days. It was something terrible.
