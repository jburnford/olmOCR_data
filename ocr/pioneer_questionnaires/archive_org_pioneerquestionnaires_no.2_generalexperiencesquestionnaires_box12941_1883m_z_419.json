The final 'Heather' we had was a man by the name of Mr. Meechey who was followed by a Miss Sarah Kerr and I still have a book given as a prize by her.\n\nA valued treasure.\n\nAt that time the house was very small consisting of one business ideal running parallel with the R.R. making line with a few scattered dwellings and I could still draw a rough sketch of every building in town but I do not think that you would be interested in that.\n\nIt was really a real novel town and business was done principally thru those who worked in the Round Store.\n\nOne thing that sticks out in my memory was the day the head of windows came into town.

I was playing with boys by the fence of Burgess on a vacant piece of ground to the west of our house when over Bedford\nWell about 50 \u2014 well provided and armed\nand in full war dress. The Squaws were in\nearnest and I can still hear as if yesterday the\n\"yea so they came into town.\"\nThey had a war dance in front of a store\nrun by Emma Ross (they afterwards moved to\nRed Deer) and it only needed a spark to start\nthere an a runaway. Any excuse at all would\nhave done! So they were in a fighting mood.\nThey delegated pairs of Indians around to the\nshops and houses to \"take what was wanted\"\nnone daring to refuse. They came to our house\nand pointed out what they wanted, promised\nto have it wrapped up and left to have a meal\nfeast.\nAnother thing \"that\" always in my memory was\nor is. One night a white man rifle round\nhouse got excited and came up in the middle\nof the night yelling at the top of his voice \"the\nBlackfeet are on the Blackfoot are on the Black\nfoot never heard any part of the rebellion and\nany way they were over 600 miles to the west of us.\"\nWe came about 50 \u2014 well mounted and armed\nand in full war dress.

Any excuse at all would\nhave done! so they were in a fighting mood.\n\nThey delegated powers of mischief around to the\nboys and horses to \"take what ever they wanted\nmore daring to refuse.

Look out! they are the rebellion and\nany way they were over 600 miles to the west!\"\nNo. 5\n\nbut you know how it was all quiet times\nevery one was on edge and the women\nand children were all huddled over to the\n6 P.M. dinner hall which was the only shelter\nknowledge of the time in the town. The result\nday we were all taken by special train to\nMoose Jaw but we might as well have stayed\nthere as the danger was nearly\nas great at Moose Jaw as at Swift Current.\nTwo amics were not at rest when the\nQueen's Own Rifles of Toronto arrived and\ncamped on a flat just north of the town.\nThey afterwards marched to Battleford 200 miles\nnorth. This was before what was then known\nas the very Lake Road was built.\n\nAt this time the freight was transported\nfrom Swift Current north by cart and teams\na common sight to see fifty or more teams\na string going over Battleford hill on their way\nsouth. The express and passengers were taken\nby stage coach.

The next\nday we were all taken by boat from the\nshore near but we might as well have stayed\nthere as we were so the danger was over.\n\nOur animals were set at rest where the\nQueen's Own Rifles of Toronto arrived and\ncamped on a flat just north of the town.\n\nThey afterwards marched to Battleford 200 miles\nnorth. This was before what was then known\nas the Long Lake Road was built.\n\nAt this time the freight was transported\nfrom Swift Current north by cart and there\na summer night to see fully or square earth as\na string going over Battleford hill on about eight\nmiles. The express and passengers were taken\nby stage coach. They had furnished with tents or\nwagon so you know as prices were good last\nNo. 6\n\nIn 1886 my Dad took up a homestead in the Pusse district; one of those areas where the cost had a 1/4 acreion against $25 you could not live on it three years. My Dad lost the lot.\n\nI also remember gathering grain whenever he brought the grain up from the water and gave instructions to others on how to use it.\n\nThis was \"the start\" of the present machine gun and I remember one fine day he took it out to a aborigie camp west of town and moved the grass and bull rushes down as will a scythe. Of course the whole town turned out to see it.\n\nOne of the first ferries over the river at Mayfield was by an old country gentleman by the name of Mr. Redler Way who established farms at three different points along the C.A.R. He made one being at Quill Gurnell.\n\nThe buildings were located about a mile south east of town on the banks of the creek and we boys used to have great fun watching\nNo. 6\n\nIn 1886 my Dad took up a homestead in the Beause district; one of those areas where the Court held a \u00bc acreion against 10-50 you could not live on it three years. My Dad loved the land.\n\nI also remember getting into trouble when he brought the gun up from the Vallo and gave instructions to others on how to use it.\n\nThis was the start of the present machine gun and I remember one day he took it out to a large field west of town and moved the grass and hulls around as will a scythe. Of course the whole thing turned out to be it.\n\nOne of the first farmers after all was attacked was by an old country gentleman by the name of Mr. Reiter who established farms at three different points along the C.A.R. He once lived at Quill Creek.\n\nThe buildings were located about a mile south east of town on the banks of the creek and we hope to have great fun watching.\noperations. The main interest was watching them milking. They had a corral built with a gate leading into a chute. They would herd a bunch of so-called milk cows into this corral (they were range cattle) then a cow would be prodded into the chute and they would milk her through the bars. They might get a cup full more or less milk than that cow was let out and another one prodded in and so it went.\n\nOf course we were safe on top of the corral bars. The farm was managed by Lord's sons and remittance men who had brought out their hunting horses and hounds and spent the most of their time hunting rabbits & coyotes etc. The laborers were from the shires of London & they used to say that when they split wood they stood in a wash tub to keep from cutting their feet. I could believe it. As you will surmise Sir Leslie went broke. This was not the first land taken up however as Fenlon the S.P.R. agent at that time and Knight the postmaster had land.\noperations. The main method was milking them milking. They had a central line with a gate leading into a chute. Sheep would herd a bunch of so called milk cows into the central (they were range cattle) then a cow would be prodded into the chute and they would milk her through the bars.\n\nThey might get a cow full more or less and then that cow was let out and another one prodded in until no it went.\n\nOf course we were safe on top of the central lines. The farm was managed by Lords now and permitted men who had brought out their finishing horses over hounds and spent the most of their time finishing hating everybody.\n\nThe laborers were from the plains of London. They used to say that when they asked wood they stood in a trough hub to keep from cutting their feet. I could believe it. As you will surmise Sir Leslie went for it. This was not the final land broken up however as Fenlon the P.B. agent'd that Xmas and Knight's the new owner had land\nNo. 8.\n\nTo the North Beach of Town.\n\nIn those years they used to collect buffalo bones to be shipped east to the sugar refineries and we used to knock the teeth out of the skulls and sell them to the Yorkeans for 5\u00a2 each.\n\nOne day I was working thru the pile of bones when I came across a rib with a steel arrow head embedded in it thus showing the power of the bow and arrow as it had to pass thru the body of the animal to lodge in this position.\n\nI took it up to Johnny Paul who bought such things and he gave me the large sum of $50 for it\u2014and I thought I was rich.\n\nI saw it years afterwards in Red Deer to where he had moved and offered him $500 for it\u2014but he said money could not buy it. Not long afterwards he was killed in an auto accident and this will give all his curious (in Red Deer) price even but this particular item had disappeared so I had a search made for it but it could not be\nNO. 8.\n\nTo the South Bank of Town.\n\nIn these years they used to collect buffalo bones to be shipped back to the sugar refineries and we used to break the teeth out of the skulls and sell them to the youths for 5\u00a2 each.\n\nOne day I was working thru the pile of bones when I came across a silk with a steel arrow head embedded in it. Thus showing the power of the arrow arrow so it had to pass thru the body of the animal to lodge in this position.\n\nI took it up to Johnny Paul who bought such things and he gave me the large sum of $50 for it and I thought I was rich.\n\nI saw it years afterwards in Red Deer to where he had moved and offered him $500 for it but he said money could not bury it. Not long afterwards he was killed in an auto accident and this will give all his curious to Red Deer quite a run but this particular item has disappeared as I had a search made for it but it could not be\nNo. 9.\n\nSome one I guess knew the value of it. While living in Swift's barned the last three buffaloes were shot in their wild state by a bull, cow and calf. They were shot by a breed between Santa Ynez and Guernsey. Cattle and the carcasses were brought to town and sold as meat. I ate some of it. Johnny Grant whom I mentioned before bought the bull a calf head and as the was a taxidermist he knew it. He exhibited the bull head at the first World's Fair in Chicago. It was offered $1000 for it but refused to sell. This also was in Red Deer and no doubt it is now in their museum.\n\nNow Mr. Thomas I think I have covered all of interest as far as my memory goes. I know you will feel it to neither disappointed nor perhaps you can salvage some items of benefit. If not just throw it into the trash proper basket and no harm done!\n\nOf course there are many items I have left.\nNo. 9.\n\nloved. Some one I guess knew the value of it.\n\nWhile living in Swift, before the last three buffaloes were shot in their wild state.\n\nA bull, cow and calf. They were shot by a breed between Santa Ynez and Guernsey.\n\nGuernsey and the carcass were brought to town and sold as soon as I ate some of it. Johnny Evans whom I mentioned before bought the bull's calf head and as the only a sacrificial act. Then up. He exhibited the bull head at the first World's Fair in Chicago.\n\nNow offered you for it but refused to sell.\n\nThis also now in Red Deer and no doubt it is now in their museum.\n\nDear Mr. Blowers I think I have covered all of interest as far as my memory goes.\n\nI know you will feel it to rather disappointed deal perhaps you can salvage some items of benefit. If not just throw it into the trash.\n\nHope header and no harm done.\n\nOf course there are many items I have left.\nNo. 10\n\nout of happenings that would only be of interest to people living in Quill Creek.\n\nbut the party was not considered so that I never received an invitation to attend their 50th Anniversary also some years ago I sent them (my request) from the O.C.S. (Surgical Corps) a history of the early days of the old town and since that time I have never heard from them but I feel there is no living person who remembers as much about the early days of Xeret City. Perhaps they think I am in my second childhood. It certainly seems to me they do not think much of these pioneers.\n\nIf there are any questions you would care to ask I would try very hard to answer them. It would also be a pleasure to meet you once more.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nE.J. Smith\nElgin Man.\n\nP.S. If you are acquainted with Mr. E. Kirk dean of Agriculture give him my best regards.
