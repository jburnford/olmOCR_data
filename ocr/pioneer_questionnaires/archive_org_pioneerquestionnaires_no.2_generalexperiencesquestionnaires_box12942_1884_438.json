The conductor of the train we were on kindly allowed our parents and I to stop over at Brandon to visit relatives for a few days, and continue on a later train. He even stopped the train 2 miles out of town, to let us off at our cousins' house beside the track.\nPage for additional answers.\n\nQuestion 14. The conductor of the train we were on kindly allowed our parents and I to stop over at Brandon to visit relatives for a few days, and continue on a later train. He even stopped the train 2 miles out of town to let us off at our cousins' house beside the track.\n19. How often did you write to relatives or friends in your old home?\n   Once a fortnight at first. Less later as old ties and interests grew apart.\n\n20. If you got married, give the name of your husband or wife along with the date and place of marriage.\n   I married William Mayrond Thompson on Jan 6th 1892 and he died on April 1st 1946 after 54 years together. He was 84 yrs old at his death.\n\n21. Did anyone else come to Saskatchewan because of your recommending it as a place to settle?\n   When my husband's sister and her husband went East for Xmas in 1882, they also visited his people in Ontario (the Boyd family) who all came out during the next few years to Indian Head and vicinity, where they farmed some but mostly were hotel-keepers.\n   After the turn of the century, cousins of ours named Westgate, came from Quebec and rented land in Abernethy for a while, later homesteading at Hazenmore Sask.\n\n22. If other members of your family (brothers, sisters, parents, etc.) came West tell when they came and where they settled.\n   My own family never came west to live, and my husband's family came out together all but one son who later came from the U.S. and settled near us. His parents lived with us until their deaths in 1906 and 1907, and his younger brother and 2 sisters finally lived in Indian Head until their deaths, in 1918, 1931 and 1934.\n\n23. Is there any particular experience of pioneer days that stands out in your memory which you would like to record? I remember once my sister-in-law was in urgent need of a doctor and as there were no telephones or cars the neighbors galloped horses from one house to the next and changed horses, and then reversed the order coming back and made surprising time. The doctor arrived in time for winter.\n   Another time a man from Toronto came out to visit his son 35 miles from Sintaluta, with only light shoes and silk sox, and couldn't be persuaded to put on warm ones, so the men who were hauling wheat did the same trick of speed and warmed him at each house so his feet wouldn't freeze.\n   In freighting wheat up the rough hills of the valley they walked behind with a stone in hand to block the wheels and rest the horses often.\n   The Reil rebellion was a source of income for the 1st struggling settlers who were paid for freighting supplies from the C.P.R. main line to Prince Albert. It took a month for the trip and was well paid although they had to live on fat pork and seabiscuit and tea, they were glad of anything to provide a bit of cash. They split the cakes and soaked them in a pail hung under the wagon from one meal to the next. At the next stop they fried the fat out of the pork and then the cakes in the fat and ate them. The tea was very strong and mostly made of slough water.\n\n24. Did you travel about much in the early years? (for business, attending church, visiting friends, etc.) How often? How far? by what means of travel?\n   At first only by team and waggon to Presbyterian and church of Eng. services held in homes from about 1886 on; to the P.Office also in a local home for the mail, until the railroad came through with a horse or team and buggy, and always to all the picnics and local sports in the neighborhood as far away as Ft Qu'Appelle and Indian Head.\n   In the earliest days we usually took in the 1st of July etc at Indian Head, but usually stayed with our folks over night, and shopped before coming home next day.\n23. Is there any particular experience of pioneer days that stands out in your memory which you would like to record? Remember once my stepfather-in-law was in urgent need of a doctor and as there were no telephones or cars the neighbors rallied horses from one end to another and finally came out together all but one son who was still there. They lived in Indiana until 1947.\n\n22. If other members of your family (brothers, sisters, parents, etc.) came west tell when they came and where they settled.\n\nMy own family never came west to live, and my husband's family came out together all but one son who was still there. They lived in Indiana until 1947.\n\n21. Did anyone else come to Saskatchewan because of your recommendation? If so please state:\n\n1882, they also visited his people in Ontario (the Boyd family) who all came out during the next few years to homestead and violently where they remained some but mostly were hotel keepers.\n\nAfter the turn of the century cousins of ours named Wessels came from Germany to Homewest Saskatchewan.\n\n20. If you got married, give the name of your husband or wife along with the date and place of marriage.\n\nI married William Raymond Thompson on Jan 6th 1929 and he died on April 1st 1946 after 54 years together. He was 84 yrs old at his death.\n\n19. How often did you write to relatives or friends in your old home?\n\nOnce a fortnight at first, less later as old ties and interests grew apart.\n\n3.\n\nIn the earliest days we usually took in the 1st of July etc at Jordan Head but usually stayed with our folks over night and shopped before coming home next day.\n\nIn the earliest days we usually took in the 1st of July etc at Jordan Head but usually stayed with our folks over night and shopped before coming home next day.\n\nAt first only by team and wagon to Presbyterian and church of one.\n\nServices held in homes from about 1860 on to the Police Act in 1892. A local house to all the priests and locals spoke in the neighborhood as far away as 60 miles away.\n\nOr team and buggy and always to all the priests and locals spoke in the neighborhood as far away as 60 miles away.\n\nYesterday (Friday, etc.) How often how far do you travel?\n\n24. Did you travel about much in the early years (for business, attending church, water).\n\nThe real relocation was a group of income tax sheltering settlers who were paid for returning supplies from the Old West main line to Prince Albert. It took a month for the trip and these well established who had to live on fat pork and sausages and barely were glad of anything to provide a bit of cheer. They split the clocks and scattered them in a field under the trees. The next meal to the next.\n\nIf the next store they raised the tent out of the park and then the oxen in the field and ate them. The tea was very strong and mostly made of brown sugar.\n\n25. Did you travel about much in the early years (for business, attending church, water).\nQuestion 23\n\nDr Hunt, a pioneer doctor came West with a \"top\" hat but on the train he stuck his head out of the window to see something interesting and the prairie wind blew it off. As no one then ever went bareheaded he stayed in the station while he sent a man to a store for a cap.\nQuestion 23 Dr Hunt a pioneer doctor came West with a \"Top\" hat but on the train he stuck his head out of the window to see something interesting and the prairie wind blew it off. As NO ONE then ever went bareheaded he stayed in the station while he sent a man to a store for a cap.\nQuestion 23\n\nWhen the teams (who traveled in caravans or sally) were freighting on what was called \"The Transport\" to Prince Albert, a farmer named Wm Ross, living near us, was so anxious to go, that he left his seeding to be done by his 16 yr old brother-in-law, who didn't manage to finish it but left 10 acres. Mr. Ross could only plow it up when he got back and leave it till the next year. 1886 was extremely dry, and the average yield was about 3 bus per acre, but that 10 acres yielded 20 bus to the great astonishment of everyone. People came for miles to see it\u2014 and so was born the idea of summer fallowing and saving 2 yrs moisture for one crop.\nQuestion 23 When the teams (who traveled in caravans for safety) were freighting on what was called \"The Transport\" to Prince Albert, a farmer named Wm Ross, living near us, was so anxious to go, that he left his seeding to be done by his 16 yr old brother-in-law, who didn't manage to finish it but left 10 acres.

In 1905 when the Kirkella branch of the C.P.R. was being built across our farm, an official drove through and stopped in our yard with the last car I ever saw.\n\n26. If you owned a car before 1910, when did you buy it? Next year?\n\n27. Did you continue to trade there? (Indicate any changes due to new towns appearing, better means of travel, etc.)\n\nYes; by team and wagon, later by team and buggy and later by car.\n\nThe country store was moved to the town of Abernethy when the C.P.R. branch was built.\n\n28. How often did you shop in the early days? About every 3rd month in the summer. In the earliest years, and we laid in a supply of staples when hauling wheat in winter.\n\n29. When (if ever) did people in your district first start going to town regularly on Saturdays? Not until 1905, and not much then until farmers began hiring help who had been used to it in other countries.\n\n30. When (if ever) did you first begin to buy through the mail order catalogues? What kind of articles did you buy in this way? Indicate also what fraction of your total purchases were by mail order and any changes in the proportion of purchases made by mail order since the pioneer period. The first things I bought by mail-order was a red shawl and a layette, early in 1897 from T. Eaton's in Toronto.\n\nWe bought mostly clothing and household furnishings (curtains, etc.) was bought from Eaton's in Toronto, ---A small fraction at first, but about 50% at the turn of the century and less again after the town of Abernethy came near us, and we could motor to Regina.\n\n31. When did you first have a telephone and what company provided it? In 1910, it was a Bell Telephone but was installed by a company of rural line subscribers, much as they are today.\n\n32. When you came to Saskatchewan the first time was it with the idea of staying permanently? Or did you make up your mind after trying it out? When did you make this decision? After my husband saw the place in the summer of 1883, the family came to stay permanently. There were too many of us to gallop about trying out places.\n25. How did you first begin to buy through the mail order catalogue? That was in 1917 when we moved to our present place. We ordered from Sears Roebuck.\n\n26. What did you order? We ordered clothes, household items, and other necessities.\n\n27. Did you have any trouble with the catalogue? No, everything arrived as described.\n\n28. How often did you shop at the local store? About every third month.\n\n29. What was your favorite store? The local store was our favorite.\n\n30. What was your favorite item purchased from the catalogue? A new dress.\n\n31. Did you ever use the catalogue to purchase a car? No, we never used the catalogue for that purpose.\n\n32. How did you first get a telephone and what company provided it? In 1910, we got a Bell Telephone but it was installed by a company of rural line subscribers.\n\n33. When did you move to Batesboro? We moved here in 1910.\n\n34. Did you make up your mind after trying it out? Yes, we did.\n\n35. How many people lived in Batesboro? There were about 100 people living there.\n\n36. Did you finally come to stay permanently? Yes, we did.\n\n37. How did you feel about trying out places? We felt very positive about it.\n34. Did any people move away from your district prior to 1914? What reasons did they have for moving? The first settlers knew nothing of summer-fallowing, and as there was no earlier variety of wheat than Red Fife, so after a succession of frozen crops and general hard times, in 1886 one with $2 in his pocket, and no responsibilities got out. However those who stuck it out or were unable to go were well repaid later, and many of the ones who left came back and wished they hadn't been so hasty.\n\n35. Did many people move away during the 1930's? Did many return? No. Money could not be got to move with. Many went on relief but they got it here and stayed put. As far as I know, there were few if any pioneers or children of pioneers who were ever on relief. The ingenuity they acquired in the early days stood them in good stead in the 1930's and once again they gained by it and came out of the depression better off than the later settlers who were unused to hardships, and who piled up debts through relief.\n\n36. If you or some member of your family have held public office, or have been active in any organizations, mention it here, giving dates wherever possible.\n\nMy husband was not inclined to public office, but he took a turn in the telephone co., and was a school trustee about 1908 when the Abernethy town school was built.\n\nMy children all have high school educations, 2 of them were teachers and 1 a Univ. of Sask and Univ. of Toronto graduate. The 2 older boys fought in the 1st great war also my 2 son-in-laws and the younger son, son-in-law and 2 grandsons in the 2nd war.\n\nMy oldest son, besides farming the home sec. of land, has invented and manufactures the Len Thompson Spoon for fishing, and is on the council of Abernethy town.\n\n37. If you or any of your family or friends were \"first\" to have or do something in the district mention it here giving dates wherever possible. (Such as owning the first automobile, combine, organizing the first lodge, etc.)\n\nThe branch C.P.R. line was built to just east of Pheasant creek in 1904, and to Abernethy early in 1905. As soon as the track was laid a few grain cars were \"spotted\" and whoever got the last bit of grain in one had the privilege of shipping a carload in it. The little town was springing up in small houses and stores and church service was held in a new implement shed. One Sunday evening in May the \"Worshippers\" noticed a grain car on the track after service, and each farmer planned to claim it and so ship the first wheat from the town. My husband and the hired man sat up till midnight, loaded a wagon and reached it first (being one of the nearest). Someone said he met W.M. Matherwell with 300 bushel in the buggy.\n\n38. How did the places in your community get their names? (School districts, Post Offices, villages, railway stations, creeks, hills, etc.). Try to give: (1) name and occupation of person suggesting place-name (2) origin and meaning of the name (3) date of its adoption (4) any changes in names since the first name was given date and reason for change. Give facts of new name as above in (1); (2), (3).\n\nI believe that Indian Head was so named because of finding an Indian skull there, and that Abernethy and Belcarres were named after places in Scotland. I understand that Lake Katepwe was so named by Mr. Lauder, an old timer of the Saltoon district because it was the Indian word for Qu'Appelle. I was too small to remember any names or details.\n34. Did any people move away from your district prior to 1941? If so, mention date, name of person(s) who moved, and where they went.\n\n35. Did many people move away during the 1930s? Did many return? If so, how could they have done so?\n\n36. If you or some member of your family have held public office, mention it here.\n\n37. If you or any of your family or friends were \"pioneers\" in the first automobile district, mention it here.\n\n38. How did the town get its name?\nQuestion 37. My husband built the first permanent house in the district and it still stands furnished for use although I have not lived there since a serious illness last summer. It was built of stone in 1887 and has been the family home ever since.\nQuestion 37.
