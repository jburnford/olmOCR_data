B. Smith\nAddress: 214 S. Robinson Street, Regina, Saskatchewan\nBirthplace: London, England\n\n1. INTRODUCTORY QUESTIONS\n\nWhat year did you start housekeeping in Western Canada? 1912\nWhere did you set up housekeeping? At Nelson's Farm, Broadview, Saskatchewan\nWhere had you been living before that? London, England\nFor how many people did you prepare meals? 3 adults, 2 children\nHow far was it to your nearest store? About 18 miles\nHow often could a visit be made to the store? Very seldom, from points had to be done\nWhat groceries did you usually buy in those earliest years? Flour, sugar, tea, rolled oats, corn syrup, figs, yeast cakes, during war corn starch, which with potatoes were used in breadmaking according to regulations\n\n2. FLOUR AND OTHER GRAIN PRODUCTS\n\nWhat brand of white flour did you use in the early years? Household Flour\nIn what quantities did you buy it? 95 lbs. each\nWhat was the usual price per hundred pounds of white flour? $1.94 (when my husband got it)\nHow much did you use graham flour?\nWhole wheat flour?\nWas flour milled locally? No\nHow far away? _______ What year? _______\nWhat was the price for a twenty pound bag of rolled oats? _______\nWhat other grain products did you use? Rolled Oats\nCornmeal? Yes, for Johnny\nWhole Wheat? _______\nFarina? _______\nOther? _______\n\nDid you grind your own wheat for porridge? No\nHow did you grind it? A homesteader would take him \"grinding\" or \"mill\" to any neighbour as a charge. Two sacks of \"oat chop\" thus ground had stood in the granary unused for want of pigs to feed it to. This became for us a godsend at one period. Having no flour in the home for bread making, the discovery of these two sacks was in the nature of a gold mine. We skimmed the mould off the top and enjoyed bread & porridge for weeks made with these two sacks & pig chop.\nPIONEER DIET: WHAT DID WESTERN CANADIAN FARMERS EAT?\n\nInstructions: Please answer as many of these questions as you can and mail to us so they will be preserved as part of the permanent record of our Province.\n\n1.

What year did you serve your first Christmas dinner in eastern Canada? 1912\n\nGive the menu. List those present and give their approximate ages at that time.\n\nI cannot remember the Christmas dinner I had prepared save that I made a traditional Christmas pudding & was horrified that oranges & a few other dainties were brought in from town to sober with pickling ingredients \"in time\". We had our dinner dinner on Boxing Day with brother-in-law, brother & wife, an old school friend & wife (whom I knew by name) with us, all about our ages 25 or less. What we ate I know not. We were at the friends on Christmas Day.\n\n19. Have you ever reduced to almost starvation level living on one or two locally produced foods? Give details.\n\nFrom 1912 to 1914 yes often. My husband & brother worked from dawn to dusk on potatoes, bread, syrup, prunes & eggs, with which I put all possible effort to render palatable. One special occasion I myself was reduced to asking my husband if he could take a lift on a passing haywaggon to get perhaps some butter & eggs from my brother's - they did have some cows - for as I told him \"I was starving.\" My sister-in-law lovingly rode over with a basin & butter which was the means of giving us a much needed meal.\n16.

Give details.\n\nFrom 1912-5-1914 I often worked from dawn to dark on potatoes, bread, and parsnip taffy, which I paid for. It was hard work, but I enjoyed it.\n20. Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\nSoft honeyed cakes compared with English fruit cakes. Fruit pies made in shallow pie plates with very thin crusts. Parts of beef being boiled, otherwise \"boiled pink & silver.\" \"Silverside\" boiled beef of London tables. It appeared more than \"offal\" should not be made use of for meals, being despised; also sweet was made use of for meals, being despised; also sweet was used by poor people for whereas a Londoner regarded his food as a delicacy to English menus.

Than did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homegrown and home prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible).\n\nWhile on the farm we retained the simple style of food evident in my replies above said.

But I might mention that during my husband's home-keeping days (1908-12) he spent a winter in the shack, holding down his residence obligation while his brother was away earning, & tried for weeks on end on nothing but rolled oats, brown sugar & milk. It was a long while ere I could tempt him with porridge, which I ate heartily for special benefit of our children as they came along. After weaning the little ones were treated on cocoa made with plenty of condensed milk (Mother) and porridge.\n\nAnother fond memory of food I often laugh at was the occasion of a \"Working Bee\" a few days after arriving at Mulvick Farm. There were about 6\n20.

It was made of silver \"Silverware\" or plated metal)\n\nMade up of four main courses, each served on a separate plate, which would be added to the table. It was served on a large platter, which was placed around the table.\n\nThen you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homemade and home prepared foods. (Give us many details and data as possible).\n\nWhile we have not returned to the Empire style of food eating in my lifetime afterward. Since 1920 until now we have left the farm for good.

But I might mention that during my husband's home-stocking days (1908-12) he spent a winter in the Shacks, holding down his residence obligation, while his brother was away earning & lived for weeks on end on nothing but rolled oats minus sugar & milk\u2014It was a long while ere I could tempt him with porridge, which I ate healthily for special benefits of our children as they came along. After weaning the little ones were treated on cocoa made with plenty of condensed milk (Mother's) and porridge.\n\nAnother proud memory I fondly laugh at was the occasion of a \"Working Bee\" a few days after returning at Walwick Farm\u2014There were about 6\nas eight men kindly completing the carpentry\nof interior of the (3) three roomed house they,\nwith my husband had helped to build\nready for my arrival. It was 9 logs cemented\nbetween & at that time with no \"ceiling\". As I\nentered & looked up into rafters (realising it had\nbeen built by quite untrained but kindly\nintelligent men - especially of course my own\nhusband - I felt within my heart & said to him\n\"It is like a Cathedral\". Well to return to my\nexperience with these men: I had to supply a meal\napart from Bread & Butter, Syrup & Eggs all I had\nwas potatoes & carrots. We had always cooked &\neven carrots in long skillets - which seemed too\npulled to contemplate! So I made a flour & oat\npaste-lined a basin as for a meat pudding, filled\nit with carrots mashed up with pepper & salt, placing\na paste cover over the top & tying it on the close-in\nlooked for all the world, as it came to the table\nafter being boiled, like a beef steak & kidney\npudding! It was accepted & eaten without comment\nand really was quite good. Certainly better\nthan simple boiled carrots. I think beetroots\nmust also have figured on the menu!!\n\nN.B. The attached papers ought be of interest to\nthe archives - But if not please return. The 1908 list\nis of my husbands' purchases when entering upon\nhousekeeping in the shack built during the first winter\nby himself & kindly brothers & neighbours. The\n1912 speaks for itself and I say only represents an\nentirely formally wedding presents as we started our\nown new life. E.
