He was looking for a temporary settlement that was being established at Balmoral. On the train from Minnedosa a man told him that far better land in the Red River country, 70 miles north of Whitewood could be got for a song. This is the country between where Yankton & Salt Lake now stand. On arriving at Whitewood he joined a party of men who had a wagon & team of oxen & were buying supplies to make the trip to the Grassland Lake country. They found the young Rand & their 12 miles NE of Whitewood a man named Robert Munro was building a log house for himself & family. His house afterwards became known as the Munro Homestead. They landed the oxen & horse & set up camp on the banks of Grassland Lake. The next day they started out on their own land & proceeded to build a log cabin. There was no building material to be had so they decided to return to Whitewood & winter there. They returned little cold & the ground was frozen over. Of the seven feet got done before they reached the river. In view of what follows it is well to remember the following facts. Of the four men, one was a Canadian, the others were British. Not even the Canadian knew anything about the climate or to make matters worse none of them had any idea how to live.\nMy Father, Thomas William Howard, sailed from England for Canada in the spring of 1883. He was heading for a temporary settlement that was being established at Saskatchewan. On the train from Winnipeg to a man told him that he better travel via the Red River country, 70 miles north of Whitewood because it was a tough place. This is the country between where Yankton & Salt Lake now stand. On arriving at Whitewood he joined a party of men who had a wagon & team of oxen & were buying supplies to make the trip to the Crescent Lake country. They found the young Rand & their 12 miles NE of Whitewood a man named Robert Murray was building a log house for himself & family. His house afterwards became known as Murray's. They found that the land was good & had plenty of trees. They decided to stake out their own land on each side of the road. They reached the following fall. Of the four men, one was a Canadian, the others were British. Not even the Canadian knew anything about the climate of the country. It was very cold.

Angus McKay of the Baptist Church had started a mission at the head of the lake, but it was not known whether Mr. McKay would be able to call the Indians on the reserve or not. He was prepared to build a stockade in Whitecourt Bay, gather all the settlers into it, defend it until help would come. Meanwhile, the Indians warned Mr. McKay that they were all going to join Red River, and that they did not wish to harm him but they remained if allowed to do their own thing.\n\nHe tried to show them the folly of rebellion against the great White Queen, but it was useless. They declared that if they did not get what he owed his people back to their homes, he would be killed.\nRev. Angus McKay of the Ready-Tarian Church had started a mission at the foot of the East end of the lake but it was far from being successful. Mr. McKay would be able to gather all the Indians on the reserve on short notice, do a great deal of good. Meanwhile, the Indians warned Mr. McKay that they did not wish to harm him but they remained in their own place against his wishes.\n\nThe great White Queen said that if they did not stop it would result in disaster. After further talk about Robert he sent his people back to their homes.\nThat same spring while everyone was wondering what was going to happen next, my mother was killing one afternoon at the kitchen window staring when suddenly a shadow was cast over her work. The look of outside staring through the window was the tall figure of an Indian. He was dressed in buckskin and armed with a rifle. Mother was a brave little woman, so though she thought the sound to the door to town 12 miles away, she at once made a cup of tea, sat down, buried him in butter on the table, prayed for him to sit in, wished he did, if he made a very honest meal. Meanwhile mother took flesh (my dear brother) into the bedroom and placed him in the bright red coat of the artist's wife that her mother gave her. Meant. Now I remember the scene. Hair was thin and fine, golden hair, the soul could not be seen. It was a perfect picture. The sunlight came through the tree. Happily his hands in his picture of teaching gave a great push quietly away.\n\n(Question 28)\n\nOn the summer of 1936 the district of Harrietstown made up a picnic to go to Round Lake.

Better Paul you to town 12 months away, she at once made a cup of tea, let him know, but on the table signed for him to sit in, which he did, so he made a very hearty meal. Meanwhile mother kept them (my dear brother) into the basement. I observed him in the bright sunlight of the ceiling light that her Butler (Glenn Woods RA) had used when he belonged to that regiment. Meant. Now I remember the scene. Glass with the artist from the shining world to God for him. It made a perfect picture. The sunlight painted with the happiest thing possible in my lifetime of teaching in Greece. Shortly afterwards he picked up his stuff.\n\n(Question 25)\n\nOn the summer of 1936 the district of Hearst gave me the privilege to go to the Round Lake, some new home on Bemidji. The women children were invited into a good will a man to observe. There was no reason why even did not know how far away it was, but they went prepared for trouble for the good times.\nQuestion (23) Sheet (5)\n\nThe plan was to find a river that would lead them down to the valley floor (the valley line is 600 ft below the summit). The river was to be followed west until it reached the lake area. A narrow and difficult descent began at the lake, but now the men had to work their way up the steep cliffs. The trail was not easy to follow, and the men had to be careful to avoid the dangerous falls that had to be crossed before reaching the only road to the town of St. John's, Newfoundland.\n\nWhen we got into the valley our troubles were only beginning. The south side of the valley included a steep cliff, which we had to climb. We then had to cross the river. The river was very swift, and we had to be careful not to fall in. We then had to climb the steep incline. When the river was crossed, we could hear the sound of the river. We then climbed the opposite bank. They came rushing to the riverbank, and we could see the children playing in the water. We then climbed back to the top of the hill.\n\nThe next day, the weather turned very cold, and we had to stay in the tent. We were very tired, and we fell asleep quickly. The next morning, we continued our journey. We walked for several hours, and we finally reached the summit. We were very relieved to have completed our journey.\nQuestion (23)\n\nSheet (B)\n\nThe plan was to find a river that would lead them down to the valley floor (the valley line is 600 ft below the summit). The river was found all right but the men had to work through dense brush. The Balm of Gilead over two feet in diameter was found. Great windfalls that had to be moved before the wagons could pass. Later, the trail made that day became the only road to New Stockbridge, Mohawk.\n\nWhen we got into the valley our troubles were only beginning. The south side of the valley included steep banks which were difficult to climb. The trees had each cut a trench in the middle through the forest. This is where the snow would come in at times along the banks so that the snow would drain away easily.\n\nThe two tents with their occupants would shift down to the front end. When climbing the opposite bank they came running to the tent end with much force and nearly fell into the water. We three children followed it all over great distances to tie in the rope at the bottom of the tree.\n\nThe tents go slowly back to prevent the snow from covering them. Finally and carefully the lake was opened out to be a stage place to find the lake (the river was also found in the lake twice too fast to fish) if there was any water.\n\nate three breakfasts with poison.\nQuestion 23.\n\nSheet (C)\n\nin syrup tins found to their dismay, upon opening them each had a lump of butter bobbing around in buttermilk. Toward evening the men decided to go back on the north side of the valley as the Indians had a trail on that side & it led to the old crossing where Father had frozen his feet in 1883. In the time we arrived there & found that a settler named Getty had built a toll bridge, & a sod house for his wife & family. After paying the toll & crossing the Bridge we drove up at the house to get acquainted & star the custom. A dirty woman came out with a child in her arms. She was dressed in a filthy blouse & skirt. In order to hold the child more comfortably she put her feet up on the hub of one of the wagons & we had the privilege of seeing two of the dirtiest legs in creation. Mother murmured \"Drive on Tom,\" & we drove on. It was the anticlimax of a great day.\n\nPlease forgive bad writing, spelling & grammar for I graduated at 14 with a grade four.\n\nJohn Howard.\nPlease forgive bad writing spelling grammar\nfor I practiced at it will you please\n\nJohn Howard\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8\nOxford\n\nNo. 613 S\n\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jessylee/PioneerQuestionnairesPDFs//PioneerQuestionnaires_No.2-GeneralExperiencesQuestionnaires_Box12942_1884_432.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 34, "total-input-tokens": 56440, "total-output-tokens": 9305, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 4], [0, 2215, 5], [2215, 4349, 6], [4349, 5587, 7], [5587, 6936, 8], [6936, 8707, 9], [8707, 10428, 10], [10428, 11902, 11], [11902, 12764, 12], [12764, 14223, 13], [14223, 15163, 14], [15163, 16480, 15], [16480, 17047, 16], [17047, 18448, 17], [18448, 19584, 18], [19584, 20918, 19], [20918, 22005, 20], [22005, 23537, 21], [23537, 25044, 22], [25044, 26441, 23], [26441, 27581, 24], [27581, 28279, 25], [28279, 28817, 26], [28817, 30077, 27], [30077, 31441, 28], [31441, 32747, 29], [32747, 34042, 30], [34042, 35043, 31], [35043, 35138, 32], [35138, 35274, 33], [35274, 35428, 34]], "primary_language": ["None", "None", "None", "None", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]}}]
