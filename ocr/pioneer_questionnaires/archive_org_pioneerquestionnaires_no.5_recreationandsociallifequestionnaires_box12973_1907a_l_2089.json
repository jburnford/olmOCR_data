(Include also the school Christmas tree, picnics, etc., if you have not described these on the School Questionnaire). Give dates.\n\nIt gradually became the custom to hold dances, box socials, etc., in the schoolhouse as the district became more settled. Then the schoolhouse could accommodate for more than just the regular school classes. After 1914 the schoolhouse became the centre for all social activities, held in favour of the Red Cross.\n\nHow much of your social life was centred around the school, and within the school district? Describe.\n\nFor many years most social activities took place at or in the schoolhouse. Gradually more Scandinavian Canadians came in the Baptist Faith who set their faces and votes at the school meetings against dancing in the school.\n\n9. When was your first community hall built? We took over the old school for that purpose when the new school was built.\n\nWhat material was it made of? Lumber How large was it? 16 x 20\n\nWho built it - the community through special funds, the municipality, some organization, etc.?\n\nWas it built in the village or town, or was it a country hall? In the country\n\nTo what extent did it take the place of homes or the school house as a place for social gatherings and parties? (for example, if you lived in the country, did you continue to use the local school house for district gatherings, and come to the hall in town for other functions, or were you close enough to make use of the hall for all gatherings, etc.?).\n\nThe hall was used for practically all dances, other meetings, school board meetings.

They were sheltered in the large barns kept separate from the main building.\n\n11. What card games were popular in the early days?\n\nWas there card playing for a prize? Once in a while at home parties.\n\nWhat dances were popular? Quadrille, barn dance, minuet, waltz, bal and te danse.\n\nWas there ever any disagreement between dancing and non-dancing residents in the planning of parties and social gatherings? Explain.\n\nThere was intense feeling when the Baptists managed to get their own trustees in and refused to allow the school to be used for dancing. The old timers had bought land and paid for it and felt they should have the card playing accepted by all residents in the community, or were there any some who frowned upon it, either as an entertainment in the home, or for community gatherings? Explain.\n\nWhen I first came to Canada both card playing and dancing were normal pastimes. There was no dancing at the dances and I never knew any one play for money in this community. It seemed to me that such innocent fun was a panacea for much loneliness.\n2.

To what extent did it take the place of homes or the school house as a place\nfor social gatherings and parties? (If you lived in the country, did you continue to use the local schoolhouse for district gatherings, and\ncome to the hall in town for other functions, or were you close enough to\nmake use of the hall for all gatherings, etc.? Describe.\n\n9. The hall was used for practically all dances. This\nwould be a good meeting place. The school meetings are\nheld in the schoolhouse. The hall is used for party\nor election days.\n\n10. When parties, dances, etc., were held in homes, school houses or halls (as\nreferred to in question 9), did the entire family attend?

Explain.\n\nThere was no dance hall in the town. It was used for dances by\nresidents who lived outside the town limits. It was also used for\nsocial gatherings by all residents in the community, or were there any\nsocial gatherings accepted by all, either as an entertainment in the home, or for\ncommunity gatherings? Explain.\n\nWhen I first came to Canada, both card playing and\ndancing were normal practices. Then we moved at\nthis community. It seemed to me that both were unnecessary for our\npromises.\n12. What attempts at formality, or \"swank,\" do you remember in small towns, such as gloves and hats when calling, calling cards, visitors treated ceremonially in parlor, etc.? \n\nAs the small town grew larger enough to provide their own amusement independent of the county, civilian parks began to appear.

Yes.\n\nDescribe what you remember about chivarees, telling how common they were, any incidents connected with them, etc.\n\nI have been told that the chivaree was originally intended as a welcome to a newly wedded couple.

Describe any other details of visiting parties, etc., that you remember, telling of any games or amusements not already mentioned that were popular at parties and give approximate dates whenever you can when some changes in visiting or social life became noticeable.\n\nDuring the first World War parties in the summer of 1915 the Red Cross were very popular.
