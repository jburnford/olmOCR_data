(Indicate any changes due to new towns appearing, better means of travel, etc.)\nYes - although there are small shopping places at Edgely & Somerton - both near our house.

When did you first have a telephone and what company provided it?\nIt was just before 1914. I believe in our area it was known as Triplewood Rural Telephone Co.\n\n33. When you came to Saskatchewan the first time was it with the idea of staying permanently? Or did you make up your mind after trying it out?

Did many people move away during the 1930s? Did many return?\n\nAs you must know there are always some who will strive & struggle\u2014so others who won't\u2014I doubt that any established family left\u2014even in spite of the dirty 30's.\n\n36. If you or some member of your family have held public office, or have been active in any organizations, mention it here, giving dates wherever possible.\n\nSchool board was about only one I can recall\u2014Dad was always very interested in politics\u2014but never connected other than party committees\u2014\n\n37.
