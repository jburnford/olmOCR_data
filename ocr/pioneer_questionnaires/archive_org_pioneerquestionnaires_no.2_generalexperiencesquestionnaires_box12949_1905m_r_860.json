It was said this trail got its name from the dead carcasses of oxen along its route. We measured the distance to Saskatoon by tying a rag on a spoke of the wagon-wheel, and counting the turns of the wheel, figuring it out from that. The circumference of our wagon-wheel was just slightly over one rod. I made in all 17 trips to Saskatoon. I was on one of these trips; leaving my wife and two little girls, Grace and Christine, on the homestead, when one of my horses took sick, which delayed me several days. There had run out of food, and my wife was going out to hunt some herbs, or something, when she saw two rabbits sitting at the corner of the house. She took the 22 rifle, shot one of the rabbits, the other rabbit sat there until she reloaded the rifle, and shot it also. They were on the last leg of the last rabbit when I arrived home.
