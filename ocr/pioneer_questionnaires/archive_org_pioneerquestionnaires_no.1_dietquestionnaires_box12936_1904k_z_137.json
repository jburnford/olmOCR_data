WATER SUPPLY\n\nWhere did you get water for drinking and for cooking? (well, river, slough, dugout) Well.\n\nHow far was this water from your home? In the yard.\n\nHow was it brought to the home? (pail, barrel, tank) Pails.\n\nRegarding water supply, mention any changes which have taken place since you first started housekeeping, giving dates where possible.\n\nSince 1914, cisterns are quite common. Some have small cisterns filled several times a year from the well.

Wood grown on our own farms now, which were scarce in the early years 1904 and on. Many use gasoline stoves in summer & some propane all year now. Therefore less burning fuel, wood, coal are used now.\n\n15. METHODS OF COOKING AND TYPES OF UTENSILS\n\nFor cooking, did you use an indoor fireplace or open hearth in the earliest days?

Were you ever reduced to almost starvation level living on one or two locally produced foods? Give details.\n\nNo we never suffered hunger but our diet was restricted and we were so tired I meant potatoes that by spring we hunted dandelion leaves etc to make a pot of very welcome greens. And the first Rhubarb tasted wonderful and the finest wild strawberries blended with a few egg white cake mother used to make made a short cake in our oven could forget.\n\nA few times we ran short of flour yeast and lived on flat buns and pancakes until the week long blizzards died down and we could struggle through the snow with a hand sleigh to get a fresh supply.\n16.

We never went hungry.\n20. Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\nThe early times was a nightmare to pioneer women. They had as little to work with that the gangs of 30 men who came hard to cater to. One neighbor would take care of everyday work supply the busy ones. Others had all cooking equipment and dishes and went to help. As the local fruits had to be bought at such long distances, we had to go out and of course we could not get any vegetables had to be prepared each day. We often used to peel a pair of potatoes at 11 o'clock at night before them for breakfast.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homegrown and home prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible).\n\n1912 boxes of apples came in very handy for the harvesting and harvest season.\n\n1912 also saw corn, peas, and tomatoes start in cans.\n\n1912 breakfast food partly took the place of our usual hot porridge.\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include items not mentioned above, quality, methods of merchandising, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. (Use back of page if more space is needed).\n\nWe had no way of disposing of our cream as we do now so we used to make butter and take it to town as barter for things we needed.\n\nNothing was graded. A raisin was a raisin, a prune just a prune whether large or small. Dried fruits kept well, freezing didn't seem to hurt them. Houses had to be banked carefully in the fall so our winter supply of potatoes etc. didn't freeze. Even then when an extra cold windy spell came, we rushed down cellar with poles and heated stones, lanterns etc. to keep things from freezing.\n20.

(See back of page II more space is needed.)\n\n---\n\nWe had no way I could make butter and fish oil as usual for things not used up.\n\nNothing was wasted. A victim was always given a second chance. We kept to be handed over to the fallow our winter supply of potatoes etc. dried plums, etc. They were an extra cold family appeal came. We needed them all winter from and limited stores, containers etc. to keep them from freezing.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jessylee/PioneerQuestionnairesPDFs//PioneerQuestionnaires_No.1-DietQuestionnaires_Box12936_1904K-Z_137.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 20, "total-input-tokens": 33200, "total-output-tokens": 6292, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 2], [0, 1649, 3], [1649, 2897, 4], [2897, 4231, 5], [4231, 5205, 6], [5205, 6908, 7], [6908, 6908, 8], [6908, 11664, 9], [11664, 15940, 10], [15940, 19697, 11], [19697, 22917, 12], [22917, 24138, 13], [24138, 25168, 14], [25168, 27186, 15], [27186, 27961, 16], [27961, 29794, 17], [29794, 30730, 18], [30730, 30730, 19], [30730, 30730, 20]], "primary_language": ["None", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "None", "None"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, true, true, true, true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]}}]
