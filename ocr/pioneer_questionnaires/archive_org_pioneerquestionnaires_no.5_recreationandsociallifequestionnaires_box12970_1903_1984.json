There was a small increase in crops, and an exceptionally fine grain harvest. Money was something that was only occasionally mentioned occasionally in the press, there was no opportunity in sight for any form of recreation. So we called a meeting to be held in the centre of the community for the purpose of holding a picnic. It was well attended, and brought together almost every kind of sport. Everything went off as smoothly as was predicted, and carried by my guests out, proceeded as one had any money, and no one would risk what little bit they had. I thought then as though our efforts were not in vain, it was a great time. Personally I could not have been friendlier, but there was no reason why the moody, dark, and gloomy day should be clouded by any suspicion or jealousy. The blowing dust nearly covered which the wind could operate, was doing its work most efficiently. We packed a nice old picnic, but had to follow a large quantity when away from the trees for at least an hour. We fitted up a platform for a stage, and then went to eat. I had forgotten to bring some soup! That's the first time I've ever been late for dinner! But it didn't hurt; it was all right, just like that.\n\nWe spent the day as we pleased, and there was plenty to see when we were finished. We walked around the town hall, and then went back to our cars. We got into the cars and drove home. It was time to go to bed, so we turned off the lights and went to sleep.\n\nThe next day we went to church, and then came back home. We had a nice lunch, and then went to work. We worked until 5 o'clock, and then came home. It was a nice day, and we enjoyed being together.\n1914 was a difficult year in Smith County. Our community faced many challenges and opportunities.\n\nOur church, Our Savior's Church, had been struggling to maintain its membership. The members were divided over whether to sell or keep the building. So we called a special meeting to decide on the future of our church.\n\nThe meeting was held on a cold winter day. It was attended by many members of our community. The discussion was heated, but we eventually came to a decision to keep the building.\n\nWe decided to hold a fundraiser to raise money for improvements. We sold baked goods and held a raffle. The proceeds were used to pay off some of our debts.\n\nIn the spring, we held a picnic at the park. It was a great success, and we raised more money for our church.\n\nThroughout the year, we continued to grow stronger as a community. We supported each other through difficult times, and we celebrated our successes together.\n\nIn conclusion, 1914 was a challenging year, but we emerged stronger and more united as a community.\n1914 was a dry year in South-west Saskatchewan. There was a small acreage in crop and an exceptionally low yield. Money was something that was only something mentioned occasionally in the press. There was no opportunity or right for any form of recreation. So we called a meeting to be held in the centre of the community for the purpose of holding a picnic. It was well attended and organized very successfully for almost every kind of sport. Everything went off as smooth as glass until it came to the question of providing for one had any money and no one would risk what little but if credit they had. It looked as though our efforts were just so much wasted time. Personally I could not see the question of risk ahead, but I could not convince the others. So matters became more clear I will be compelled to become personal deeper on that I became disgusted and without forewarning deeper on that question I stated that I would liberate the matter. They would cooperate in doing the work necessary. If not me, then the picnic a success. At that point they all agreed. If not me, not only responsible but in position to supervise the whole affair. A position which I think was readily met. Providing that I lost, then I lost on my own budget. But, for this fact, there I lost on my own budget. The picnic was also unique. I picked a spot some 25 miles south of Abbey Park. The nearest point to a railroad or a town was a long distance, a long stretch of field and a platform for a stage. I then went to work and arranged for all the necessary from one of the lumber yards. I did not have a single thing that could stand as a deposit on this bill of terms. But I did have the whole-hearted cooperation of the community without the whole-hearted cooperation of the community without the cooperation we were doomed. I not only used the committee previously appointed, I formed new committees. The work was completed in a short time. We picked July 16th as our date. Farmers holiday. We still had about three weeks to go, which we used for advertising. We knew what the people wanted, and we aimed to give them just that. Our slogan was \"get acquainted with your neighbors.\" The county was but a little at the time and many did not know their neighbors that lived only a few miles away from them. We used what we may term as the old stage coach methods. We would drive around plus a long write-up the paper. Success was through the written word.\nThe project was a success, but at that point they all agreed to help me not only responsible, but also a position to lead them through the affair. A position which I think was rightfully mine. However, this fact, their trust in my own judgment, and the fact that they had to show a large machine shop for demonstration purposes, less blueprints, a long string of fabric and a platform for a stage. I then went to the town and arranged for some credit from one of the lumber yards. Today we have a simple, cheaply built as a depot on the hill of timber. But I didn't have the whole-hearted cooperation of the community without that cooperation, we were doomed. I not only used the committee previously appointed, I somehow committed the work was completed in a short time. We picked up the pace as quickly as possible, and we aimed to give them what they wanted, and we aimed to give them what they needed. The county was not yet acquainted with our neighbors. The county was just settling in at the time and many did not know their neighbors that lived only a few miles away from them. We used what we may term as the old stage coach methods of getting the news around, plus a little writing in the Bible weekly. So this day, I believe our success was through the initiative of those active in the many committees.\n\nOnce the initiative was brought into action, there was no telling where it would end. It had been a case for future action. I may quote an instance as an example. First, I appointed three girls who were in their early twenties to form or organize a concert program. They were well known in the community, I felt they were entirely on their own about two weeks later as I came in from the field. I found the three of them parked on saddled horses at my door. I invited them in. They all were not well and they appeared a little nervous. I scarcely approached the question in order to find that they had no knowledge of their abilities and only a week to go to picnic day. I placed on them their intelligence, plus initiative, to give them a few indirect hints as to how a concert could be organized. Without making any direct hint to follow, praised them for being more capable of putting on a play than I could ever hope to do it.
