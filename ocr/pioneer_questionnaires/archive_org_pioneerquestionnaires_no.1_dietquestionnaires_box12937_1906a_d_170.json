WRAPPINGS AND CONTAINERS\n\nMention any changes which you recall in the wrappings and containers received with the food you purchased (give dates where possible).\n\nIn the early years from 1879-1900, groceries were sold in paper bags, jam in wooden jars tied in linen, tea was sold in cans, as large as 50 lbs. This is down to 1 lb. The worst was no cellulose packages those days, and was wrapped, there was no easy opening, flour in white sacks, fruit melons, seeds were purchased all in bulk, much less canned goods. There was no salted salt as far as I know. Candy was in bulk, you could buy a typical day's meal (breakfast, dinner & supper) for the earliest year you can remember.

Give details.\n20. Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\nIn early days the housewife had to prepare everything for the meals. There was no prepared foods ready to place on the table, such as canned meats, cakes &c., as today. And a good cook was considered OK if she could make an appetizing, appetizing meal out of very little.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homestead and home prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible).\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include items not mentioned above, quality, methods of merchandising, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. (Use back of page if more space is needed).\n\nIn the early homestead days we kept cows & churned a quantity of butter, also sold eggs to the store. There was no grading in those days. Mother & I often would rise early & drive our horse & buggy 20 miles to town with our load of butter & eggs, & take it to the store for groceries whatever was needed. We would have such a load we could hardly put in the buggy. Flour, oatmeal, sugar, tea, were, twice over, all we was needed on the farm. It was a long hard day in the boiling sun of summer. Afterward we had a grocery van call for a year or two.
