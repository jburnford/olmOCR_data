Did anyone else come to Saskatchewan because of your recommending it as a place to settle?\n\nRelatives and friends came from Bruce and settled in the Manor District upon the recommendation of my father.

Is there any particular experience of pioneer days that stands out in your memory which you would like to record?\n\nJune 1897 our Fleming School and all surrounding schools joined with Moosomin in celebrating the 60th anniversary of the reign of Queen Victoria. Each teacher was given a badge, given beforehand, was to head his or her own pupils and look after them in the Grand Parade made around the town and on to the grand stand, where choirs were sung by the schools & speeches made by prominent citizens. Governor General Dewdney and Party were present.\n\nIn 1900 at Yorkton a gramophone record was made of Mrs. Wallace's voice as she read a Psalm. Her husband wanted this, as she was ill & not expected to be better. A quartet from the choir sang \"Unto the hills around do look up.\" I played the organ for them.\n\n24. Did you travel about much in the early years? (for business, attending church, visiting friends, etc.) How often? How far? By what means of travel?\n\nMostly by foot in the earliest days as I remember. At Newdale (our first homestead) as soon as there was wheat oats & wagon father would go with a great to the mill at Moosehead (not sure). Once I went by stage from Fish Lake to Moosomin (about 45 miles). Another time I went by stage Mr. Green driving to Brittle partway on a trip to Yorkton.\n\nWhen teaching at the summer schools, most of any rides were with people where I boarded. At my first school we went to the Fair at Lapella from Ravine Bank in a wagon drawn by young oxen. Had a ride back in a top buggy. At Fleming I had a Remington Bicycle to get around with. I could get home faster to Moosomin, for 9 miles away.\n\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway daily through Fleming. Horses in buggies, buckboards & democrats common.\n19.

When was the first car used in the community? About 1905.\n\nG.K. Grass Sintaluta - homemade car. So the story goes.\n\nHerb Hall of Wolseley & Dave Rollon Sintaluta had first cars.\n\n26. If you owned a car before 1914, when did you buy it? What make?\n\nAbout 1910 a second-hand Studebaker - a big cumbersome thing, sounded like a threshing machine. I was glad when it quit.\n\n27. Where was your trading center? How far from your home?\n\nMinnedosa - 17 or 28 miles from Newdale Manitoba.\n\nMoosomin and Sintaluta at our own General Store.\n\n28. Did you continue to trade there? (Indicate any changes due to new towns appearing, better means of travel, etc.).\n\nYes, as long as we lived at these places.\n\nAs motor cars became general, trade was less at small town stores. People were going to Regina more than on the train or with horses.\n\n29. How often did you shop in the early days? Not very often at first.\n\nMoney wasn't plentiful. Later, at Sintaluta at our own store, we shopped there almost daily.\n\n30. When (if ever) did people in your district first start going to town regularly on Saturdays?\n\nAt Sintaluta, it seems to me there was always a big crowd in town starting 1901, right through to 1933.\n\nAt first it would be horses put in livery stables for some hours, while farmers & families shopped & visited & visited & visited.\n\n31. When (if ever) did you first begin to buy through the mail order catalogues?\n\nWhat kind of articles did you buy in this way? Indicate also what fraction of your total purchases were by mail order and any changes in the proportion of purchases made by mail order since the pioneer period.\n\nIt seems to me, we sent once in awhile to Timothy Eaton's Toronto, at first, ever since they started business. Nearly every home had a catalogue from them. We would study the book carefully, see what was fashionable for the year, and buy something if we could; and they didn't have what we wanted. Mr. D. McNaughton's, Moosomin, developed into a fine departmental store. Remember my first (Astrohan short) fur coat was bought at this store. I had saved for it from my $360 a year salary (paying $10 per month for board).\n\n32. When did you first have a telephone and what company provided it?\n\nSoon after 1901, in our store at Sintaluta.\n\nIt was likely The Bell Co., but not sure.\n\n33. When you came to Saskatchewan the first time was it with the idea of staying permanently? Or did you make up your mind after trying it out? When did you make this decision?\n\nIt was the idea of staying permanently at first, but father was always ready to move, if he thought he could better himself. His last move was, when in business, to Yorkton when appointed Homestead Inspector.\n\nHis third homestead was in the Beaver Hills.\n25. When was the first car used in the community?

We would study the book\n\ncarefully, see what was available for the year,\n\nand buy something if we could; and they didn't\n\nhave what we wanted. If we couldn't find something,\n\ndeveloped into a fine departmental store. Remember\n\nmy first (Prairie) share was bought at\n\nthis store. I had saved for it from my $60 a year\n\nsalary clearing 10\u00a2 per month for years.\n\n32. When did you first have a telephone and what company provided it?\n\n33. When you came to Saskatchewan the first time was it with the idea of staying permanently? Or did you make up your mind after trying it out? When did you make this decision?\n\nIt was the idea of staying permanently at first,\n\nbut father was always ready to move if the\n\nthought he could better himself. We had never\n\nthought he could better himself. Appointed\n\nHomestead Inspector.\n\nWas raised homesteaded land in the Beaver Hills.\nI put them on, and heard music in this way for the first time. For another 10\u00a2 each we were led into a dark room of a tent and were shown by X Rays the bones and make-up of our hands very clearly. In front of another tent was a placard \"Come in and see the Petrified Man\"; we were used to seeing petrified wood, leaves etc., near Moosemin, so went in out of curiosity\u2014not doubting too much. When we saw this figure lying on a cot, covered\u2014all but his face\u2014we felt at once that this was a fake & couldn't keep back a smile which brought scowls for us from the solemn two men, one at the head, another at the foot of the man on the cot. We had a laugh to ourselves when we got outside. Later on we read where the mold and tools of these men were found, and the men arrested.\nI pointed them on, and heard music.\n\nin this way for the first time.\n\nFor another five each we were led\n\ninto a dark room of a tent and were\n\nshown by X Rays of the bones and\n\nmake-up of our hands very clearly.\n\nIn front of another unit was a\n\nplaced \"Copper in And See The\n\nPetrified Man\". We were asked to\n\nseeing petrified wood, leaves etc.\n\nnear Moabamin, so went in out\n\nof curiosity\u2014not doubting too much.\n\nWhen we saw this figure lying\n\non a cot, covered\u2014all that his was\n\nface; we fell at once that this was\n\na fake & we couldn't keep track a\n\nsmile which brought secrets for us\n\nfrom the solemn two men; one at\n\nthe head; another at the foot of the\n\nman on the cot. We had a laugh\n\nto ourselves when we got outside.\n\nLater on we read where the mold\n\nand molds of these men were found,\n\nand the men arrived.\n34.

Electrically lighted houses instead of coal oil lamps. The Canadian Pacific Railway through from coast to coast. Telephones, planes, motor cars in common use. Schools, churches & public buildings are available & near full now. Labor-saving devices too numerous to mention.\n\nAt Brandon Fair about 1896 Ella Ross (another teacher) and I attended the Brandon Fair for a day. We had to go the night before on the train.
