On Sunday mostly.\n\n4. Were you often invited to other homes, or was most visiting done without an invitation? People never invited anyone in the early days. People just called in and accepted food or other things as the family were able to supply. People were always pleased to see each other and never worried about anything as formal as an invitation. What time of the day did you go, - in the morning and spend the day, or in the afternoon, etc.? Usually visited in the morning - had dinner with the family and left for home about 4 p.m. in the afternoon.\n\nWhat about meals? Did you stay when not invited beforehand? Yes, a meal was always set for visitors if the proper time presented itself. It was quite customary that people stay for dinner, with friends or relatives.\n\nHow was the invitation to a meal worded when people had come unexpectedly? (That is, was the term \"take potluck\" used, or was some other expression common?) As mentioned above everyone was so pleased when visitors came no thought was ever given to whether or not they would stay for a meal - it was just done automatically and without invitation. We ate whatever the family of the house was going to eat - no extras were provided in any way.\n\nIf no meal, what other refreshment might be offered to visitors who had \"dropped in\"? None. If you did not have time to eat a meal with the family - no other refreshment was served.\n\n5. Did the whole family go, or did someone stay home to \"look after the place\"? When the children of the family were all small they all went with their folks, but as we grew older we usually visited families who had grown up children our own age and less went out separately.\n\n6. Did you ever have \"bees\" when groups of neighbors came together to sew a building, make quilts, or other such activity? Yes we did, and they were usually a good excuse for the community to get together and although we worked hard there was much fun and good fellowship.\n\nTell what you remember about such gatherings, giving dates if possible, telling what the \"bees\" were for, and how often they occurred. In the winter months we had \"bees\" mostly attended by women who would card and teaze wool and slice feathers for making of cushions, rugs, etc. Sometimes men would attend and would be employed at plucking of the geese. Usually a lunch of bread, buns, butter, and coffee was served. Of course we had \"building bees\" and helped each other in building of houses, barns, etc., along the same lines, the work here being done mostly by men and the women would supply the lunch.\n\n7. In the earliest years that you were here, were there many parties, whilst drives or dances in homes? Describe. No, not for our particular family. We were of Baptist Church faith which did not allow us to take part in very many parties etc., just purely socials with perhaps singing and children's games.\n\nWere these more frequent in later years? Give dates.\n\nDid you follow any kind of informal schedule, such as going by turn from one home to another at definite times, - every two weeks, once a week, once a month, etc.? As mentioned above most of our visiting was done on Sunday and we tried to visit a different family each Sunday.\nSASKATCHEWAN ARCHIVES QUESTIONNAIRE.\n\nNo. 5\n\nPIONEER RECREATION AND SOCIAL LIFE.\n\nRECREATIONAL VISITING, PARTIES, ETC.\n\n1.
