The circulation was about 600 or 700 and it was widely circulated. It was nearly all the towns including Ripina and North Farm - very remote places at that time - but a few copies. A large number of Eastern papers exchanged and some copies went to England.\n\n8. The paper called the (Critic) was just a little sheet almost twice the size of this page and was not edited by Andrew Stewart as he died too soon in P.A. until a late date - around 1894 or so. Would you have heard of the paper? (I believe it was in PA in 1822 and October.)\n\n9.

For John & Macdonalds during the rebellion and further him supported the volunteers and organized defense during the rebellion. He was a Fenian Raid Veteran (I have his medal here) and had attended Military College in Kingston so was better qualified than most to organize defenses. During the rebellion many people opened their homes to farmers in the district and had in several months alone ten people protected or them in our home and the property. One was used as sleeping quarters in the patrol. People add most disastrous effects to the experience in my year late we will had the P.I.O. Round and occasionally calling for some necessary type. I might add here that when people were asked to make statements of their rebellion losses my father put in for very nominal sum - about $200 - albeit the paper had been suspended for several months and he had fed such a large house hold and suffered much discomfor, he contended he had only done his duty in\nThe precise nature of the accusations made against the defendant during the investigation and proceedings of the court remains unclear due to the destruction of the original documents.\n\nHe was a former naval veteran who had attended military college in Kingston upon Hull (not listed separately).\n\nWhen questioned regarding his involvement in the case, he claimed that he had never been present at the scene of the alleged offense.\n\nThe prosecution presented evidence that he had been seen near the location of the crime several months prior to its occurrence.\n\nThe defense argued that he had been away from the area during the relevant time frame.\n\nFurther investigation revealed that he had indeed been present at the scene of the crime, but he claimed he had been there for a different purpose.\n\nThe court found him guilty of the charges brought against him.\nMaking such efforts to defend his home. Unfortunately many others did not share this belief and several fortresses were founded on inflated hopes and dreams.\n\nHope this is along the line you want. I have no wish to see the early days recorded or remembered because I feel that in the early days the foundations were laid. What we have now is a magnificent superstructure far surpassing the dreams of those early adventurers. Isn't it a super structure so what of the foundation? We should not forget that\u2014and I think it was well and truly laid by those men who let my father looked for nothing more than to make this a country to live in. A newspaper in the early days had many difficulties\u2014but was of inestimable benefit to the country it served. Father, James Oliver, Melton Ford Davis and others helped\u2014\n\nSincerely,\n\nDr. Gertrude Smith\nHope this is along ok. Love ya\nmuch.
