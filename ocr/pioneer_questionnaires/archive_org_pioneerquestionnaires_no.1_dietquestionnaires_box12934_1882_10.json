Rebellion took place likely the events were very important. We had oatmeal porridge, coffee bread rolls, olives (or beans). It was hard to make as it was made on a wood fire and syrup. Dinner at noon - meat, roast beef (which to you was 18 cents). Potatoes, turnips, cranberry pie, tea and milk, tea at 6 p.m. We had cold meat, fried potatoes, raspberries, strawberries, jam.

Coffee and dried fruit in my days.\n20. Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\nThe only difference I notice was that there was a much greater variety\u2014and the frozen foods and imported perishable foods\u2014strawberries, etc.\u2014were frozen\u2014cabbage, onion, etc., imported during winter months and pressure cooking methods\u2014all made great changes and shortened the housekeeper's time (which) shortened what work she did.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homegrown and home prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible).\n\nWe always\u2014from earliest recollection\u2014bought every thing except a few potatoes, onions, and bacon. Bread was available once in 1886 or 1887. A few canned fruits as strawberries and canned jams\u2014some times in the H.B. & Co. English and apple jars and mandarins\u2014expression in food\u2014tomatoes were the earliest canned vegetable\u2014remember (above?) along in 1890 there were packaged jellies (something like jelly) but no desserts as now.\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include items not mentioned above, quality, methods of merchandising, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. (Use back of page if more space is needed).\n\nIn my recollection as a child\u2014Ontario\u2014Ontario\u2014when they had large stores of everything\u2014goods and canned provisions in barrels, evaporated or dried apples in tins, raisins and currents in boxes (I believe) jams\u2014these stores also had a store lot\u2014a dear food\u2014panty lace, ribbons\u2014sometimes childrens' and ladies' hair hats as well as men's\u2014pre-made clothes as far as I can remember\u2014lots of pretty beads and gay collars and flannel blankets in red green or grey or white\u2014the French and Indians loved these to wrap themselves. All the stores in pioneer days were several stores and carried a wide variety\u2014including coal oil.\n20. Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of home-prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible.)\n\n22.

Include items not mentioned above, quality of merchandise, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. (Use back of page if more space is needed.)\nand candles, matches, etc. There was a great deal of \"trading\" in the early days. In my father's business the adventurers were thought of paying cash for the family \"deal-out,\" any account they bought goods until the amount owing was paid. The farmers brought in a few bushels of potatoes, a couple hams (eggs and butter occasionally) and once I remember a load of wheat which we had made into flour at one of the mills where they did \"grinding,\" as they called it, and paid them subscription\u2014then pay\u2014and paid them subscription\u2014the pay\u2014I never remember seeing much money they said when the railroad came it took over all the money\u2014because freight had to be paid in cash instead of the \"trading,\" the freighter used to do. When they really just got goods for their freight.\n\nIn addressing my envelope for this I recalled to mind that\u2014When I was a kid just for a trip in 1897 there was not one building on the south side of the main street and only about three including the depot on the north side. The N.W.M. had a tavern I think named Willis located there.\nand candles, pots, etc. Have no c.\n\ngreat deal of trading in U. until dep.\n\nfor my father because the adventurers have\n\nthought of paying card be the people's\n\ndebt one away account. Our money\n\ngood will if anyone owing we paid\n\nThe former brought in a few valuable goods.\n\na couple farms (1779 and half, occasional)\n\nand one house in a body of water. What\n\nwe had most into play, or they called us\n\nlike this dry ground, or the poor\n\nand paid them pre-emption\u2014their money\n\nand never received owing much money.\n\nWe card like the railroad came,\n\nover all the money\u2014treasure\n\nbut the Red Kid paid in cash instead of the\n\npreyful need to do. But this\n\ntrading the preyful for their prosperity\n\nreally got put food for their prosperity.\n\nIn addition my card goes to d. = )\n\nNewell's farm that I knew. Know one\n\nfrom a trip in 1897 they lost more one\n\nbuilding or the end of it over at Bennett's\n\nand they allow the machinery the depot\n\nor the money paid. If it happens\n\nI think named will plateau.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jessylee/PioneerQuestionnairesPDFs//PioneerQuestionnaires_No.1-DietQuestionnaires_Box12934_1882_10.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 24, "total-input-tokens": 39840, "total-output-tokens": 6474, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 4], [0, 1357, 5], [1357, 2745, 6], [2745, 3691, 7], [3691, 4694, 8], [4694, 6072, 9], [6072, 7149, 10], [7149, 11998, 11], [11998, 12714, 12], [12714, 16691, 13], [16691, 17166, 14], [17166, 18415, 15], [18415, 19300, 16], [19300, 21292, 17], [21292, 22499, 18], [22499, 24477, 19], [24477, 25049, 20], [25049, 26108, 21], [26108, 27102, 22], [27102, 27102, 23], [27102, 27102, 24]], "primary_language": ["None", "None", "None", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "None", "None"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, true, false, true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]}}]
