Some of the\nneighbors weren't fortunate enough to have a slaughter-house so brought their beast over to our place. One of our hired men was a good butcher so the butchering proposition was easy for both farmers, although my father and Uncle were both good butchers. The old colony-styled house made an ideal pig-pen and the end room a good sized chicken-house.\n\nAfter this crop, Uncle Albert bought a half section jointly with Don McDermid, who later sold his share to my Uncle. Later on he bought another half section at Summerberry, selling out to Harry Burnham in about 1910 and returned to Toronto where he lived until he died in 1928.\n\nMy father married Miss Jessie Wood, Venkleek Hill, Ont., on Oct. 4th, 1894.

Three of the teachers who had taught at the school from time to time were Mr. Brady; Mr. L. V. Kerr, a lad of seventeen years; and Mr. Ed. Deifenbaker. I quite remember Mr. Deifenbaker saying it was such a relief to live at the house of the Trustee. There were no cars or phones then.
