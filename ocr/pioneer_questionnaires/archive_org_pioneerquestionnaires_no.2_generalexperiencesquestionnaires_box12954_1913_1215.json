It is impossible for anyone to answer all questions. Some may be impossible to answer at all; others may not apply to your experiences. Others may prove impossible to answer because they don't apply to your experiences. Others may prove impossible to answer because there is not sufficient space to answer them. Others may be impossible to answer because there is not sufficient space to answer them. Others may be impossible to answer because there is not sufficient space to answer them.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1944, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experiences of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write their answers separately.\n\nOther Questions:\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer Days: What Did We Do?\" is still being circulated.
