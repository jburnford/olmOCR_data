Some of the questions here will not apply to your experiences; others may prove impossible for you to answer so don't worry about leaving them unanswered. Use extra sheets of paper if there is not enough space on these pages, or get another questionnaire.\n\nDon't hesitate to give details, or describe particular events, if they help to answer the questions.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther questionnaires which have been prepared or projected are listed below.
