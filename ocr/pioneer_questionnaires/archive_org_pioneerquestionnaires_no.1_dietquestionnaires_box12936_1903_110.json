WRAPPINGS AND CONTAINERS\n\nMention any changes which you recall in the wrappings and containers received with the food you purchased (give dates where possible).\n\n17. Give a typical day's menu (breakfast, dinner and supper) for the earliest year you can remember. Give the year and list the members of the family with their ages at the time. State the approximate month, e.g., winter or summer.\n\nIn 1903 - 1905 or 1908\n\nBreakfast: Porridge, bread, butter, milk, Barry or Wheat Coffee.\n\nDinner: Wild meat, sometimes pork. Mother often made different kinds of noodles usually together with beans or prunes. Also jam cakes. We had potatoes, vegetables and bread. Beverage as for breakfast. Fruit at times.\n\nSupper: Home made soup, fried potatoes. Bread, butter, drinks as above.\n\n18. What year did you serve your first Christmas dinner in Western Canada? .......\n\nGive the menu. List those present and give their approximate ages at the time.\n\n1903. The menu for this first Christmas I don't remember. But I strongly suspect it was not much different from every day. I remember for one of the first Christmases Dad brought a canned bone from Rosthern.\n\nThose present were:\n\nDad age 48. Mother age 44. Myself age 7.\n\nAnd my three sisters ages 5, 4, and 2 years.\n\nThe names of my sisters were: Cordula, Clara and Zita.\n\n19. Were you ever reduced to almost starvation level living on one or two locally produced foods? Give details.\n\nThanks be to God, we always had enough to eat. It was not the modern fancy diet one sees almost everywhere in this district nowadays. But we were always healthy and despite many hardships never needed a doctor in the early years.\n\nThat refers to bought fruit. Whereas wild fruit was in season we had our fill. If I remember right there was a lack of sealers for canning in the first years. But later on Mother did a lot of preserving.\n16. RECALL FOODS AND CONTAINERS\n\nMention any changes which you recall in the newspapers and containers received with the food you purchased (give dates where possible).\n\n17. Give a typical day's menu (breakfast, dinner and supper) for the earliest year you can remember. Give the year and list the members of the family with their ages at the time.

What year did you serve your first Christmas dinner in Western Canada?\n\nGive the menu. List those present and give their approximate ages at the time.\n\n1903. This meant for the first Christmas dinner in Western Canada.\n\nI remember for one of the first Christmas dinner Dad brought a canned ham from Portland.\n\nThree present were:\n\nDad age 48. Mother age 44. Myself age 7.\n\nAnd my three sisters ages 5, 4, and 2 years.\n\nThe manner of any winter meal: Canned ham, beans and rice.\n\n19. Were you ever reduced to almost starvation level living on one or two locally produced foods? Give details.\n\nThanks be to God, we always had enough to eat.\n\nIt was not the normal family diet and we almost everywhere in this district nowadays. But we were always healthy and despite many hardships never needed a doctor in all our years.\n\n20. That refers to the family's health. When was the last time you were sick?\n\nNotes on Western New York and New England. If you remember anything about the lack of medical facilities and the first doctors in the area.\n\nA list of physicians.\n20. Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\nMeals were prepared much more simple. Not so many different things on the table. Very seldom cake or pie.\n\n(Continued from bottom) Mother used to relate during one of first winters. Feed for livestock was getting very low and my youngest sister prayed something like this: \"Dear God let the snow melt. Our house needs hay and our cow needs grain.\" In fact, when Dad would cut grass with a scythe to put up feed for winter use.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homegrown and home prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible).\n\nWe never relied solely on purchased foods even to this day. But as time went on and finances allowed, I would say from about 1910 and then on through the years we bought a limited quantity of prepared foods to provide a variety and change in our diet. Especially fruit as it became available was among the things we bought. I remember Dad used to buy apples by the barrel. That I think was in the years from 1908 to 1912 and later. The Grocer would always include a package of candy for our kids free of charge.\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include items not mentioned above, quality, methods of merchandising, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. (Use back of page if more space is needed).\n\nFrom 1903 to 1906 everything had to be brought out from Rosthern by Wagon or Sleigh either by the settlers themselves or the store keepers. The Railway thru Humboldt, Brune, Dunn, had not been built yet.\n\nLugging everything the settlers needed 40 to 80 miles was no small chore.\n\nIn those years it really could rain. Wagons were often mixed in mud so that things had to be carried out by hand in order to get the wagons out. (See above)\n20.

Very seldom.\n\nCake on first.\n\n(Continued from letter) Mother used to select during our old first winter the feed for livestock was going very low and I helped myself to anything the kids liked. Dear God I did not want meat. Our house much hard and our own needs were great. In first year Dad worked out our own work a lot to keep my head for winter work.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of home grown and home prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible).\n\nWe never relied solely on purchased foods even at this day. But as time went on and farming allowed, I would say from about 1910 and then on down the years we bought a limited quantity of prepared foods. To maintain a variety and change in our diet. Especially fruit as it became available was among the things we bought. Remember Dad used to buy apples by the barrel. That I think was in the fall from 1908 to 1912 and later. The store supplied almost entirely a feeding of Canning for kids free of charge.\n\n22.
