There were many travellers on the trail. However, and it made quite an interesting trip. Of course in those days we had no motor travel and had to travel with horses or oxen.

Did you travel about much in the early years? (for business, attending church, visiting friends, etc.)\n\nIn the early homesteading days there seemed to be a great deal of visiting spirit among the neighbors and there was a great deal of gathering and gathering such as church services, picnics and dances where the neighbors met and got acquainted with each other. In fact it was at one of the dances that I first met the young lady who was later to become my wife.\n\nIn the early days of homesteading there were no roads marked out so when there was a dance held in the winter the people would come quite early and dance away until daylight in the morning so there was no danger of being lost on the way home. Some of the young girls from across town would come on horseback to a dance.\n19.
