The fall was spent in harvesting and storing the grain. We had to put up hay and wood to keep the animals comfortable through the winter.\n\nIn the fall of 1890, we moved into our new home in Regina. The house was a two-story frame structure with a large porch on the front. It had four bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a large living room. We also had a garage attached to the side of the house.\n\nThe next spring, we planted more crops and harvested them again in the fall. We continued to work hard on the farm throughout the year, despite the challenges of farming in the semi-arid climate.\n\"My pioneering experiences in Indian Head\"\n\nThat's what they call us!\n\nIndian Head\n\nFirst Prize Essay\n\nThe following story, submitted by W.D. Lang of Caveston, B.C., took first prize, $5, in Indian Head's Golden Jubilee contest.\n\nOne of the most interesting stories I ever heard was told to me by an old timer who had lived through the early days of Indian Head. He said that when he first came to town, there were only a few houses and a small population. The town was growing slowly, but there was a lot of potential for growth.\n\nIn those early days, the town was very isolated from the rest of the world. There were no roads or bridges, and travel was difficult. However, the people of Indian Head were determined to make their mark on the world.\n\nOne day, a group of pioneers decided to set out on a journey to find a new home. They loaded up their wagons with supplies and set off into the wilderness. After many days of travel, they finally arrived at their destination.\n\nThey found a beautiful valley surrounded by mountains. They built their homes and started farming. Over time, the town grew and prospered.\n\nToday, Indian Head is a thriving community with a rich history. It is a place where people come to experience the beauty of nature and the warmth of its people.\n\nTO REGINA\n\nBRIANTS\n\nExperimental Farm employee for stock at C.M. times and many valuable services rendered.\n\nTO REGINA\n\nMOOSOMINTS 70\n\nCheckers races over a half mile all blood horses barred, tan 31st.\nHours Counted to Big Jubilee Celebration\n\nIndian Head's 50th birthday celebration now needs only fair weather next Tuesday, July 1 to assure recognition of the event by the community.

The farm was run by Dr. Farrar\u2019s wife until his death in 1899.\n\nThe property then passed into the hands of Dr. Edward Davies, who sold it to Mr. Edmondson. Mr. Edmondson sold it to Mr. Billingsly, who lived there until his death in 1916.\n\nThe property was then bought by Mr. Simpson and was held by him until his death.\n\nMr. Simpson\u2019s widow continued to live there until she died in 1940.\n\nSince then, the property has remained in Mr. Simpson\u2019s family.\n\n\u201cMy pioneering experiences in Indian Head\u201d\n\nFirst Prize Essay\n\nThe following story, submitted by Mr. W.

A handsome, 10-roomed natural stone house in wide wooded grounds, the mansion is a little bit of old England. The Victorian flavor of the big stone house starts with the riding crop in the hallway, carried past the steeplechase pictures and into the den where the squire smokes his pipe and a visitor examines a Malayan kris on the library wall.\n\nThe squire of Maples is 82-year-old Kenneth Price, London-born and Oxford-nurtured, who began life as the son of an imperial army officer. He changed his mind about an army career and in 1887 turned his back on the white cliffs of Dover\u2014but not its traditions\u2014to become a farmer at Cannington Manor, Sask.\n\nAfter his home at Cannington burned down he worked in a livery stable at Moosomin and part of his job was driving the mail and passenger coaches over the old Moose Mountain trail to Birtle, Man. His parents, sisters and brothers came out in 1889 and they settled on a farm near here.\n\nThe restless Price however was a timber cruiser in northern Manitoba when the First World War broke out, and he became Captain Price with a squadron of the 9th Canadian Mounted Rifles that served overseas. He was gassed in France and after months of hospital care found his way back to Moosomin, where he served as postmaster for the next 30 years.\n\nMr. Price has been astride a horse most of his 82 years. He staged his own fox hunts in the Moosomin district with hounds imported from England. Polo was another pastime he brought to the prairie west but jumping was his favorite sport.\n\nHe took five horses to Winnipeg one year and won every steeplechase prize offered. Mr. Price has been a top-notch cricket player, representing Saskatchewan in other parts of Canada.\n\nHe was the first secretary of the Martin municipality and president of the Dominion Postmasters' Association for a five-year term. He retired from the Moosomin post office in 1950.\n\nSquire Price now is holding the fort for merrie England at Moosomin and confidently looks forward to celebrating his first century at his beloved Maples.\n\nA water moccasin can bite under water, but is less likely to be annoyed into striking while in the water.\n\nCanada's Quality Tea\n\n\"SALADA\"\n\nORANGE PEKOE\nLarge Stone Home Is Little Bit Of Old England At Moosomin, Sask.\n\nMOOSOMIN, Sask.\u2014\"The Maples\" of Moosomin stands solid and enduring.
