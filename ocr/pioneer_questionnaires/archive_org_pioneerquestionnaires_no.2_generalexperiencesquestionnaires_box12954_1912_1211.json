Is there any particular experience of pioneer days that stands out in your memory which you would like to recount?\n\nWell, I think it interesting to recollect when I took up homesteading a few years ago and found that practically all transactions had to be made by mail. Our stock was purchased even before we arrived at the place. We had to make arrangements to have our land surveyed and to notify the government of our intention to settle there. We had to make sure that we had enough money to purchase our land and to pay our taxes. We also had to make sure that we had enough food and supplies to last us until we could earn a living. It was a difficult time, but we persevered and eventually we were able to establish ourselves on the land.\n\n24. What kind of transportation did you use in the early years?
