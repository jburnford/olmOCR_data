(Use back of page if more space is needed).\nMr Lewis H Thomas\nprovincial archivist\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMrs Root has filled out this questionnaire at my request and I would like to refer you to Mrs Cecil Austin, Lloydminster, Sask. Mrs Austin's mother died about a year ago but she keeps a very full diary of the earlier days dating from 1907 in Saskatchewan. I wrote Mrs Austin some time ago and told her I was giving her name & you if it was possible she might be able to give you some information or even lend the diaries if they contained sufficient information of value to your project.\n\nI was a small girl when my father settled at Humboldt, North West Territories, in 1905 & later home steaded seventeen miles South of Humboldt near where the Station Attica is located today.\n\nDiet and shortage of supplies did not bother me until the winter of 1911 when it was impossible to get to town and we were completely out of coal oil for nearly a week. Candles lasted only a couple of nights more so that for several nights all the light we had for the long winter evening was that thrown by opening the door of the heater when we had to have a light. We used our last match & had to get up frequently at night to be sure of keeping a wood fire burning. Most serious the men were out of tobacco & after smoking the cleanings from coal pockets, they tried a home cured cabbage leaf tobacco made by some Hungarian...\nMy dear Mr. Sherman,\n\nI have just finished out this questionnaire at my request and it arrived early in your mail.\n\nTo Mr. Cecil Austin, Superintendent, State Prison\n\nI wrote Mrs. Austin about a year ago and I know that she lives in San Francisco. It was during the earlier days of my time there and I was working for the state prison. She was very kind and told me what I could do to help her. She promised she would be able to give me some information or even send the dinner if they contained sufficient information of value to your project.\n\nI was a small girl when my father started at Kumeyaay house west sometime in 1908. Later, he attended seventeen miles south of Humboldt River where the station office is located today.\n\nOur and shortage of supplies did not bother me until the winter of 1911 when it was impossible to get to town and we were completely out of coal for nearly a week. Candles lasted only a couple of nights more, so that for several nights all the lights we had for the camp were coming on that evening by opening the door. In the winter when we had to have a light, we used our loaf of bread frequently as fuel. We were keeping a wood fire burning most evenings as the snow was deep and often blowing the chimney from one place to another.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Date]\n16.

This resulted in nearly driving everyone out of doors while the house was aired.\n\nFor a couple of winters 1911 & 1912 my sister & I butched with my father, & we were more conscious of diet, which consisted mainly of Baking powder biscuits, rice pudding, frozen potatoes carrots & turnips or even the dugout pit in the cellar froze solid. Plenty of milk cream & butter from our own cows. Eggs were a sign of spring & were plentiful when warm enough for hen & lay. Fresh beef killed & frozen in fall. Summer meat was mostly pickled pork. Home cured ham.\n\nA particular dish of the earlier days I remember well was called flumerty or some such name and consisted of whole wheat soaked and boiled slowly for hours then nutmeg sugar salt & milk added. Was a main cereal dish. Nutmeg came in whole and had to be grated and coffee beans were ground in a grinder when needed.\n\nI hope this information supplied by Mrs Root will be helpful and will look forward to seeing the articles on diet in the Saskatchewan History.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nM.E. Robinson\n\nMrs L. McK. Robinson\n2046 Cameron St Regina Sask\nneighbour. This resulted in nearly driving everyone out of doors while the house was quiet.\n\nFor a couple of weeks in 1942 my aunt & I lived with my father; a we were most contented by diet, which consisted mainly of Baking Powder, rice pudding, frozen potatoes, carrots & turnips or even the digestive diet in its early stages. There was plenty of milk cream & butter from our own cows. Eggs were a sign of spring & were plentiful when warm enough for them to lay. Fresh bread, porridge in the morning, mutton, puddled pork, ham & bacon for a particular dish of the earlier days. Remember well when mutton, sugar, salt & milk added, was a main cereal dish. Mutton came under and had to be grated and coffee beans were ground in a grinder when needed.\n\nI hope this information supplied by Mrs. Root will be helpful and will work toward & seeing the article on diet in the Saskatchewan History.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMrs. O.
