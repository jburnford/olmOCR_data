Some of the questions here will not apply to your experience; others may prove impossible to answer; so don't worry about leaving blank spaces. Be sure to give detailed answers to describe particular events or any help to answer the questions.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1914, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or reply for a complete questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nWestern Saskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer Diet: What Did You Eat?\", is still being circulated.
