The Prophecy of Sir Wilfrid Laurier: \"The twentieth Century belongs to Canada if on one hand and the opportunity of acquiring 160 acres of land for $10.00 in instalments and on the other, induced Laurier's peasants and also industrial workers to look towards Canada as the place to escape from all the brewing European trouble and become free and independent as the owner of 160 acres of land which looked to most of them as a kingdom and themselves as the future rulers.\"\n\n1913: It was therefore no wonder, that 1913 proved to be the Year with the biggest influx of Immigrants from Europe, the writer of this, his brother and a friend amongst them. Possession of Land was the first goal and Homesteads north & west of St. Walburg were secured. As we did not have any financial means to start farming, for the first number of Years, working as Farmhands or whatever jobs could be gotten for Wages provided the means for Living during the Winter and have some Laundry broken by other Neighbors.\n\nSecuring a Job in 1913 was not an easy matter, for a short time I worked at the Mental-Asylum between the Battleford, which at the time was under Construction, went to Regina after last wolf skin accepted a job on the Grand-Trunk and with a bunch of about 75 Men were shipped by hall and snow along the Fraser River to a Construction-Camp about 25 miles this side of Fort George, now: Prince Georg.\n\nWith approaching Harvest, I left the Construction-Camp and came east again to work in the Harvest-Fields. The Experiences gained by going from Regina on the Grand Trunk by way of Melville, Saskatoon, Edmonton & Jasper to the end of the Hall at the time at: Tete Jaune Cache, from there on a Snow down the Fraser River to the Construction Camp and to Fort George and from there back along the same route to Battleford, would fill a Book by itself.\n\nDuring harvest & Threshing I worked north & west from Denholm and while there, my Wife and Baby-son arrived from the old Country, 77, also my Friends wife and family. After threshing we went onto one of the Homesteads and prepared living-quarters for the Winter. Being totally inexperienced our Log-shacks were by no means master-pieces still we were very proud of what we had done.\n\nThe Winter from 1913 to 1914, was fairly mild and we enjoyed life in Canada much during our first Winter. No Work to do, except securing Wood for close by, heating the Shacks which we needed to carry only on our Shoulders from close by, was only playing for us.\n\nThe Winter gone, the Flour and other Proviant at an ebb in the House, the Family's were left alone in the bush and the search for work started all over again, unsuccessful as far as I was concerned. I broke a Garden with a shovel, dug and dried Seneera-root during the Summer and with help of a little Cash from my Brother managed to keep alive until harvest.\n40 Years History of a Homesteader:\n\nErnst Reinhard Haase\nPierceland, Sask.\n\n1912: The Balkan Wars foreshadowed a bigger Catastrophe and instinctively all Europeans became uneasy and the Literature distributed in this most Languages by the Canadian Government were eagerly read. The Prophecy of God's Hallowed Land: The Twentieth Century belongs to Canada if on one hand and the opportunity of acquiring 160 acres of Land for $10.00 and on the other, included luxurious Peasants and also Industrial Workers to look towards Canada as the place to escape from all the Inhumanities brewing of Europe which looked to most of them as a Kingdom and themselves as the future Ruler.\n\n1923: It was therefore no wonder that 1913 proved to be the Year with the biggest influx of Immigrants from Europe, the writer of this, his brother and a friend amongst them. Possession of Land was the first goal and and Homesteads north & west of St. Walburg were secured. As we did not have any financial means to start farming for the first number of Years working as Farmhands or whatever Job could be gotten for Wages, provided the means for living during the Winter and have some Land broken by other Neighbors, for a short time I worked at the Mental Asylum between the Battlefields, which at the time was under Construction, went to Regina after Lay-off and accepted a Job on the Grand Trunk and with a bunch of about 75 men were shipped by rail and Sow along the Fraser River to a Construction-Camp about 25 Miles this side of Port George, now: Prince George.\n\nWith approaching Harvest, I left the Construction-Camp and came east again to work in the Harvest-Fields. The Experiences gained by going from Regina on the Grand Trunk by way of Melville, Sasatoon, Edmonton & Jasper to the end of the Rail at the time at: Tete Jaune Cache, from there on a Snow down the Fraser River to Batterford, would fill a Book by itself.\n\nDuring Harvest & Threshing I worked north & west from Denholm and while there, my Wife & Baby-Son arrived from there on the old Country, also by friends site and family. After threshing we went onto one of the Homesteads and prepared Livings-Quarters for the Winter. Being totally inexperienced our Log-Shacks were by no means master-pieces still we were very proud of what we had done.\n\nThe Winter from 1913 to 1914 was fairly mild and we enjoyed Life in Canada much during our first Winter. No Work to do, except securing Wood for heating the Shacks which we needed to carry only on our shoulders from close by, was only playing for us.\n\nThe Winter gone, the Flour and other Provisions at an end in the House, the Family's were left alone in the bush and the search for work started all over again, unsuccessful as far as I was concerned. I broke a Garden with a shovel, dug and dried Sassafras-Roots during the Summer and with help of a little rain from my Brother managed to keep alive until harvest.\nFor harvesting & threshing I went with a number of neighbors to the Cut-knife District, and there we had a good time. The weather was fine, and we worked hard but happily.\n\n\"I am going to pay you $3.00 per day for stacking, but you will have to follow the binder with one more day - pay after the binder is done, or I pay you 18 cents per acre,\" one farmer offered me. I accepted it by the acre, not knowing if this was a fair price or not. If it had been $42.00 as the binders worked a total of 13 days, doing the 250 acres by the acre, I would have earned only $596.00, however I did it in 11 days. The farmer was very satisfied, saying: \"This is the cheapest stacking I ever had done, besides having good stocks.\"\n\nRight after harvesting, a period of heavy rainfalls prevented threshing and with another neighbor I went home for a time, finding our poorly built Log-Shack in a poor shape. The roof leaked terribly and I remember writing a letter under the table which with its Table-Cloth on top provided the only dry spot in the house. However, there was no time or money to do the necessary repair work to make the roof waterproof, the only consolation the women had: There were more houses in the neighborhood in the same shape.\n\nMy brother who worked that year at Charles Lang's farm near Brea, brought our heat-supply for the winter. Charles Lang butchered 6 hogs for him and gave it to him free of charge; the hog-prices at the time being very low and Charles Lang figured it didn't pay to feed them. For us, it surely was a very welcome gift. Charles Lang was elected M.P. in 1917.\n\nAfter everybody was home, the flour & other provisions with the available money was bought; the potatoes were measured and everything was rationed for the whole winter. By that time we had a good cow, for which I had made plenty of hay cutting it with a sythe, so while we didn't have anything to much, we were not suffering.\n\n1915 went by in about the same way, we were fortunately able to earn enough money to buy 3 oxen in the spring of 1916, get a plow & disk etc., on time and we started our own farming.\n\nBy the summer of 1916 we were more as 3 years in Canada and we made application for naturalization. While a number of our neighbors, who had come to Canada the same year as we, became naturalized shortly after our application, our applications were not more granted. We had send our application shortly after an order in council by the Dominion-Government had been issued, prohibiting the naturalization of aliens during the war.\n\nThis created quite a problem and as nobody knew at the time what the future would bring, we decided to concentrate only on one homestead to have a \"house above\" and drop the other homesteads altogether.\n\nHaving worked during seeding and harvesting & threshing in the Cut-knife district, we became acquainted there and during 1917 we worked there with our oxen (even by that time) doing plowing breaking etc., for wages and for 1918 we rented a farm buying seed for $500.00 in the spring. Unfortunately that year a heavy frost in July took the crop and we harvested only just about as much grain as we had sown and with the land-lords share we were poorer as in the spring.\n\n3. For working after the springing of crops ready without the plowing of crops.\nFor harvesting & threshing I went with a number of neighbors to the cut-off line district.\n\n\"I am going to pay you $3.00 per day for stacking, but you will have to follow the binder with one more day pay after the binder is done, or I pay you 18 cents per acre,\" one farmer offered me. I accepted it by the acre, not knowing if this was a fair price or not. If I had accepted it by the day, my total wages for stacking would have been $42.00 as the binders worked a total of 11 days doing the 220 acres by the acre I earned only $7.59, however I did it in 11 days. The farmer was very satisfied, saying \"This is the cheapest stacking I ever had done, besides having good stocks.\"\n\nRight after harvesting a period of heavy rainfalls prevented threshing and with another neighbor I went home for a time, finding our poorly built Log-Shack in a poor shape.

However, there was no glue or money to do the necessary repair work to make the roof waterproof, the only consolation the women had: There were more houses in the neighborhood in the same shape.\n\nMy brother who worked that year at Charles Lang's farm near Breen brought our meat-supply for the whole winter. Charles Lang butchered 6 hogs for him and give it to him free of charge, the hog-prices at the time being very low and Charles Lang figured it didn't pay to feed them. For us, it surely was a very welcome gift.

Unfortunately that Year a heavy Frost in July took the Crop and we harvested only just about as much Grain as we had sown, and with the Land-Lords Share we were poorer at the end of the Season.\nPIONEER EXPERIENCES: A GENERAL HISTORY\n\nDuring the summer (by then we had 10 oxen) we broke 250 acres. We bought a lot of Prairie-Wool was cut for sale and when our crop was ripe we bought a hay press and worked it all fall. The driving power being supplied by the oxen, driven by some of my friends children, halting very close to a house, a passer-by stopped his team came over and watched our operation. I asked him anything you want? He said no, I am just watching you fellows, no doubt you will do what you think is best for you, but I'll give you one good advice and that is: keep those oxen, as long as you have them, you have friends, whenever you get rid of them you'll find out that your friends are gone.\n\nWe often thought later of that men's advice, the same winter we sold all our oxen, bought horses, lost some of them, got beat by smart horse-traders etc.\n\nIn 1919 we bought seed again for $300.00 and had only a small crop. To make it short by buying Horses, Machinery etc. and going into debts during all those Years, my family stayed at the Homestead near St. Malburg, during all those Years, my family stayed at the Homestead near St. Malburg, I myself going to the Cut-Knife back and forth for seeding and harvesting & thrashing working at the Homestead & farming it only for feed for the winter for the Stock which gradually accumulated. My Family which in 1913 included only one big boy, gradually increased in 1915, 1917 & 1922 by the arriving of 3 girls.\n\nThe Boy was born in Germany and was only a few weeks old when he came to Canada. At the time we expected the next & first Baby in Canada, the nearest Doctor to the nearest Neighbor with a Team Lived 4 Miles away, the nearest Hospital (though he was only a Farmer -Doctor) 11 Miles away, the nearest Hospital at North-Battleford, the nearest Railroad-Station (Edm.) 441 Miles away.\n\nWe faced quite a Problem. We studied a good doctor Book in all its details and when the Baby arrived, I represented the Doctor, the Nurse and everything went O.K.\n\nWe did the same in 1917 & 1922, though Neighbor-Women came for bathing the Babies after they had arrived.\n\nThe 6 Year renting-experience finally resulted in the dissolving of the partnership with my friend and two Brothers. My Friend went to the south of the province, my brothers bought Land near Cut-Off and I stayed permanently at St. Malburg.\n\nOne of my Neighbors was employed by the Provincial Government as Fire-Ranger in the District north of the Beaver River. He told us of the good Land available for Homesteads and in the summer of 1927 I made a trip with another Neighbor to that District.\n\nI liked it very much and I filed on the N.W. 23-62-25 w. 3 m.\n\nDuring the winter from 1927 to 1928 the C.P.R. made a Survey through the District and when I arrived on my Homestead on June 3, 1928 to start breaking Land, on the very day a bunch of Land-seekers who had heard of the survey arrived also and all during that Summer a steady stream of Land-seekers visited us.\nDuring the summer (by then we had 10 oxen) we broke 250 acres of land. Wages during that year in the Out-land District was a lot of hard work and worked all fall. For sale and when our crop was grown we bought a hay press and worked all fall. Children, buying hay close to a road, a passer-by stopped his team came over and watched our operation. I asked him anything you want? He said, No! I am just watching you fellows, no doubt what you think is best for you, but I will give you one good advice and that is keep those oxen, as long as you have friends, you have friends, whenever you get rid of them you'll find out that your friends are gone.\n\nIn 1919 we bought horses, lost some for $300.00 and had only a small crop. Our oxen, bought horses, lost some again for $300.00 and had only a small crop. Machinery etc., and going into debts. We often thought later of that men's advice, the same winter we sold all our oxen, bought horses, lost some again for $300.00 and had only a small crop.\n\nTo make it short by buying horses, machinery etc., and going into debts during 1918 to 1920, it took us another years from 1921 to 1923 to pay them and at the end we were poorer as at the time we started to rent land. 6 Years were spent just for experience.\n\nDuring all those years, my family stayed at the homestead near St. Malburg. I myself going to the cut knife back and forth for seeding and harvesting & thrashing, working at the Homestead & farming it only for feed for the winter for the stock which gradually accumulated.\n\nFor the stock which gradually accumulated, my family which in 1913 included only one boy, gradually increased in 1915, 1917 & 1922 by the arriving of 3 girls.\n\nThe Boy was born in Germany and was only a few weeks old when he came to Canada. At the time we expected the next child first baby in Canada, the nearest hospital the nearest neighbor with a team lived 4 miles away, the nearest hospital (though he was only a farmer - doctor) 11 miles away, the nearest railroad station (Edam) 44 miles away.\n\nNo cars in the neighborhood, in fact no roads to drive a car on. We faced quite a problem. We studied a good doctor book in all its details and when the baby arrived, I represented the doctor, the nurse and everything went O.K.\n\nWe did the same in 1917 & 1922, though neighbor women came for bathing the babies after they had arrived.\n\nThe 6 year renting experience finally resulted in the dissolving of the partnership with my friend and two brothers. My friend went to the south of the province, my brothers bought land near Cut-Unitie and I stayed permanently at St. Malburg.\n\nOne of my neighbors was employed by the Provincial government as fire-fighter in the district north of the Beaver River. He told us of the good land available for homesteads and in the summer of 1927 I made a trip within another neighbor to that district.\n\nI liked it very much and I filed on the N.W. 23-62-25 W. 3 M. During the winter from 1927 to 1928 the C.P.R. made a survey through the district and when I arrived on my homestead on June 3, 1928 to start breaking land, on the very day a bunch of land-seekers who had heard of the survey arrived also and all during that summer a steady stream of land-seekers visited us.\nThe, what I considered, good enough land for agricultural purpose was all show up again, their land in turn was either cancelled by new Settlers or they had abandoned themselves.\n\nThe real influx of settlers came in the fall of 1930 & when the \"trick to the north\" from the dried-out Prairies was in full swing. The provincial Government surveyed more land for homesteads and lots of land were settled which at the time was considered unsuitable for farming, in spite of this a number of the settlers with their Grey-Bush-Soil and good Alfalfa-Crops & Prices did real good.\n\nWith no Roads, no schools, no hospitals or hospital in cases not enough clear Land to build Houses on, depending only on the meager Relief, most of the Settlers faced a big problem.\n\nBeing the first Homesteader, I naturally had a certain advantage, by being able to sell all our products, such as Butter, Potatoes, Beef & Feed Grain, Sheaves etc. to the Newcomers, thereby being able to keep away from the Relief Officer.\n\nOne Winter the Provincial Government operated a Relief-Camp on the Shore of Lac des Isle (Big Island Lake) and I supplied the Kitchen with dressed Pork at: Believe it or not, 5 Cents per Lb.\n\nI sold at one time 4 good Sowers for $12.00 a piece and hauled Wheat to the nearest Elevator at Fort Kent, Alberta 52 from the Farm and got 1/2 Cent 28 Cents per bushel. From the Farm I sold during that Year the Grain at 1/2 Cent per Lb., that is: Oats 17 Cents, Barley 24 and Wheat for 30 Cents a Bushel.\n\nThe Government bought for Settlers on Relief seed & Feed and paid for them with so-called Relief-Supply-Orders, which turned out to be no good for about seven Months. While the Government expected us, to accept those Orders in Payment for Seed or Feed, they Government refused to accept their own Money as payment for Taxes etc. Seed & Feed sold that way in the Spring of the Year was paid finally in cash during the following November by the Government.\n\nThe first Car-load of Wheat from North of the Beaver-River was shipped during the Winter 1928-29 by me to the Basie, Wheat-Pool. We did build a Granerie in sections, set it up in the Yard of a Farmer in Beaver Crossing, Alta., hauled the Wheat into it and hauled from there to the Station and loaded from the Platform.\n\nThe Price for it: 52 Cents per Bushel, after producing it, handle it twice and haul 34 Miles. What a difference of Conditions in the last 20 Years, at that time and now within only about 20 Years, at the time all hauling was done with Horses, now with Trucks.\n\nBesides the Homestead, I acquired another 1/2 Section from the Provincial Government by paying $1.00 per Acre, so called: Pasture-Land.\n\nJumping out of a Butter with a run-away team, one of our Girls, broke a Leg and again I acted as the Doctor, as the Horses at Loon Lake. We did get advice from him by travelling on Horse-back and everything turned out fairly good.\n\nWithin all the Children nearly married, we divided rented the Farm partly to our Son, partly to one of the Son-in-Laws and moved into the Hamlet of Pierceland, where I was for a Number of Years working as Secretary of different Co-op. Organizations, such as the Co-op. Store, Credit-Union, Alfalfa Growers and Co-op. Livestock-Shippers.\n\nAt present n now 72 1/2 Year old, I am still busy with odd Jobs.\n\nLooking back, I believe that, while the times were hard, a different and better type of Men & Women were the result, as compared with the present young generation.\n\nP. Haase\nThe, what I considered, good enough land for agricultural purpose was all filled on by the end of the summer, though a good deal of the settlers did not show up again, their land in turn was either cancelled by new settlers or they had abandoned themselves.\n\nThe real influx of settlers came in the fall of 1930 when the \"rush\" to the north from the settled-out prairies was in full swing. The provincial government surveyed more land for homesteads and lots of land were settled which at the time was considered unsuitable for farming. In spite of this a number of the settlers with their grey-bush-soil and good alfalfa-crops did real good.\n\nWith no roads, no schools, no hospital or hospital in cases not enough clear land to build houses on, depending only on the meager relief, most of the settlers faced a big problem.\n\nBeing the first homesteader, I naturally had a certain advantage, by being able to sell all our products, such as butter, potatoes, beef & feed grain, sheaves etc., to the newcomers, thereby being able to keep away from the relief officer.\n\nOne winter the provincial government operated a relief camp on the shore of Lac des Iles (Big Island Lake) and I supplied the kitchen with dressed pork at: believe it or not $5 cents per lb.\n\nI sold at one time 4 good steers for $12.00 a piece and hauled west to the nearest elevator at Kent Kent, Alberta 52 from the farm and got (allies) 28 cents per bushel. From the farm I sold during that year the grain at 1/2 cent per lb., that is oats 17 cents, barley 24 and wheat for 30 cents a bushel.\n\nThe government bought for settlers on relief seed and feed and paid for them with so-called relief-supply-orders, which turned out to be no good for about seven months. While the government refused to accept those orders in payment for seed or feed, they government refused to accept their own money as payment for taxes etc. Seed and feed sold that way in the spring of the year was paid finally in cash during the following winter by the government.\n\nThe first car-load of wheat from North of the Beaver River was shipped during the winter 1928-29 by me to the Sask. Wheat Pool. We did build a granary in sections set it up in the yard of a farmer in Heaver Crossing, Alta., hauled the wheat into it and hauled from there to the station and loaded from the platform.\n\nThe price for it: 52 cents per bushel, after producing it, handle it twice and haul only about 20 years, at the time all hauling was done with horses, now within 34 miles.\n\nWhat a difference of conditions per month, per day, per hour, per minute, per second, per minute, per hour, per day, per month, per year, per decade, per century, per millennium.\n\nBesides the homestead, I acquired another 1/2 section from the provincial government by paying $1.00 per acre, so called pasture land.\n\nJumping out of a cutter with a run-away team, one of our girls broke a leg and again I acted as the doctor, as the hours at the time were practically impossible to travel to the nearest doctor at Loon Lake. We did get advice from him by travelling on horse-back and everything turned out fairly good.\n\nWith all the children finally married, we remained rented the farm partly to our son, partly to one of the son-in-law's and moved into the hamlet of Pierceland, where I was for a number of years working as Secretary of different co-operative organizations, such as the Co-op store, credit union, alfalfa growers and co-op livestock shippers.\n\nAt present I am now 72 1/2 years old, I am still busy with old jobs.\n\nLooking back, I believe that while the times were hard, a different and better type of men and women were the result, as compared with the present generation.\n\nP.
