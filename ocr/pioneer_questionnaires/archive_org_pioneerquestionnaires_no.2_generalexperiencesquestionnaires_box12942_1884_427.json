They were very kind and did not harm us.\n\nThe school was a small wooden building, hunching around the wall, no chairs but the mud at the teacher's desk. We used slates to write on. I was only four and our first teacher just taught him Scottish rhyming.\nI am writing to express my deep concern regarding the recent developments in our community. The situation has become increasingly tense, and I believe it is crucial that we come together to address these issues.\n\nFirstly, I would like to acknowledge the efforts made by the local authorities to maintain order. However, I have noticed an uptick in incidents that seem to be escalating the tension further. It is essential that we find a way to resolve these conflicts peacefully.\n\nSecondly, I urge everyone to remain calm and composed. Let us focus on finding constructive solutions rather than allowing emotions to run wild. We must work towards a future where everyone feels safe and respected.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge all members of our community to come together and find common ground. Together, we can overcome any challenge.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nA word of explanation to the person answering the questionnaire\n\nIt is difficult to prepare a general questionnaire on pioneer life because no individual who is asked to answer it has exactly the same experiences as another.
