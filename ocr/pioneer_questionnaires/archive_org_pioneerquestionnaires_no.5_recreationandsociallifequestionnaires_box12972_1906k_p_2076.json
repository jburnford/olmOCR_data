My wife was often called upon in cases of sickness.\nIn the year a natural spring was found a little off the South east corner of homestead, had the water tested it was not suitable for drinking but was very useful for cattle. In winter the ice used to form about 12 feet high. I made an application for it to be kept as a public spring which was done, and 3 acres was allowed on the side of road allowance up to now the spring is still running. Our house was on the road from Shebo to Wadena & when we saw anyone go in the morning & not back before dark we hung a lighted lantern on the chimney for a guide in the dark & often people stayed over night.\n\nTrails were very bad to find in the dark especially if there was a prairie fire through the day.\n\nWe did not have a doctor nearer than 20 miles and no nurse.
