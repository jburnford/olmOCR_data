We traveled the fifteen miles to the farm with a neighbor in a lumber wagon, over roads which were trails, covered with rocks, at night, when only a light jar off in the distance could be seen. It was the longest ride I ever took, and I was wishing I was back home where I could go to school instead of being a pioneer. That memory will always be with me, I know.\n\n24.

What do you think are the most important changes in your community since you first came West?\nAs I have not visited the community when I have mentioned in this questionnaire for a good many years, I cannot say about what changes have taken place.
