Some of the questions will not apply to your experiences; others may prove impossible for you to answer, so don't worry about leaving blank spaces. The best thing to do is to give details or describe particular events to answer the questions.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1905, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experiences of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not. If there is not sufficient space to answer the questions, they should be written on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires:\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer Diet: What did Western Canadian Farmers Eat?\" is still being circulated. If you have not already answered this, and would be willing to do so, please put a check mark here ( ).\n\nSaskatchewan Archives questionnaires on other subjects will be prepared at a later date. Some of these are listed below. Please mark the ones you would be willing to answer.\n\nAll questionnaires listed:\n- Pioneer health conditions\n- Pioneer social life, sports and recreation\n- Pioneer housing\n- Pioneer education and churchwork\n- Pioneer farming experiences\n\nPreservation of Questionnaires:\n\nAll questionnaires will be preserved in the Saskatchewan Archives Board's Office at the University of Saskatchewan as part of the permanent record of our Province. Please send your completed Questionnaire to:\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Office,\nUniversity of Saskatchewan,\nSaskatoon, Sask.\nSASKATCHEWAN ARCHIVES QUESTIONNAIRES\n\nNo. 2\n\nPIONEER EXPERIENCES: A GENERAL QUESTIONNAIRE\n\nNOTE: Please print all proper names and place names in capital letters.
