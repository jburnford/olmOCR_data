Give a typical day's menu (breakfast, dinner & supper) for the earliest year you can remember. Give the year and list the members of the family with their ages at the time.

The most we ever had was tea. We had to get along on what tea was to get up on.\n\nWe were mother, (dad died in the flu) 3 boys and two girls.

(Always wanting a change.) We could eat fish week in and week out, we still love fish. We were different then all God must have made us that way as I don't think the younger generation could come down to live as we did and get along, they would sure think they were being abused, although they are some folks living that away today, and no need for it, their children are half good natured all the time.\n15. Give a typical family scene (breakfast, dinner & supper) for the earliest year you can remember. Give the year and list the members of the family with their ages at the time.

(Give details.)\n\nChristmas dinner was just another ordinary meal, with whatever extras mother could try to make out of nothing. No one ate in as they were no fun and no dinner.\n\n19. Have you ever refused to almost starvation? Give details.\n\nWe never thought we'd starve to death today as we got well. But and we were not hard to please so if it had always been a change we would have made sure that way as I don't think the younger generation would come down to this as we did and get along, they would sure think they were having a hard time, although they are now quite well off.\n20. Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homestead and home prepared foods?
