Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\nMaybe there's little difference except that now the housewife has so many labor-saving appliances, automatic stoves that less work is actually used in cooking a much larger meal, than would have been incurred 50 years ago when all she had was a cook stove equipped for burning wood, maybe the wood was only green poplar poles.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homegrown and home prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible).\n\nWhen the Railway arrived here in 1909, we gradually lost the habit of preparing for 6 months supply, I bought in smaller quantities I had more variety; I would say the change began in 1909 but was not in full swing until after the first war, maybe 1920.\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include items not mentioned above, quality, methods of merchandizing, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. (Use back of page if more space is needed).\n\nNot much more to add, except a word about tobacco. We used to purchase tobacco in large packages with a pipe imbedded in the mixture. This was French Canadian \"Tobac\" it wasn't nice to smoke, after being used to better prepared stuff, but when we ran out of smoking altogether we used to dry the tea leaves, mix them with the inner bark of the Red Willow (Smoke that). It smelled awful & tasted worse! Its usual name was \"Kini Kini\". Many matches were of the Sulphur variety & when ignited, you had to wait until the Sulphur burned away before lighting your pipe, as the Sulphur fumes were very powerful & not at all palatable.\n20. Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\nMaybe there's little difference except that now the housewife has so many labour-saving appliances, automatic stoves that less work is actually used in cooking a much larger meal, than would have been incurred 50 years ago when all she had was a coal stove equipped for burning wood, (maybe the wood was only green poplar poles).\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homegrown and home prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible).\n\nWhen the Railway arrived here in 1909, we gradually lost the habit of preparing for 6 months supply, I bought in smaller quantities I had more variety; I would say the change began in 1909 but was not in full swing until after the first war, maybe 1920.\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include items not mentioned above, quality, methods of merchandising, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. (Use back of page if more space is needed).\n\nNot much more to add, except a word about tobacco. We used to purchase tobacco in large packages with a pipe imbedded in the mixture. This was French Canadian \"Jobac\" & it wasn't nice to smoke, after being used to better prepared stuff, but when we ran out of smoking cigarettes we used to dry the tea leaves & mix them with the inner bark of the Red Willow & smoke that. It smelled awful & tasted worse! Its usual name was \"Kini Kini\". Many matches were of the Sulphur variety & when ignited, you had to wait until the Sulphur burned away before lighting your pipe, as the Sulphur fumes were very powerful & not at all palatable.\nOxford\n\nNo. 613 S\n\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jessylee/PioneerQuestionnairesPDFs//PioneerQuestionnaires_No.1-DietQuestionnaires_Box12937_1906A-D_174.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 20, "total-input-tokens": 33200, "total-output-tokens": 6619, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 2], [0, 1693, 3], [1693, 3830, 4], [3830, 5124, 5], [5124, 6154, 6], [6154, 7463, 7], [7463, 8627, 8], [8627, 13210, 9], [13210, 16729, 10], [16729, 20550, 11], [20550, 21780, 12], [21780, 23016, 13], [23016, 24329, 14], [24329, 25895, 15], [25895, 27422, 16], [27422, 29231, 17], [29231, 31046, 18], [31046, 31046, 19], [31046, 31200, 20]], "primary_language": ["None", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, true, true, false, true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]}}]
