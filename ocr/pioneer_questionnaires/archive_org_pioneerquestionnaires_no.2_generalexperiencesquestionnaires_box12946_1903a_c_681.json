Some of the questions here will not apply to your experiences; others may prove impossible for you to answer, so don't worry about leaving blank spaces. Feel free to give details, or describe particular events, if they help to answer the questions.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who have lived in Western Canada before 1917, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer List: What Has Happened Since?\" is still being circulated.
