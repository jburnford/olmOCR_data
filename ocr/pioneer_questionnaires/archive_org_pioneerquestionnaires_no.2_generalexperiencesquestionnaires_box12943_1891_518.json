We had to make a long journey by horseback to attend services. The church was very small and the service was held in the schoolhouse. It was a difficult trip, but we enjoyed it.\nSo he went home. He had one boy and a girl with him, and he called them in and he killed the girl and thought that he had killed the boy. Then he cut his own throat with a mould knife. He threw the boy & girl into a bed, thought they were dead. A neighbor went over and saw how things went and came into H.O. and reported it. My dad drove the Methodist missionary out, and they found out what had happened. Rev. Harrison said the boy was still alive. He went to work and dressed the wound. Still alive, he went to work and dressed the wound. And they hailed west bound express and put him in hospital in Portage La Prairie and took him to hospital in Portage La Prairie and he came through all right. Some of the neighbors asked him what happened; he said the old fool just went crazy.\nSo he went home.
