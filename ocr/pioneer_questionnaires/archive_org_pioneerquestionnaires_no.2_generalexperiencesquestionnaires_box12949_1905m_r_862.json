On the morning of the day of the surrender of the Province of Saskatchewan in July 1905, I received a telegram from Mrs. Wilson saying that the Governor General was visiting Regina. I knew that the Butter Family was going to stay there for about 400 days, so I decided to go there for the regular train. I managed through the C.P.R. Agent to find the Butter family at the Canadian Hotel which was in town through the offices about 10:30 A.M. I also heard by the Provincial Secretary that they were to be home for the following year. I heard nothing further about a Butter Family, so the announcement I had heard must have been a misunderstanding.\n\nAbout that afternoon a ship arrived carrying supplies to Japan, which was at that time closed at war with Russia. The ship was an American vessel named the Plunkett Lewis from Japan who arrived through the offices on their way to the East. To send a representative from Russia on the same boat, I sent a message to the Governor General during his visit to the Governor General's residence. They came by train to Prince Albert and packed on the railroad siding.\nTo continue from page 23 - There are some incidents\n\nof the day of the discovery of the Princess &\n\nRegina Royalty - July 1905. I received a telegram from\n\nMrs. Wilson - July 8th. Mrs. Wilson was residing in\n\nRegina during the Butter Fair. She had been there\n\nfor about two weeks and was very busy.\n\nI then proceeded to the regular train. We met another\n\nthrough freight by special arrangement. I managed\n\nto get the C.P.R. Agent to put the Butter aboard an\n\nexpress train which ran through the office\n\nabout 10:30 A.M. I also heard by the same line\n\nwhich runs to the Butter Fair. For the following\n\nmorning, I heard nothing further about\n\na Butter Fair. So the arrangements I shipped\n\nwere made.\n\nAlso that afternoon a shipyard was being built\n\nover at the Butter Fair. The shipyard was designed\n\nby the Russians and held by them as a Canadian\n\nshipyard. I knew the Butter Fair from afar, but\n\nI could not see anything from the train.\n\nBerlin, B.S.A. To send a representative from Russia\n\non the condition of other countries. To arrange a\n\nsubdivision of the town. Also during this\n\nthe Government General. Then came your\n\nBritish Railways can be purchased on the railway.\nThe Creamery while we met the Reitman went on a Hunting Trip somewhere North of the Snake River. We knew one of the nice people there. We Grand Trunk Pacific had the privilege of seeing the scenery there going on the train of the Grand Trunk Pacific. I set out to find some friends in early Nov 1905. Going to Regina I went to the offices and got plans of Nova Scotia which helped me. Then proceeded to Prince Albert which was also through Saskatchewan. We passed over a Bridge and then we were going East until the following day there were Canadian Trains and then the line of the Canadian Northern.\n\nThat evening afternoon I got my first experience of High Tying a Plains fire. A huge Column of smoke and flames was seen burning in from the west driven by a wind blowing at 25 m.p.h. The fire was a great danger and warning. We did not try much further from a Trail to the North of the Village and also watched for any flags which warned from the Trail and fire was out of our sight. The following day I took Train for Hearst Hotel and back on the main line. Fortunately it was very late and I almost missed looking over this area but\nThe Creamery, built by Mr. and Mrs. Richardson, was located in a beautiful setting overlooking the Snake River Valley.\n\nRichardson, who had traveled extensively throughout the Pacific Northwest, was particularly fond of the area's natural beauty.\n\nIn 1905, the Creamery was sold to Mr. and Mrs. Johnson, who continued to operate it successfully until their deaths in 1920.\n\nToday, the Creamery stands as a testament to the rich history of the region.\ndid not find enough questions for their family class.\n\nI replied to most of my arguments as I wrote down.\n\nJohn James was held in a new state office three or four times. He questioned me on a topic which I thought would be interesting and then told me that there was just about nothing to say about it.\n\nRemained on the train that evening until two o'clock in the morning. He invited me to go along with him and toured down on the land in question. This Jacob Tal and family went back to Alexandria and lived on their homestead Nov. 28th, 1905 - May 8th, 1907.\n\nThe location was very fine at that time. There had not been any snow and it was so mild I had to take off my overcoat while driving around. This area was then known as \"The Big Sioux Plains.\"\n\nThe telegraph line and trail other which ran through our premises fell to 309. The day after the fire, the telegraph wires across the premises fell to the ground. The telegraph line was also down. The fire was caused by the salt from which the newly planted hay caught fire when it was hit by the lightning.\n\nAnd I am writing a story of the telegraph line at the University of Nebraska. Please return with it. T.E.P.\ndid not find except question 8 for Paul family also.\n\nZapata. He met my acquaintance as I went down.\n\nQuestion. Then returned to Albuquerque and met a man.\n\nJohn Johnson who had a new estate office there at that time. He questioned me a lot about his travels and then told me that there was a road almost between there and\n\nRancho de los Ranchos and that he was going to the\n\nPacific on the train. He invited me to go along with\n\nhim and brought him on the boat in Guadalupe. We\n\nstayed there overnight Nov. 28th 1905 - Jan. 7th 1906\n\nThe location was very nice at that time. There had not\n\nbeen any dams and it was so mild I had to take\n\nmy overcoat while driving around. This area\n\nwas then known as \"The Big Quill Plains.\"\n\nThe all telegraph line and trail other which are familiar\n\nwere formed during the Riel Rebellion in 1885.\n\nOur headquarters #309. The day after the war ended\n\nthere was a big dinner across the river at\n\nthe South End of the Murrayfield where I left them.\n\n1944. There were also homes of the Allen and\n\nthe Telegraph lines. This part of the town was\n\ncalled the Salt Flats which is really almost the\n\nCarter where summer tents or the earliest days\n\nand raising a young cattle camp to grow as a result.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of\n\nthe R.M. 309 which shows the\n\nZapata River's best looking at the\n\nS.E. corner and crossing to New Mexico.
