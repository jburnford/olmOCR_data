Some of the questions here will not apply to your experiences; others may prove invaluable for you to answer, so don't worry about having blank spaces. The questions are intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1914, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experiences of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer List: What Did You Answer?\" is still being circulated. If you have not already answered this, and would be willing to do so, please put a check mark here ( ).\n\nSaskatchewan Archives questionnaires on other subjects will be prepared at a later date.
