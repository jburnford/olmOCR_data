Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\nThe difference for preparing meals in those days from these, I think are, that we had to use more forethought to keep lots of essential food on hand, such as flour, sugar, cooked it in case of uncertain weather and bad roads, being so far from neighbors or the store, having no phones or many conveniences that we have these days.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homestead and home prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible).\n\nI think about 1910 that we began to realize that we could get almost everything we wished for and neighbors began to settle nearer to us.\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include items not mentioned above, quality, methods of merchandising, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. (Use back of page if more space is needed).\n\nIn regard to Sec. 22. I would like to say that from 1893 until 1912 we lived on a farm which my husband and I homesteaded between Peace River and Grande Prairie close to the C.P.R. track & there between we got our washing water, & my husband took the contract of plowing the field around & underseeded with the neighbors, & I used to go into Peace River 14 miles once a week. We think in the earliest years with horse teams to trade my butter & eggs for groceries, got four 125 lb. a lot for butter & a 1/2 doz crate of eggs for 40\u00a2 & my children had to go 5 or 6 miles in a buckboard to finishing school but I think we were happier & more content than than many people are today.\n\nPlease excuse writing as I am past 82 years.\nThe difference for purchasing much in their days from ours, I think was that we had less money for things to keep lots of essentials for ourselves such as flour, sugar, canned goods, etc., because of unemployment. We didn't have a lot of money for luxuries or even necessities. Our lives were hard those days.\n\nI think about 1910 that we began to realize that we could not obtain everything we wished for and neighbors began to help each other.\n\nIn April 15th 22nd I will take it very easy then from 1893 until 1914 we lived on a farm which my husband bought near the town of Sparta called the C.P.R. Black & White. But we got our living by working on the farm and doing odd jobs for neighbors, and we had 15 acres of land. By now 14 miles away a neighbor built a house for us, but we had to build our own. We had my husband help us with the work. We had my children help us too. We worked hard to make ends meet, but I think we were happy and content. The weather was very harsh and cold those years.\n\nPlease excuse writing on paper, please be kind.\nThe Homestead club at Lincoln, Nebraska, send their regards to me, when my children from here came on the plains during 1915-16, and being very kind and generous they invited me to stay with them in their home. They treated me kindly and when I arrived my children knew the need of my children who were in the midst of war, and they gave me shelter and comfort.\n\nYour very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCalifornia U.S.A.\nThe Homemakers club at Cawth, S.A., sent these papers on to me, when my eldest son has been on the farm, since 1925. I met him very near old times there, suppose they thought I was one of the few left around the River & Ground Creek district where I raised my children. Now the rest of my children are in the States so am living with my 2nd son in Fresno. I am enjoying life.\n\nWith thanks for your very kindly wishes and best regards,\n\nMary E. Roe\nc/o W. A.
