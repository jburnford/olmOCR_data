On his way home he tied up the horses (bronks) and went in a house to see about a midwife. And found when he came out the horses had broken loose and gone. He walked home eleven mile and hunted three days for the team and found them looking very quaint. The colo oil was spilled in the flour. We tried to use it, but it created too much gas, so it was used for making paste etc.\n\nThat was 1907\nIt was very difficult to get a meal every day without purchasing new food.
