Some of the questions here will not apply to your experience; others may prove impossible for you to answer, so try to be brief about leaving blank spaces.\n\nThe extra sheets of paper if necessary, should be sufficient space to answer the questions. Don't hesitate to give details, or describe particular events, if they help to answer the questions.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1924, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nSaskatchewan Archives have which have been prepared or projected are listed below. Please mark the ones you would be willing to answer.\n\n- All questionnaires\n- Pioneer diet\n- Pioneer schools\n- Pioneer churches\n- Pioneer recreation and social life\n- Pioneer farming experiences\n- Pioneers in Saskatchewan\n- Pioneer health and housing\n\nPreservation of Questionnaires\n\nAll questionnaires will be preserved in the office of the Saskatchewan Archives at the University of Saskatchewan as part of the permanent record of our Province.
