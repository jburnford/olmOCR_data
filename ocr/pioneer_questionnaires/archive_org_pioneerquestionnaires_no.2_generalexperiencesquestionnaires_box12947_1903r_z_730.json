If there is not sufficient space to answer the question, write in the margin or on separate sheets.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1925, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or supply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nDistrib Questionnaires\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer Life: What Did Eastern Canadian Pioneers Have?\" is still being circulated. If you have not already answered this, and would be willing to do so, please get a check here.\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire on other subjects will be prepared at a later date. Check off those you listed below.
