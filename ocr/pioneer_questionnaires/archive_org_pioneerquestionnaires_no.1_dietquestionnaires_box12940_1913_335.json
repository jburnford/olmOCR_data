Give details.\n\nMy husband planted in 1911. Asparagus, it is still on the place, also strawberries planted 1912. Crab apples from Ottawa experimental farm. Some of them still producing and we always had all the vegetables. Potatoes, cabbage, celery, onions, carrots, peas, beans, dried & fresh, cucumbers, tomatoes. The first year I put up canned, over 75 quarts of fruit. Wild strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, were plentiful, but you had to watch out for them. Mosquitoes and flies nearly ate you up, but what did that matter if you had a good cellar full of fruit.\nDear Mr. and Mrs. Smith,\n\nI am writing to express my gratitude for your kind invitation to attend your Christmas dinner. I am honored to be included in such a special event.\n\nYour generosity is truly appreciated. I look forward to spending time with you and enjoying the festivities.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]\n20.

When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homestead and home prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible).\n\nI have not started to rely on purchased food yet. We have always baked our own bread, canned our own fruit, meat etc., and my husband keeps bees so we have all the honey we want.\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include items not mentioned above, quality, methods of merchandising, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. (Use back of page if more space is needed).\n\nWhen I prepared for my first town dinner, I used to buy a few currants, raisins, candied peel etc. for cake and puddings. So it was no hardship to make them when the time came. Anyone passing needing a meal or bed was always welcome. My neighbour once said, \"Don't you use a lot of flour?\" So many visitors I had told her when that sack has gone there always seems money for another. She said it must be little the widow's cruse of oil. It failed not, neither did it shrink.\nThen did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of home grown and home prepared foods? (Give as many details as possible).\n\nI have not started to rely on purchased food yet. We have always taken our own food. I mean we eat food. Canned or our own food too. Have all the money we want.\n\nPlease tell other details from your early experiences of buying groceries.\n\nWhen I purchased food, I often bought canned goods. Racine's canned food, etc., for sale at the store when they were plentiful. So it was no hardship to make them when the time came. Anyone passing needing a meal or bed was always welcome. My neighbour once asked if you use a lot of flour. So many people had said he used that much flour. She paid it back in money. The widow's house of oil must be sold. Neither old or young. It failed out, neither old or young.\nI wonder what the trappers would think of today. If they had trapped marmots in 1914, a friend of ours trapped 600 rats for the price of 6 cents each. $36.00 dollars for 600 rats.\n\nOne year in 1930, we could not sell rasp (cultivated) only for 10 cents a quart\u2014lovely big one free from insects. I canned nine 245 quarts. Later in fall sold them for 40 cents quart, got my sailors back.\n\nOne year we sold dressed pork 2 3/4 cents a lb.\n\nIn 1930 food No. 2 wheat was 18 cents a bushel cost 9 cents for threshing, all other labor and seed.\n\nIn 1921 fall, a neighbor sold 13 head of cattle. One cow 2 and 3 years old for $75 dollars. One head today would bring that price.\n\nOne year had 1400 bushel potatoes sold about 100 bushel in fall 25 cents bushel. 200 more in spring delivered them 25 cents away, 25 cents bushel. Next sold 5 cents bushel.\n\n3 clock wagon load $5 dollars. But they had to come out of the root house. A neighbor had 1,000 bushel white potatoes hocused lovely. Never sold a bushel. But we lived through it all. And never went in debt.\n\nIf eggs or butter went down in price when we got to the store, we just crossed off the items, we could do without. How much better than the installment plan no worries about paying bill. We just did not have any.\n\nYours truly,\nMrs. E. M. Johnson\nI wonder what we shipped hereabouts in\nof today. If they had shipped hereabouts in\n1914, a friend of ours shipped 600 cats for\nthe price of 6 cents each. 36,000 dollars for\n600 cats.\n\nOne year in 1930, we could not sell Rasp (cultivated)\nonly 10 cents a quart. Got my scales back.\nSold them for 40 cents a quart. Got my scales back.\nOne year we sold dried beans for 25 cents a lb.\nIn 1921 fall, a crop of 13 head of cattle\nSome 2 and 3 years old for $75 dollars. One\nhead today would buy their price\n\nLast year had 1400 bushel potatoes @ 10\u00a2\nabout 100 bushel in fall 85\u00a2 cut - crushed\n200 more in spring delivered them 25\u00a2 extra\naway. 25\u00a2 cut - crushed next fall 5\u00a2 cut - crushed\n3 deck wagon load. Next fall they had\nto come out of the rent house. A neighbour\nhad never tried white potatoes before. Lovely\npotatoes. Never sold a crushed bush - ever\nlived through it all. And never went\nin debt.\n\nIf egg or butter were down in prices when\nwe got to the store, we could do without. How\nthe fellows, we could do without. Plan\nmuch better than the two tall men. Didn't\nbother about paying bills. We just didn't\nnot have any.
