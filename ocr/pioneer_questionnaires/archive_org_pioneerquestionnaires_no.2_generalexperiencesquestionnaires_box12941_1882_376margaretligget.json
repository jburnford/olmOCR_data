They were both born in the County Tyrone in Ireland. Father came to the United States in 1867. There he met my mother who had come to U.S.A. a few years later than he did. They lived in U.S.A. for the first six years of their married life. Father at that time was working in a factory in Indiana. The heat was too much for his health and a change was essential. In the meantime his sister who had come from Ireland with him had married George Weldon a telegraph operator. They had gone to Humboldt where the government in Ottawa had run a single wire through the country? I think my uncle's duties were to wire weather conditions to Ottawa in order to learn if this climate was suitable for population. I believe he was also responsible to let Ottawa know if Indians were likely to make trouble. When the railway came in 1882 the Weldons moved to Grenfell, and it was through them that my father and mother decided to come to Canada. They brought three small children with them. Five more of us were born at Indian Head.\n\nThe hardships which they endured, I only know from hear-say. The most primitive conditions had passed before I was old enough to recognize them. I have heard my mother say that before coming to Canada she was terrified of the Indians. Her second winter in Indian Head there was a tent with two hundred Indians in it across the street from the Liggett shanty. During the winter a lot of those Indians starved to death. Yet they never took anything from the few white inhabitants. The Indians were so much in the majority that they could have killed all the whites and taken their stores of food. When the rebellion broke out in 1885, my mother was not frightened of the Indians in spite of all the stories of atrocity. At that time every white man in Indian Head was away at the rebellion and the women and children were alone; but even that did not frighten her.\n\nMy father and mother came to Indian Head on one of the first trains to reach there in November of 1882. There were people who came earlier and who drove with oxen or walked from Brandon in the spring of that year.\n\nIndian Head continued to be my parents' home until their deaths in 1919 and 1924.\n\nOf father's family, only four are living. My sister, Mrs. Bessie W. Hoar, 2270 McIntyre St., Regina, Sask., is a widow and a retired school teacher. My brother W. A. Liggett still farms the old homestead at Indian Head. He has bought other land adjoining it and farms five quarters. My sister Mrs. Edna Watkins, Hubbard, Saskatchewan, is wife of the post master there. I am home teacher (or travelling teacher) for the Canadian National Institute for the Blind in Southern Saskatchewan.\n\nMy father's grandchildren.\n\nCharles Gaddes, real estate business in Kelowna, B.C.\nLeonard Gaddes owns his saw mill in Westbank, B.C.\nWilliam H.

Did you travel by yourself or with a party (family, friends or other groups)?\n\n13. What means of transportation did you use?\n\nFor more than twenty years after my parents arrived in Indian Head in 1882 farmers drew wheat to Indian Head from sixty miles north and sixty miles South. At that time it was considered the largest initial wheat shipping point in the world. It was not until the lines were built through Abernethy and Francis, that the importance of Indian Head as a wheat centre was decreased.\n\n14. What incidents of the journey West do you remember?
