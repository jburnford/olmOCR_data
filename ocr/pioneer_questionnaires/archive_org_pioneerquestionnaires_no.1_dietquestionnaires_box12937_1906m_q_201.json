By 1912 our lives had changed altogether. The country was taken over by farmers. We ranchers were confined to leases which were fenced and so our pioneer days were ended we had to become fully civilized.\n20.

When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homestead and home preserved foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible.)\n\nAbout 1918\u2014a railroad came between us and main line of C.P.R. and we could get fresh fruit and more supplies.\n\n22.
