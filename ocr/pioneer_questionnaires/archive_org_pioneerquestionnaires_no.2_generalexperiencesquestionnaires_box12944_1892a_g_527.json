TITLE OF QUESTIONNAIRE TO THE PERSON COMPLETING THIS QUESTIONNAIRE\n\nIt is difficult to prepare a general questionnaire on pioneer life because no individual who is asked to answer it has exactly the same experiences as another. Some of the questions here will not apply to your experiences, but there may be others which are applicable.\n\nIn preparing for your answers, you should try to recall all the facts that you can about your pioneer experiences. You may find it helpful to list them in order of their occurrence, or to make a list of things you remember. If you have any photographs or other personal memorabilia, you may wish to include them with your answers.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1914, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experiences of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer Pictorial History,\" has been completed.

And perhaps build a more substantial fortune there than on the Prairies was that I was a Britisher. That year there was a rush of liberty land as I had never been as a boy on Prince Edward Island and my parents had installed this as a great project for the next three months. Another thing was that I did not want to work in Prills or Calgary if I wanted a job & call my own day. There that I wanted to go to the mills.\n\nDay there all the clerks were there. This being a presidential election. All the ladies were there. (My Pal Nelson) brought down a lot of votes. We were voting in Music Hall and counted them. We were each of the officers in a large official hall. The ballot box was the superintendence of the city council. Each had a copy of the voting list. When the polls closed he was asked for his vote. He wanted to get away from that. And I thought I would send my vote by mail. So I got them from you down the mountain of Thomas and gave them to Canada in the best country to have a family in.\nI would refer you to Frank Gurnett.\n\nSome Reason why I stayed in Saskatchewan\n\nWhile I could have stayed in the New England States and perhaps build there accumulated so much more wealth than on the Prairies now that I was a Britisher. That year there a wave of Liberty beckoned me. I had never been a boy on Prince Edward Island and my parents had instilled into me a great respect for the Land. Another thing was that I did not want to work in Mills or Factories. I wanted the freedom to build in the Country. I wanted to go out and call my own own work there that I could work on an election day. Also the way the farmers worked on an election day. There all the farmers were working hard. This being a Provincial Election. The candidates, Mr. Macdonald and Mr. Laurier (Mr. Laurier said let us go down to the Hall and vote in Ontario). It was a big affair. The Hall was filled with people. Each had a copy of the working list which they had to sign. The next ballot, he wanted to get away from that. And I found myself with my own thing to sign. They have gone down the mountain of time. And I felt that Canada is the best Country for raising a family in.\nSome Reason why I Stayed in Saskatchewan\n\nWhile I could have stayed in the New England States and perhaps could have accumulated as much or more wealth than on the Prairies, was that I was a Britsher, that I knew there abuses of liberty such as I had never seen as a boy on Prince Edward Island and my parents had installed into us a great respect for the Constitution. Christian thing was that I did not want to watch in Canada if wanted to go back to my open air hut on the Country if wanted to go back to my own. I also said there that the workmen in the Mills had to vote the way the bosses wished. On an election day there all the debates were closed. This being a Provincial Election. The Candidates, Macdonald, Haggard, My Pal Nelson (Mr. David) Red was drawn to the Voting in Music Hall and watched them vote. We were in this building was for travelling shows. Sitting up on the stage was the Mayor, returning officers. Great right behind early. The officers was a little officially by the Berlin Mills Co.\n\nAnd the Superintendent of the Green Paper Mills Co. They had a copy of the voting list which the voter tipped up he was asked this question. He is anxious and who he wished to vote for. He meant this for you. Glad was before Austria but brought him in the face was the big Millman. If I gain tomorrow the next bullet. So wanted to get away from that. And I found liberty under my own flag. So this is a day I came down. The number of times, and I felt them coming down. To raise a family in Mr. Campbell's Canada in the best country to raise a family in. Mr. Campbell.\nOne Reason why I stayed in Saskatchewan while I could have stayed in the New England States, and perhaps build huge accumulations of much more wealth than on the Prairies was that I was a Briton, that I knew there abuses of liberty such as I had never seen as a boy in Prince Edward Island and my parents had installed into us a great respect for the Constitution. Christian thing was that I did not want to work in Omaha or Chicago. I wanted the open air but on the Boundary I wanted a spot & call my name also day three that he worked so the walls had to vote the way the business wished. On an election day there all the debates were closed. This being a Provincial Election the Candidates Charles Land & Harwood (my pal Nelson) M. E. said let me go down to the Voting in Music Hall and watch them vote. We went into building was for travelling shows. Sitting up on the stage was the Mayor returning officials. Great ring it behind early. The officers were a high officials of the Board Mills. They fixed the Superintendent of the Town Paper Mills Co. They each had a copy of the writing book within the writer stepped up he was asked this question in his address and who he was had to read from looking him in the face was the big Philosopher. He said something to me and wrote down. That was Liberty Austria &a. Bought his the current bullet. So wanted to get away from that. And I found liberty under my own flag. So far I was getting down the gun down the number of times, and I felt them Canada in the best country to raise a family in.\n6.\n\n37.
