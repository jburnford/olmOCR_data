MARGARET MCLELLAN\n\n2. Your address: ARCOLA, SASKATCHEWAN\n\n3. Date: SEPTEMBER 1952\n\n4. Where were you born? (Give name of place and country) I was born in Brussels, Ontario in the county of Huron.\n\n5. What was your father's name and occupation? Thomas Hislop; he was a farmer. We had fifty acres of land and one half miles south of Brussels.\n\n6. When did you come to Saskatchewan? (Give month and year) We came to the North West Territories on April 11th 1885.\n\n7. Mention any other places where you lived before coming to Saskatchewan, giving dates wherever possible. We came direct from Brussels to the Moose Mountain district coming by C.P.R. to Moosomin and then by horse and wagon from there to our homestead.\n\n8. How old were you when you first came to Western Canada? (You do not need to answer this question if you would rather not or you may use \"I was a small child\", \"I was in my teens\", etc.) I was nineteen years old. I was born on December 29th 1865 at Brussels where my parents lived after their marriage in 1860.\n\n9. What were your reasons for coming West? My father's brother had a lot of sons and I had three brothers all younger than myself. The older men thought it best for the younger to establish themselves on farms. Western Canada offered that opportunity. One Uncle came to Manitoba shortly before while another had gone to Kansas with his larger family and yet another to North Dakota the same time we came to Saskatchewan. The small farms around us were becoming congested and if one wanted to farm it was better to migrate somewhere. Possibly the adventurous spirit had little to do with it too. We heard a great deal about the wonders of these places. Just why my father chose western Canada instead of Kansas I don't know unless he wanted to stay under the British flag which I knew full well.\n\n10. How did you learn about the West? (Through other people? Reading about it? Railroad or government information?) Mostly other people talking about it and from people who had been out and come back to Ontario. My father came out in 1882, homesteaded and then came back for us. We sold everything by auction sale but the horses and cattle we took to the west and my uncle rented the land until it was sold a few years after.\nPIONEER EXPERIENCES: A GENERAL QUESTIONNAIRE\n\nNOTE: Please print all proper names and place names in capital letters.

I worked on the farm around us and were becoming organized and one wanted to live in the city.

In the early days many people preferred to stay under the British flag because they realized about it and railroad or government information. Monthly other people talking about it and from people who had been out and come back to Ontario. My father came out in 1882, however, and cattle took to the west and my wife raised the Lord until it stood off a few years after.\n11. What did your friends and relatives think of your decision to come to Western Canada? Most of them thought it was a very good idea. My sister would not come with us as she was teaching. Both she and her fianc\u00e9 came out the next summer and were married at home this was the first wedding in this part of the country; In the Moose Mountain district so far as we can learn.

(People you met on the way, meetings with Indians, adventures on the journey, accidents or other excitement etc.) There was nothing unusual about our trek in. We stayed at Greenbank's all night, that was the stopping place, and Mrs. Greenbanks made beds for us in our own little hut but we had a comfortable sleep. There were several others inside our family bedded down for the night. Mother, unable to sleep got up when she heard Mrs. Greenbanks moving around. The men had hung their wet clothes on a line over the kitchen stove to dry. Mrs. Greenbanks made a huge pot of rolled oats porridge and left the lid off mother going around the kitchen shortly after the porridge was boiling saw one of these heavy knitted socks fall in. Mrs. Greenbanks fished out the sock and stirred up the porridge. At breakfast mother drank tea and took bread and a boiled egg. We children and father tucked in a goodly supply of porridge and enjoyed it. Mother told us afterwards. We reached our farm about sunset that day, we had our food for the summer with us.\n\n15. Where did you first stay when you arrived in Saskatchewan? Father had been out in the spring of 1882 and he and a nephew and cousins had built log house, or rather hut as it had only one room so the house did us until they built the house that summer getting logs from the Moose Mountains and using concrete as there was lots of gravel in the little prairie creek near by. This house is still standing and is occupied by the youngest son. My youngest brother. It is still in good repair and is about as large as the house we thought it small at the time.\n\n16.

The brother went back to Ontario.\n\n17. Mention any other places where you have lived since coming to Saskatchewan. We have lived no other place even when I married my husband had land in township 8 range 4 and I only moved half a mile.\n\n18. How did you earn a living before coming to Western Canada? How after you came? My father and brothers farmed there was no school for my teenage brothers to go to so they had to learn what they did at home. I went to Manitoba and taught school for two summers before I married and then the first summer I was married both my husband and myself taught school. I walked to the school near by and he rode horseback to his some eight or ten miles distant. No it would not be 8 miles away about six. I walked a mile the other direction. I was the first teacher in our school my husband's school had been opened the summer before the name of the teacher before him was Melissa Jefferson and the name of the school was Buffalo Head. This was the first school for miles and miles until ours, Clare, opened in 1887. Buffalo Head opened in 1886.\n21. What did your friends and relatives think of your decision to come to Western Canada? Most of them thought it was a very good idea. My sister would not come with us as she was teaching. Both she and her fianc\u00e9 came out in the fall of 1949.\n\nAugust 4th, 1949, we were married at home.

We stayed at Greenbank's place all night, that was the only place we could find. There were several others beside our family bedded down there for the night. Mother made a big pot of soup for dinner and let it boil over the fire. She cooked some bread and butter and a boiled egg. We children played around the house and drove the cows and played around the house a lovely afternoon.\n\n15. Where did you first stay when you arrived in Saskatchewan? Father had been out in the spring of 1948 and he and a relative had built a log house but rather put as it had only one room. The house burned down until they built another house with lots of gravel. In the little prairie creek nearby, it is still there.\n\n16. Where did you settle or take up homestead? By the river, his brother and three nephews had taken homesteads.

Since then I have worked on the farm until today.\n\n19. Any other comments?\n19. How often did you write to relatives or friends in your old home?\n   Quite often, possibly every two weeks.

My father went home to Ontario and brought out my sister and her\n    husband and three small daughters and settled them on a farm five miles distant.\n    My sister was not strong and he thought the change of climate would do her good.\n    She died in 1892.\n\n22. If other members of your family (brothers, sisters, parents, etc.) came West\n    tell when they came and where they settled.\n\n23. Is there any particular experience of pioneer days that stand out in your\n    memory which you would like to record? The birth of my five children is the\n    outstanding thing in my life.

When was the first car used in the community?\n   If you were to take a vote most people would say 1912.

What make?\n   My brother owned one in 1914 but there were many around by then.\n\n27. Where was your trading center? How far from your home?\n   When we were in first Moosomin was for a while then J.G. Turriff opened a general store along with the post office in 1884. Moosomin was 70 miles from our farm, Carlyle was twelve miles. My father was postmaster for Clare at\n\n28. Did you continue to trade there? (Indicate any changes due to new town appearing, better means of travel, etc.)\n   was opened shortly after the one at Carlyle for the western homesteaders. People mostly walked to our place on Saturday or Sunday for their mail. It was brought from Moosomin to Carlyle and then on up to our place once a week. The odd homesteader had a horse and buggy, some brought the heavy team and wagon. Of course the young men rode horseback a lot. Father kept this until a third post office was opened, Arcola. This was about six miles or half way between Carlyle and Clare. This was opened in Feb. 1889.\n\nThere was so little mail coming to the office then that my father would not bother with it and they moved it two miles east, where it could serve more people.\n\n29. How often did you shop in the early days?\n   Whenever the neighbors went to Carlyle we sent for food and father went possible once a month.\n\n30. When (if ever) did people in your district first start going to town regularly on Saturdays? The C.P.R. came in to our district in the fall of 1900 and we went there for supplies. It was not until after we had a car that everyone met in town on Saturday night.\n\n31. When (if ever) did you first begin to buy through the mail order catalogues? What kind of articles did you buy in this way? Indicate also what fraction of your total purchases were by mail order and any changes in the proportion of purchases made by mail order since the pioneer period.\n\nFather and mother used to send to the Hudson Bay Co. once a year for winter supplies. I was married quite a while before I heard of Eaton's. I remember about 1903 or 4 that we sent to Scotland for drygoods and ready made clothing and got good results. Lovely clothes for our children.\n\nNo we never sent huge orders to Eaton's as some people did. My husband had a sister who sent us clothing for the winter. She lived in Stratford Ontario and seemed to enjoy packing us warm things for the winter. When the railway came in we mostly bought supplies there in the town of Arcola.\n\n32. When did you first have a telephone and what company provided it?\n\n33. When you came to Saskatchewan the first time was it with the idea of staying permanently? Or did you make up your mind after trying it out? When did you make this decision?\n   We came to stay and never thought of returning to Ontario. So we all went back for visits a few years later as we got the money to travel.\n\nWe enjoyed the life and would not exchange it for another --- they are still the best days of my life, our pioneer ones.\n25. If you were to take a vote now people would say 1912 I don't think any one else exactly sure or who owned it is another none of contention for years.\n\n26.
