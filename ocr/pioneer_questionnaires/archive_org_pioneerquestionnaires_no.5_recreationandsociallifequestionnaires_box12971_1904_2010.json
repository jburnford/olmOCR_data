In the first few years, how many homes were near enough to you for visiting back and forth? About five within a radius of a few miles?\n2. How often did you usually visit neighbours? About half were bachelors.\n3. Did you usually visit our neighbours with visiting unless when necessary required?\n4. Did you usually visit on Sundays or other days? We met occasionally-and-often.\n5. Did you usually visit the family of a neighbour? Such told you all was well.\n\nInvitations: Most visiting was done voluntarily-you were always welcome.\n\nThat time of the day did you go in the morning and spend the day, or in the afternoon? When another became lonesome the oxen was hitched up, so two women might meet for a short time. On the road you might stop about meal? Did you stay when not invited beforehand? It would be strange by you were invited to come in and have something to eat. The writer of this, Willa Gaye, generally did not drop in at this time. What is the term to \"take policies\" used? Or was there some other expression? Never heard of an invitation to visit-your invitation was a standing invitation. The wife might say-she commenced a mealtime or dinner. \"Well, we haven't much to eat, but you are welcome to have a hot meal. This might be said, and it was plenty good.\n\nRemember Coffee never run short. Flower and coffee and some potatoes were generally kept in stock with family and bachelor alike.\n\nDid the whole family go, or did someone stay home to look after the places?\n\nIf family was young everyone went to visit their neighbours for a short visit\u2014even family people would get lonely.\n\nDid you ever have these when groups of neighbours came together to put up a building make quilts or other such activities? In a few instances where a family came unexpectedly on their homestead built in a single day and family sleep in it the same night?\n\nTell what you remember about such gatherings. You know dates if possible, telling what the theme were for, and how long they lasted.\n\nIn the early days when a family gathered to build a log-shack for a bachelor in an emergency I have seen it might take several days to complete the building that day (1906) men bring their own logs and chop to the ground? It has been done on a few occasions, good enough for the family to sleep comfortable in the same night.\n\nIn the earliest years that you were here, were there many parties, whilst drives or dances in homes? Describe. Dances mostly\u2014If a bash, homesteader completed a large sized shack, one evening word went round by telegraph, \"Get ready tonight, we are having a dance at this homestead.\"\n\nDon't let him know where coming. One Ox-team was generally gone to pick up 8 or 10 people, the Homesteader was generally gone to before so much the better. When all arrived music etc., loud cheer went up, the Homesteader knew something was up, The females often went up with babies, husbands, boyfriends, etc. The Homesteaders always had milk would soon be filled with yours babies\u2014the Homesteaders had our own music and seller of choice was plenty to dance was on the winter if we got home at 8 or 10 o'clock, thumbs-up line, did you follow any kind of informal schedule, such as going out once a month, etc? Dances was when we got the urge, and find a shack large enough. No one knew who or where the dance would be next time. This carried on after our school was set up\u2014These were real enjoyment no high-hatting, honest to Goodness people.\nNEIGHBOUR VISITING, PARTYING, ETC.\n\n1. In the first few years how many homes were nearby enough to you for visiting back and forth? About five within a radius of a few miles.\n\n2. How often did you usually visit neighbors? About half were bachelors.\n\n3. Did you usually visit on Sundays or other days? We met occasionally when necessary.\n\n4. Did you usually visit a neighbor's house without an invitation? Most visiting was done voluntarily\u2014you were invited.\n\n5. What time of the day did you get in the morning and spend the day, or in the afternoon? Usually we would meet for a short time. On the road you might have coffee and something to eat.\n\n6. Did you ever have guests when guests were generally expected? In a few instances where a family came unexpectedly at night, they would be invited to stay.\n\n7. In the early days what kind of entertainment did you have? The H. S. students played games and sang songs.\n8. Tell what use was made of the school house for community dances, box socials, and other activities. (Include also on the School Questionnaire.) Give dates.\n\nHow much of your social life was centered around the school, and within the school district? For example, if you lived in the country, did you continue to attend local school house for district gatherings, and did you come to town for other functions, or were you close enough to come to the school hall for all gatherings, etc.? Gatherings socially dangerous to make any Church when a travelling sky pilot came along. Strange to think that this time very few worshipped under the same roof\u2014deep water Baptist, Presbyterians, Anglicans, Methodists, R.C., Faith and others. We talked about their creed or dogmas. A young chap called Chip was sent as a student preacher or homesteader. Charles Luxemburg was ordained Minister. Afterwards a descendant of Charles Luxemburg preached for a time. Homesteaders had a college club, a little unruly, preached for a time. Dances, etc., were held in homes, school houses or halls. (As referred to in question 8, 9, and 10.) Did the entire family attend?\n\nWas there card playing for a prize? Not then (1905).\n\nWhat dances were popular? Square dance with caller off\u2014very popular.\n\nWaltzes, polkas, reels, some Nordic and German dances etc.\n\nWas there ever any disagreement between dancing and non-dancing residents in the planning of parties and social gatherings?

Some years later we seen these women come to most dances, but sat it out as wallflowers.\n\nWas card playing accepted by all residents in the community, or were there some who frowned upon it, either as an entertainment in the home, or for community gatherings? Explain. Until after the end of first World War card playing in public was out. Shortly around the twenties this became the fad in public entertainments. The game poker was popular in private from our earliest recollections in W. Canada. To many old country people this game was unknown.\nHow much of your social life was centered around the school, and within the school district?

Was card playing in public was out. Shortly after the end of the war card playing became the fad in public entertainments. The game \"Poker\" was popular in private from our earliest recollections in W. Canada.\n\n17. To many old country people this game was unknown.\n12. That attempt at formalities, of course, do not happen in small towns such as ours. We never heard of \"sneak\" in the early homesteading days.\n\nAfter our Church got going around (1913) the ladies visited occasionally.\n\nSpecies got very nifty once little old ladies of dress. At this time the T.B. Eaton Co. had a large window display and have it exchanged.\n\nA mat number now females were a new hat each Sabbath.\n\n13. I have the habit to dress up when I go out.

And kept repeating over and over \"Margo aristocracy etc.\"\nAfter a time as darkness began to fall, the woods around the little home became alive with women, girls and youngsters; so quiet a nice for the dreaded the brides tart tongue.\nEven the sedate and 'very' religious male and female of the town came. The stillness was broken with a mighty clash of tin lids, cow bells, and other noise makers; all started by the women present. We made a collection, and gave Billey back his $5.00 and the world was well with the bride again.\nThis was the largest crowd we ever seen since or before in second avenue.\nNote: on the shivaree of the aged couple\n\nThe bride was all excited Billey would give away all the wealth. And kept repeating over and over \"Margo aristocracy etc.\" After a time as darkness began to fall, the woods around the little home became alive with women, girls and youngsters; so quiet a nice for the dreaded the brides tart tongue. Even the sedate and 'very' religious male and female of the town came. The stillness was broken with a mighty clash of tin lids, cow bells, and other noise makers; all started by the women present. We made a collection, and gave Billey back his $5.00 and the world was well with the bride again. This was the largest crowd we ever seen since or before in second avenue.\n18. Name any other organizations that were in existence in your community before 1914, giving the name of each, date when it was first organized, its activities and purposes, who belonged (men, women, young people?), whether it included people only in one relatively small area (for example, within a school district), or was centred in the town or village and included the surrounding community. (There is space in the church questionnaire for organizations connected with the church, so they need not be included here).\n\nFirst organized club we remember at Margo (1905-6) a football team. Football was popular then. This early team became famous for a time\u2014playing the game fifty miles distant at other early points. In this team was a chap who played with a crack team in England; and no doubt, gave valuable pointers of the game.\n\nA few names of the players at random\u2014Taylor from Eng.; A. Drummond; Laurie; Charity; Virtue; McCrae; Fraser; etc. We searched for some records\u2014all dead. About 1908 hockey and base-ball became popular; football died over night.\n\n(1904) We saw our first Yorkton agricultural show and sport day; it was held 'over the tracks' south of town. Yorkton then\u2014while a town\u2014was little more than a village\u2014now a city. An interesting side show we noticed on the grounds \"The wild man from Borneo\" all dressed up to suit the occasion. An amusing incident took place\u2014with the wild man. He was chained in a cage eating raw beef. Along came a country kid six feet tall, raw boned; descendant from a Highland clan. Surveying the 'wild man' for a moment, jumped toward the cage and commenced tearing for the scrub while the spectators roared with laughter.\n\n19. What organizations hold their meetings?\n\nShouting all the time \"I could tear that wild man apart.\" The wild man tore for the little door on his cage, and running like the wind for the scrub while the spectators roared with laughter.\n\n20.

So far as we can remember youngsters played very little games in the early days\u2014either the ground was unsuitable, or no one taught them games of other lands.\n\nWhat games did girls play in summer (-skipping rope, play house, etc.)?\n18. Name any other organizations that were in existence in your community before 1910, giving the name of each, date when it was first organized, its activities, and purposes, who belonged (men, women, youth, people at large), whether it attracted isolated people only in one relatively small area (\"Cox's People\"), whether it drew a district-wide attendance, etc.\n\n19. In what way did the church questionnaires influence the organization of the community? (There is space in the church questionnaire for organizations.)\n\n20. What organizations do you remember? We remember Margo (1906-6) a football team. This early team became a favorite for a time. We remember a baseball team, organized club, we remember a hockey and base-ball became popular; a few names of the players of the game: Mr. Taylor, Mr. Moore, Mr. Fraser, etc., we searched for some information about 1908 hockey and base-ball became popular.\n\n21. What games did boys play in summer (skipping rope, play house, etc.)?\n\nCHILDREN'S GAMES\n\n21. What games did boys play in summer (jumping rope, ball, marbles, fly kites, etc.)? So far as we can remember youngsters played very little games in the early days\u2014either the ground was untenable, or no one taught them games of other lands.\n\nThat games did girls play in summer (skipping rope, play house, etc.)?\n22. What winter games were played outside - fox and hounds, skating, etc.?  \nWhat games were played indoors in winter - card games such as \"Happy Families\", \"Authors\" or others, checkers or other games?  \nCard games in early times were not popular with the early settlers.  \nDid the whole family join in such games, or only the children? Explain.\n\n23. Was there much time for games, or was everyone usually busy with some kind of work? Explain.\n\n24. Did children invent games connected with such things as buffalo bones, arrowheads, gophers or other objects or animals, or games in the snow? Describe.  \nNo.\n\nPICNICS AND SPORTS.\n\n25. What was the date of the first picnic that you attended in Saskatchewan?  \nGive year and month if possible. June, of 1904 in the district of \"Wallace\" some 20 miles N.E. Yorkton. This was an old settlement possibly settled 1880-5 with Scotch families MacDougall's; MacEachern's; Drysdale Livingston's; Pollock; MacLaren; Jones Etc., etc.\n\n26. Who organised it?\n\n27. Was it for the entire community, or for a smaller group, such as a school district, Sunday school, some organization, etc.?  \nWe believe these gatherings were growing into old age when we first met up with them (1904) At that time a small log-church stood near the sports ground.\n\n28. Was it the first picnic held in the community?  \nIf not, do you know the date of the first one that had been held? I do not.\n\n29. What were the amusements at the picnic you attended (ball games, races, band, etc.)?  \nChildren and old folk races; horse races etc.\n\n30. What arrangements were made for eating - was there a general lunch, or did families and friends form smaller groups? Most families brought lunch (plenty) Women went about the crowd serving their own or others-two large wash boilers with strong tea and coffee were free for the serving.\n\n31. What did you have to eat and drink? Plenty: Some of the 'new Canadians' there for their first time took note, which served them well in after years-the set up was so strange to them from their home-land.\n\n32. What time of the day did it start, and how long did it last? Noon till late evening-then a dance in the local school.\n21. Did children join in such games or only the children of nearby? Explain.\n\n22. What winter games were played outside? (Ex. Ball games, skating, etc.)\n\nWhat games were played indoors in winter\u2014card games such as \"Happy Families,\" \"Whist\" or others, checkers or other games?\n\nCard games in early times were not popular with the early settlers.\n\nDid the whole family join in such games, or only the children? Explain.\n\n23. Was there much time for games or was everyone usually busy with some kind of work? Explain.\n\n24. Did children invent games connected with such things as buffalo bones, arrowheads, gophers or other objects or animals, or fishes in the snow? Describe.\n\nPICTURES AND SPORTS.\n\n25. What was the date of the first picnic that you attended in Saskatchewan?\n\n26. Give your name and address at that time.\n\n27. What was the date of the first picnic that you attended in Saskatchewan?\n\n28. Give your name and address at that time.\n\n29. What were the amusements at the picnic you attended (ball games, races, band, etc.)?\n\nChildren and old folk races, horse races, etc.\n\n30.

What time of the day did it start, and how long did it last? Noon till late evening\u2014then a dance in the local school.\n33. Describe any features of this picnic which you remember as outstanding.\n\nWe saw our first bounce-busting contest; and thought it a cruel sport-and lover of horses all our life. Shortly we were in the saddle ourselves, shouting yippee-ia-ia, and enjoying the sport immensely\u2014when we didn't come down to pull grass.\n\n34. Describe any different kinds of picnics which you knew of in the early days, such as the large community picnic, school or Sunday School picnics, family picnics, etc. Tell about any differences in numbers attending, activities, food and drink, when held, etc.\n\nAt this time, picnics are not well organized sport for young and old. To my mind the 'annual show day' at the present is well organized graft. Money is extracted from every source, heavy gate money; the whole proceeds put in purses and presented to a semi-professional base-ball team, come from a far distance\u2014brought no following\u2014got free to the sports ground. Just came to bring back the profits. We play sports, while the unfortunate country and village don't even get a chance to run. Except a change in 'annual Sports' come shortly; they will die a natural death, and a thing of the past, Commercialized too far.\n\n35. What changes have you noticed in picnics since the first years? If possible, give dates when changes became noticeable. Between the two world wars a noticeable change took place. Big money was demanded for crack teams and the locals were not good enough to hold the money at home. This has been going on for a time, and day after the 'sports' we find no one telling you \"it was a glorious time.\" The youngsters and mothers are the sufferers. We find many people presently saying \"what's the use, you see nothing at the sports anymore.\"\n\n36. Describe the sports which were popular in your community in the early years, telling who took part in the various games and sports (men, women, mostly young people). The reader must not think that this and the forgetting in the ravings of a soured mild man\u2014Money were scarce in the early days, there were enough for the fat woman's race; the fat man; ladies big and little; especially the youngsters they all had a chance to win. In the words of the poet \"The mother saw her bairn respected like the laws\" team organized in your community to play against neighboring teams?\n\nWhat year? How long did it continue?\n\n37. Name any other sports teams that were organized before 1914, giving date of organization if possible, and tell something of their activities\u2014played against teams from neighboring towns, played at local sports days, entered in competitions in larger centres, etc.\n\n38. Tell when the first outdoor rink was built in your community, and what it was used for (hockey, curling, etc.). The first hockey rink at Margo (1908) a large slough on first ave. We have seen some exciting hockey matches played on it.\n\nWhen was the first indoor rink built, and what was it used for?\n\nFirst enclosed open rink (hockey) was constructed 1911. About 1916 it was enlarged and rebuilt. In the early days the water was hauled more than a mile to flood it.\n\n1940 The two sheet curling rink was built, with shingle roof. Both hockey and curling rinks are electric lighted.\n33.

This has been going on for a time, and day after the 'Sports' we find no one telling you 'it was a glorious time.' The youngsters and mothers are the sufferers. We find many people presently saying \"what's the use, you see nothing at the sports anymore.\"\n\n36. Describe the sports which were popular in your community in the early years, telling who took part in the various games and sports (men, women, mostly young people). The reader must not think that this and the foregoing in the ravelings of a soured gulf man\u2014Money were scarce in the early days, there were enough for the fat woman's race; the fat man; ladies big and little; especially the youngsters they all had a chance to win. In the words of the poet \"The mother saw her heir respected like the laws.\"\n\n37. Are there any sports teams organized in your community to play against neighboring teams?\n\nWhat year? How long did it continue?\n\n38.

Both hockey and curling rinks are electric lighted.\n40. When did an annual \"sports day\" become established in your community? 1906\n\nThe first big sports day started continued to the present.\n\nDid it grow out of or replace the earlier community picnic? Yes.\n\nWhat was responsible for starting the first sports day? At this time it is hard to state who was the lead horse. Records has gone with the windfield timers-the horse and his rider has left or gone to the happy hunting grounds. Usually held? (what month, or any special day, such as May 24th or July 1st). Dates varied-24th, May was a favourite date.\n\n41. Are there any from your community who have become members of well-known hockey, ball or other teams? Give names, and dates. None this writer know of.\n\nREADING\n\n42. What books did you bring with you when you came west? (Give a list of the names and authors if possible. If not, tell as nearly as you can how many you bought, and what kind.) (Use extra sheets if necessary)\n\nFamilies coming from the old land had so much other things to bring; Bedding; youngsters clothes; perhaps her wedding dress etc. They had little space for something could be done without.\n\nAs I remember the 'Big ha Bible with family records' A copy of the works of Robert Burns; and a few other little momentos would be all.\n\nOn this side after years the writer bot books till they exceeded 1500 volumes. At this writing (1953) I am sure less than half remain either borrowed and forgot to return; some distributed amongst the family-who, sometimes don't appreciate them.\n\n43. How many of your neighbors brought books with them? The average early settler no matter where they hailed from brought a few books with them.\n\nWhat kind of books and how many? The Bible in any language appear to have been the favourite.\n\n44. To what extent did you exchange books with neighbors? Personally: Too much.\n\n45. Did you buy many books after you came west? Give details. Histories: mostly. \"Fall of the Roman Empire\" history of France, Britain, Ireland, Scotland Canada from its earliest-and many others. Fictional history etc. Scott's works; R.L.Stevenson, Richard Harding Davis; others too numerous to set down--They were all precious to me.\n\n46. What books were sent to you as gifts in early years? Very few.\n\n47. Have you ever had any \"travelling library\" books in your community or school? Give details and dates. Yes. Some years back the Sask. Gov. sent out a travelling library(not interesting) to a crank reader. I believe it was discontinued a few years ago.\n\n48. Was there a school library? No. When was it begun?\n\nTo what extent were books borrowed from the school library for adults to read at home? We don't know.\n\n49. Did parents ever use their children's school text books as additional reading material? Very often. I venture to think many mothers knew what they contained than did her youngster.\n50. Has there ever been a community library in your district or town?\n   When was it started? Who started it?\n   Is it still in existence?\n   If not, when was it discontinued, and why?\n\n   Give any other details which you can about the library - how many books it contained, how many people used it, where it was kept, who acted as librarian, and what arrangements were made for borrowing books.\n\n   When the 'Pool Elevator' came into existence they attempted to form a library in Pool office. Myself and many others presented copies of good works; they either went out and never returned. Presently it is as dead as the dodo.\n\n51. What newspapers or magazines did you subscribe to when you first came to the west? Nor. West Farmer; and other farm papers. I subscribed to the Winnipeg Free Press on arrival in the West-I still get it at this time (The Daily).\n\n52. Describe later changes in your subscriptions, telling why you stopped certain subscriptions and added others. Newspaper subscribers like other things-they come and go.\n\n53. Did you ever obtain the free monthly Lady Aberdeen packages of reading material? No.\n   Give dates and tell how and where you got them.\n\n54.
