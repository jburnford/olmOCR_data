Watson Edward Collis\n\nWatson, Edward Collis\nWishart. 1903\nPIONEER EXPERIENCES: A GENERAL QUESTIONNAIRE\n\nA word of explanation to the person answering this questionnaire\n\nIt is difficult to prepare a general questionnaire to pioneer life because no individual who is asked to answer it has exactly the same experiences as another. Some of the questions here will not apply to your experiences; others may prove impossible for you to answer, so that sufficient space to answer the questions, don't hesitate to give details, or describe particular events, if they help to answer the questions.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1920, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experiences of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family answered the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or copy for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Board No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer Life What It Was Like\" is still being circulated. If you have not already answered this, and would be willing to do so, please put a check mark here (\u2014).\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Board No. 2, entitled \"Pioneer Life What It Was Like\" is still being circulated.

Some of the questions here will not apply to your own experience but may prove impossible or irrelevant to others. It is therefore suggested that you answer the questions most relevant to your own experience. Also, if there are any questions which you feel should be included in the questionnaire, please let us know.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1920. If more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires:\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer Life,\" was distributed to Western Canadian pioneers in 1947 and will be circulated again. If you have not already answered this, and would be willing to do so, please put a check mark beside it and we will be sent to you.\n\nSaskatchewan Archives questionnaires on other subjects will be prepared at a later date. Some of these are listed below. Please mark the ones you would be willing to answer.\n\nAll questionnaires:\n\n- Pioneer social life\n- Pioneer religious life\n- Pioneer sports and recreation\n- Pioneer housing\n- Pioneer education and churchwork\n- Pioneer farming experience\n\nPreservation of Questionnaires:\n\nOffice of the University of Saskatchewan Archives Board's Provincial Archives.
