This would enable me to find my way home. My neighbor agreed to come the next day and cut the grain.\n\nThe oats we kept for feed. Some of the wheat I traded for coal and some for flour. That fall I bought a team of oxen. They cost twenty dollars each and the harness was ten. I planned to use them that winter for hauling, etc., but a bachelor who lived a few miles away had more horses than he cared to feed for the winter, so he loaned me two of them, a pony and a large work horse. I was forced to juggle the bolts on the whittletree in order to throw more weight onto the heavy horse. After that all went along smoothly and I used the team all winter.\n\nWhen spring planting time came around I had only the team of oxen. They were old and unable to pull the drill. I decided to hitch one of the cows in with them. Thereby I was able to get the ground cultivated and spring planting finished.\n\nYou may think it rather strange that I used the cow as a draught animal. The answer is simple. She wouldn't let anyone milk her. I tried it once. In an instant I was sprawling in a ditch ten feet away, hat, milk bucket and milking stool landing on my head in regular order. That old cow would kick the stars out of the sky, I believe. I tried tying her feet when I milked her. She refused to give a drop. That's why she had to go to work.\n\nAlong about this time I received a gift of a team of young steers. I was able to use them by hitching them up with the old oxen. One of the steers was balky and would lie down when hitched to the plow, and he would refuse to budge. The only way I could get him up again was by switching him across the nose with a small twig.\n\nMy wife's brother brought in a shipment of wild horses from Montana. These were horses that had not been in harness before that time. He let me use a couple that harvest. I also bought a good farm horse in the fall.\n\nAs time went on and I had more land under cultivation, I was able to buy more domestic animals, and in a few years had my farm well stocked.\n\nPESTS AND ANNOYANCES\n\nIn the early days on the homestead we were compelled to share our meager grain crops with various and sundry pests, for instance, little animals and wild fowl.\n\nThe cranes constantly ate the tops off the grain stocks in the fall. Sometimes the workers would hide behind the stocks and shoot a bird or two.\nMy neighbor lived ten miles away. There were no roads nor fences, nor telephone poles to guide us, only bleak prairies. In view of this fact, I cut an arm full of willows and drove one into the ground every half mile. This would enable me to find my way home.
