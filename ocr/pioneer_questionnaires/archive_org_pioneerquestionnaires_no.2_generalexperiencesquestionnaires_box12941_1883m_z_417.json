He dropped the pail and rope in and I had nothing but the box on top of the well to hold on to. I held on with my two hands and kicked but I could not find that circle. Then I let go of one hand, my toe touched the circle and I had courage enough to let go with both hands and I felt I was getting from somewhere and I landed on that circle and turned my face around with my face to the water where my baby was floating. The water was up to my knees as the circle was below water. I held him with his little head down and worked his arms, calling for help. When help came from the far field, I handed up my baby which went in a little lump pile on the grass, then my husband lifted me at 3 P.M and it was 6 P.M when he breathed. He went to the war in 1914-1918. Came home safely and married Miss Constance Dryden Legore, men with me and raised 4 fine teacher Allan that was boarding with me and raised 4 fine boys. They are all farming here in the Roconville District. Their names are as follows at this date May 3/52.\n\n(Jack) John Reavie\nWilford Colin Reavie\nDonald Reavie\nBrian Reavie\nOne experience I remember distinctly was when my youngest son aged 2 & \u00bd years fell into a 14 foot well and the only circle was in the centre.
