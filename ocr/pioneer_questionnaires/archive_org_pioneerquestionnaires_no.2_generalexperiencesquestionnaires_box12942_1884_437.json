We are pleased to have this to add to the others filed for permanent preservation in the Archives. Under separate cover you will receive copies of the other Questionnaires which you indicated that you would be willing to answer, as well as the three new ones which have recently been prepared. It is in no respect only those who came to the province after 1905 that we are interested in hearing from, but on the contrary are very anxious to receive answers from those who settled the area in the days preceding Provincial establishment. It is the sum total of the experiences of individuals which give the picture of prairie settlement and development.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEvelyn Eager\nAssistant Archivist\n\nEE/ed\nAugust 5, 1955.\n\nMr. Hugh Horison,\n1123 Third Avenue N.W.,\nMoone Jav, Gaith.\n\nDear Mr. Horison:\n\nThank you for the copy of pioneer Questionnaire No. 2 which you exemplified and returned to us recently.

Some of the questions have been added to your experiences; others may prove impossible for you to answer so it is very about leaving blank spaces. Use estimates of time if they are not sufficient space to answer the question. Don't hesitate to give details, or describe particular events. If they help to answer the questions.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1974, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family own answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nSaskatchewan Archives questionnaires which have been prepared or projected are listed below. Please mark the ones you would.\n\n- All questionnaires\n- Pioneer diet\n- Pioneer schools\n- Pioneer churches and social life\n- Pioneer residence experiences\n- Pioneer health and housing\n\nPreservation of Questionnaires\n\nAll questionnaires will be preserved in the Office of the Saskatchewan Archives at the University of Saskatchewan as part of the permanent record of our Province.

What reasons did they have for moving?\n\nThere was a tide of settlement to our area in the early 1800s when the railway reached Moose Jaw. In 1892, our very large population of these early homesteaders left their lands in 1866, a dry year. All this, of course, goes toward promoting the growth of the province, a story of its own.\n\n35. Did many people move away during the 1950s? Did many return?\n\nAs you are probably aware, about 100,000 people moved away from our province during the Thirties, called the \"Great Migration,\" to the United States, Canada, and other parts of the world.\n\n36. If you or some member of your family have held public office, or have been active in any organizations, mention it here, giving dates whenever possible.\n\nBy far the most important position I have ever held was that of mayor of Moose Jaw.

Give facts of the school district of Moose Jaw No. 1 in the Province of Saskatchewan, and the extent of the land in the name Moose Jaw. There are many versions of the origin of the name Moose Jaw. It is still used originally to the Creek, or river if you wish.\nHUGH RORISON\n\nMOOSE JAW, SASK.\n\nMr. David Watson, Post Office, I believe, Tuxford, Sask., has a fund of information re early farm associations, agricultural societies, grain grocers' associations, etc., apply more particularly to Moose Jaw and district.\n\nForbes McKenzie, Belheek, Sask., information re farm and farming activities.\n\nBen Thompson, 1068 Second Ave. N.W., Moose Jaw.\n\nMrs. J.J.
