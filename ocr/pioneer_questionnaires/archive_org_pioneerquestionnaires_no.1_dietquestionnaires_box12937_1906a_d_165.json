The club asked but I got my father-in-law who is 87 years old to fill it in but he couldn't remember much about prices & dates for food. He came to Ponoka first in 1906, it was well settled by then & he was close to town. Then he bought a farm about 10 miles from Kinaston in 1912. It had a house & well - the wells are flowing wells in that district, I can't get good water from shallow wells although they used water from a spring a few years.\n\nHope it will help you some.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMrs Russell Adams\nI am sorry this report isn't very full.
