Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\nIt was a pleasure even with all the hardships to prepare meals in the early days. Things are too hard made for the housewife today\u2014and they do not seem to have any more time than we had to relax and enjoy a social life. The people of old days did have a chance, I call it \"Happiness.\" Sometimes not knowing what they are hurrying or where they are going, the housewife of today hurries too much with the meals\u2014a food in stores to buy\u2014put up instead of ready to use\u2014therefore, plenty of work to do.\n\n21.

(Give as many details and dates as possible).\n\nIn the late 20's and early 30's I began to rely on purchased and prepared foods. In the beginning, I offered outside the housewife to buy. For instance, the premium on breakfast foods would be a pretty high\u2014and who would at fall for me? So the old fashioned healthy oat meal lasted a long time. I am right now reminded of the old Dutch proverb: \"When fools go to market, peddlers make money.\"\n\n22.

Even though we haven't seen each other in years, I still feel connected to you.\n\nThank you for being such an inspiration to me.
