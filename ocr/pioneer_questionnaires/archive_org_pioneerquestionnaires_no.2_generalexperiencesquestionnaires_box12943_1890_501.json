Some will like questions better than others; some may apply to your experience; others may prove too difficult or too easy. So don't worry about leaving blank spaces. Use your imagination to give details, or describe particular events, if they help to answer the questions.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1947, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nWestern Saskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer Fiat: What 3rd Western Canadian, more than 50 years old, would be willing to do so please put a check mark here ( ) and one will be sent to you.\n\nSaskatchewan Archives questionnaires on other subjects will be prepared at a later date.
