I would be 8 years old then. It was my first time or only morning and someone held me up to show them land they had seen going \"Far away.\" To whom? Friends and Uncle John even when families were living for some place else.\n\n\"Why were they going?\" Several years earlier neighbors the Smiths had gone away and went to Nebraska and homesteaded there. When they came back to Nebraska for a visit mutually the whole community was friendly interested until they heard of and met my parents of the \"free\" farmland and cheap homesteaded duties. The land doctoring made them rich in the West. He usually met what money raised and many they could own the country land holding they had in Nebraska and went to Nebraska.\n\nThe name \"Manitoba\" was still used for many years when referring to what is now the other three Western provinces. I don't know how far North they used to go. (I have many old letters here from 1889 and later) although so many difficult feet appear but\n1. Early reminiscences of my two Uncle's coming home from Canada. I was about 8 years old then. If was mighty late in July when they came home. They were going \"far away\" to where Grandpa and Uncle John were.\n\nThey had fond memories of those \"innocent\" times when families were living for some place else.\n\n\"Why were they going?\" Several years earlier neighbors the Mylers had gone away and tried to become free homesteaders. When they came back to Orleans for a visit mutually the whole community very greatly interested with them. There was much talk and discussion for prize and during homestead duties. The land was taken up and given away. It usually was what many raised and many who could not afford to pay for land building they built outbuildings and went to Illinois to the same time. They came back to Illinois and went to Western Kansas. I think they knew how far from Mexico they would go. (I have no idea where they came from in 1889 and they returned to many different post offices.)\nthey usually arrived.\n\nThe above should answer the question of why I came out west late. James McKee was my grandfather and he came out to Morden. Then he met my grandmother's cousins on his way out (the Hutchinsons). He had also visited at Winnipeg to the Bandos who had the hotel there. They were also our neighbours. Mr. Band wanted girls to help in the hotel so his visit had later results. Two of his daughters did come out to Morden and later to Wpg., where one of them met and married a young man from Berlin Oul who was working on a store. However, Grandpa proceeded further on and finally hired out to a farmer in Man for the crop season. This earning enough to buy his first team of oxen and wagon. He and the other young men who came from out with him then drove out to meet where Forget Lake now is and selected their homestead; then returned by way of Old Coulee Carlyle to fall on their land and also for an older Uncle who was to come out too. They spent the winter working on farms in Man and next spring when the grass was high enough to graze oxen on Grandpa\nThey usually arrived.\n\nThe above should answer the question of why I came out West. James P. Lee was my benefactor and friend. He was the owner of the Hotel where they were all staying when the Board arrived. They were all very kind to me. The Board arrived and took the hotel there. They came from Berlin and were working in Alaska. However, they were planning for the next season. They came through to bring the food down from the mountains. He and the other young men who came from New York will then drive over to meet them. They will be very glad to see them. They returned by way of California to go on their land and also for an old friend who was to come out too. They started to work in Montana and met up with the same old friends in Europe.\ndrove out to the homestead. The other man came later and after they had done some breaking they put up two log buildings very small (the space between was used for grainary later by closing it in) One end the men used for house - the other end was for the oxen. Thus they wintered doing their own cooking and taking bread (Grandpa finally got to be the best bread maker around, they said.) It apparently meant all sunshine homesteading with oxen. If the flies bothered they just worked out in the sloughs, snow and all and many times no persuasion could get them out. A post office was established about 7 miles from their place. The mail came from Woronoco. The old letters show postmarks of Demington, Percy, Carlyle and Coban all on the same envelope. Apparently all the mail was sorted out at each stop and post marked there then sent on to the next etc. But the mail did arrive! Does this get too detailed? Well that was how homesteading was without the women to do women's work the men who came alone had to concern from the field work and get their own meals and all.\nand after they had done some building they put up their big building very small (the place between the road and the river) by buying land. One day the man said his name - the other end was for the town.\n\nThey bought property, buying their own cooking and taking care of the house. They bought the best materials they could find (because family got to be the best they could).\n\nThe next day they moved into their new home. They moved all the things from the old house to the new one. They moved all the furniture and everything else.\n\nWhen this fell into place? Well that was how the town started. It was nothing but women who worked hard to make the town grow. The men who came alone had to come to pay the rent work and get their own meals and work.\nTo make a long story short, Uncle John did come out finally in 1891 and he also worked in Manitoba to get money to carry on with. Money was just one thing there wasn't very much to be had in those days. Also they had crop failures through hail and frost and long hauls to nearest point of shipment and low prices. No wonder it took so long to get enough to bring a family of 10 out. The older ones had got married, my mother being one of them. In 1895, the two Uncles mentioned in the opening up the pioneer story came out West and they too worked for older settlers farther North so they could get horses and equipment. They really didn't suffer from idleness. With sons now to help Grandpa they put up a good sized log house with cellar and upstairs, quite comfortable, but still the money was scarce as ever, but gradually they exchanged oxen for horses and gathered around them cattle, pigs, fowl and garden and by 1896 had sent for 3 more of the family to come out including Grandma. It was a day of great rejoicing to have 7 of them now\nTo make a long story short, Mr. John Doolittle came to our family in 1891 and he was working in Middletown selling money to carry on work. Money was hard to find and work was scarce.\n\nIn those days they had to work for their living. They had to work for their living. They had to work for their living. They had to work for their living.\n\nThey worked hard and saved money and paid prices. As soon as they got enough to buy a house they bought a house. In 1895 they bought a house.\n\nThey moved into the opening of the pioneer story. They moved into the opening of the pioneer story. They moved into the opening of the pioneer story.\n\nThey needed a new house. They built a new house. They needed a new house. They built a new house. They needed a new house.

They exchanged cars for horses and gathered around the car.\n\nThey gathered around the car every day. They gathered around the car every day. They gathered around the car every day.\n\nFor three more years the family lived in the old building. For three more years the family lived in the old building. For three more years the family lived in the old building.\n\nWhen a day of great rejoicing came for them all...\naround the family table, with plenty of salt and sugar and able to add to the farm buildings as needed to care for the stock as well. From what I have been told and from letters and a small diary of one of my aunts (the one who bought the feather ticks & pillows on the train for comfort) I have pieced together the life that was lived on this particular homestead in Area 405.\n\nIt would take books not a few pages to enumerate all the change that \"homesteading\" made in the lives of the people. I still recall how \"hardfaced\" my mother was at the household talk of animal life as the lives of animals were so closely related to the life of the individual concerned. It was life as there were no large bank accounts to provide for the needs of a household. It was the surrounding animal life that provided the table with food. Gardening wasn't too successful at first but gradually people learned to dry everything and found most vegetables would grow out here. The gardens even grew rhubarb, currants, corn and most things usually found in gardens. Roots were common and disappointments many.\naround the family well, well things are\nand near and all will be well to the farm building\nwe needed to move in the store as well. From old\nI knew then well and from Ellen and a small diary of\nmy aunt (the one who lived at the French Creek settlement\nin the town of Amboy) I have found together all the\nwere stored in the French Creek settlement on June 8th,\n& small lake birds and a few pages & numerous\nall the changes that \"homesteading\" made on the lives\nof the people. I still recall how thankful my mother\nwas at the household talk of normal life on the\nlives of animals were so closely related to the life\nof the individual concerned. If we had life, so there\nwere no large bank accounts to provide for the\nneeds of a household. If we had the surrounding animals\nlife that provided the table with food. Feeding\nwould be successful at first but gradually people turned\nto buy everything and found myself to this world of\nout here. The garden was plentiful, currant, corn\nand rhubarb were all found in gardens. But\nthere was something to many.\nSo this family gradually added to their comfort, and other settlers came. The early homesteaders were much like a large family. Each shared the others joys and sorrows. Doctors were far away; Carlyle was the nearest to them in Mormon. The day of the \"pack peddler\" had become \"the peddler with a democrat or buggy with teams or one horse bringing the things that would usually be bought in a store.\" But I wouldn't think these even came around much before 1875.\n\nI may be wrong. There usually wasn't enough money before about then, for people to buy much they could do without. It surprising what can be a luxury when you only have two hands and no money.\n\nThe animals there, can provide a fairly good way of life by making it possible to grow grain and garden. The pig becomes pork in the barrel, the cow becomes milk, butter, cream, roba, beef tallow becomes lard when melted with a rag stick in it and lighted, to say nothing of the corned beef from cattle and hocks and roots and stems etc., The poultry also became eggs & meat. These are the things I saw as a child.\nThe family gradually settled in their comfort,\nand other settlers came. In early times they moved\nlike a large family. Food shared the other way\nsometimes. Doctor was far away. Couples were\nmarried to them in Pennsylvania. The day of the \"penned\" wedding\nhad become \"the wedding\" well in advance or happy\nwith friends and family. They were called \"the\nnuptial\" marriage. A couple was a story. But I wouldn't\nthink there even came around much before 1895\nI may be wrong. The usually amount enough money\nto buy what they needed. If anything\ndo without. If everything\nwhen you only have five hands and no money.\n\nThe animals then, can provide a fairly good way of life\nby making it possible to grow grain and garden.\nThis way becomes hard work, but it's easy to become\nmilk, butter, cream, eggs, beef, poultry become light,\nwhen mixed with a mop stick in it and kept it\nany nothing?

They just wanted any money left after they paid for seed, house, wagons, machinery to put in crops, and all things necessary. Their nearest town was thirty miles away, and it was about twenty-five years ago when they had crops fail several years and it was all they could do to save and for trying to get a crop the next year. I also remember a neighbor of Grandpa's who came back to Indiana because he knew people and he came back to my folks to tell us of Grandpa and Uncle John and how they helped him out there from the very beginning. The situation didn't bother them, and they had plenty of work and were looking for a way to help him out.\n\nIt began to look as if Grandpa wasn't going to have his family all together at least for a while. Lonely still, and Uncle John and Uncle Jim worked very hard, seven years of hard work, and lonely times. He was worried about how he needed all of them to help him make a good home. Finally, he had two big teams big enough and cellar big enough to hold lots of potatoes.\nThat day went by very quickly though, and I was eager to get back home. I had made it easier for them to get along with their work after my other two weeks had gone out too.\n\nIt began to look as if Grandpa was going to have his family all together at last after lonely stuff and Uncle Johnny and John worked away at least 7 years of hard work and lonely time. He wrote so much of how he needed all of them to help him make a good home. Finally he had his top house big enough and cellar big enough to hold lots of potatoes, had gardens ready, cows, pigs, hens and horses. He had sold his oxen. Often I have heard them talk how happy they were together and everything going so well after Grandma, Uncle Arthur & Aunt Anna were there in July 1898.\n\nTill Grandpa died a cyclone blew the roof off the house and he was standing holding his pony at the door and the roof fell on him.\n\nIt made a very sad home and my Grandmother and Uncle then wanted my folks and my other aunt and Uncle to come over. Then remember all the letters coming as I had started to school by that time.\n\nMy Dad and Uncle decided to go out there fast and see if it looked like a good place to take young\nI have been very busy lately, working hard to earn money for my family. We now live in Idaho City, and I am grateful for this opportunity.\n\nIt's hard to think about the future, but I am determined to provide for my loved ones. I have a good job, and I am thankful for the support of my family.\n\nThe house we rent is small, but it is comfortable and cozy. My children love playing outside, and I try to make sure they have enough space to run around.\n\nMy husband works long hours, but he always makes time for us. He is a hard worker, and I admire his dedication.\n\nWe are planning to move soon, and I am excited to see what the future holds. I am grateful for the support of my family and friends, and I am confident that we will be able to overcome any challenges that come our way.\nThere were only four of us, including my mother and father, who were going to settle in the country. They thought there would be a good chance to build up homes and other settlers were going there too, so they sent for us.\n\nAt last came the day when the packing was all done, my little dog was given to a neighbour to keep and the little girl, James' wife, and the family wrote me and said they were going to go by train and my two brothers who were attending school.\n\nWe went to stay with friends who were going to drive us to take the train. I remember the fun we had that night. After we were sent upstairs to bed there was many a shout of \"Quiet up there!\" Then their Daddies shout extra loud \"If I come up there etc etc.\"\n\nFinally sleep came and so did early morning long before the sun was up. We were dressed extra warmly and seemed to be taking so many clothes with us. The Surrey with the fringe on top with a high stepping team of roan horses (fours) was brought to the door. We said good-bye to all and soon were on our way. The horses with their fine shoes on their feet made such music on the hard road. I never forgot that early drive.\nGrant McKee\nPlaying on 1961\nGrey Cup game Toronto\n14-14 - Playing overtime\n21-14 - Hamilton win\nWPG - Winners!\nUnprecedented game\nTwo overtime\nA Great Block\n\nPlaying on the Town\n\nGiving up playing at\n\n14-14 - 14\n\nUnpretentious\n\nWaltz\nThis was in November 1878 so weather was cold... I don't remember anything about getting on the train that morning but do remember seeing and eating my first bananas on the train while on our way out. We had to change trains several times and we were afraid we would get lost in the crowds and there were children like us everywhere trying to keep with their parents too. We even rode in one of those old coaches with the slat seats, all wood, no upholstery just plain hard. My aunt had insisted on bringing her feather bed, pillows, and some blankets so we would be comfortable on the train. (A good thing she did too as far as I can remember. Then these early settlers must have tried everything at least once.)\n\nI think we were about two weeks coming as we stopped at Winnipeg and stayed 2 or 3 days while for work. Finally we got to Wamato which was about 50 miles from the homestead. My Uncle and Dad met us with teams and wagons with plenty of poles, horse blankets etc and hay in bottom wagons. We got part way out of course had to stop at the half way house.\nNovember 1878\n\nWe were in [illegible] and everything was cold.\n\nWhen they arrived, they did not announce their coming.\n\nAnd eating my first dinner, we became settled in our new home.\n\nWe had always been used to living on the grounds and there were children like us everywhere. Trying to keep with them proved hard. We came back to our old routine.\n\nWe walked with the old men, although no explanation just plain hard. My heart was filled with longing for freedom, but I knew it would be comfortable and soon finished, so we would be free.\n\nOn the train (a frightening ride that we all knew) I was reminded. Given these early memories, I could have heard everything I heard once.\n\nI thought she was lonely, but she was not. She was happy and loved by everyone.\n\nAbout 50 miles from the homestead, we met a man who was very friendly and willing to help anyone.\n\nThey say brothers are supposed to help each other.\nThere was no carpet in the house. We were the last to have carpet in our house. We stayed there for over two years. At first we stayed at Grandma's until they had a sod shack built for us. It had three rooms in it - not very big either but nice and warm. It had a floor in it and windows too, so was really a very good shack. I don't think the rain came through the roof much either as it did in many such homes ago. I imagine they had used lumber and tar paper instead of logs under the roof and the bunkers were built in the one bedroom for the children.\n\nSo many things were new and different for us. Even at Grandma's where we stayed first they had a big deep cellar with large swing shelves built for holding the pans of milk and any food they wanted to keep cool in the summer. (There were no fridges then there.) Every morning after the milk was strained into the clean pans, part of the pans of milk from earlier milkings were skimmed of the cream into large crocks to be churned later in the dark churn. The skimmed milk was used to feed cats, chickens...\nWe played there for over two years, and then we moved.\n\nIt had three bedrooms and not very big either but nice and warm. It had a floor to ceiling windows, so it let in lots of sunlight even though it was cloudy.\n\nThere was really a very good church. Didn't think the rain came through the roof much either so all did stay in many weeks down on Maggie's clay.\n\nAnd next door and then further instead of stop under the roof, a house was built on the hill.\n\nSo many things were new and different for me, but I found myself fairly well adjusted to life there.\n\nThey had a big deep cellar with large storage shelves built for holding the family milk and any food they wanted to keep cool in the summer. There were no fridges then, though. Every morning the milk was churned into the cream pails, half of the cream milk from earlier milkings was skimmed off the cream and kept separate to be churned later in the dark churn.\n\nThe abandoned milk was used to feed the chickens.\nmake puddings; cottage cheese and feed dogs etc. Any extra would be put in the swill barrel where the pig feed was. Crushed grain was added to the milk, buttermilk etc. in the barrel until it was almost like a porridge. The pigs certainly liked it. They were fed some green food too.\n\nIn those days people had to do for themselves everything they could. Some were more expert than others in certain jobs so it didn't take long before one farmer would be sharpening plow shares, and shoeing horses. Another was handy with the saw and hammer and soon found people wanting his help. So it went and in this way gradually the settlers got settled. The early settlers always helped the new ones coming in. Dad was a carpenter and was kept quite busy. We kids enjoyed our time in the country although we didn't have all our time free. We had to do our school work every day and of course our Sunday School lessons as well. We had to make our own fun in our spare time. We pretended we were farmers.\nmake packings; cottages (where we fed dogs etc.)\n\nTiny extra would be fed half in the small barrel where the pig feed was.

We pretended we were farming\nweaving gopher and badger knolls for our farms also the road from the barn to the well we plowed with big spoons. When the teams of horses passed over it on the way to the well we said a storm had destroyed our crops and we had to do it all over again. There was buffalo willow there and we pretended it was a forest and hunted in it.\n\nWe pounded up rock on the huge big rocks where the buffalo had rubbed and hollowed it out of also hunted for birds nests on the prairie. We pretended the cracked rock was ammunition. Dad's Mother made games for us at home.\n\nOn the back of the table cloth was the parchesi game all drawn out carefully by Dad, who also made a wooden dice and with mother's empty yeast cake box for a shaker we were all ready to play. They also made a checker board and checkers, and a card game of numbers in books of 4 each\u20144-120, 4-75, etc and 4-38.\n\nThey were all mixed up and to play each had a few to start with called the number wanted all at once to see who could complete their sets quickest first. It was everything but quiet, but guess it did allow us to use our\nalso the road from the barn to the well we plowed with my spade. When the teams I knew passed over it on the way to the well we said a prayer that they would not get stuck in it all over again. There was a big field behind it.\n\nAnd we pretended it was a forest and hunted in it.\n\nWe pounded up root on the things they work where the fields had rubbed and hollowed it out of the prairie. We pretended the cracked root was ammunition. Daddy worked on games for us at home.\n\nOn the back of the table we'd use the parchesi games all drawn carefully by Dad, who also made a wooden dice and with mother empty pancake tin for a checker we were all ready to play. They also made a checker board and checker, and a card game of numbers on cards. Each had a few to start with called the number twenty all at once.\n\nThey were all mixed up and to play each had a few hours who could complete them with broken food. If we ever everything tried special, but guess if they allow us to use our\nvoices in freedom from idonti. Referring to card game, so many things are not remembered from those early times.\n\n1. The never ending stream of men looking for land. They usually tried every rigs and a man who could show them land, not yet filed on, for homesteading. There were usually always some every week in the summer and fall of the early years. Some homestead seekers at Grandmas, also saw some while all my aunts taking outfits by far from home.\n\n2. The N.W.M.P. in their red tunics or in oldish breeches with blue or tan buffalo coats and fur caps, patrolling the country to see that the settlers were alright and overseeing the prairie fire dangers ever present, and always a friend of the law abiding settler, and also to the Indians.\n\n3. The Peddlers. Men travelling by cart or democrat with boxes or cases of goods of all kinds for sale. Variety was what they had and various types of people went about each year until the coming of the railroads and towns as they were called. Some sold just tea, others stoves, dry goods etc. Many automobiles became peddlers, many became our first store keepers etc + stages in our early lives.\n\n4. The long lines of teams passing my Grandmothers house on the old Freepath from Alameda.\n\nOn the way to Alameda, the men liked to go in groups for company. It was a long slow trip there with loads of grain, and home again with groceries, making very sure nothing was forgotten. Even then it often happened, then as now, that merchants were sometimes just out of certain goods so the settler was also just without until next trip. (Unless a neighbour had it)\nworks on freedom from \"slavery.\" Confusing to card grain.\n\n1. The men working on farms 8 men looking for land.\n\nThey usually travel every trip until a man who could show them land not yet filled on for farming. They came in the early spring.\n\n2. The N.W.M.P. in their red uniforms on an endless trail.\n\n3. The settlers work hard and pay crops, particularly the best land. They knew the settlers were always and overworking the land.\n\n4. Few danger ever present, and always a friend of the settler.\n\n5. Men travelling by rail or democratic with horses or oxen. They had all kinds for sale. Variety was what they had and various types of people went abroad each year until the coming of the railroads and towns as they were called. Some sold fruit trees, others also.\n\n6. The long time of times passing my grandmother's home.\n\n7. On the way to Altamont, the men tried to go on prompt for company. It was a long slow trip, then with lots of grain and home again with groceries, making very few nothing was forgotten. Even then it plan happened.\n\nThen on now, what mischief were sometimes found out of certain goods. So the settlers were also good without much next trip. (Writing a magazine but it)\n5. Dried fruit (evaporated fruit) available.\n   Apples, prunes, apricots, pears, nectarines, raisins, currants.\n\n6. Apples were bought by the barrel shipped out from Ontario. Cheese also to be had. (These could be bought at Blumberg if you had money.) Farmers had their own meat, butter, eggs, milk and potatoes and any other vegetables they could grow as soon as they got some breaking done and garden spot ready. (If it didn't freeze or dry out.)\n\n7. Substitutes - when original not available but blizzards, etc., were coming.\n\n8. Wild turkey, geese and ducks, prairie chicken, rabbits available to those who wanted to go hunting for them.\n\n9. The long looked for railroad did not come through so our young ladies were being shipped in the far west until 1900. Then we moved to Aricola as we would be near school. At first we had to go to an old school that had been used by the early settlers near Aricola (it was only a mile from the new townsite and was still being used). They had come about 1883.\n\nThe Indians used to come down from the Reserve and camped along the road to the school but we had been used to Indians passing by Grandmas on their way to the States to visit their relatives.

No, the trip moved at such a bind, by the\n\nwere couldn't go to school. I imagine they didn't suffer too much\n\nwhat they thought as there was a nice little crowd nearby and\n\nwill all the activity? A new house coming into existence is divided\n\nwhy were loved. From remarks the former clearly tells on the\n\nwould fail and the overall old rock after twelve & keep the\n\ndown early from spreading over everything. The weekly rounds\n\nshe was on palm aged pumas (At all time it was claimed\n\nthat needs to spread the charcoal). Mother was a thing Norman\n\nbut I made a good recovery in the next year or so Dad\n\nbuilt a larger house which of the P. H. Palmer. In an old\n\nthere we lived until about 1986. We lived there during the\n\nbig yard really the town run out of coal, the woods were\n\nstocked and finally with 5 engines and nothing more.\n\nWhen a team got us from Mt. East (Sarasota). Then\u2014\n\nThe yard we had plants under there with small trees on\n\nsafe could\u2014now down the street, but all those things\n\nPoveshall away and the little town grew. (Then what)\n\nWe often heard a buzzinging (clamorous) school bell\n\ntake no note to themselves. So third. Finally Dad decided to\n\ntake up a homestead on school was very lonely\n\ncommunicators (Red) had helped build several of them so\n\nwe moved out to the homestead where we were about\n\n3\u00bd miles from school. Dad brought a little shop in whom\nand we had no sooner got nearly settled this world I\ngot badly fever in three days. Doctor knew was in\nlight fever for a few days. I was weak and cold and\nvery weak. Bed clothes had a good young lady, Miss\nMrs. Smith on 16 Street from City Hall. We were quarantined\nfor over six weeks. They say they didn't suffer too much,\nbut they thought so there was a nice little social meeting and\nwill all be together. I imagine they didn't suffer too much.\nThey were closed. From November to June, daily talks on the\nworld and the overall oil such refinements & deep. The\nadmirers of the town especially our very fine. The evening\nalso on palm night games (Halloween) at our school.\nThat needs approval the closure). Miles were a very warm\nbut made a good recovery. In the next year or so Dad\nbuilt a larger house which is the Pabst home. For an end\nthen we lived until about 1918. We lived then during the\nbig depression when the town was not so good, the weather\nbecame and finally with 5 engines and nothing more.\nNow a train goes from the East (Avenue). This -\nThe spring we had plants under these with small trees in\nsafe could - now down in the streets. Say all those things my\nfather away and the little town grew. Finally Dad decided to\ntake us back to Milwaukee. We tried. Finally Dad decided to\ntake us a formalized or school was being taught by many\ncommunities (Red) had helped fairly several of them so\nwe moved out to the homeland where we were about\n3\u00bd miles from school. Dad brought a little thing.\nand we had no sooner got newly settled than word I got scarlet fever. In those days scarlet fever was no light fever for a few days. I was weak as a cat and discovery sick. But there was a good young doctor, Dr. Wilson, who called in Dr. Hardy from Calico Mule. We were quarantined for over six weeks. Dad & the boys moved out into a tent, but the boys couldn't go to school. I imagine they didn't suffer too much about that though as there was a nice little creek nearby and with all the activity of a new town coming into existence I don't think they were bored. I can remember the twice daily baths in the wash tub and the overall oil rub afterwards to keep the skin scales from spreading over everything. The scaling would also be seen on palm aged pieces (at that time it was believed that scales spread the disease). Mother was a busy woman, but I made a good recovery. In the next year or so Dad built a larger house south of the R.R. station for us and there we lived until about 1986. We lived there during the big blizzard when the town ran out of coal, the roads were blocked and finally with 5 engines and rotary snow plow a train got us from the East (source). Then in the spring we had floods when those with small boats or rafts could row down the streets, but all those things passed away and the little town grew. We often heard a barking dog (Democrat) and Dad would take us out to Grandmas to visit. Finally Dad decided to take up a homestead as schools were being built in many communities (Dad had helped build several of them) so we moved out to the homestead where we were about 3\u00bd miles from school. Dad bought a little house.\nand we had not come for much better than what I\ngot today. We are in a good place now and we\nare well off. We have moved out of the city, to the\nnew town and the overall oil well operation is going\nwell. The weather has been very good and\nthe crops are doing well. We are very happy\nwith our new home and we are looking forward\nto many more years of prosperity.\n\nWe often travel to the city to visit family and\nfriends. We also enjoy going to the movies and\ntheater. We have a wonderful community and\nwe feel very lucky to be part of it.\nand we had no sooner got newly settled there until I got scarlet fever. In those days scarlet fever was no light fever for a few days. I was weak as a cat and very sick. But Mother had a good young doctor, Dr. Wickersham who called in Dr. Hardy from Castle Rock. We were quarantined for over six weeks. Dad & the boys moved out into a tent, but the boys couldn't go to school. I imagine they didn't suffer too much about that though as there was a nice little creek nearby and with all the activity of a new town coming into existence I don't think they were bored. I can remember the twice daily baths in the wash tub and the overall oil rub afterwards to keep the skin scales from spreading over everything. The scaling would also be seen on palm sized pieces (at that time it was believed that scales spread the disease). Mother was a busy woman, but I made a good recovery. In the next year or so Dad built a larger house south of the R.R. station for us and there we lived until about 1966. We lived there during the big blizzard when the town ran out of coal, the roads were blocked and finally with 5 engines and rotary snow plow a train got them from the East (Source). Then in the spring we had floods when those with small boats or rafts could row down the streets, but all those things passed away and the little town grew. We often heard stories of the school closing due to snowstorms.\n\nWe often heard a story of a homestead and Dad would take us out to Grandma's to visit. Finally Dad decided to take up a homestead as schools were being built in many communities (Dad had helped build several of them) so we moved out to the homestead where we were about 3\u00bd miles from school. Dad bought a little tough Indian...\nand we had no sooner got newly settled than until I\ngot steady busy in those days, hardly twice a week\nlight from the sun. Then came the first school \u2014 a 21st and\nDecember week. But there was then a good young teacher, Mrs. Wilson\nand really in the heart from Caffe School. We were guaranteed\nfor over six weeks. After it, we moved out mid a third to the\nVillage and then go to school. I imagine they didn't suffer too much\nschool. That though on those who a once tried went ninety and\nwill all its activity of a new town coming into existence is divided\nwhy were drawn! Green armament red \u2014 two daily talks on the\noverall tall and the overall old red afterwards a deep blue.\nalso overlooking sprightly over everything. The second would\nnot make a good recovery, or the next year on as Nellie\nbuilt a larger house which of the population for around\nthen we have waited about 1986, as loved when during\nthe blizzards and snow, the down rain and flood, the worst was\nclocking and finally with 5 improved and other property\nwhen a house fell from the roof (shame). He is\nthe only one that I know under whose watch small things or\nrefuse could \u2014 now down the streets, yet all those that I could\nfound away and the little town grew. The church\nThe often heard a story that (damaged) and Mr. Wilson\ntake no end to the troubles. Finally Red decided\ntake up a homestead on school was being taught an many\ncommunities (Red had helped build several of them) so\nwe moved out to the homestead where we were about\n3/4 mile from school. And brought a little long Odom\nThis pony became much loved by all who spoke of his many tricks. He was not mean. He would kick when he was feeling happy but Dad had a heavy kicking strap that fastened over his hips and fastened to the cart or buggy shafts. If the trickster (as he often did) and went on a kicking spree, he would always stop if we hollered \"Whoa\" which happened if we upset the cart. Going to school at least wasn't dull. He might be going along just enjoying everything when suddenly a prairie chicken might jump or rather flop right up in his face and he would stop so suddenly we would likely land on top of him, but \"Whoa\" kept him in position until we got ourselves back in the cart and on our way. (I don't believe a school bus could be as unpredictable!)\n\nBy 1908 I was ready for high school but had only school in the summer. Mr. Vivian was our school Inspector for several years. It was decided I should go to Arcola High School so I went and lived with Mr. Anderson at the C.P.R. Station. They treated me well and were interested in my progress at school. In 1910 I received my third class diploma and went to Regina Normal School for the third class session and took my first school that fall at Vincent Lake.\n\nSocial life on the prairies at that time was such that I could have attended a dance or party every night but as I was paid to teach school I needed only a few nights in succession of dancing until I knew Friday nights and Saturday nights were the time I would allot to that pastime; I wouldn't endure being half asleep all day as dances then were all night affairs. Good\nSorry, I'm very tired by all this in the\nchild of too many weeks. It was not much. He would\nhave to finish over his hips & proceed to the end\nof spring. If he thought so, he planted\nthe field, which helped him to replace the\nlost. Going to school at this point did. He might be\ngoing along enjoying everything when suddenly a\nprince chivalry might come to fly right up to\nhim and he would stop as suddenly as we could\nlikely land on top of them. But \"When\" help him in\nposition until we got ourselves back on the car and on our way!\n(Or don't believe a word you could be as unpretentious!)\n\nBy 1908 I was ready for high school but had only worked\non the summer. (My parents were on school holidays for\nseveral years.) I was decided I should go to school\nat the C.P.R. School. They liked me well and were\ninterested in my progress at school. In 1910 I attended\nmy third class school and went to Regina Normal\nSchool for the third class degree and took my first\nschool test fall at Vancouver Beach.\n\nI was told on the previous at that time was much\nthat I could have attended a dance or party\nevery night but no one paid to local school\nindeed only a few nights in summer of dinner\nmany I know Friday night and Saturday to midnight\nwith the time Penny all day to let you know I would make\nlong help keep all day to dinner then even all night affairs. Good\nI taught then for several years on that Third Class Certificate (until 1916-1917), on extensions granted to me by my School Inspectors recommendation to the Dept. of Education. Then in 1917 I attended the Normal School for Third Class Teachers, and received my second Third Class Certificate Apr 28, 1917 valid until June 30, 1919. Then I received further extensions of my Third Class Certificate until Dec 21, 1923. After that time no further extensions could be granted to me and I again went to work as Assistant in a Municipal Office where I worked for several years including the drought years and relief work in the office.\n\nSince 1949 I stayed at home to care for my parents. Dad died in 1950 and Mother in 1958. Now I live alone and have several hobbies which keep me interested. Collect rocks, stamps, coins and curiosities.\n\nSome record of memories of pioneer days I will record here for posterity, but not right now. I have had enough of looking back for the present.\n\nThis sketch may not be acceptable at all for what you want in your archives. I would like it returned when you finish with it.
