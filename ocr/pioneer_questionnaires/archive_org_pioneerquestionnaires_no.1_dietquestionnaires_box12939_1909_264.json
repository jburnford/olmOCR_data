There were times when the supply was getting low and I had to plan and stretch to get along with little or possible except what we produced on our farm. We stored our food supplies in the cellar. We also kept our vegetables supply in the cellar like cabbage, carrots, beets, onions, potatoes in the old cellar spread. Had trouble the first year to pack eggs. Had trouble. The first year without loss. In a simple way without loss. Until I tried oats - a layer oats, a layer eggs not touching a little space between each egg, standing with the smaller top down. Lasted first till middle of Feb., when we started getting fresh eggs at market. We are getting fresh eggs all winter.\n21.

We lived in a small town and had a normal amount of getting done and little extra work to do. We always got along well with our family. We always worked hard and never complained.\n\nThe cellar was full of vegetables, apples, and other things. We also had potatoes, onions, and carrots stored away.\n\nHad trouble. The potatoes were a simple way to keep a layer of blue and white planking with a little space between them down egg standing with the smaller ones when we visited relatives. Had trouble making sure all vegetables were stored properly.\nOxford.\n\nNo. 613 S\n\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1MB\nOxford\n\nNo. 613 S\n\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1MB", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jessylee/PioneerQuestionnairesPDFs//PioneerQuestionnaires_No.1-DietQuestionnaires_Box12939_1909_264.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 20, "total-input-tokens": 33200, "total-output-tokens": 4485, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 2], [0, 1009, 3], [1009, 1757, 4], [1757, 2826, 5], [2826, 3694, 6], [3694, 5169, 7], [5169, 6215, 8], [6215, 10543, 9], [10543, 10746, 10], [10746, 11730, 11], [11730, 11730, 12], [11730, 13076, 13], [13076, 13731, 14], [13731, 14652, 15], [14652, 15103, 16], [15103, 16522, 17], [16522, 17592, 18], [17592, 17748, 19], [17748, 17902, 20]], "primary_language": ["en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]}}]
