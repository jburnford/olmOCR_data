(pail, barrel, tank) Slough, by hand.\n\nRegarding water supply, mention any changes which have taken place since you first started housekeeping, giving dates where possible.\n\nYou must remember that when we started up the country was as God made it. We got a well dug as soon as we could get at it. Sometime in July 1906. We struck water at 33 ft. One morning. Soon after dinner a CPR survey gang came along & took their Survey right across the field that was the Moore - now Norden. Moore was a Mucklin.\n11.

WRAPPINGS AND CONTAINERS\n\nMention any changes which you recall in the wrappings and containers received with the food you purchased (give dates where possible).\n\nThe fancy wrapping, mostly bulk paper bags. You got your good cheese that way, it was just as good if not better. I think we are paying too much for being silly.\n\n17. Give a typical day's menu (breakfast, dinner and supper) for the earliest year you can remember. Give the year and list the members of the family with their ages at the time. State the approximate month, e.g., winter or summer.\n\nWe had a first rate meal what we could get. Some kind Porridge three times a day. Some Corn-meal clitto. Some bread + Syrup. Babes often went out Sundays to get a meal (don't know). Some times in Summer we had Bread & Wild Strawberries. Meat around meat. Butter burned to oil that we if you had any.\n\nFather 61. Mother 62. Myself 27. My Sister 21.\n\n18. What year did you serve your first Christmas dinner in Western Canada? .......1908\n\nGive the menu. List those present and give their approximate ages at the time.\n\nChristmas 1906, deep snow, short of fuel, got under the blankets, sale a packet of raisins between the four of us. That was our Christmas dinner 1906. It was about 40 below. We had all the making but lacked the fuel to cook it.\n\n1907 Family in Battleford. Myself in Summer Camp Hudson Bay Simcoe. 1908. We had Chicken Potatoes, dried green peas & puddin'.\n\n19. Were you ever reduced to almost starvation level living on one or two locally produced foods? Give details.\n\n1906-07 were lean years. Distances too long so great that we had to make do with what we had. If you run short of anything you had to go without. There was no getting by town in the Winter. I knew more than one homesteader put in his clothes on corn-meal mush & water. You didn't see many people those days until well rounded summer.\n\nWe were always hungry. Try to put in a 10 hour day behind a working Plow on a Blade Bull or Bread-Jam till. When you are through your sides are hanging in.\n\nP.T.O\n16.

Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\nI don't see very much difference. There may be more variety today\u2014if you can afford to buy it.\n\nWe always tried to grow all the vegetables we could.\n\nWe were always plain eaters. Didn't go in for the fancy stuff.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homegrown and home prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible).\n\nWe seldom purchased vegetables. If we could not grow them, we went without.\n\nPeople grumble a great deal about the high cost of living. Well, some of it is their own fault. If you expect other people to purchase your food for you even to the extent I purchased clothing, you have to pay for it.\n\nWe grew peas and our own vegetables. We raised our own food.\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include back items not mentioned above, quality, methods of merchandizing, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. (Use back of page if more space is needed).\n\nThings on the Homestead were very primitive in the first year or two. 1906-07 we had no mail\u2014no newspapers.\n\nSo far as what took place in Canada or the World in the years 1906-1907, it was complete blank. We were isolated on the Prairie. The only break was the trip to town\u2014then we were too busy to look at a paper. We only allowed ourselves about a half a day in town, arrive in the morning\u2014sell out before supper. You see you had to think about feed for your animals. You could not get that in town without paying for it.\n\nP.T.C.\n20. Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\nI don't see any marked difference. This may be our variety today\u2014if you can afford to buy it.\n\nWe always used to grind our vegetables, we could.\n\nWe were always Julian eaters, Didn't go in for\n\nIt's funny stuff.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homegrown and home prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible).\n\nAll our own fresh vegetables. If we could!\n\nGrow them, we would without\n\nPeople scramble a great deal about the dry soil\n\nof living. What! some of it is their own land. If you expected other people to purchase from you, you\n\nwouldn't have to pay for it.\n\nAll your Pan's did our own cooking. We had the food\n\nsecured by foods. In other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada, including P.E.I.\n\nItems not mentioned above (quality, methods of merchandising, problems of storage, shortages and other details). (One blank of page 12 more space is needed).\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and\n\nshopping on the Homestead were very plentiful\u2014no fish\n\nyears in hours. 1906-07\u2014had no mail\u2014no newspapers.\n\nIn fact we could not have been in Canada or the United States\n\n1906-1907, it was very hard times. We were unable to\n\nbuy a thing at first. We only allowed ourselves bread,\n\nbutter, a day or two, as a treat. We had no meat or coffee.\n\nSuffice it to say that I think about five or six\n\ntimes a year I got fed in town and that happens fairly.\n\nP.T.C.\nPost Office was set up in the N.E. 15-33-22 W3 in the early spring of 1908. Mail came out from Saskatoon twice a week as far as Borden, P.E. (Plenty) - our PM had his store there for at least 20 miles. Our P.O. was called MacKinnon (Boring). The town was later extended to Borden (Beaufield) - Keller, Marango, also Post Office at Hark (Kirkland), after this time most of us went to Eaton's. Shipping for clothing, hardware, furniture, groceries, etc., we got the goods very reasonable + some good bargains at times. You could get a good suit of clothes for $13.50. Men's boots $2.00, women's shoes $1.50. House linen, good quality $1.00. Pants were anything from 6\u00a2 to 25\u00a2 per yard. Furniture was also reasonable, getting groceries through the mail saved a good many miles of travel to town, which was to a certain extent a waste of time.\n\nThe saving gave us more time to work on the land & build improvements as we could afford them. Most often had to build sod shocks to have some place to live, but we were all extremely glad when we could afford some lumber to build a house however small. Wells were also a problem. Shallow wells often dried up sometime early in the summer so you could not keep livestock without water. Some the very early years, we could not do all the breaking up land we would like, but had to take time to get water & building.\n\nAnother problem was firing. We used Prairie chips for summer. We had to burn Wood for winter & this had to be gotten in the summer also, as distances were too great to risk getting it in winter. 1906 we got our Wood from Stampede Lakes 1907-8 from the 6 Mile Butte, 45 miles from home. 1909-1910 from Sourkings Lake 39 R6 W4 Alberta 95 miles from farm. What made it more difficult we had to find these places. When we had to look behind the wood & start back home - then we not knew where made them.\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8\nOxford\n\nNo. 613 S\n\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jessylee/PioneerQuestionnairesPDFs//PioneerQuestionnaires_No.1-DietQuestionnaires_Box12937_1906E-L_190.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 22, "total-input-tokens": 36520, "total-output-tokens": 6366, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 2], [0, 1540, 3], [1540, 2680, 4], [2680, 4140, 5], [4140, 4140, 6], [4140, 5605, 7], [5605, 5605, 8], [5605, 10141, 9], [10141, 12918, 10], [12918, 17248, 11], [17248, 18248, 12], [18248, 19319, 13], [19319, 20391, 14], [20391, 22438, 15], [22438, 23131, 16], [23131, 24838, 17], [24838, 26420, 18], [26420, 28277, 19], [28277, 28277, 20], [28277, 28365, 21], [28365, 28519, 22]], "primary_language": ["None", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, true, true, true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]}}]
