It is impossible for you to answer all of them without having blank spaces. It is not necessary to give details, or describe particular events, if they help to answer the questions.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1914 and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not. If more than one member of the family can answer the question, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer Picti: What Did Western Canadian Pioneers Eat?\" is still being circulated. If you have not already answered this, and would be willing to do so, please put a check mark here and one will be sent to you.\n\nSaskatchewan archives questionnaires on other subjects will be prepared at a later date.
