Some of the questions will not apply to your experiences; others may prove impossible for you to answer so do not worry about having blank spaces. The purpose of your answers is not to fill up space but to answer the questions. Don't hesitate to give details or describe particular events, i.e., they help to answer the questions.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1930, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experiences of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nWestern Canadian Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer Days: What Did Saskatchewan Pioneers Have?\" is still being circulated.

Instead, I will share a few memories from my childhood that will hopefully inspire you to reflect on your own life.\n\nOne day, while working on our farm, my father decided to build a new barn. He spent weeks planning and preparing, but when it was finally completed, we were amazed by its size and beauty. It became a symbol of hard work and determination, and we knew that we had achieved something truly special.\n\nAnother memory that stands out is the time we went on a camping trip with my extended family. We set up camp near a river, and every night we gathered around the fire, telling stories and enjoying each other's company. It was a magical experience that we will never forget.\n\nThese memories remind us of the importance of perseverance and hard work, and how they can lead to incredible achievements. They also show us the value of family and community, and how they can bring us together in times of need.\n\nIn conclusion, I want to thank everyone who has supported me throughout my life. Your kindness and generosity have meant the world to me, and I am grateful for all that you have done.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this letter. I hope that it has given you a glimpse into my life and experiences. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to reach out to me.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]\n19.

To let the people\nin who might pass by, back and forth\nall night. We took advantage of\n2 tents and a campfire, provided by the\nR. N. W. M. P.

To let the family\nknow who kept house, back and forth,\nall night. We kept house, we bought\na tent and a parapet, we paid the\nR. N. W. M. P. B. Association, in which they\nthen resided. We bought two lots\nof ocean and hitched them together\nin wagon, and both families together\nwith implements and groceries\nwe required started out for the promised\nland.\nOur own were unkind, and we were entirely unprepared. And as there was no road nor room for us to go in the north ground, as the host had commenced to come out of ground.\n\nSo we decided to divide by the road and Mr. Smith went on to the river and started with his women and children with one of the tents to carry on trail till he could get back under cover in the morning.\n\nIt started for a very heavy snow fall, and in the confusion of dividing by the road, we discovered that we had been left without any rations. Mr. Smith had taken all away with him. I found my way to an Indian cabin and tried to explain that I wanted some food. Lee & Bacon the Indians understood nothing English nor Scotch, and when I tried to explain everything strangely enough Lee & Bacon got excited and he refused to drink any more. He had a delish rum in his hands over his stomach, however I was able to buy among them and Bacon and Lee and the ladies had become quite fond of me and the place, we would have been on a love.\nOur own wives, children, and we were entirely unprepared. And as there was no road nor room, we had to pitch in the open ground, as the host had.\n\nSo we decided to divide by the road and Mr. Smith went on to the homestead with his wife and children, while we continued our journey.\n\nWe came across a very heavy snowfall and started for two days, and on the fourth day of dividing by the road, we discovered that we had been left without any supplies.\n\nMr. Smith had taken away all his Indian tobacco and tried to display that he was not a man of means. He had tried to show that he was a gentleman, but he was not able to buy among the Indians.\n\nAnd so, I said to the leader, \"If you can't find the bacon on a tree, we will go back on a stone.\"\nAnd we stayed there a week before Mr. Smith came back from.\n\nThey used to call our settlement the \"Scott Settlement\" at first another man no man or no from Scotland.\n\nWe brought your ladies and bring a poem with us and had some\n\nwe formed a literary and debating society and had lectures, debates,\n\nand entertainments which were both humorous and entertaining.\n\nAt our Brown's Celebration we had the house filled with local style\n\nand of course to the ladies.\n\nSo the humor province of Idaho,\n\nwas drabbed the board in lemonade,\n\nand liquor allowed but on one occasion a lady was served.\n\nTo the prominent memory and I noticed that some of the men\n\nwere away outside and after a while they started coma (asement)\n\nvery pleased with them selves\n\nthen others would go out and\nAnd we stayed there a week before\nMrs. Smith\u2014Verna, back, for fun.\nThey used to call our settlement\nthe Social Settlement at first; another\nwas no name or no from Scotland.\n\nWe brought our bride, and Brown's\npoetry, truth, joy, and had religious\nservices, and Brown Celebrations,\nforming a literary and debating\nsociety, and had lectures, debates,\nand entertainments, which were both\nhumorous and entertaining.\n\nAt our Brown's Celebration, we had\nthis happy period in our style.\n\nAnd a banquet with roast beef,\nplenty of food, and our hearts.\n\nTo the summer province of Idaho,\nand of course, to the ladies.\n\nWe drank the toast in lemonade,\non the occasion of our arrival.\n\nIt was a most memorable day,\nand I noticed that some of the men\nwere very outside, and others inside.\n\nThey traveled over in (asment)\nvery pleased with themselves,\nthen others would go out and\nCome back equally happy.\n\nI heard that the old Squire who was to serve the Squire's daughter a drink, but he said he wasn't going to take a drink, so the Squire said, \"For I have no son (the good son) and has no money in the house,\" and has no like greyhounds can they smell the wine.\n\nBut she bought a bottle and had it somewhere in the orchard yard saying he would have a good dinner.\n\nBut Browne of whom we hear from hid his bottle inside it and poor Austin commented because the bird not taken him down when he got the chance.\nI told a joke about the Duke of Argyll and then one of the men who had come out too often and was standing in the lobby saying something about the noble of the place. I commenced crying because he was a better man than the Duke of Argyll.\n\nAnd kept repeating it until Thomas came back where he fell asleep.\n\nI heard that the old Scottishman who used to serve the guests to the hotel also went out and was seen off doing a dance. But he said he was going to take a drink at the moo for a few days (the good for solo boys) and has returned in charge of his men in the greyhound.\n\nBut she bought a bottle and hid it somewhere in the orchard yard saying it was his own. He had raised the Grace (the house) but it was empty of any work from him.\n\nBut Emma of whom we have been hiding his bottle stole it and now found himself lamenting because Richard must take his dream when he got the chance.\nThe man was very deaf and\nmost of us had to whisper to each\nother. One day, when I was home,\nI heard a woman talking to another\nwoman in the street. She was saying\nsomething about the weather being\nvery bad.\n\nThe woman started crying and\nsobbing. She then turned around and\nwalked away. I thought she might be\nill.\n\nLater that day, I heard someone\nscreaming for help. It turned out\nthat the woman had fallen off her\nbike while crossing the road.\n\nOn another occasion, I witnessed\na lady dropping a piece of paper\non the ground. Afterwards, she was\nseen walking away.\n\nShe seemed surprised and looked\nat the paper. She then walked over\nto pick it up and read what was\nwritten on it.\n\nI thought it was a message from\nsomeone who needed help.\n\nI went back to my house and\nwrote down everything I had seen.\n\nI then went to the police station\nand reported what had happened.\n\nThe police came and took me to\nthe hospital where I was treated.\n\nI was very grateful to them for\nhelping me.\n\nI have never been able to forget\nwhat I saw that day.\nThe man was very deaf and\nmost of us had to shout at him\nwhen going home. The man who\nthought he was in good company\nwould often stand at the\nback of the boat and watch the\nharbor master or the pilot over the\nhead of the boat. We had heard\nthat he had a bottle of nothing in each hand\nand kept it from bumping the bottles.\nThe dinner was always short of something\nhad fallen out, till I told him\nthat the bottle of vinegar had fallen\noverboard. Apparently he was known\nas the Duke of Croydon locally.\n\nOn one of these occasions I knew nothing\nof his plight (which was of course)\nhe seemed surprised and looked at what\nthe others do about it. I told him to\neat it, and he could smell my\nplace around the cheese and\ncommentary to eat it. He wasn't\nsmacking every good time. So\nI told him to put down his pocket\nand eat it when he got home,\nwhich he did.\nThe ladies used to grind tea\nrolled oats to make the Kaiser\non a little coffee-pot which a man\nhad brought out from Ireland\nwe always had plenty of rolled oats\nas one of our main foods bought\nfor 10s. 6d. 0.05 in Bradford\nso there was always corn in Egypt\nwe had to learn a thorough knowledge\nfrom 17 attaing feet in Woolston through\ndeep straw with 4 Leams of ocean\nto through our first crop a distance\nof 45 miles and when finished each\nfarmer had to pull it down next season\nwe had quite a lot heavy hold of it\nbut we read in a paper that the\nChambers of the Paul could not get it off\ncatch that fish whenever we got near\nit it would be ready to all the head\nand bound off again so one of our\nneighbours had never heard trouble\nand when they heard about went away to the\nlunch for a week she was a lucky lady\nwomen so she got hold of Ochre Gold\nnow and partly dry on the hang and\nThe ladies used to grind the\nrooibos-roots to make tea. They\nhad brought coffee-mill which a man\nuse always had plenty of rolled oats\nas one of our main food. Bought\n19 lot of Boiled oats in Bradford,\nso they was always corn in Egypt.\nwe had to carry a storehouse\nfrom 15 acre of land in Woolver, through\ndeep snow, with 4 loads of grain\nto store our first crop, a distance\nof 45 miles, and when finished each\nfamily had to pull it to the next farm.\nWe had quite a job keeping hold of the\nforty huge we ploughed out.

I found them in the same place where I had left them earlier.\n\nI then went to the store to buy some new clothes. When I got home, I realized that I had forgotten something important. I quickly ran back to the store to get it.\n\nI am grateful for your kindness.\nAs soon as the clothes were hung out by the house and the clothesline was arranged,\nmyself came home from the church\nand saw the pig running in the other\nyard (it had never been outside before)\nthat afternoon. It seemed a sight like\nhe didn't want what you set\nfor him. I thought he was going to\nrun away. Before something might\nhappen, one of our neighbors built\na place of wood around like a\nhouse with a hole at the top\nto keep the pig through the snow and\nof his handywork and agreed\nto see how the pig was doing\nwhen I looked inside I could see\nno pig and well known had come\noutward which had been used to\nfeed the pig with\nI am your friend\n\nP.S.
