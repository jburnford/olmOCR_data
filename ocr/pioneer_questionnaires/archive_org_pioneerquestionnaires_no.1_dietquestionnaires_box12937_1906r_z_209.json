Water could be obtained almost anywhere. June 12 to 20th since then water levels have steadily declined probably 10 ft. so that by 1940 water was difficult to obtain by well digging. Then dug outs came into use.\n| Item                  | Quantity | Unit Price |\n|-----------------------|----------|------------|\n| Corned & frozen       |          |            |\n| Canned carrots        |          |            |\n| Other canned          |          |            |\n| Canned apples         |          |            |\n| Apples - fresh        |          |            |\n| Apples - dried        |          |            |\n| Lettuce               |          |            |\n| Tomatoes - fresh      |          |            |\n| Bananas               |          |            |\n| Lemons                |          |            |\n| Oranges               |          |            |\n| Cornflakes            |          |            |\n| Other prepared        |          |            |\n| Breakfast             |          |            |\n| Oatmeal               |          |            |\n| Pearl tapioca         |          |            |\n| Imilo tapioca         |          |            |\n| Sugar                 |          |            |\n| Dates                 |          |            |\n| Valuuta               |          |            |\n| Icing sugar           |          |            |\n\n12.

Arrived at Strachan siding, slept in a box car on the way. Next day pulled out then crawled into a culvert, left a thunderstorm washed us out, then to Purnell, where we got breakfasts walked most of the way to Nelsonia and back to Raymore before we struck work.

Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include items not mentioned above, quality, methods of merchandising, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. [Use back of page if more space is needed].\n\nIn 1906 our nearest supply was at Sheho, 45 miles or so. I purchased my first groceries and household equipment from Leon Beck, Sheho on Oct 18th, 1906. I was paid by check. I started caching on Oct 28th in a log stack which was not covered or plastered. Made bed inside and claims out of poplar level on rafters. In a month, I purchased a quarter of beef from a neighbour, $28.00 for $8.30.\n\nNov 18th, 1907 went to Sheho with a neighbour, own wagon. Owen's names were Bill, Ed, and Terry who both all start out possible driven without lines. Camped out on the trail bought enough supplies to last but a short time. Underestimated tobacco, so fell back on Wiley's book. Lessons lost, if which I had plenty. Piled the wagons high and hung pots and pans outside the wagon box, and started for home arriving at about noon of Nov 21st. Later on, a farmer set up a store at Round Plains, 10 miles away. A neighbour of mine, Alf Chappell, had occasion to go there one day in the summer.\n20. Is there any substantial difference in the preparation of meals in the \n   Canadian Arctic compared with today?\n\n21. What did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead \n    of hunting and local prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates \n    as possible.)\n\n22. Please list other details from your early experiences of buying groceries \n    and preparing foods in other parts of the world. Include items purchased abroad, \n    problems of storage, shortages, and other difficulties.\n\nIn 1906 our nearest supply was at Sheshatshiu, 45 miles by boat.\n\nPurchased my first groceries and baseball stuff from \nJerr 15\u00a2. All stores on 18\u00a2. 28\u00a2. In a big island. Bread was not \ndelivered or delivered, made but late and cheap at 3\u00a2/pound \nlocal or imported. So a month later purchased a greater quantity \nof a regular size. $2.80\n\nNov. 18th-1907 wrote to Sheshatshiu with a new address \nand name. Also bought bread and sugar who lost all their \ncuts possible. During winter time camped out on the beach \ntrough enough supplies to last until spring. Had some \nlettuce so full each on stock food. Season late. Also \nhad plenty of meat. Also had some potatoes. Also \nabundant fish within five and fifteen miles away. Also \nmoney of about $10.\n\nRound Peary 10 m. by away. A northern summer day choppers \nhad occurred to go there one day at this distance.\nbeing out of supplies, so he hauled up his cover, let the stove heat in which he placed two chairs so that he and wife Ruby could ride in comfort, on the way home into town and grocers. But even worse was up if a hole spread a story, covered with mosquito and blankets they made a bed here and there slumped but the water was up to their backs and despite all prayers and illusory refusal to budge for two hours, another among accident or temporary supplies was when a neighbor came along with a two wheeled cart and lost a notion he would like to buy a pig, said he could have it alive if it was turned up, and give a little trouble getting a stick branch to stand the pig was placed between his legs, hit around without the branch so on the dead run across country and it never stopped short of home, but left the cold sitting in a deep pool, under the pig between Henry Smith's legs in 15 ft. of water.\n\nAnother neighbor of mine, Jack McWhirter, a Scots bachelor, had two shocks at the edge of a river, on the bottom of which a spring ran all winter, rabbits came plentifully, Jack had one spot he could get be seen dead in sheepskin coat sitting on a armchair, with a 32 rifle, pots rolled at the spring, by the shocks a rope was stretched between two poplars, on which he always sat relaxed, whenever a neighbor passed he was bound to take a dozen. Good memories.\n\nA bachelor diet in those days consisted chiefly of game, beef & pork occasionally, hammock (no bread) syrup pones and not eating all pancakes varied by dumplings.\n\nOne winter a bachelor gave a big party to 10 or 12 bachelors, after cards in the house served up supper which consisted of a huge plum pudding, nothing done but there was plenty for everyone.\n\nShe, after mentioned old Chappie was an old country cabinet maker and every new to farming had difficulty the first year, in growing potatoes.
