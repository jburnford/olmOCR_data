What other persons were employed by the council?\nMiss Evelyn Eager,\nAssistant Archivist.\nSask Archives Office.\nSaskatoon.\n\nDear Miss Eager,\n\nI am enclosing a questionnaire which was handed to me by my son Gordon who is a member of the Rural Municipality of Elmo No. 154, some time ago, and mislaid. Being an old pioneer, he thought I could fill it out better than he could, but I am unable to answer many of the questions and thought it would be better if I wrote a letter telling a little of what I know of local government activities in the early years, even before the Province was formed.\n\nI came to Winnipeg from Ontario in April of 1892, and in July joined a Survey Party when we came on the Railway as far as we could, which was Red River Carts over the old trails as far as the Morden District as it is now known where we subdivided 14 Townships into Sections until Nov. 10th when we returned over the trails to South Qu'Appelle, or Troy, where we boarded the train for Winnipeg. I returned to Ontario in 1883, and with my Father came back to the West in the spring of 1884 to homestead, which we did in the Pheasant Forks district, 40 miles north of the C.P. Railway here, and now the Duff district. We farmed there for 15 years and then moved in 1897 to a farm near to Grenfell, to be near the Railway, where I farmed until retiring in 1927. During the 42 years we were on the Homesteads our lands were not taxed at all. Some School Districts were formed in that part, in which we were not included.\n\nAt Grenfell we were in a Statute Labor District, and done one day's work a year on the roads, for each quarter section we owned with a man and team. We paid taxes in cash to the Town School District. A change came in 1905 when the Province was formed. We were then in a nine-township Local Improvement District, for one or two years when by a vote of the ratepayers they were changed over to a Municipality. After a Council was formed in 1905 the Municipal taxes were collected in cash, and they also collected the School TAXES. I was elected by acclamation to serve on the first Council in 1905, and continued as Councillor till 1923 when I became Reeve and served as such for 2 years. I was away in England for a visit at the time of the Municipal Election and could not be elected, and never served again. Up to near the close of the last century, trails were in use mostly, and if bridges were required the Local Government would build them, and make the approaches. The settlers then began to fence pastures with barbed wire, for their horses and cattle which formerly had been herded and tethered. It was then that the road allowances had to be opened up, the sloughs filled, and deviations made around them and roads made through the scrub and bluffs. For many years or up to the 1st war, most of the settlers were willing and anxious to work on the roads, and in that way pay their taxes, or partly so, and then when money became more plentiful and labor scarce, it was very difficult to get roads built. It was then we got larger tools and road graders such as Fresno Scrapers which required four horses, and larger graders to be drawn by the gasolene tractors which were then coming in, and often not powerful enough. Then motor cars were coming in when better roads were wanted, and more graded roads which required road drags to keep them in shape. There was always a demand for more and better roads which were costly to build, especially in a rough country with sloughs, bluffs and hills, as we have over most of this Municipality, and the taxes were as high as most of the settlers were able to pay. We always had a long list of unpaid taxes. While I was in office our Council and Ratepayers meetings were always orderly. Some Councillors were not very capable as one might expect. When I was reeve I had occasion in one year to halt the roadwork in two divisions, because the appropriations had been exceeded by many hundreds of dollars in one division, and over two thousand in the other. In the latter division there was always an election for a councillor. I found that my experience in surveying was useful in my position as Councillor and as Reeve.\n\nI think this is all that I need to write, and so will conclude.\n\nYours sincerely\n\nAlbert J Loveridge.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMAY 3 1956\nMiss Evelyn Eager,\nAssistant Archivist,\nSask Archives Office,\nSaskatoon.\n\nDear Miss Eager,\n\nI am enclosing a questionnaire which was handed to me by my son Gordon who lives in the Rural Municipality of Minapo No.154 near Elmo, Saskatchewan. Being an old pioneer, he thought I could fill it out better than he could, but I am unable to answer many of the questions and thought it would be better if I wrote a letter telling a little of what I knew of local government activities in the early years, even before the Province was formed.\n\nI came to Winnipeg from Ontario in April of 1882, and in July joined a Survey Party when we came on the Railway as far as we could, which was Flat Creek (Manitoba). We then drove over 600 miles and even with Red River Carts over the 320 miles far as the Dundurn District as it is now known, where we subdivided 14 townships into Sections until Nov 23rd. Then we returned over the trail to South Qu'Appelle or Troy, where we boarded the train for Winnipeg. I returned to Ontario in 1885, and with my father came back to the West in the spring of 1886 to homestead, which we did in the Pheasant Forks district 40 miles north of the C.P.R. Railway here, and now the Duff district. We farmed there for 15 years and then moved in 1907 to a farm near to Grenfell, to be near the Railway, where I farmed until retiring in 1927. During the 15 years we were on the Homesteads our lands were not taxed at all, since School Districts were formed in that part, in which we were not included.\n\nAt Grenfell we were in a Statute Labor District, and some one days work a year on the roads, for each quarter section we owned, such a man and team. We paid taxes in cash to the Town School District. A change came in 1905 when the Province was formed, we were then in a nine-township Local Improvement District, for one or two years when by a vote of the Ratepayers the municipality was formed over the Municipality. After a Council was formed in 1905 the Municipal taxes were collected in cash, and they also collected the School TAXES. I was elected by acclamation to serve on the First Council in 1906, and continued as Councillor till 1923 when I became Reeve and served as such for 2 years. I was away in England for a visit at the time of the Municipal Election and could not be elected, and never served again. Up to near the close of the last century, trails were in use mostly, and if bridges were required the Local Government would build them and make the approaches. The settlers then began to fence pastures with barbed wire, for their horses and cattle which formerly had been herded and tethered. It was then that the road allowances had to be opened up, the sloughs filled, deviations made around them and roads made through the scrub and bluffs. For many years or up to the last war, most of the settlers were willing and anxious to work on the roads, and in that way pay their taxes or partly so, and then when money became more plentiful and labor scarce, it was very difficult to get roads built. It was then we got larger tools and road graders such as Fresno Scrapers which required four horses, and larger graders to be drawn by the gasoline tractors which were then coming in, and often not powerful enough. Then motor cars were coming in when better roads were wanted, and more graded roads which required road drags to keep them in shape. There was always a demand for more and better roads which were costly to build, especially in a rough country with sloughs, bluffs and hills, so we have over most of this Municipality, and the taxes were so high almost of the settlers were able to pay. We always had a long list of unpaid taxes. While I was in office our Council and Ratepayers meetings were always orderly. Some Councillors were not very capable as one might expect. When I was reeve I had occasion in one year to halt the roadwork in two divisions, because the appropriations had been exceeded by many hundreds of dollars in one division, and over two thousand in the other. In the latter division there was always an election for a councillor.

My personal knowledge is of that which was known in the 1880s as the Primitive Methodist Colonization Company. This was a colonization company formed in 1882. This company received a grant of land from the Dominion government for colonization. This land was the first choice of colonization lands in the attractive Qu'Appelle Valley District. The company, without loss of time went to work to procure settlers. My parents, with four children were among the earliest settlers.\n\nThe writer was three at the time and am the oldest living member of the family who came from England in 1883. The local government was then under the P.M. Colonization Company, with the Rev. C.S. Willis as agent and secretary. Mr. A.J. Loveridge, another settler tells me that they were too busy building their homes to think much of local government.\n\nThe entries for homesteads were made through Mr. Willis, and if there were any taxes they were paid to him as Sec-Treas of the company.\n\nThe first record available now to me is of the formation of a Public School District in 1885. This was the Pheasant Forks Protestant School District #48, established by Ordinance #4 of 1885, passed November 18, of that year.\n\nThis was the school where I and brothers and sisters received our early education. A Mr. Mac Maholland was appointed returning officer for the election of trustees, and Mr. John Kenyon on a provisional Certificate was the first teacher.\n\nThe only taxes I remember being spoken of were School Taxes. However in 1897-8 I do remember some road work being done much to the disgust of all the early settlers, we liked the prairie trails better, they went direct to the place one wanted to go.\n\nThere must have been other municipal government as the years went by. After an absence of over forty-five years I went back to our homestead S.E. 2-28-9 and have paid the taxes since then; as follows:\n\nMunicipal Tax - Health Services - School Tax - Telephone Tax - Public Revenue $14.40 $14.40 $22.40 $2.25 $3.20\n\nThe Primitive Methodist Colonization Company seemed to just fade out.

The parade formed up at the school grounds at 10:30 A.M., and by 11:00 A.M. McCamick's Pipe Band and his Scottish dancers proceeded down 2nd Ave. to the Town Hall, then down Main Street to the Exhibition grounds where a full afternoon and evening's entertainment was provided. Main St. was lined on both sides with spectators to watch the colourful parade and the opinion of all was that it was the best parade seen outside of a city.\n\nThe float carrying a group was entered by the Wapella C.W.L. ladies who demonstrated in pioneer costumes the process of wool being clipped from the sheep to the finished product. A similar type of float with spinning wheel was entered by St. Andrews. The Central Grocer's parade came with a \"Bonfire To The Pioneers\" float of flowers, which was awarded second prize. Included in the parade were other well designed and outstanding floats, The Red Cross with nurses and characters portraying the world wide work of mercy, Sanderman's store, Stott's Hardware depicting old and modern ways of doing the family's washing, the North American Lumber Co.'s Ezy-built cottage, The Post Office, Kornblatt's float, Town Fire Brigade, The Commercial Hotel, Norman's Imperial Oil, Jubilee Choir floats, Jr. and Sr. who entertained with singing en-route. Also in the parade were pony riders and cowboys strumming guitars, not forgetting the \"Gentleman Cop\" clearing the way for the big machine, and all the little children's decorated bicycles.\n\nA very pleasant part of our Golden Jubilee Celebration was the signing of the Guest Book by 137 of our Pioneers who have resided in the Province 50 years or more, or who were over 70 years of age. Tea and cakes were served to them from 2 to 4 p.m. in a special enclosure provided for them by the committee convened by Mr. F.

The winners were: men's 1st Grenfell Gems, 2nd St. Andrews, 3rd Rocanville, 4th Moosomin, 2nd Grenfell, 3rd Welwyn. Another entertainment feature was the Scottish dancing by Piper D. J. McCormick's dancers.\n\nMr. G. Cole, the Hon. C. C. Williams, Minister of Labour, gave a brief former Wapella boy, and congratulated the address and congratulated the Agricultural Society on the celebration of its 50th anniversary since its association with this town and its activities. He related instances of his boyhood days here. He also congratulated the Wapella Jubilee Committee. Mr. Williams was accompanied by two of his daughters.\n\nLunches and supper were served in the rink by the Ladies' Committee, following which, a broom ball game was played between J. Starrett's \"Oilers\" and D. Currie's town team. This drew a large crowd and at the end of an exciting game the teams were deadlocked at 2 goals each and called it quits.\n\nThe Dominion shows were present on the grounds with their Ferris wheel, miniature cars and other novelties for the entertainment of all.\n\nA grand display of fireworks closed the celebrations at the exhibition grounds. A dance was held later in the Town Hall.\n\nMr. Ronald Ede, cousin to the bride, and Mr. Charles Salonen, brother-in-law to the groom. The groom's gifts to his attendants were tie clips.\n\nThe reception was held in the church parlor for the immediate relatives and very close friends. The church parlor was decorated in pink and white flowers and wedding bells. The three tiered wedding cake, which was covered with gardenias in a miniature frame and decorated with silver leaves, was made by the bride's mother, and Miss Nora Ede. Mr. Howard Ede was toastmaster and after the toast the bride and groom responded. Pastor P.J. Koski led in grace and Miss Koski spoke a few words befitting the occasion.\n\nThe young couple plan an extended honeymoon trip, perhaps to Banff, and for going away the bride chose a beaguing with green accessories. Upon returning they will make their home on the groom's farm in Clayridge.\n\nPrior to her marriage Mrs. Maki was teaching school in Clunridge and took an active part in the community and church work.\n\nOut-of-town guests were: Mrs. John Cascadden, an aunt of the bride, and Mrs. Harry Carcary, a cousin, from Brandon; Mrs. Vera James, Vancouver, B.C.; Mrs. Charles Huhtala, Winnipeg; Mrs. John Carter, Sprague, Waskesiu, sister of the groom; Mr. and Mrs. Gabriel Maki and family of Sault Ste.

If you remember when the organization of districts was on a voluntary basis, tell whether they were popular or unpopular?\n   The organization of districts on a voluntary basis was popular because the farmers were too poor to pay their taxes in cash so they were allowed to work on the roads and keep them in repair in their particular area. Everyone could work out their taxes in this way.\n\n3.

In each case, the question is to be answered in relation to the particular section in which it is included, and you may therefore need to answer the same question more than once, as it applies to different forms of local government under which you have lived.\n\nPlease send your completed questionnaire to:\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Office,\nUniversity of Saskatchewan,\nSaskatoon, Saskatchewan.\nSASKATCHEWAN ARCHIVES QUESTIONNAIRE.\n\nNo. 10\n\nLocal Government.\n\nPART I: STATUTE LABOUR DISTRICTS AND LOCAL IMPROVEMENT DISTRICTS BEFORE 1908.\n\n1.

Now the Town is policed by the R.C.M.P.\n   (2) People from the Country Districts send their children to the Banora School to receive training in Grade 9 to 12, as Banora had always excellent School Facilities. The School charged a tuition fee which in many cases could not be collected, but which made the taxes high for the rate payers. Why not have a larger trust which equalizes the taxes.\n\nDo you think the changes are an improvement, or not?\n   (1) It certainly is a big improvement\n   (2) The rate payers of Banora have to pay too high a bill rate compared with the County Districts. But Banora has now excellent facilities.\n\n6. Has there ever been much complaint from property owners in the town (or city) that they were taxed unfairly compared with people living in the surrounding district and making use of town (or city) facilities?\n   Yes, especially in School matters.\n\nDescribe any efforts made for the adoption of the single tax.\n   We tried it once, but quit it as it was not satisfactory.\n\nHow successful were these efforts? We could not make it work.\nPART IV: TIME AND CITIZENSHIP\n\n1. In what towns or cities (and during what years) have you lived?\n   In Banora since it became a town in 1910.\n\n2. If you remember its establishment as a town (or city), tell what you recall of any special notice given to the event.\n   Remember the event very well. We just went through a typhoid fever and Smallpox epidemic. We had to do a lot with raising well water and put in Water Works costing over $100,000. We decided roads and walk to cost us $5,000. Electric light and fire protection $15,000. All these improvements had to be made to make Banora healthy enough to live in. We discussed buying Banora, was high enough to prevent the expenditure, but the Board of Supervisors said no, they would not allow the Board to become a town together.\n\n3. What differences in the management of local affairs did you notice particularly compared with where you had lived previously?\n   When I came to Banora in 1905, there were no School districts organized. The Territorial Government was organizing the local Improvement districts. The people had to sign up the School districts themselves. The population was predominantly Mexican and practically none could write English. Very few could read or write in their own language. I was engaged by these people to be their teacher and organize their School Districts. These Mexican and School Board ran their own district as well as their children and grandchildren.\n\n4. Was there much competition for the position of mayor?\n   Yes, some times.\n\n5. What differences have you noticed in the services performed by the town (or city) recently as compared with earlier years?\n   (1) The Town Council employed the Town Policeman. Now the Town is policed by the State R.C. No. 1.\n   (2) People from the Country Districts send their children to the Banora School to receive training in Grade 9 to 12, as Banora had always excellent School Facilities. The School charged a tuition fee which in many cases could not be collected. But today, we make the taxes high for the rate payers who will take a larger share which equates the taxes.\n   (3) It certainly is a big improvement.\n   (4) The Rate payers of Banora have to pay too high a mill rate compared with the County Districts, but Banora has never exceeded the tax rate living in the surrounding district and making use of town facilities.\n\n6. Has there ever been much complaint from property owners in the town (or city) that they were taxed unfairly compared with people living in the surrounding district and making use of town facilities?\n   Yes, especially in School matters.\n\nDescribe any efforts made for the adoption of the single tax.\n   We tried it once, but quit it as it was not satisfactory.\n\nHow successful were these efforts?\n   We could not make it work.\nLocal Government\n\n(Drawing by McGregor Hone)\n\nPlease print name and address in capital letters.\n\nYour full name __ J.F.

Canora is situated in R.M. No. 274\n   of Good Lake.\n\n2. Did the people in your community like this form of organization better than the smaller units in existence before 1908?\n   People did not like the change from the Statute Labour District to the\n   S.L.D. because they were no longer allowed to work out their taxes\n   the way they wanted to. But after the L.I.D. was in operation,\n   For what reasons? a year, most of the people liked it because the\n   people now wanted to work out their taxes and hire the contractor\n   as the work had to be done now. There was strong opposition to\n   organization of the municipality as this meant that taxes would\n   be up.\n\n3. Describe ratepayers meetings, telling how many attended, what took place at meetings, which subjects caused the most discussion, and any differences noticed from meetings of earlier years.\n   In the summer of 1908 there was a vote taken in the municipality.\n   It was carried because the Returning Officer in Canora did not allow\n   a number of rate payers who had a right to vote to do so.

Were people generally satisfied with the way local affairs were managed by the reeve and council?\n   Not always. There was bitter conflicts, often among the candidates.\n   But that was more because some people preferred one candidate and\n   other people wanted the other and then they argued so and so spent\n   If not, for what reasons? too much on a certain piece of road.\n\n   Did people think that relatives and friends of council members\n   received special favors? Yes, sometimes so, of what kind?\n   Mostly that some Reeve or Councillor had fixed a road running close\n   by his friends.\n1. During what years did you live in a mine township L.I.D.?

(or R.M.) should do more?\nYes they did, but mostly they claimed the Government in Regina should do more.\n\n7. What equipment did the L.I.D. (or R.M.) own?\n\nThe L.I.D. had only scrapers; value about $200,000. The Rural Municipality of Good Lake today had power graders and scrapers and other machinery; value about $50,000. The town of Canora has equipment all told, $30,000.00\n\nWas it loaned to individuals or kept only for municipal (or district) work?\nHorse scrapers were sometimes loaned to farmers, but big machinery now days is only loaned to Societies to fix up fair grounds, etc.\n\n8. Was there much complaint about the taxes levied for municipal purposes?\nThere was always; the taxes were always too high.\n\nIf so, on what grounds? (that is, because they were too heavy, or not fairly distributed, etc.)\nBoth taxes rose in the last 15 years from about $45.00 per half section to $250.00 per annum. Then came the larger unit. Taxes rose from 15 mills to 45 mills.\n\nWhat suggestions did people have for ways of raising revenue other than taxes on land?\nNone in the municipality.\n\n9. (To be answered by those who lived in L.I.D.'s).\nWere people in the L.I.D. anxious to have it formed into a R.M.?\n\nWhy or why not?\nThey were afraid of the higher taxes.\n\n10.

In what villages (and during what years) have you lived?\n   The hamlet, 1904 to 1908; village, 1908 to 1920; and town of Genora, from 1910 on.\n\n2. Do you recall the formation of the village?\n   Yes.\n   If so, was there much excitement among the people over its formation or any particular notice given to this event?\n   No.\n\n3. If you lived in a R.M. or L.I.D. before moving to the village, what differences did you notice in the management of village affairs?\n   We took some horses, cows and chickens with us so did not notice so much difference. The affairs of the village were managed more efficiently.\n\n4. Was there much competition for the position of councillor?\n   No.\n   Was there usually a good turnout of voters for election of councillors?\n   Yes.\n   Was it generally considered that the council did a good job?\n   Not always.\n\n5. Was there any custom followed in the selection of overseer by council members (i.e., by rotation etc.)?\n   No, we decided who was the best man and voted him into office.\n\nIn the conduct of village affairs, how did the importance of the overseer compare with that of the other councillors?\n   The overseer was Sec.-Treas., Policeman, License Inspector, etc. He was quite an important man who took his orders from the council.\n\n6. What were the most important activities of the village council? (List in order of importance).\n   1. Sanitation. See that every dwelling had a proper back house. Establish a nuisance ground. No one would sell us land for one.\n   2. Build sidewalks and roads and keep them clean.\n   3. In 1909 we had a typhoid fever and small pox epidemic, kept everything as sanitary as possible.\n\nWere these duties well performed?\n   As well as could be.\n\n7. Did property owners in the village think they were taxed unfairly compared with people living in the surrounding district and making use of village facilities?\n   Yes. Taxes on a medium sized dwelling were as high as on a whole quarter section including buildings.\n\nDescribe any efforts made in the village for the adoption of the single tax.\n   We never had any in the village. During my term as Mayor in 1920 we tried it in Genora.\n\nHow successful were these efforts?\n   We did not go on with it as it was not satisfactory.\n\n8. Has there ever been much agitation or desire to have the village established as a town?\n   It was established as a town in 1910 by necessity to get wider power.\nPART IV: TOWNS AND CITIES.\n\n1. In what towns or cities (and during what years) have you lived?\n   In Canora since it became a town in 1910.\n\n2. If you remember its establishment as a town (or city), tell what\n   you recall of any special notice given to the event.\n   I remember the event very well. We just passed through a typhoid fever and small pox epidemic. We had to do away with using well water and put in water works costing over $100,000. We needed roads, sidewalks, etc., costing $25,000. Electric lights and fire protection, $35,000. All these improvements had to be made to make Canora healthy enough to live in. The assessed value of Canora was high enough to permit the expenditure, but the village did not have the power we had to have become a town to get permission. Finally, the word came that we were a town and the people felt relieved.\n\n3. What differences in the management of local affairs did you\n   notice particularly compared with where you had lived previously?\n   When I came to Canora in 1905 there were no school districts organized. The Territorial Government was organizing the Local Improvement districts. The people had to organize the School Districts themselves. The population was predominantly Ukrainian. Practically none could write English. Very few could read or write in their own language. I was engaged by these people to be Sec.-Treas., and organize their School Districts. The Ukrainian School Board ran their School District as well; as their children and grandchildren are running these organizations today.\n\n4. Was there much competition for the position of mayor?\n   Yes, sometimes.\n\n5. What differences have you noticed in the services performed by\n   the town (or city) recently as compared with earlier years?\n   1. The Town Council employed the Town Policeman. Now the town is policed by the R.C.M.P.\n   2. People from the Country Districts send their children to the Canora School to receive training in Grade 9 to 12 as Canora had always excellent School facilities. The School charged a tuition fee, which in many cases could not be collected but which made the taxes high for the rate payers. Now we have a larger unit which equalizes the taxes.\n\nDo you think the changes are an improvement, or not?\n   1. It certainly is a big improvement.\n   2. The rate payers of Canora have to pay too high a mill rate compared with the country districts but Canora has now excellent educational facilities.\n\n6. Has there ever been much complaint from property owners in the facilities of the town (or city) that they were taxed unfairly compared with people living in the surrounding district and making use of town (or city) facilities?\n   Yes, especially in School matters.\n\nDescribe any efforts made for the adoption of the single tax.\n   We tried it once but quit it as it was not satisfactory.\n\nHow successful were these efforts?\n   We could not make it work.\nPART IV: TOWNS AND CITIES.\n\n1. In what towns or cities (and during what years) have you lived?\n   In Gomora since it became a town in 1925.\n\n2. If you remember its establishment as a town (or city), tell what\n   you recall of any special notice given to the event.\n   I remember the event very well. We just passed through a typhoid fever and small pox epidemic.\n   We had to do many things including water and put in water works costing over $100,000.

Did the people in your community like this form of organization better than the smaller units in existence before 1908?\n   I do not think so.\n   For what reasons? Things were done in a larger way,\n   and the council was not as close to the people,\n   much more business is done which the average\n   man does not understand. Taxes are high\n   and there is not much that can be done\n   about it and people seem to have lost interest.\n\n3. Describe ratepayers meetings, telling how many attended, what took place at meetings, which subjects caused the most discussion, and any differences noticed from meetings of earlier years.\n   I have been to several ratepayers meetings\n   which were very tame and not well attended.\n   However back in 1937 it was considered that\n   the large account for administrating relief\n   was away out of line and the ratepayers\n   turned out in force and protested and since\n   then things have been quiet.\n\n4. Was there much competition for election to positions of reeve and councillor? no\n   Were they regarded as positions of some honor, or just a \"chore\"\n   that someone had to do? Not many people are anxious\n   to fight for these positions.\n\n5. Were people generally satisfied with the way local affairs were managed by the reeve and council?\n   I think so but the problem of country roads is\n   a big one and only so much can be done\n   If not, for what reasons?\n\nDid people think that relatives and friends of council members received special favors?

Describe differences in activities and duties of the 9 township L.I.D.'s or R.M.'s as compared with the 4 township units before 1908?\n\nThere is much more to be done now than with the four township units. A full-time secretary is employed. School and telephone tax is collected. Roads have been improved. Land grants have been distributed. The health of the people has been looked after, such as employing municipal doctors and grants to hospitals and many other duties too numerous to mention.\n\nDid people think the L.I.D. (or R.M.) should do more? No\n\n7. What equipment did the L.I.D. (or R.M.) own?\n\nUntil about 1930, they had very little equipment except occasional donations. Each annual division had three or four pieces of equipment and a plow.\n\nWas it loaned to individuals or kept only for municipal (or district) work? Sometimes loaned\n\n8. Was there much complaint about the taxes levied for municipal purposes? No\n\nIf so, on what grounds?

Was it customary to permit a person to work off his taxes by cutting bush on the road allowances or by roadwork with team and scraper? Yes, in the early days and was common until about 1920 and even later where it difficult for a person to pay taxes otherwise.\n\nCan you remember during what years this was allowed?\n\n11. Has there ever been any agitation or desire to have the village established as a town?\n6.
