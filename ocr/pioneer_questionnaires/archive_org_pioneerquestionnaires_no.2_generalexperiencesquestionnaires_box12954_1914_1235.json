It is also important to remember that the answers given will be used by the researcher to understand the pioneer experience.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada between 1870 and 1920. It covers both personal experiences of the pioneer family members and the history of the family.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them in separate entries or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questions:\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneers' Life,\" is still being distributed. If you have not already answered this, and would be willing to do so, please put a copy here ( ).\n\nSaskatchewan Archives questionnaires on other subjects will be purchased at a later date, some of these are listed below.
