Well, that is where Mr. David Miller is boring for coal. Has he found any yet? No, my son, but he has bored through 80 feet of shale, and he says that coal always underlies shale.\n\nOh, Pa, is that Mr. Van Horne coming this way with Mr. Stephens? No, my friend, that is Mr. E.

Are they going to hold up the train? For shame, my son, those are two very respectable merchants and are doubtless talking coal. The short dark one with a lot of overshoe on is Arthur Roberts and the tall one is T. J. Smith.\n\nOh, pa, who is that young man who has just yulled Mr. Smith away from Mr. Roberts and is marching down the street with him. That, my son, is George H. Morrison. T. J. and George are very thick just now. It is said they have bought or had on mortgage all the land they can get near Wapella as a great rush is expected when the coal is found.\n\nOh, pa, isn't that young fellow rude that just passed through the train; he spat on my shoe? No, my son, he is not rude, only thoughtless. He is looking for customers for the Queen's Hotel. His name is Charles Rossiter. He is a very nice young man and reads the SIFTINGS.\n\nOh, pa, the train is off! Who were those two men standing on the bank? The dark one, my son, is Marvellous John, who presides at all the public meetings and some of the private ones, and is a very jolly fellow and always sees the last one under the table, and the other one with the tight pants and loose boots is Old Vanity.

After all, he was not quite sure that she had not spoken the truth.\n\nIf the calico frock had been a flounced silk, for instance, how many degrees more deferential would have been his manner in presenting the cherries?\n\nQuery the second.\n\nIf the calico frock had been walking down Broadway about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, would he, Solomon Griggs, of Griggs, Makem & Co., as willingly escort it as across those green fields where, if the robins and bluebirds did make remarks, it was in their own language?\n\nSol couldn't answer the questions satisfactorily, but he went to bed and dreamed all night of the little Diogenes in her calico frock.\n\nThat week and the next he waited patiently for the first glimpse of that remarkable garment coming around the corner, but in vain. And when, in such a very careless manner that it was quite remarkable, he wondered audibly \"where that odd little girl lived whom he saw on the eve of his arrival,\" Aunt Hester answered dryly: \"A way up\u2014thereabout,\" pointing with her hand. She boarded, she believed, with some queer sort of folks there; though, for that matter, she was queer enough herself. And this was absolutely all she would say on the subject.\n\nThe next day Sol took it upon himself to wander up that way, \"thereabouts,\" and was rewarded with a glimpse of the calico frock going through a broken gate; and following it closely, came up with the wearer as she was about to enter the dilapidated front door, at which piece of impertinence she was so much incensed as to turn very red, while tears actually started to her eyes.\n\n\"What do you want?\" she asked, sharply enough.\n\n\"To see you!\" replied Sol, who, taken by surprise, could think of nothing but the truth.\n\n\"Well, you have seen me\u2014now go?\"\n\n\"But it's a warm day, and I am very tired!\"\n\n\"I can't help that. It's not my fault\u2014is it?\"\n\n\"You might ask me to walk in and sit down, if you were not as hard hearted as a Huron?\"\nSouth Carolina Archives Office\n\nUniversity of South Carolina\n\nApril 18th, 1955\n\nDear Mr. Smith,\n\nI am writing to you in response to your request for information regarding my family history. I have been researching my ancestors for many years and have found some interesting facts.\n\nMy great-grandfather came to South Carolina from Ireland in 1840. He was a farmer and worked hard to provide for his family. My grandfather was born in 1860 and lived through the Civil War. He fought for the Confederacy and was wounded at the Battle of Gettysburg.\n\nMy father was born in 1880 and worked as a carpenter. He met my mother in 1900 and they married in 1902. They had two children, my brother and me.\n\nI hope this information is helpful to you.
