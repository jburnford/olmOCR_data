Sketchley moved from Okla W.B. to the Quill Lake district Sept. 1902, hauling our possessions overland from Yorkton some 125 miles. Ours was the first family, my age 12 years. It was the fall of 1904 that the first construction trains were operated through Quill Lake and some provisions could be obtained through this medium. Until that time everything was hauled from Yorkton or Sheho. The winter months were \"freighting time.\" The settler bought in quantities and at the close of winter freighting had supplies to last pretty well through the following summer. The plentifulness of prairie chickens, rabbit, ducks solved the fresh meat problem.\n\nIt was more economical to buy in quantity and many people kept up the practice, and many were the mail orders mostly to Eaton's for those articles which could be kept for long periods. I observed this practice for a good many years after becoming a housewife.\n\nMy husband came to the district through freighting grocery supplies for the rail roaders. 1904.
