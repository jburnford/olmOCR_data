What did your friends and relatives think of your decision to come to Western Canada? Most of them thought it was a very wise move and suggested that they might follow in the near future.\n\n12. Did you travel by yourself or with a party (family, friends or other group)? My father and a neighbor loaded a car with settlers' effects at Trenton Ont., about March 10th, 1884 and came West in an immigrant train. We crossed the St. Clair river at Sarnia Ont.\n\n13. How long did your journey take? From there we traveled by C.P.R. arriving at Indian Head, Man., 21st\n\n14. What incidents of the journey West do you remember?

All household effects including a year's supply of food and fuel had been stored in a big tent near the shack. He went to build a suitable log house after arriving. Within ten days however, calamity hit them. A fierce prairie fire swept through the area and destroyed everything. They had very little money and a job of any kind was extremely hard to find. This was a dreadful blow to the family and my aunt finished my poor mother. At that time all the government relief would have been a God-send.\n\nIt was my job during the summer of 1889 and 1890...\nGARRATT, Mr. Alfred Webster\n\nMilestone, Sask.\n\n11.
