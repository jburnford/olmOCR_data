Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\nIn the early years of my experience steam threshing outfits were about at the end of their day but preparing meals for the large crews of men with their huge appetites was a big problem. Fourteen or fifteen men can consume an enormous amount of food in a day. Two men can now do the same amount of work with a self-propelled combine harvester today.\n\n21.

Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include items not mentioned above, quality, methods of merchandising, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. (Use back of page if more space is needed).\n\nSince leaving the west we have occasionally taken our homegrown wheat to the mill at Estevan to be ground into flour, bran & chaff or flour. As my wife & I had seven children & my father-in-law lived with us food was somewhat of a problem. We always grew a very good garden & lots of potatoes & as soon as frost allowed in the early winter we killed a cattle heart for winter use. There was always a big pot of meat & gravy & another two containing potatoes & vegetables. Lack of finances made the purchase of groceries a problem but we always bought in as large a quantity as possible. When the children were all at home a 100 lb bag of sugar lasted six weeks & a bag of flour a little over two weeks. Perhaps we were lucky but we had very little sickness.\n20. Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\nIn the early years of my experience, there was a tendency to rely almost entirely on canned or preserved foods for the basic diet. This was due to a lack of fresh produce and the high cost of transportation. However, as time went on, we began to grow our own vegetables and fruits, which helped to reduce costs and improve our diet.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homegrown and home-prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible.)\n\nSince moving to this area, we have occasionally taken our homegrown crops to the market to sell them. We also grow a variety of vegetables and fruits in our garden, which provides us with fresh produce throughout the year.\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences as buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include items not mentioned above, quality, methods of marketing, prices, etc.\n\nAs my wife and I raised our children, we always emphasized the importance of a balanced diet. We grew our own vegetables and fruits, which provided us with fresh produce throughout the year. We also bought meat, dairy products, and other essentials from local stores. The children were always encouraged to eat a variety of foods, and we never allowed them to go hungry.\n\nWe also had a small garden plot where we grew a little corn and beans. Our neighbors were very helpful, and they often shared their surplus with us. We were very grateful for their kindness.\nOxford\n\nNo. 613 S\n\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jessylee/PioneerQuestionnairesPDFs//PioneerQuestionnaires_No.1-DietQuestionnaires_Box12940_1913_336.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 20, "total-input-tokens": 33200, "total-output-tokens": 5527, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 2], [0, 1258, 3], [1258, 1258, 4], [1258, 2674, 5], [2674, 3561, 6], [3561, 4936, 7], [4936, 6380, 8], [6380, 11012, 9], [11012, 14986, 10], [14986, 18981, 11], [18981, 20287, 12], [20287, 21846, 13], [21846, 22739, 14], [22739, 23574, 15], [23574, 24228, 16], [24228, 25935, 17], [25935, 27561, 18], [27561, 27561, 19], [27561, 27715, 20]], "primary_language": ["None", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "None", "en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, true, true, false, true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]}}]
