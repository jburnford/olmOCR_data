(You do not need to answer this question if you would rather not or you may use \"I was a small child\", \"I was in my teens\", etc.)\n   nineteen\n9. What were your reasons for coming West? Farmers in England at that time all talked a lot about the bad times farmers in England were going through. I have since come to the conclusion that that is a constant condition among farmers, and that perhaps they were not so badly off as they made out. Hearing so much of this talk I suppose I formed the opinion that it would be a smart thing to look for something offering better prospects of improvement.\n10. How did you learn about the West? (Through other people? Reading about it? Railroad or government information)?\n    A big industrial exhibition was held at Wolverhampton in 1902 at which the Canadian Government had a building and on two visits to the exhibition I collected a lot of the literature being distributed by the Department of the Interior. I think that first started me. During the next winter I had a talk with Mr. McDougall of Cordie who was in Britain as a Canadian Farmer Delegate to encourage immigration.\nCooper, James\nWest Bend, 1903\n\nPIONEER EXPERIENCE: A GENERAL QUESTIONNAIRE\n\n1.

We had a family of four children.\nI arrived in the spring of 1865 and of the wagon down stream but the men stayed with it and we got across all right. I rode in the car with the stock, it took us two days to get through. We had a time and came just until we had the heavy things unloaded from the car. Then I took my family's pack and buggy and went out to see my homeland before starting out with my loved. There was no road just a trail very faint at the far end, it was 35 miles, the ditches and creeks were all full and it was just out of one mudhole into another. We were told that 800 lbs was a good load for a team.\n\nI found I had been lucky enough to get one of the best quarters in the country but I went through a lot of country that I did not like the looks of before I got to it and I almost turned back several times.

My friend going North, South, and I South. Well, I was alone for the first 12 miles and got stuck in the mud several times, but by using a loggin's chain and some trimm unloading part of the load, I got through making the 12 mile trip.\n\nAbout 7 PM, I caught up with them again with two wagons and ox teams; they had left Idaho a whole day before me and had been across daylight that morning making about a mile. I helped them and by hitching six oxen on our wagon we pulled it back out of the mud. Then the owner tried again and pulled into a bad place again and stuck again, so we pulled him back again and in doing so turned the wagon over completely. We had to unload it and load up again. They were both unloaded, but would not leave any part of their loads along the road, so had been down 3 days of the matter. We finally got all three wagons across that place by about 10:30 PM and turned the oxen loose, built a campfire, had supper, and lay down to sleep.\n\nI traveled with three people half the next day making 5 or 6 miles, and felt much better.\nBeing satisfied that my load was good I went back to St. John where we loaded up our wagons and started out.

They had them and by hitching six over on an wagon we pulled it back out of the mud.

It took me two more days to get to my destination after being stuck many times and leaving part of my load on the road.\n19. How often did you write to relatives or friends in your old home?\n\nI planned on writing every two weeks but until we got a post office nearer than Shilo letters sometimes got held over awaiting for some neighbor to go to town to mail them.\n\n20. If you got married, give the name of your husband or wife along with the date and place of marriage.\n\nI was not married until 1925 when I went to England and was married to Ellen Phillips on May 25th, 1925 at the parish church Leigh Staffordshire.\n\n21. Did anyone else come to Saskatchewan because of your recommending it as a place to settle?\n\nAn aunt of mine came in 1910 and kept house for me for nearly two years. While she was here a cousin came, she taught school for a time and later married one of the neighbors. A young friend of my people came about the same time, he worked for me one summer and then took up land near Biggar.\n\n22. If other members of your family (brothers, sisters, parents, etc.) came West tell when they came and where they settled.\n\n23. Is there any particular experience of pioneer days that stands out in your memory which you would like to record?\n\nIn the early spring of 1905 I went to Shilo with the oxen and wagon to get 20 bushels of seed oats and 600 pounds of barley. I had intended going on the sleigh before the snow went, but snow went early that year and by March 26th the ground was bare but still frozen. I took the wagon, Mr. Wall who had a country store here, suggested that I should bring some supplies for him to make up a load, and help to pay the expenses of my trip. The load was good going, so I put on a load of about a ton. When I started out it got warm and the frost came on quickly, and soon the wagon was sinking 6 inches in the mud. One of the rear wheels was old and was completely out. I went back to Shilo and brought a yoke of young oxen, not well well broken. I put them on the wagon and tried to get behind, but soon broke the wagon tongue. After getting that fixed I decided I had too much load. I left the winch beside the road, and myself and the oxen at a house nearby, and went on ahead the rest of the load.\n\n24. Did you travel about much in the early years? (For business, attending church, visiting friends, etc.) How often? How far? By what means of travel?\n\nThe first three years I was here I went each harvest to work at Inglis, then two years and Balcarres. The first time I walked to Fort Macleod, then two years and Balcarres. In the spring of 1905 several of us went to look for a job on the railway, a neighbor drove to Lipton about 45 miles and then we got a job on the CPR and were then on a work train. We liked the work two of us left after a few days and walked up the grade to the end at Bulger hoping to get on a grading outfit, but there was nothing doing so we came west. North of Earl Grey station we waited for a few days with some friends. Then walked into Regina where we bought an oxen, grain and seed to go back. I walked to Shilo and lived there for growing and mail. But if I wanted much stuff, had to take the oxen and wagon.\nI got home on the Sunday having been away since Monday morning. After delivering my load to the store, I started back on Monday morning for the rest of the load which was only 2 miles out of Echo. When I got there I found the old ox dead, and someone had taken my win. I went to Echo to see the N.W.M.P., but they never found anything out about the win. A year or so later I found that a man had come along soon after I unloaded it, and picked it up. He followed me and stayed at the same place I did that night, but left his load some distance from the shack, saying his horses were played out, as well they might be, with 600 lbs extra on their load. It got away before my next morning so I never got a close look at his load. This man was supposed to be weak mentally. When he heard the police were on the job he sold the win to another homesteader and went back to the States. I never got the win back, and in consequence, wasn't able to fence my bit of crop. The range cattle ate it all as well as the hay I had just cut.\n\nI got home from that trip after another four days with only my oats. A most unpitiable start out for a young fellow.\nI got home on the Sunday having been away since Monday morning. After dinner I loaded the old oxen back on the Monday morning for the rest of the load which was only 4 miles out of town. When I got there I found the old oxen dead and someone had taken my win. I went on to see Mr. M.M.P. but they never found anything out about it. We came along soon after and found that a man had picked it up. He followed me and started past the same fellow. I did that night, but after his load came distance from the shocks, again his horse was played out, so we all they weight it, with 600 lbs extra on their load. It got away before we could get away on our own. We took another load. This man was supposed to be weak mentally. When he heard the patter was on the job he sold the oxen to another homesteader and went back to the flats. I never got the win back, and in consequence wasn't able to renew any bit of crop. The range cattle also call me when they heard your cry.\n\nI got home from that trip after another four days with only my ox. Almost impossible to tell you how I felt.\n25. When was the first car used in the community?\n   About 1914\n\n26. If you owned a car before 1914, when did you buy it? What make?\n\n27. Where was your trading center? How far from your home?\n   The town at first. In late 1904 or early 1905 Mr. Walt opened a country store about a mile from here. The main goods such as groceries, dry goods, and hardware, etc.\n\n28. Did you continue to trade there? (Indicate any changes due to new towns appearing, better means of travel, etc.)\n   In the winter of 1907-8 the railway was extended to Fountain Lake which was only 2 miles away. In 1908 the steel on the C.P.R. to the south of us was laid and Pellicer 15 miles away became our shipping point, and continued to be so for 20 years. All the C.P.R. branch from Fountain Lake that was built in 1923. When West Bend 5 miles away became our town, Pellicer had several stores, hardware, drug store, banks, blacksmiths, everything, implement agencies, etc., etc., etc.\n\n29. How often did you shop in the early days?\n   Two or three times a year, but when Walt had his store, most of the community gathered there on Sunday afternoons.\n\n30. When (if ever) did people in your district first start going to town regularly on Saturdays?\n   It has never become very well established. When cars became common about 1920 it became fairly general. Now at West Bend we have two trains a week Tuesday and Friday on mail days, so those are the days we go to town.\n\n31. When (if ever) did you first begin to buy through the mail order catalogues?\n   What kind of articles did you buy in this way? Indicate also what fraction of your total purchases were by mail order and any changes in the proportion of purchases made by mail order since the pioneer period.\n   I think we always bought most of our clothing by mail order, and practically all that. Some groceries have been bought by mail, and some from travelling salesmen who took orders, also some from peddlers (Watkins, Raleigh, etc.) but not to any very great extent. The Co-op stores seem to have put nearly an end to this now. But we still send to Eaton's for clothes.\n\n32. When did you first have a telephone and what company provided it?\n   We organized the Horne Lake Rural Telephone Co. This company also now joined with the Garnock Valley Co. before the Pellicer Co.\n\n33. When you came to Saskatchewan the first time was it with the idea of staying permanently? Or did you make up your mind after trying it out? When did you make this decision?\n   I intended to stay if I thought it good enough and was satisfied after a year, or a little more, that it was. Later after being completely frozen out, two years in succession, and making a number of other setbacks I began to have doubts, but it was too hard to leave them fortunately.\n25. When was the first car used in the community?\n\n26. If you owned a car before 1914, when did you buy it? What make?\n\n27. Where was your trading center? How far from your home?\n\n28. Did you continue to trade there? (Indicates any changes due to new terms appear-\n\ning, better means of travel, etc.)\n\n29. How often did you shop in the early days?\n\n30. When (if ever) did people in your district first start going to town regularly\n\non Saturdays?\n\n31. What kind of articles did you buy in this way? Indicate also what fraction of\n\nyour total purchases were by mail order and any changes in the proportion of\n\npurchases made by mail order since the pioneer period.\n\nI think we always bought our clothing by mail\n\norder, and for all other things bought by mail, and some from travelling salesmen who came\n\nalso from puddles (Walter, Puddleside) but\n\nnot from any general store. We got our own\n\nfrom puddles and to this man. But we all send\n\nto Eaton for clothes.\n\n32. When did you first have a telephone and what company provided it?\n\n33. Did you come to Saskatchewan the first time as a tourist or did you\n\nmake this decision?\n\nI intended to stay in Ontario for a good while and was\n\nsatisfied after a year or so. Later after buying completely\n\nmy own house in 1916 I decided to go back to Ontario\n\nagain to have a family, but it was then hard to leave them;\n\nfortunately.\nat very reasonable prices. He purchased all his supplies from Jack, who knew everyone. He paid $40 per cart.\n\nand remembered who was going to town was often glad of a job of bringing a load back.\nat very reasonable prices. He freighted all his supplies from Idaho by horse team or wagon. He paid $10 per cart, and homesteaders who were going to town were often glad of the job of bringing a load back.\n34. Did any people move away from your district prior to 1914? What reasons did they have for moving?\n\nQuite a number, most of them were men who had no intention of farming but thought proving up a homestead and selling was easy way of making money to start something else. They lived on the homestead long enough to get the patent, worked for wages the rest of the year. This sold or mortgaged as soon as possible.\n\n35. Did many people move away during the 1930s? Did many return?\n\nOnly a few, and these were made up of by people moving in from the dried out districts of southern Saskatchewan. There has been some relocation in the number of farms, to make way for larger farm units. People moving over mostly older people who went to B.C. and never came back. Some young ones went North to new farming land in Northern Saskatchewan.\n\n36. If you or some member of your family have held public office, or have been active in any organizations, mention it here, giving dates wherever possible.\n\nIn January 1907 I was elected one of the first trustees of Gilbert School District. I served until we had plans drawn up and called for tenders, then resigned as it was going away for the summer. Later in November 1911, I was secretary of the same district for a time. In 1926 I took part in organizing Tringly P.O. and was chairman of the board for three years and later took over as acting until the district became part of a larger unit.\n\n37. If you or any of your family or friends were \"first\" to have or do something in the district mention it here according to date wherever possible.

Kilker was named after the Chief Engineer of the C.B. Railroad at the time the C.B.R. built the main line through the town. Trove (Philo) West Bend was named after the original settlers of the area. But there was a man up with the name, and West Bend was given to the main settlement, and thus got West Bend. Later Ladstock had to be changed to Bankhead, which was the name of the School District there. Gilbert P.O. was called after Thomas Gilbert who helped to organize the district. The first meeting was supposed to choose their name for the Department and election from the three names and choose three names for the Department to elect one from; the three names chosen were Gilbert, Purdy's Bankhead. One of the organizer committee Gilbert was one of them. Finergy was organized and a number of our older members were chosen. The name was accepted almost immediately, and we found there was nothing else. Nearby the Finch, the first postmaster. Bremerton got its name from Mr. Wynn who was the first settler who came from Yorkshire.\n34. Did any people move away from your district prior to 1914?

Did many return?\n\nOnly a few, and these were made up for by people moving in from the dried out districts of southern Saskatchewan. There has been some reduction in the number of farms, to make way for larger farm units. I know leaving even elderly older people who went to B.C. and never came back. Some young ones went North to new farming land in Northern Sask.\n\n36.

Winkler branch, bend to the West, it was first called Ladstock, after an old P.O. just west of them, but then was a mix-up with the names, and Ladstock was given to the next siding and this got West Bend. Later Ladstock had taken charge to Bankhead which was the name of the School District then. Gilbert S.D. was called after Thomas Gilbert who helped to organize the district. The first meeting was supposed to choose three names for the Department to select one from, the three names sent in were Gilbert, Reddy, Baker. Through the organizer committee Gilbert was chosen. Timflay was organized much later taking parts of four older districts. Then came hot arguments about it, and feelings ran high, so Timflay. Beckenham P.O.
