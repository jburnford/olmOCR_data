Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include items not mentioned above, quality, methods of merchandising, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. (Use back of page if more space is needed). This information asked for is mostly dealt with in the foregoing replies to questions asked. One of the first great detriments to early settlement was the fact that the Canadian Pacific Railway gave a monopoly of all their cars to grain companies who would not did build elevators on their sidings. This put us settlers at the mercy of the grain dealers combine or grain exchange. It is not too much to say that we settlers were robbed of several cents a bushel on every bit of grain we sold. A farmer could not get a car at any station where an elevator had been erected. The sale of cattle also was in the hands of a monopoly headed by the Gordon Brothers Co. They never got the value of our breed. We had to keep all steers till three years old and the most we got was $1.50 for an animal that would dress 800 lbs. This along with the high freight rates and high cost of alfalfa supplies made the years of early settlement a period of poverty. It has been partly overcome by organized cooperatives. But much remains to be done, but will not be done until the political parties are cleansed by the election of men of principle.\n\nJohn Evans\n20. What did you do to improve your diet?\n\n21.
