WATER SUPPLY\n\nThere did you get water for drinking and for cooking? (Well, river, slough, dugout) ........................................... Dug well, only 12 feet deep.\n\nHow far was this water from your home? ........................................... 40 feet.\n\nHow was it brought to the house? (pail, barrel, tank) ........................................... pail, and pulled out of well by pail on a rope.\n\nRegarding water supply, mention any changes which have taken place since you first started housekeeping, giving dates where possible.\n\nWe left homestead in 1909, most people have deep wells now with pump and power, and in many cases farms homes have water system in.\n13. SOAP\n\nDid you buy laundry soap or make your own? ................. wood ashes\n\nIf you made your own, did you use lye? Yes ........... wood ashes? No ...........\n\nWhat kinds of laundry soap did the grocer handle? Royal Brown Soap\n\n14. FUEL\n\nWhat fuel did you use in the earliest days? Poplar wood\n\nWhere did you get your fuel? On and near homestead\n\nMention any changes in the use of fuels which have taken place since you first started housekeeping, giving dates where possible. In wooded areas many people still burn wood, with some coal in winter for heating. Generally speaking, coal is used most both in town and farm homes since 1910. Today many use oil for heating, also natural gas in areas where there is a supply. The more modern homes use electricity especially for cooking and this use is increasing as power lines are extended in the rural areas.\n\n15. METHODS OF COOKING AND TYPES OF UTENSILS\n\nFor cooking, did you use an indoor fireplace or open hearth in the earliest days? (Give dates) No\n\nDid you use an outdoor fireplace or bake oven? (Give dates) No\n\nBy whom was your first cook stove made? Mrs. McCrary\n\nWhat year was it purchased? 1905 Price? Second hand?\n\nWhat types of utensils did you use? (Iron, copper, tin, homemade) ..........\n\nHad some of old type iron pots, some tin\n\nFor preparing food? (china, earthenware, wooden bowls, other) Some wooden bowls, some earthenware\n\nWhen did you first see enamel ware? Think about 1900\n\nAluminum? 1910 nearly all tin or Iron before these dates\n16. WRAPPINGS AND CONTAINERS\n\nMention any changes which you recall in the wrappings and containers associated with the food you purchased (give dates where possible).\n\nMost food was in the bulk, and was put into paper bags and if necessary wrapped them in strong brown wrapping paper and tied with parcel string. The fancy containers and cans started to come in about 1910.\n\n17. Give a typical day's menu (breakfast, dinner & supper) for the earliest year you can remember. Give the year and list the members of the family with their ages at the time. State the approximate month, e.g., winter or summer.\n\nBorn in Manitoba 1886 my early life spent 60 miles north east of Winnipeg in ranching country. As I remember breakfast did not vary much. Porridge, fried potatoes, meat, Bread & Butter Milk, Tea, or Coffee. Dinner beef, pork fish or wild game, rice or tapioca pudding, Bread & Butter, Vegetable Syrup, Milk, Tea, Coffee. Supper, Bread & butter, Syrup, Jam sometimes a cake, not often. Plain wholesome food and lots of it. This was so in the 80s and 90s. Dad and Mother and seven kids.\n\n18. What year did you serve your first Christmas dinner in eastern Canada?\n\n................... Give the menu. List those present and give their approximate ages at that time.\n\nI ate my first Xmas dinner in Manitoba and if I remember right we had either Beef, Turkey, Chicken, Plum pudding and all the trimmings. My dad and Mother and one sister. I served my first Xmas dinner the year I was married 1906. On the Homestead at Nealsdale, Sask (near Watson) Just my Husband and I. My Mother in Law sent us a hamper from Winnipeg, Turkey, Plum Pudding candies, nuts etc.\n\n19. Were you ever reduced to almost starvation level living on one or two locally produced foods? Give details. No, never! We always had plenty to eat, when I was a kid at home in Manitoba, and after I married and lived on the Homestead for 3 years. Mostly just plain food, lots of it, and mostly raised on the farm. We hadn't money to buy fancy things. We had exactly $10.00 in cash when we started on the Homestead. My husband and I made hay (prairie wool) all summer 1906 and that fall many settlers came in and needed feed to winter their stock we sold about 100 loads at $2.00 a load. We were well away.\n16.

Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today. My early years were spent on ranch and farm, and of course the cooking was plain and wholesome (no hundred and one kinds of canned goods, which of course are handy today to cook up a meal quickly, canned soup, canned meat or fish, minute puddings, etc.). Breakfast is so different today. Fruit Juice, (can) Bran Flakes, etc., Toast coffee. The old days Porridge, (Oatmeal, not rolled oats, took at least half an hour to cook.) Then meat, maybe cold, or ham and eggs (both raised on farm), and fried potatoes, also raised on farm, coffee, tea or milk. Dinner, again a substantial meal, Roast or fried Beef, Pork, Fish, Puddings in those days, not so many pies as today, and always the syrup Jug, morning, Noon and night. Home made bread (today probably 50% of farmers buy bakers bread). Meat of some kind again for supper (imagine people anywhere having meat 3 times a day now). Better Now? Some things yes, others no.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of home grown and home prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible). About 1910, but of course the quantity of canned and prepared foods have increased over the years from that time until today, and the change has been gradual from home grown and home prepared foods, to the purchased and prepared foods; I still bake my own bread, we like it better than bakers. I still bake my own pies and cakes, and can some fruit. But gradually we fall in line with the big majority, and there is a larger pile of cans to be moved from the back yard every month end.\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include items not mentioned above, quality, methods of merchandising, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. (Use back of page if more space is needed). Actually people did not buy much in the way of \"store\" food in the old Homestead days: Main list for the store on the five or six times a year trip to town was flour, tea or Coffee, sugar, syrup, salt and Coal oil. Most people were trying to get \"a start\" and hadn't much money to spend on luxuries. The main diet was meat and vegetables raised on the farm, supplemented by game, deer & rabbits in winter and ducks, chickens, prairie & Gesees in summer & fall. I think perhaps the quality of goods were better on the whole in the early days, particularly clothing and boots, and of course the price of these were much lower than today. One could buy a good suit of clothes for $15.00, pair overalls 75\u00a2 to $1.25. Fair work boots $1.75 and a new coat $5.00 for a pair of \"best\" shoes, it was the height of extravagance. Quality of foods and groceries were about the same as today but much cheaper. Coffee 18 to 20\u00a2 today $1.00. Sugar 5\u00a2/lb today 13\u00a2. Display of goods is quite a feature today, shelf, window, and showcase. Service is a feature today also, you're no sooner in the store and a salesman or lady instantly appears with the question \"may I help you\"? There was none of this 50 years ago. The problem of storage was not great, we had (just my husband and I) a one room shack, a hole in the ground, and a trap door was the cellar where vegetables were stored. All else was stored in the one room, bed room, kitchen, dining, sitting, reception and bath room (12x16) 2 or 3 100 sacks of flour and a 100 sack sugar in one corner; coffee, rice, beans etc on a rough board shelf or cupboard in square tin boxes which would hold about 10 lbs. and were...\nwere safe from the mice, other small articles and dishes were on this shelf or cupboard (we had no china cabinet). The 5 gallon conical can stood in a corner. On yes the table was a large packing box in which had been stored between two chairs and a double bed and that was it. So you see there was really no storage problem to speak of. As regards shortages there just didn't seem to be any. We had lots of good plain food, lots of appetite, lots of hard work, lots of sunshine and lots of happiness, and lots of time to live. That was the slow age.\n\nJust as fast or faster. Live fast, drive fast, get fast if you're not lucky. Worry about income tax, sales tax, education tax and poll tax, you worry about militarism, communism, socialism, fascism, life and all the improvements of modern science.\nwere safe from the mice, other small articles and dishes were on this shelf or cupboard (we had no china cabinet). The 5 gallon coal oil can stood in a corner. Oh yes the table was a large packing box in which had been built shelves to take care of small articles in daily use. Two chairs and a double bed and that was it. So you see there was really no storage problem to speak of. As regards shortages there just didn't seem to be any. We had lots of good plain food, lots of appetite, lots of hard work, lots of sunshine and lots of happiness, and lots of time to live. That was the slow age. I liked it. Today it's the fast age, make money fast, spend it just as fast or faster. Live fast, drive fast, die fast if you're not lucky. Worry about income tax, sales tax, education tax and poll tax. You worry about Militaryism, Communism, socialism, fascism, and ATOMIC BOMBS, and you just haven't time to relax and enjoy life and all the improvements of modern science.\nNo. 613 S\n\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8\nOxford\n\nNo. 613 S\n\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jessylee/PioneerQuestionnairesPDFs//PioneerQuestionnaires_No.1-DietQuestionnaires_Box12937_1906M-Q_199.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 22, "total-input-tokens": 36520, "total-output-tokens": 7522, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 2], [0, 1772, 3], [1772, 4067, 4], [4067, 5564, 5], [5564, 7139, 6], [7139, 8828, 7], [8828, 8828, 8], [8828, 13246, 9], [13246, 14805, 10], [14805, 18392, 11], [18392, 18392, 12], [18392, 19903, 13], [19903, 19903, 14], [19903, 22173, 15], [22173, 24418, 16], [24418, 28078, 17], [28078, 28078, 18], [28078, 28878, 19], [28878, 29849, 20], [29849, 29996, 21], [29996, 30150, 22]], "primary_language": ["None", "None", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, true, true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]}}]
