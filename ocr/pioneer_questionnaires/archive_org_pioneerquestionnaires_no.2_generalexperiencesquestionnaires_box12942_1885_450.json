Lindeburgh Weldon V.\n\nTo Sask. - April, 1885\n\nPIONEER EXPERIENCES: A GENERAL QUESTIONNAIRE\n\nNo. 2\n\nA word of explanation to the person answering this questionnaire:\n\nIt is difficult to prepare a general questionnaire on pioneer life because no individual who has lived to answer it has exactly the same experiences or views. Some of the questions here will not apply to your experience; others may prove impossible for you to answer, so don't worry about not being able to answer all the questions. If there is anything you would like to add, or if they help to answer the questions.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who have lived in Western Canada before 1914 and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not. If more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires:\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1 entitled \"Western Life\" has already been sent to you and would be willing to do so please mark the ones you would be willing to answer.\n\nAll Questionnaires (unanswered)\n\n- Pioneer health conditions\n- Pioneer social life, sports and recreation\n- Pioneer housing\n- Pioneer education and churchwork\n- Pioneer farming experience\n\nPreservation of Questionnaires:\n\nAll questionnaires will be preserved in the Saskatchewan Archives Board Office at the University of Saskatchewan as part of the permanent record of our province.

They were assisted by kind friends and neighbors. Among these was Mr. John W. Weldon, of Keokuk, Iowa, who came to Indian Head in 1857.\n\nQuahalla Valley, Indian Head, Kansas.\nIn the early days the main lines were divided into two classes: Passenger and Freight. The latter were operated by several companies, including the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railroad, the Illinois Central Railroad, and the Chicago & Alton Railroad.\n\nThe former included the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad, the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad, and the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railroad.\n\nFreight was handled by the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railroad, the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad, and the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad.\n\nPassenger service was provided by the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railroad, the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad, and the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad.\n\nThe Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railroad was the largest of the three companies, with over 1,000 miles of track. The Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad had approximately 800 miles of track, while the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad had around 600 miles of track.\n\nThe Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railroad was known for its fast trains, which could reach speeds of up to 70 mph. The Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad was known for its scenic routes, which included the famous \"Scenic Route\" between Chicago and St. Louis. The Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad was known for its efficient freight service, which included the use of diesel locomotives.\n\nIn conclusion, the early days of railroading in Illinois were characterized by competition among several companies, each with its own unique strengths and weaknesses. The Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railroad was the largest and fastest, while the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad was known for its scenic routes. The Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad was known for its efficient freight service.\nOxford\n\nNo. 613 S\n\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8\nOxford\n\nNo. 613 S\n\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jessylee/PioneerQuestionnairesPDFs//PioneerQuestionnaires_No.2-GeneralExperiencesQuestionnaires_Box12942_1885_450.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 24, "total-input-tokens": 39840, "total-output-tokens": 3988, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 4], [0, 1678, 5], [1678, 1678, 6], [1678, 2581, 7], [2581, 3367, 8], [3367, 4160, 9], [4160, 4977, 10], [4977, 5683, 11], [5683, 6515, 12], [6515, 7073, 13], [7073, 7572, 14], [7572, 8306, 15], [8306, 8883, 16], [8883, 8883, 17], [8883, 10208, 18], [10208, 10907, 19], [10907, 10907, 20], [10907, 11163, 21], [11163, 13045, 22], [13045, 13200, 23], [13200, 13354, 24]], "primary_language": ["None", "None", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]}}]
