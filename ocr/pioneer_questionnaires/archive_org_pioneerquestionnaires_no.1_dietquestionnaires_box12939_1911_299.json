(Use back of page if more space is needed).\n\nBuying governed strictly by prevailing prices which were generally far less than present times.\nAlthough earning capacities were restricted 40 years ago,\nit was possible to live fairly comfortably on income from labor and farming operations.\nWe asked no credit buying, and during summer periods of working out on farms, counted ourselves fairly secure for winter provisions on homestead with from $50 to $80 according to extent of family. (Possible need of medical aid was discounted, as a luxury)\nSmall trading with belts, seneca root and horse hair supplemented the lender. Many pioneers had ice wells for summer storage, and smoke houses for curing.\nMuch homemade furniture was in evidence.\nQuality of merchandise compared very favorably with those of present days. Perhaps not so attractively displayed but nevertheless dependable and wholesome.\nLittle need for government controls or subsidies.\nShortages, if any, were anticipated adequately by reason and experience, in regard to distance from buying centres.\nNever relied greatly on prepared purchased foods.\n\nThere were rendered more convenient as family members and local home (Cam 1935).\n\nSmall quantities were then sufficient for our needs, with resultant freshness, and varied diets.\n\nCanned vegetables & fruits.\n\nPressure Cookers\n\nBakery Mixes.\n\nQuick freeze products.\n\n21.
