Give details.\n\nI always had enough to eat, but there were times when the quality was very poor. I remember one particular winter when the potatoes were very bad.\n20. Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today. Early days we grew good gardens tried to produce all we could because we had no money to buy while baked our own bread also eggs when ever we had one, canned our vegetables & fruits. Did not buy much more than tea & coffee. Relied more on our own resources for a living.\n\nToday hardly a woman in this district lacks her garden. They can get a calf, pig & beef up. But nowadays much garden can buy at vegetables in cans also canned fruit of all kinds. After two canned meat. (Not afraid) canned pork & beans in cans go to the butcher shop for meat. Hardly ever lacks of any meat. Killing store own meat. Shipwreck ever arrived. They have to depend for them buy there meat in much easier way. Hardly any farmer needs a cow buys bottled milk or in cans.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homegrown and home prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible). We have never relied much on prepared foods have our little garden stills costs to prepare our own food as much as possible. Since the 30's we have had fairly good crops in this district & so many seem now to rely on purchased foods & prepared foods rather than home prepared foods.\n\n22.
