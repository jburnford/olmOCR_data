The school was built by the citizens of the town and was dedicated to the memory of Mr. and Mrs. Smith, who had recently passed away.\n\nThe school was located on the corner of Main Street and Church Street. It was a two-story building with a large auditorium on the second floor. The school was attended by students from all over the town and was considered to be one of the best schools in the state.\n\nThe school was closed in 1950 due to declining enrollment. The building was sold to a private developer who converted it into an apartment complex. Today, the building stands as a reminder of the rich history of the town of Newburyport.\nPage 1, Document 23.\n\nThe year 1890 was a most memorable one. Firstly, the organization of the school district and opening of the school, then the arriving of the Gordon family, Mr. F.B. Gordon who arrived in 1885, followed by Mr. W.M. Gordon, who came three years later. These Gordon family moved into the old, red-roofed house, which may have been built by Mr. Gordon himself, now converted into the schoolhouse, into a real community center. The Gordon family became the heart and soul of the town, providing a sense of belonging and community spirit.\n\nThe schoolhouse was a small, one-room building, with a large porch in front. It was built by Mr. Gordon himself, using local materials such as pine and cedar. The walls were made of logs, and the roof was covered with shingles. The schoolhouse was a simple structure, but it served its purpose well.\n\nThe following winter, 1890-91, we had a big public program at the schoolhouse, which lasted two hours and included a band concert, a speech by Mr. Gordon, and a musical performance by the school children. It was a memorable event, and it marked the beginning of a new era for the town.\n\nThe schoolhouse continued to serve the community until 1910, when it was replaced by a larger building. Today, it stands as a reminder of the past, a symbol of the hard work and dedication of those who built it.\nPay (2)\n\nAt Question and 23.\n\nFor Indiana-1816 furnaces.
