Some of the questions here will not apply to your experiences; others may prove impossible for you to answer, so don't worry about leaving blank spaces. Use extra sheets of paper if there is not sufficient space to answer the questions. Don't hesitate to give details, or describe particular events, if they help to answer the questions.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1914, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nSaskatchewan Archives questionnaires which have been prepared or projected are listed below.

The night was black, the rain pouring down & we were on burnt prairie so could see nothing. Rather than try to go further we unhitched the team & tied them to the back of the wagon & we crawled underneath & stayed there all night. I can hear the coyotes now as I recall it & I surely felt a very lonely person that night of May 15th 1906 I believe.\n\n24. Did you travel about much in the early years? (for business, attending church, visiting friends, etc.) How often? How far? By what means of travel?\n   We always travelled by horse & buggy usually but I did pay a visit one time with an ox hitched on to a stone boat over the snow. Church was held in neighbour's houses, & we used to travel for a while (this was before I was married) 5 miles to get our stock of groceries from Mandal to Davidson.\n25.
