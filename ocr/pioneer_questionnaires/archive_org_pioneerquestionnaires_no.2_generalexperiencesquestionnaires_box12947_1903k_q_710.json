Bocking\nAssistant Provincial Archivist\nA word of explanation to the person answering this questionnaire\n\nIt is difficult to prepare a general questionnaire on pioneer life because no individual who is asked to answer it has exactly the same experiences as another. Some of the questions here will not apply to your experiences; others may prove impossible for you to answer, so don't worry about leaving blank spaces. Use extra sheets of paper if there is not sufficient space to answer the questions. Don't hesitate to give details, or describe particular events, if they help to answer the questions.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1914, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nSaskatchewan Archives questionnaires which have been prepared or projected are listed below.\n\nPlease mark the ones you would be willing to answer.\n\nAll questionnaires\n- Pioneer diet\n- Pioneer schools\n- Pioneer churches\n- Pioneer recreation and social life\n- Pioneer farming experiences\n- Fortitude in Saskatchewan\n- Pioneer health and housing\n\nPreservation of Questionnaires\n\nAll questionnaires will be preserved in the Office of the Saskatchewan Archives at the University of Saskatchewan as part of the permanent record of our Province.
