I am quite fond of Ottawa.\n\nOn the north side of the SW 1/4 of Sec. 26 in 1914, there was a 1914 stone (chamotte) on the ground. The month was covered with snow at this time, but the digging was away from the mouth quite far.\n\nThis away we could see the mouth quite far.\n\nI think it was the China Building. That day, I went to Regina for the museum in 1905.\n\nI heard the station (around 1905) would be built.\n\nThe hill facing the amphitheater is too high.\n\nThat this might be of interest to you.\n\nThat this might be of interest to you.\nOffice of the Saskatchewan Archivist\n\nMarch 27, 1955\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am writing you a letter today. I have thought of something I thought to tell you about. This was in 1944.\n\nOn the north end of my property, the month was covered with snow. We could only see the top of earth. But by digging, we could see the inside of earth. We could see the moon quite far away.\n\nI think it was Mr. Chas. Wooding that day. He said it was Regina for the museum in 1945.\n\nI heard the station (Amund Quilling) said to have been destroyed on that date. It was no accident. Hundreds of people would have witnessed it, so it was a total loss.\n\nThe hill facing the south is another smaller hill during the fall and winter.\n\nI think this might be of interest to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Office,\nUniversity of Saskatchewan,\nSaskatoon, Saskatchewan.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been writing you a while ago, I have thought of something I forgot to tell you. On the north east side of sec. 32, T. 26, R. 11, 2 there was a homesteaded SW \u00bc of SW \u00bc of first peer of 1914. We could only see the eyes (more) the mouth was covered with two or three inches of earth & roots but by digging this away we could see the mouth quite plain.\n\nI think it was Mrs. Glass Woodbury that dug it up & sent it to Regina for the museum in 1905.\n\nI heard the doctor (Howard Duvall) said it had human sacrifices on that store & it was no situated hundreds of people could have witnessed it, as it was on top of the hill facing the south another smaller hill facing it like an amphitheater.
