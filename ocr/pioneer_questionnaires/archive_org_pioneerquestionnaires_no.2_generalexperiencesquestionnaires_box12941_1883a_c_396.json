However, we are not able to attend as our eldest son Dr. Lawrence S. Chipperfield of New Westminster, British Columbia is arriving the next day by air to Saskatoon and we have arranged to meet him there by car and he will spend four days with us here.\n\nWe may say for your information that Mrs. Chipperfield arrived in Saskatchewan in May 1882, she came as an infant with her family. They came with ox team by wagons from Brandon and it took them four weeks to make the trip. The homestead her father obtained at the time is only about one mile from the present village of Lorlie. Mrs. Chipperfield lived on the farm until our marriage in 1907.\n\nThe writer came from Essex England in May 1883 and my father entered for his homestead on May 31st, 1883. This homestead was only a few miles west of Lemberg. He put up a tent on the farm which we lived in until about the 15th of November, by that time he had erected a log house with a sod roof. He had not had any experience in England building with logs so he had help from Mr. W.R. Motherwell who was afterwards the Minister of Agriculture for Saskatchewan and afterwards for the Dominion. In checking over one of my father's diaries, in October 1883 there was an entry of about $12.00 paid to Mr. Motherwell as labor on the house. In our trip from England, my father, mother, sister and myself got off the train at Indian Head and were treated very kindly by a family named Liggettes, the two families have been friends ever since.\n\nIn 1887 my father applied and obtained a Post Office at his farm home and was named Chickney after his old home in England. Later on a committee applied for a public school which was obtained and the following were the first trustees: Chairman, Samuel Chipperfield; Secretary, Henry Dixon; Treasurer, Mr. A.B. Ferrier. My father for a short time was a local J.P. He was also associated with the late John Teece and William Dixon in conducting religious services in some of the homes in the Chickney district.\n\nAbout eighteen years after arrival the writer conducted a general store on a portion of land that belonged to my father's homestead, later opened a branch at Lemberg which was sold to Mr. Henry Aldous. In 1907 the writer moved to Kelowna and in December 1908 moved to Hubbard. We conducted a general store and Real Estate business there and in later years the writer's two sons Eric and Jim were associated with myself in the store business. In 1948 all our interest in Hubbard was sold. Eric and Jim bought a business in Minnedosa, Manitoba and the writer moved to Prince Albert and is now conducting a Real Estate and Insurance business.\nThe Mayor of Lemberg,\nLemberg, Sask.\n\nDear Friend:\n\nMany thanks for the kind invitation sent to Mrs. Chipperfield and myself to attend your Old Times' Banquet on the 29th instant.\n\nWe are both old timers, Mrs. Chipperfield at Lemberg and myself at Chitchev.

He had not had any experience in building with logs so he had help from Mr. R. Northover who was afterwards the Minister of Agriculture for Saskatchewan and afterwards the Hon. A.E. Forrester. My father for a short time was a local U.T.F. He was also associated with the late John Teede and William Dixon in conducting religious services in some of the homes in the Chitchev district.\n\nIn 1887 my father applied and obtained a Post Office at his farm house and was named Chitchev after his old home in England.

Forrester. My father for a short time was a local U.T.F. He was also associated with the late John Teede and William Dixon in conducting religious services in some of the homes in the Chitchev district.\n\nAbout eighteen years after arrival the writer conducted a general store on a portion of land that belonged to my father's homestead. Later he opened a branch at Lemberg which was sold to Mr. Henry Allman. In 1907 the writer moved to Lemberg and in December 1908 moved to Hubbard. We conducted a general store and hall for the business there and in later years the writer's two sons Kyle and Jim were associated with myself in the store business. In 1948 all our interest in Hubbard was sold. Kyle and Jim bought a business in Minnedosa, Manitoba and the writer moved to Prince Albert and is now conducting a Real Estate and Insurance business.\nWe had six sons; Lawrence Samuel the eldest is a Medical Doctor at New Westminster, British Columbia, this year he was elected President of the College of Physicians and Surgeons for the Province of British Columbia; our second son John Norman died when he was 25, if he could have gone to University one more year he would have had his degree; our third son Eric Sydney as I stated before in Minnedosa, Manitoba; Donald Victor is a Medical Doctor in Prince Albert; James Hubert in addition to his share of business in Minnedosa has been Mayor of the town since 1951, he is also the President of the association of Urban Municipalities for the Province of Manitoba; Gordon Wesley is a Medical Doctor at Taber, Alberta.\n\nWe wish to take this opportunity of wishing all our old friends in your district a very happy and prosperous future.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPer\nThe Mayor of Lethbridge, Continued\n\nJune 22nd, 1955\n\nWe had six Hon.
