Some of the questions will not apply to your experience; others may prove impracticable. If your answers are not applicable, please write an explanation or statement of your experience, or describe particular events if they help to answer the questions.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1911, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer Plots: What Did Western Canadian Pioneers Get?\" is still being circulated. If you have not already answered this, and would be willing to do so, please put a check mark here (X) and one will be sent to you.\n\nSaskatchewan Archives questionnaires on other subjects will be prepared at a later date. Some of these are listed below. Please mark the ones you would be willing to answer.\n\n[X] All questionnaires\n[X] Pioneer health conditions\n[X] Pioneer social life, sports and recreation\n[X] Pioneer housing and churchwork\n[X] Pioneer farming experience\n\nPreservation of Questionnaires\n\nAll questionnaires will be preserved in the Saskatchewan Archives Board's Office at the University of Saskatchewan as part of the permanent record of our Province. Please send your completed questionnaires to:\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Office,\nUniversity of Saskatchewan,\nSaskatoon, Sask.\nMcGannel, Mrs. Neil\n1823 Victoria Ave., Regina.\n\nTo Sask. - April, 1953\n\nPIONEER EXPERIENCES: A GENERAL QUESTIONNAIRE\n\nIt is desirable to prepare a general questionnaire on pioneer life because no individual who is asked to answer it has exactly the same experiences as another. Some of the questions will apply to every experience while others may prove impossible for pioneers who came from certain localities or who had special experiences. It is therefore suggested that each person should answer only those questions which apply to his own experience.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1914, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in the province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer Pasts That Did Not Vanish,\" and will be sent to you.\n\nWestern Canadian Pioneers Questionnaire No. 2, entitled \"Pioneer Pasts That Did Vanish,\" and will be sent to you.\n\nPreservation of Questionnaires\n\nAll questionnaires will be preserved in the Saskatchewan Archives Board Office at the University of Saskatchewan as part of the permanent record of our Province.
