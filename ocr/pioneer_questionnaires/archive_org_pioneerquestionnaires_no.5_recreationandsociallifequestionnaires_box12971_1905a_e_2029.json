For example, wheat, beans, potatoes, and various vegetables were grown by the settlers who brought them with them.\n\n6. How was the invitation to a meal worded when people had come unexpectedly? The term \"take potluck\" used, or some other expression that was common? Everyone was welcomed anytime, at the time the host was formally invited. The hostess was always invited first. Generally, the meal was prepared by the hostess, and she would sit down and wait for the guests, usually women, not men, because the kitchen work was more\u7e41icult.\n\n7.

Other building the first organized was 1907, building bees still washed in 1912-14, since my return in 1928. Only one such affair that was house was destroyed, and one little child was abandoned.

The host would make the cake, pie, meat sandwiches, etc., within six miles radius, bring his horses to warn them of our house. The host would meet us there to assist in anything necessary. They would clear the moving furniture, lights, stove, piping, and arrange rooms to suit everyone's comfort.\n\nThe dances varied in type, becoming more popular in newspapers than in homes today. We had parties that were more like programs, such as street parties and stockades. We still had parties for a few years after 1918, now they are rare.

Around the room on tables were garlic, onions, apples, potatoes, vegetables, they were solid and secure and safe. The floor was in good order to clean up. Then, someone from the party, and another one arrived, and they knew someone, from about five o'clock. All people assembled, after the little chin in the old Dolan Robins started the ball rolling.

This was an event at each meeting in succession. Proper was read on different recipes, notes on the needy, and help needed.

We also had bullfights, boxing matches, and many other things.\n\nWhat means were commonly used by organizations for raising money? Many means were used for raising money, for equipment and supplies for the school, desert trips, and charity work. We had auctions, raffles, and other events.

The most interesting lecture I attended was a spontaneous talk given by a former student who had attended the school room for only two times for a short time. He spoke about his experiences abroad. The day was beautiful, the audience was large. The missionary had arrived early and was standing at the back of the hall. No one present knew him, but it turned out he was a volunteer who had come to help the school. He spoke about his experiences and the students were very interested.

Spreading the word of the Gospel was one of the main purposes of these shows.\n\nWhat were the slides about? They were about the lives lost through famine, pictures of human living skeletons, and the relief work of the foreign missions. The slides were very instructive to the poor, who ill the sick and dying, closely packed and famine was everywhere.

Sometimes a false agent would drop a little money on the roadside, at close range sometimes a false agent would drop a little money on the roadside, across the road, across the road, and then the money would be dropped again.\n\nWhat games did girls play in summer (skipping rope, play house, etc.)? Girls were enterbed into many of the yes they had their games too. Skipping rope, hide and seek, blind man's buff, but in this case the girls played in boys' games too. But in winter they made a game of hide and seek by preparing lunch at noon time warming soup and drinks and getting warm meal roasting potatoes and apples. They proved good housekeepers.\n18.

There were many such songs in it. We met every Sunday morning, we sang at the church and the club. It became the concert party and was sought to take part in nearly all social affairs. It was built up to a membership of 17-8-9-0. This eventually became the Parkdale Amateur and Concert Association. It took part of the area known as Minnehaha and Parkdale N.E. and W. About 1912 each dissociated itself there. However, there was also organized a sports club, organized mostly at Minnehaha and Parkdale mothers from east west, and north joined in the effort.

Describe any features of this picnic which you remember as outstanding.\n\nThe thing outstanding feature that impresses my mind was the fortitude of the people themselves. Their high ideals, their courage and determination, carrying homes and possessions across the prairie, and into the new and fertile lands. Great fields transformed from waste lands, trail blazers opening up their trails from settlement to settlement connecting these to main trails leading to school houses, churches, post offices, towns. The old trail blazers, though far from the old times of those times left, but their monument will live for posterity. To remember them, the determination of these settlers against adversity will remain. Year after year, the land grows, the trees grow, and they go up to meet the stars of maturity. Then one fine, clear looking morning, you would wake up with a white frost covering all within sight. Frozen beyond meaning were the great homesteads, the proud homes of the year. Standing in the midst of this was the invincible features written on the tablets of the hearts, or those pioneers of long ago. Impressive, yes!\n\n34.

What changes have you noticed in picnics since the first years? If possible, give dates when changes became noticeable.\n\nThe old time picnics were essentially family affairs. The spirit of close friendship and intimate acquaintance was securely bonded by the old settlers' social styles. In other words, success was secured to the settler after the first world war, when the recession of prosperity of the settlers volunteered for service with the expeditionary forces. On my return in 1919, the most noticeable change was noted in the vast vacancy caused by the absence of the young men who had gone overseas. Now there was a great shortage of young men in the countryside. Some of them had returned, but many more had deserted and in their place came the vanquished German immigrants who had saved their lives. The war was over, but the monumental roll of the dead (names) has been struck away, and the monument is cracking. The inscription \"Let us forget\" and \"Captain C. Bell's\" is disappearing. It is now only a shadow on the field.\n\nDescribe the games which were popular in your community in the early years, telling who took part in the various games and sports (men, women, mostly young people).\n\nThe early settlers joined in all the sportive events. Teddy Rinkers, Alex Geer, Lou Grimes, Cyling Smith, Nelson Prior, Eli Pateman, Bob Thompson, Art Pashwill, those men who played a big part in making the country a successful settlement. Here and overseas, many others too made the supreme sacrifice. From the race track, the man race, the horse race, the cow race, helped to turn homesteads into dream lands. Sports ground, and clearly marked out in the countryside, and all those who were left to carry on. Oh God let us never forget.\n\n36. For what game was the first team organized in your community to play against neighboring teams?

Until 1918 when other teams were formed from the towns along the branch line.\n\n37. Name any other sports teams that were organized before 1914, giving date of organization if possible, and tell something of their activities - played against teams from neighboring towns, played at local sports days, entered in competitions in larger centres, etc.\n\nAll the sports teams were taken over by the villages. Along the line of the C.N.R., Meota, Vawn, Edam, Mervin, and Turtleford these villages were 25 to 35 miles distant from Pordele area, so teams were organized by the villagers. At sports days, country teams would play villages. It was scratch teams not organized and was played at nearest point as the railroad reached those points.\n\n38. Tell when the first outdoor rink was built in your community, and what it was used for (hockey, curling, etc.).

Both were asked to appear they spoke of the community spirit, and did not in any way touch on political affairs. So that broke the community spirits up for good.\n64. Has anyone from your community become well known or famous in the musical world? Give names and dates and places of public appearances.\n\n65. Is music as important or less important in your community now as compared with the early days? What is the reason for this change?\n\n66. Do you have any \"collections\", such as stamps, stones, paintings, signatures, arrowheads, etc.? No hobbies! No collections for myself, I collect for others. Stamps, and coins for my brother-in-law, but not to any degree of notoriety.\n\nGive details of this collection, telling when you started it, how you became interested in it, any outstanding events connected with it, and a description of the collection.\n\n67. Did you make notes of the weather, time of arrival of birds, blooming time of trees, etc.? Yes, generally in the old days kept notes on the weather, time of departure, and arrival of birds, migration of birds, time of bursting buds, appearance of barnacle gull, the popping up of the ground, the first thunder's appearance, the first wheat, and barley, the first signs of life, to the heavenly first and last frosts and snowballs, the rainfall, tempests, storms, winds, and other disturbances. For years I have kept them carefully, by my records I know what has happened.\n\n68. Describe other hobbies or special interests of yours not already mentioned.\n\n69. Is there anyone in your community who is well-known for any of these hobbies, or for others such as photography, bird-watching, etc.? Not that I know of. There was a young man who had a hobby of collecting in connection with his study of flora and fauna. He was a keen naturalist.\n\n70. Describe any outstanding features or incidents of social life, games, entertainment, sports, reading, music of pioneer days, not already mentioned.\n\n(Use back of page, or extra sheets if necessary). The most outstanding incident was the community sports held on the grounds of the school of Parkdale (old-room) about 2 m north of Mianus Lake School. The grounds of the school were used for running races, shooting gallery, refreshments, etc., by horses for racing, horses from Edmondson, were entered on the one mile, 6 in the 3 mile, pony races ran on the race course, handicap races, 100 yds to 800 yds, steeplechase, high and long jump, running, high jump, boxing matches, and long jump, egg and spoon, three-legged race, sack race, square races, shooting matches, and long jump, etc. These events were in full swing at 3 p.m. The dancing in the afternoon races, and other events were in full swing at 3 p.m. The dancing seven to eight hundred were in attendance, and at the close of the dance, the crowd gathered around the raised platform. It was found that expenses building the meeting of the sports committee, it was found that expenses building the prizes and prize money, didn't break even. There should have been a charge for the dance, had it been so, it would have been a great success. Some of those not on the committee started a rumour it was a political issue, but members happened to be present, conservative and liberal both were asked to speak, they spoke of the community spirit, and did not in anyway touch on political affairs, so that broke the community spirits up for good.\nNo. 613 S\n\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8\nOxford\n\nNo. 613 S\n\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jessylee/PioneerQuestionnairesPDFs//PioneerQuestionnaires_No.5-RecreationandSocialLifeQuestionnaires_Box12971_1905A-E_2029.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 50, "total-input-tokens": 83000, "total-output-tokens": 17410, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 4], [0, 1232, 5], [1232, 1232, 6], [1232, 7216, 7], [7216, 7216, 8], [7216, 13232, 9], [13232, 13232, 10], [13232, 13232, 11], [13232, 17657, 12], [17657, 20502, 13], [20502, 20502, 14], [20502, 24662, 15], [24662, 24662, 16], [24662, 25419, 17], [25419, 25419, 18], [25419, 25800, 19], [25800, 28059, 20], [28059, 33066, 21], [33066, 33066, 22], [33066, 40214, 23], [40214, 41771, 24], [41771, 46533, 25], [46533, 46533, 26], [46533, 47733, 27], [47733, 51017, 28], [51017, 55931, 29], [55931, 55931, 30], [55931, 57152, 31], [57152, 57152, 32], [57152, 57152, 33], [57152, 57152, 34], [57152, 57152, 35], [57152, 57152, 36], [57152, 57152, 37], [57152, 57152, 38], [57152, 57152, 39], [57152, 57152, 40], [57152, 59999, 41], [59999, 62583, 42], [62583, 63279, 43], [63279, 63999, 44], [63999, 67211, 45], [67211, 67211, 46], [67211, 70450, 47], [70450, 70450, 48], [70450, 70597, 49], [70597, 70751, 50]], "primary_language": ["None", "None", "None", "None", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false, false, true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]}}]
