While there we lunched from a gallon tin of canned apples and a loaf of bread. We passed icebergs on the voyage. We got to Saskatoon just at the wrong time of year to make a start at farming. After Mr. Walker of Saskatchewan what was later Sutherland district, located Dad on his homestead. I was to stay with them, and my sister at a neighboring farm, but I cried continuously, so was taken to the homestead to rough it with the rest in the tent. It was all like a wonderland to me. We made a sundial on the homestead line and used it to tell the time by. My Dad got some carpenter work somewhere, while my two brothers set about making a garden by cutting the sod with an axe and then spading up the ground. Oh, yes, a neighbor plowed about 20 acres for us and sowed it with oats, as it was too late for wheat. We found a baby owl which I kept as a pet with a string on its leg and fed it pieces of gopher.

While there we lunched from a gallon tin of canned apples and a loaf of bread. We passed icebergs on the voyage. We got to Saskatoon just at the wrong time of year to make a start at farming. After Mr. Welker of Saskatchewan what was later Sutherland district, located Dad on his homestead, I was to stay with them, and my sister at a neighboring farm, but I cried continuously, so was taken to the homestead to rough it with the rest in the tent. It was all like a wonderland to me. We made a sundial on the homestead line and used it to tell the time by.

How often did you write to relatives or friends in your old home?\n   I wrote to Mother before she came. She to her sisters after that.\n   My brothers to their old school mates, who of course thought we were in the\n   midst of Indians, buffalo, etc.\n\n20. If you got married, give the name of your husband or wife along with the date\n    and place of marriage. Campbell, 1921.\n\n21. Did anyone else come to Saskatchewan because of your recommending it as a place\n    to settle?\n\n22. If other members of your family (brothers, sisters, parents, etc.) came West\n    tell when they came and where they settled. Mother and youngest brother and\n    sister came in spring of 1907.\n    Oldest brother came out in spring of 1914, took up a homestead with the\n    third brother in Weston district. Was in Grenadier Guards, so returned when\n    war started in 1914. Was all thru the war and marched into India. I have his\n    letters, was with my second brother, (who had returned and spent five yrs. in\n    London Heart Hospital) when he died, and has been missing since then.\n\n23. Is there any particular experience of pioneer days that stands out in your\n    memory which you would like to record?\n    The hay ceiling of our sod house caught fire when my sister and I\n    were alone in the winter. A neighbor happened to pass on the way to the bluffs for\n    wood, just at the critical moment and put it out. We used to go outside and\n    shout at the coyotes to try to scare them away.\n    Used and I used to walk 2\u00bd miles back from a visit to the neighbor in\n    the middle of winter with nothing but the North Star to direct us and sky and\n    prairie looked all just alike. Also driving back from town one evening when\n    it was snowing, after passing the end of the road allowance, we weren't sure if\n    we were on the trail, so he sent me to see if a dark object was a bluff and a hay-\n    stack. When I turned around\u2014I could not see the cutter! just grey everywhere.\n    What a predicament. Lost and alone and on foot. But I just kept on walking and\n    soon saw it again. Blessing Providence.\n\nIn October of 1927 my sister and I had to walk home the 2\u00bd miles fr\nfrom school after school had started. We had only leather boots on our feet\nand as the snow was soon quite deep and the weather turned cold, our hands and\nfeet were frostbitten when we kicked at the door of a neighbor halfway home,\nand were fortunate that he was at home. After thawing out our very painful\nhands and feet (my heels carry the marks of the sores to this day which develop\ned) we took the news to my mother whom he met on his way to meet us. We stayed (see lower)\nand you travel about much in the early years? (over)\n\n24. Some visitors used to come to our place later on when we got an organ and we used\n    to sing hymns. Also Dad used to drive us with the team and democrat six miles\n    to church at Floral. We always had a program of our own and Christmas tree at\n    Christmas. One of our best games was crokinole, but we had choruses, etc., and\n    recitations. There were eight of us at the most, but that varied, as one bro-\n    ther worked away, the other took up a homestead and my older sister went to town to work\n    (from above) there three days while the blizzard lasted.\n\nIt was also in either 1907 or 1908 that a huge prairie fire, which had\nbeen coming from the East for three days, by the glow in the sky at night, but\ncould not see in the daytime, caught up to our house when only my sister and I\nwere there. All we could try to save was the bedclothes and those we threw down\ndown the dry well by the garden and then ran ahead of it to our neighbor's,\nJohn Evans 2\u00bd mi. away, who was the fire warden. Over the range of hills I was\nexhausted and lay down for a minute with the smell milk cider down quilt I had\nbrought with me. When we returned, the whole country was a charred mass of\ncrunchy black. Our brothers had got home in time to save the \"tepee\" of firewood, and the house.\nMay Evans rode up on horseback one day when a small\nprairie fire got away and burned into some of the crop. The winters then were colder than now and the blizzards were real blizzards, where you could not go out without getting lost.\nI used to \"break in\" any young colts we had, to drive, and once one made a complete wreck of our one-seater rig. One day this same colt, later, came home with the empty rig, when my Father should have been with it. So I turned him about and drove back until I found Dad, limping a little, as the colt had shied at a pig coming out of a grain field and upset the rig.\n\nI distinctly remember driving at least one load of hay to town myself and down the \"long hill\" and across the traffic bridge. I don't think I was more than twelve at the time, but I was the \"right-hand man\" and did all the work in the fields with the horses. I met Dad at the market, where I expect he must have driven in by buggy. When I went to town to help some friends for two weeks, and stayed two years, as I went back to school and worked for my board, Dad hired two men to do the work. I attended six different schools in Saskatoon, starting with the old stone school, as late as '14, when we moved to Sutherland about 1914, I decided to go to High School and rode the colt to Nutana, where my sister was living, and attended the Collegiate, but only for about three months, so the first holidays I went to the farm, where the family moved back to still in the summer for a year or two, I didn't get back.\n\nThe \"Honors in Spelling\" badge remained in my possession from the time I first won it at the new King Edward school, and I was foolish enough to turn it in when I left school. Having attended school in England from age three, which is customary there, they couldn't seem to find a grade to suit me here, so I went from four to five, to seven to eight. I was crowded and fell over the banisters on to the main floor below me at the old King Edward, which is the City Hall now. We went to Domestic Science class at Victoria school, and for a while attended Princess school, as I was staying in that vicinity then.\n\nWhere St. Thomas Church is now was away out on the prairie near a slough and the building, I think, was the one that is now the Sons of England hall. My youngest brother's name is on the Honor roll for War Service in the first war, at St. Thomas Wesley. My Mother was a Life member at the Y.W.C.A. in the City, and for some time took charge of the Young Mission Band at St. Thomas. Mrs. Freethy, who died recently, was Sunday school teacher to my younger sister and myself. This sister attended Bedford Rd. Collegiate and is at present teaching for the fourth year in Pictou County, N.S., while her elder son is on his third summer as a student minister of the United Church and is in B.C. Last summer, while my daughter and I were on a three month visit to the British Isles, this nephew's younger brother drove his mother in an Austin car from Pictou, N.S., to Saskatoon and on out to Vancouver, where his brother also drove to the Okanagan and then back to Treburn, Sask., to a job. They visited my Dad, who is 92 this past month, May 1852, and is still carrying on his own business each day in the busy part of Vancouver city and goes down each day, and last year, was also keeping house for himself, tho' he had what little he eats, out. He preached at the Peoples' Mission when he was first in Vancouver about 1926 and before that, besides England, had preached at Blackley, near Sutherland, at the Shetland Islands, Eng., where he spent one winter, and I expect in Florida, where he spent one winter.\n\nOne niece in Saskatoon has spent a year exchange teaching in England and now has her B.A. My elder sister is in Saskatoon, has ten children and 13 grandchildren. My youngest brother is on a homestead in the Peace River country at Worsley, Alta.\n25. When was the first car used in the community?\n\n26. If you owned a car before 1924, when did you buy it?
