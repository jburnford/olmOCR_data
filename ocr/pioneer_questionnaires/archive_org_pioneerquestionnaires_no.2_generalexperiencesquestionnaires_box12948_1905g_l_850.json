Or did you make up your mind after trying it out? Then did you make this decision?\n34. Did any people move away from your district prior to 1914? What reasons did they have for moving?\n\nYes, a few moved to the North & West Cemetery which was opening up for settlement. Reason to improve their financial position. Which some died, and others joined.\n\n35. Did many people move away during the 1930s? Did many return?\n\nA large number moved away in the 1930s. Practically none returned.\n\n36. If you or some member of your family have held public office, or have been active in any organizations, mention it here, giving dates wherever possible.\n\nSince including year 1911 - I served as chairman and at present am serving my 3rd year as Chair of the Rural Mtn.

During that time he has been a member of the board of directors of the Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities for 12 years and its president for seven. He has served as a member of the board of directors of the Saskatchewan Municipal Hall Association for 31 years and its vice-president for the past 12 years.\n\nHis varied activities also include chairmanship of the Notomis Union Hospital board and in 1962 he served as Grand Master of the Provincial Legislature from 1984 to 1985.\n\nFormerly fifteen years he has been a highly respected farmer in the district serving a wide circle of activities which began as a justice of the peace. He retired from active farming in 1949 when he organized savings committees in Saskatchewan.\n\nA rather impressive record for the young immigrant who arrived in Canada in 1915 with a tradition of hard work and determination. He has no trouble in anyone's mind why the Queen bestowed the medal on Mr. Hummel for outstanding service.\n\nAn even more glorious designation comes to Mr. Hummel from one of his next-door neighbors who said: \"He's one of the town's outstanding citizens and a swell guy.\"\n\nThat is a citation not earned by too many people in this world.\n\nYour Board is satisfied that the establishment of efficient production methods require considerable expenditure on suitable buildings and equipment for stock and food supplies. To some extent at least, the degree of efficiency at present exists in the province, with prices fully in line with those paid in the United States. The domestic market for livestock involves a higher original investment than in itself is not enough to provide stability for the livestock producer. For example, during the year 1956, monthly average prices ranged from a low of $28.56 in January to high of $38.33 in July, a range of $9.78. Durc is sold in the cow-pot market, yet this price variation was not due to the domestic market, for the best available data shows that the domestic market for livestock producers is not large enough to provide stability for the livestock producer. If the best interests of the livestock producer are to be served, it will be necessary to bring about stability in the market for cattle. This would mean that the domestic market for cattle would be better balanced by implementing the provisions of the Agricultural Prices Support Act to make every effort in recent years to stabilize livestock prices where they do not already exist.\n\nThe experience gained during the period of the floor market in 1944 when it amalgamated with the Saskatchewan Co-operative Livestock Producers Limited. Following amalgamation, one of the first projects carried out was the establishment of public stockyards that the losses suffered by producers in the absence of support action in all parts of the province have been many times as great. There is no doubt, in our opinion, that prices to producers remove from violent production and are damaging regular markets to producers but only to the producer but to the country as a whole. In the adoption of the Wheat Pool system, the producers have been able to maintain their prices at a level that is competitive with those prevailing in the United States.\nReeve Guy Hummel of Wreford municipality was honored recently with the award of a Queen's Coronation medal and Mr. Hummel is still wondering how that came about.\n\nThe citation accompanying the award said it was presented for \"Outstanding Service.\" And Mr. Hummel is trying to figure out what outstanding service he has rendered.\n\nAn examination of Mr. Hummel's background would seem to make it very evident why he had received the medal and why it was awarded on the basis of outstanding service.\n\nMr. Hummel has been active in local municipal affairs for 34 years all but three of which he has held the position of reeve of Wreford municipality. During that time he has missed only two meetings, both due to illness. In provincial municipal circles, he has been a member of the board of directors of the Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities for 12 years, and its president for seven. He has served as a member of the board of directors of the Saskatchewan Municipal Hall Association for 31 years, and its vice-president for the past 12 years.\n\nHis varied activities also include chairmanship of the Nokomis Union Hospital board, and in 1952 he served as Grand Master of the Masonic Lodge in Saskatchewan. He was a Liberal member of the provincial legislature from 1934 to 1938.\n\nFor nearly fifty years he has been a prominent, highly respected farmer in the district, enjoying a wide circle of activities which began as a justice of the peace. He retired from active farming in 1949.\n\nDuring the war he organized salvage committees in Saskatchewan for the Department of National War Services.\n\nA rather impressive record for the young immigrant who arrived in Nokomis in 1905 with a trainload of homesteaders from Nebraska\u2014and it should leave no doubt in anyone's mind why the Queen bestowed the medal on Mr. Hummel for outstanding service.\n\nAn even more gracious designation comes to Mr. Hummel from one of his next-door neighbors, who said: 'He's one of the town's outstanding citizens and a swell guy.'\n\nThat is a citation not earned by too many people in this world.\n\nThe success of this extension of market facilities is outlined in the following excerpt from the 1949 annual report of the Wheat Pool, which states:\n\n\"Your Board is satisfied that the establishment of markets at these points, with prices fully in line with those prevailing elsewhere, has raised the basic price of livestock not only to Pool members but also to all livestock producers in the surrounding area.\"\n\nWhile the Pool now provides expert livestock marketing service at seven major centres in Saskatchewan, this in itself is not enough to provide stability for the livestock industry.\n\nThe domestic market for livestock today absorbs the major part of production, cattle and hog production. Only a small percent of livestock production is sold in the export market, yet this outlet is a strong factor in determining the domestic price. If the best interests of the livestock producer are to be served, it will be necessary to bring about stability in price and production. Stable prices and operation efficiencies can best be achieved by implementing the provisions of the Agricultural Prices Support Act to establish floor prices where they do not already exist.\n\nThe experience gained during the period of the foot-and-mouth disease embargo has shown that a floor price system can operate successfully. Critics may suggest that the losses incurred by the government during this period can be justified only under emergency conditions. It is our opinion that the losses suffered by producers and the nation, in the absence of support prices during the embargo, would have been many times as great. There is no doubt, in our opinion, that price support action fully justified itself.\n\nFurther, we are of the opinion that violent price fluctuations create emergencies which conditions are damaging not only to the producer but to the country as a whole.

However, many things may be done to reduce the natural variability in production by following certain practices which will help to maintain the proper use of land in these provinces.\n\nThis section of our submission will try to suggest some of the things which may be done to reduce the threat of production to suggest the proper use of land in these provinces.\n\nLand utilization, however, is only one part of the general problem of soil and water conservation. Much valuable work has been done by the provincial government in developing irrigation projects and in land management programs.\n\nThe natural hazards of grain production in Saskatchewan were aggravated in the early days. It is a commonplace of Saskatchewan agricultural history that the land under the prairie farm rehabilitation act below which would have been left in its native state. Provincial and federal governments have spent substantial amounts in recent years to return some of the land to grass. The result is by no means finished and both governments are still engaged in policies designed to correct remaining problems.\n\nLivestock Marketing\n\nLivestock marketing is essential in Western Canada and the federal government has done important explanatory work in the area. What has been accomplished in the last ten years of P.E.I. experience is that farmers in 46 municipalities qualified for assistance in five out of ten years. In 177 other municipalities, the main problem was paid off eight out of ten years.\nJanuary 10 \u2014 On or before this date where a public library has been established, in a municipality, at the first meeting of the council, the members of the library board shall be appointed.

The department of cooperation reports that credit unions in Saskatchewan lent an estimated $10,500,000 to farmers for farm opera-\nDonald Lambie\n\nNew Valuator\n\nDonald D. Lambie has been appointed property valuator in the extension service branch of the Department of Municipal Affairs in Saskatchewan.\n\nThis organization suggests that additional emphasis should be put on farm management and matters generally related to the farm as a business enterprise. It appears that farmers are generally interested in such subjects although they have received more attention than where they are located in soils in 1942.\n\nHe did experimental work with wheat at the Dominion Experimental Station at Swift Current in 1936 and 1937. Much of the information that is given in this pamphlet was obtained from the farmers' soil sampling at Virdenhill in 1938.\n\nMr. Lambie was born in Dublin, Saskatchewan in 1910 and graduated from the University of Saskatchewan in 1936.\n\nApart from the numerous examinations of P.F.A.A., the number of awards made by the organization has been steadily increasing since its establishment in 1920.\n\nThe average value of awards paid annually by P.F.A.A. is slightly more than $47,000, which makes it the largest single source of income for the organization.\n\nIn the light of these circumstances, the attention of the commission is directed to the following resolution:\n\n\"A resolution expressing the opinion that the organization should be continued and strengthened, and that the services of Mr. Lambie should be continued.\"\n\nThe benefits under this scheme are limited. In the event of a complete failure of crops, there will be no loss to the farmer except in the case of partial crop failures.\n\nSufficient experience has now been accumulated among up to 300 acres of land, the maximum area covered by the act, to show the advantages of this new system of crop insurance.\n\nThe maximum coverage under the act is $150 per acre, and the premiums charged are based on costs and prices prevailing in 1938.\n\nTwo things emerge from this brief examination of the scheme of crop insurance:\n\nFirstly, that the organization has been successful in providing a valuable service to the farmers.\n\nSecondly, that the organization should be continued and strengthened, and that the services of Mr. Lambie should be continued.\n\nThe question of farm credit is closely associated with the problem of stable production in Saskatchewan.\nUniversity of Saskatchewan, the field service of the provincial department of agriculture, the field service of this organization are but three of many sources offering information of vital importance to farmers' success. The newspapers and radio stations offer another essential avenue of information.\n\nThese avenues of information and education have helped the farmer to improve his production methods in many instances. The gradual improvement in agricultural practice which has taken place over the years can be attributed in some measure at least to the work of extension agencies.\n\nAgricultural extension services generally recognize how far performance still falls behind knowledge. They are conscious that their best efforts have not been completely fruitful and they have spent much time and thought in analyzing their own work to discover where improvements may be made. We feel sure that this process will continue and that improvements in extension methods will come as a result of continued critical examination by those engaged in this field.\n\nThis organization suggests that additional emphasis in extension work should be put on farm management and matters generally related to the farm as a business enterprise. It appears that farmers are generally interested in such subjects and would be receptive to more information than they have received in the past.\n\nThe present wheat situation appears to be a case in point. Much of the information that is given to the public by some agencies is of dubious merit from the farmer's standpoint. This organization suggests that the farmer needs to understand the basic principles of marketing and farm economics so that he may make his own critical analysis of material that reaches him from the many sources that are competing for his attention.\n\nAn adequate farm information program ought to have three virtues: it should be comprehensive; it should be timely, and it should be accurate. And of these virtues, accuracy is the greatest.\n\nCrop Insurance\n\nUp to this point this submission has directed attention to some of the ways in which the hazards of production which face Saskatchewan farmers may be reduced or eliminated. But, however conscientiously these remedies are applied, the fact is that the Saskatchewan economy will remain subject to violent fluctuations in yield and income.\n\nThis is now officially recognized in national farm policy and steps have been taken to ameliorate the condition through the Prairie Farm Assistance Act which has been in operation since 1939. Under this act prairie farmers and the federal government share the cost of making adjustment payments to farmers who experience complete or partial crop failures.\n\nSufficient experience has now been accumulated under this act to point the way to broader and more comprehensive schemes further to reduce the instability arising from the natural hazards of grain production in Saskatchewan. A brief review of P.F.A.A. experience will point up some of the problems involved in developing an effective pattern of coverage.\n\nIn the 14 years P.F.A.A. has been operating in Saskatchewan, it has been necessary to make payments under the provisions of the act in every year but one\u20141942. Even in the record year of 1952 when the province as a whole reaped the largest total wheat crop in its history and enjoyed the highest average yield, 3,084 claims for assistance were honored to the amount of $758,000.\n\nApart from 1952, the number of awards under P.F.A.A. has ranged from 10,576 in 1941 to 62,473 in 1941. The average number of awards paid annually since 1939 (but not including 1942) is slightly more than 34,700. Annual payments have ranged from $758,000 in 1952 to more than $15,000,000 in 1949. This record reflects a variability in production which calls for broad policies to level off the effects of such instability.\n\nP.F.A.A. has been supported by the farmers through a contribution of one percent on the value of grain delivered to the elevators. In Saskatchewan this contribution has amounted, in 14 years, to $41,500,000. During the same period, payments in Saskatchewan under the act have amounted to $103,800,000. Thus Saskatchewan farmers have borne 40 percent of the cost of this elementary system of income insurance. The balance has been made up by payments from the federal treasury together with small surpluses earned by the scheme from its operation in Manitoba.\n\nThe benefits under this scheme are limited. In the event of a complete crop failure (that is less than five bushels to the acre) the farmer receives $2.50 per acre on half his cultivated acreage up to 200 acres. The maximum payment under P.F.A.A. is, therefore, $250. For partial failure, the maximum is $150. These amounts are based on costs and prices prevailing in 1938. They are obviously inadequate now to give even the level of security envisaged when the act was passed. There are other limitations in the P.F.A.A. scheme which make it questionable as the basis for an adequate crop insurance plan. P.F.A.A. has been useful as an emergency measure to meet conditions which prevailed when the act was passed. Amendments have increased its usefulness as conditions have changed. But it is nowhere represented as a substitute for adequate crop insurance.\n\nTwo things emerge from this brief examination of the experience accumulated by P.F.A.A. The first is that some form of insurance against the hazards of cereal crop production is necessary. The second is that it is unlikely that the farmers themselves can bear the whole cost of a satisfactory insurance scheme.\n\nIn the light of these circumstances, the attention of the commission is directed to the following resolution which has been approved by the delegate body of the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool:\n\n\"That we again urge upon the federal government the adoption of a national agricultural policy which would provide for:\n(a) An adequate scheme of crop insurance, the cost to be borne jointly by the Dominion and provincial governments and the producers.\"\n\nFARM CREDIT\n\nThe question of farm credit is closely associated with the problem of stable production in Saskatchewan.\nWHEAT POOL SUBMISSION\n\n(Continued from Page 6)\n\nWithout adequate credit facilities, many Saskatchewan farmers would find it very difficult to operate their farms efficiently in adverse weather conditions. Indeed, many farmers have been forced to sell their livestock at a loss because they could not obtain credit to purchase feed or other supplies.\n\nCredit is essential to the operation of a farm. It provides the means by which the farmer can acquire the necessary equipment and supplies to maintain his operation. Without credit, the farmer is forced to operate on a cash basis, which can be extremely difficult during periods of adverse weather conditions.\n\nThe availability of credit is crucial to the success of any farming operation. It allows the farmer to purchase supplies and equipment when needed, rather than having to wait until he has saved enough money to make the purchase. This flexibility is essential to the successful operation of a farm.\n\nMoreover, a greater degree of stability in livestock prices would encourage farmers to invest more in their operations. The increased investment would lead to higher productivity and better profits.\n\nIn conclusion, the availability of adequate credit facilities is essential to the successful operation of a farm. Without credit, farmers are forced to operate on a cash basis, which can be extremely difficult during periods of adverse weather conditions. The availability of credit allows farmers to purchase supplies and equipment when needed, rather than having to wait until they have saved enough money to make the purchase. This flexibility is essential to the successful operation of a farm.\n\nResearch and Extension\n\nScience has become increasingly important in the development of the prairies. From the earliest days of settlement, the people have operated on a very limited scale, with little knowledge of the potential of the land. During the homesteading period, advances were made by pioneers, stores, and banks, and eventually, the entire mortgage system was developed. As the century was laid out, the farmers found themselves in the midst of the depression, and the farm debt problem increased. Interest rates also increased, and agricultural companies for tractor fuel were unable to pay their bills. The situation became worse when the problem of farm debt was compounded by the failure of the federal government to provide adequate assistance.\n\nIn conclusion, the availability of adequate credit facilities is essential to the successful operation of a farm. Without credit, farmers are forced to operate on a cash basis, which can be extremely difficult during periods of adverse weather conditions. The availability of credit allows farmers to purchase supplies and equipment when needed, rather than having to wait until they have saved enough money to make the purchase. This flexibility is essential to the successful operation of a farm.\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8\nOxford\n\nNo. 613 S\n\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jessylee/PioneerQuestionnairesPDFs//PioneerQuestionnaires_No.2-GeneralExperiencesQuestionnaires_Box12948_1905G-L_850.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 42, "total-input-tokens": 69720, "total-output-tokens": 14499, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 4], [0, 1976, 5], [1976, 3515, 6], [3515, 5101, 7], [5101, 5896, 8], [5896, 6561, 9], [6561, 7196, 10], [7196, 8627, 11], [8627, 9338, 12], [9338, 11518, 13], [11518, 12524, 14], [12524, 14746, 15], [14746, 15703, 16], [15703, 16946, 17], [16946, 16946, 18], [16946, 17438, 19], [17438, 18390, 20], [18390, 18390, 21], [18390, 18390, 22], [18390, 22275, 23], [22275, 26238, 24], [26238, 27956, 25], [27956, 31892, 26], [31892, 33684, 27], [33684, 33684, 28], [33684, 38721, 29], [38721, 43990, 30], [43990, 43990, 31], [43990, 49164, 32], [49164, 49164, 33], [49164, 49164, 34], [49164, 49164, 35], [49164, 49164, 36], [49164, 51464, 37], [51464, 57623, 38], [57623, 60546, 39], [60546, 60546, 40], [60546, 60634, 41], [60634, 60788, 42]], "primary_language": ["None", "None", "None", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]}}]
