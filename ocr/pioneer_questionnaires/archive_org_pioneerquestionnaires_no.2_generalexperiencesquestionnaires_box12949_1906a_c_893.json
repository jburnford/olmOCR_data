Mr. Gladstone was his name (since deceased) he used to haul the mail from Kindersley to his home south of Holbeck School on a farm & the Post Office was called Holbeck then later when school was built it was given same name. First settlers here decided to call the town Eaton (don't know why) but got word there was a small place with that name so it was changed to Eatonia.\nAfter some years we moved to Bladworth, Sask., where my husband was the minister for a few years, then back to Eatonia for a few years & resigned from the Ministry in 1925 although still preaching when needed.\n\nWe took a trip out to Vancouver for couple of months & decided the farm was the best place to raise a family so started farming in a small way near Eatonia. Our family consisted of 3 sons & 3 daughters, the youngest died in Eatonia. My husband was then asked to be Secretary of our Eatonia Hospital he had helped Dr. Lord (deceased) to get the Hospital going on a Union basis with the municipality (Royal Canadian) he served in that capacity for 20 years.

That was the main worry because I knew that\n\nthe Rome shows before it went up again very good, if you go\n\nabout 2 ft. high at first. Please the Edmonton farmers got out of\n\nSuburbia when this 14 came into question because farmers were worried\n\nwith work stopping.
