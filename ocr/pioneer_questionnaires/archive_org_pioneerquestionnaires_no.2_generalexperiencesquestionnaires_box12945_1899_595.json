Most inhabitants of the journey west do you remember? People you met on the way, meetings with Indians, adventures on the prairie, accidents, or other accidents etc. We did not meet with any outstanding incident or accident except we were in Brandon on the 24th of January. The Indians told us there was a critical ice in the river that day. As there was no critical ice in the river that day they proclaimed it by stating that the ice had been cleared with snowplow in the early spring and because for Victoria day shorts, we did not investigate the report.\n\n15.

Is there any particular experience of pioneer days that stands out in your memory which you would like to record?\n\nThe onset of our battle with experience of pioneer life was our battle with grasshoppers during the summer of 1899 and lasted till August. Most of us Easterners had never seen anything like it before in many cases. Grasshoppers would lay down and roll while hitched to the plow in other instances one could see a cloud of the hosts around livestock at a distance of a half mile. Hardly a grove would become disfigured with the country that year and from any other season. In several succeeding years they were all bad but not in 1900 which was a dry year.\n\n24. Did you travel about much in the early years? (For business, attending church, visiting friends, etc.) How often? How far? By what means of travel?\n\nPeople traveled quite a lot by team & buggy in early days of settlement mostly for only short distances, such as the nearest village to do shopping or go to church. Now days with our big highways and many of our villages are ghost towns and church attendance is fast disappearing and will diminish entirely in a few more years except in the larger centers.\n19. How often did you write to relatives or friends in your old home? I did not.\n\n20. If you got married, give the name of your husband or wife along with the date and place of marriage.\n\n21.

Is there any particular experience or pioneer days that stand out in your memory which you would like to recount?\n\n24. Did you travel about much in the early years? (For business, attending church, visiting friends, etc.) For what? How far? By what means of travel?\n\nPeople traveled quite a lot by teams of horses in early days of settlement mostly for only short distances such as the nearest village to do shopping or go to church. Our days with our big horses and church attendance is fast disappearing and will diminish entirely in a few more years except in the larger centers.\n25. When was the first car used in the community? about 1911\n\n26. If you owned a car before 1911, when did you buy it? What make? I did not own a car until 1918.\n\n27. Where was your trading center? How far from your home? 4\u00bd miles\n\n28. Did you continue to trade there? (Indicate any changes due to new towns appearing, better means of travel, etc.). As more cars came into use, more business went to Ryburn store.\n\n29. How often did you shop in the early days? about once a week\n\n30. When (if ever) did people in your district first start going to town regularly on Saturdays? When cars came into general use, shopping 2-3 times a week became common.\n\n31. When (if ever) did you first begin to buy through the mail order catalogues? What kind of articles did you buy in this way? Indicate also what fraction of your total purchases were by mail order and any changes in the proportion of purchases made by mail order since the pioneer period.

In 1910, a local organized company.\n\n33. When you came to Saskatchewan the first time was it with the idea of staying permanently? Or did you make up your mind after trying it out? When did you make this decision? We came here to stay if it proved possible to make a good living, but believe there was a considerable percentage of population that intended to leave for a more congenial climate when their stake was made.\n34. Did any family move away from your district prior to 1924? That means did\n\nthe year mentioned very few people left here before\n\n35. Did many people move away during the 1930's? Did many return? Grant had been\n\nleft here during the 30's some returned Grant did not\n\n36. If you or some member of your family have held public office, or have been\n\nactive in any organization, please mention it here? Every data wherever possible.\n\n(Such as county,\n\nstate, federal, etc.)\n\n37. If you or any of your family or friends were interested to have so do research\n\nin the district of Butten, there places dues where possible.\n\n(Such as county,\n\nstate, federal, etc.)\n\n38. How did the places in your community get their names? (School districts, Post\n\noffices, villages, railway stations, creeks, etc.) Try to give (1) exact\n\ndate of its adoption (2) any changes in name (3) and meaning of the\n\nname and reason for change.\n\nWas taken partly from a former name (Butten)\n\nour village (Prestonport) was taken from a name\n\nsame former mayor of Weymouth\n35.

If you have children or grandchildren, please give their names, where they live and occupations.\n\nJames Allan, 65, lives at home helping on the farm.\n\nOne grandchild (Marlene), daughter of Paul Bradley.\n\n41. What do you think are the most important changes in your community since you first came west?\n\nThe most important change in my opinion is the change from horse to power farming. We used to rent land then at the mercy of the manufacturer. If a man could get over before and the quality of the harvest was good we would rent. If not, we would not rent. The farmers that raised their own grain did not have to depend on the government. They could sell and pay their taxes. However, performing oneself is easier to control and defend than with the old method.\n\nPlease give the names and addresses of other persons who should be included.\n\nIf someone else has filled in this questionnaire for you, please have this signed and fill in any other questions.\nQuestions regarding historical sources materials:\n\nDo you have in your possession or do you know the whereabouts of diaries, old photos and photographs, written or oral histories, books of community organizations, newspapers, old letters, old programs, old minutes, lists of the school district here at present if it was not present at the time of the school district officials who did not object to having it.\n\nWould you or the person who owns them either:\n\n1.

What do you think are the most important changes in your community since the last census was taken?\n\nThe most important changes in our community since the last census was taken are:\n\n- The change from horse to power farming.\n- The increase in the number of families owning cars.\n- The decrease in the number of people working in agriculture.\n- The increase in the number of people working in the service sector.\n\nPlease give the names and addresses of other persons who could help you fill out this questionnaire.\n\nIf someone else has filled in this questionnaire for you, please have this person sign and date it.\nOxford\n\nNo. 613 S\n\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8\nOxford\n\nNo. 613 S\n\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jessylee/PioneerQuestionnairesPDFs//PioneerQuestionnaires_No.2-GeneralExperiencesQuestionnaires_Box12945_1899_595.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 22, "total-input-tokens": 36520, "total-output-tokens": 6785, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 4], [0, 1981, 5], [1981, 9235, 6], [9235, 10967, 7], [10967, 11966, 8], [11966, 13779, 9], [13779, 16009, 10], [16009, 16724, 11], [16724, 18137, 12], [18137, 19939, 13], [19939, 20947, 14], [20947, 22475, 15], [22475, 22475, 16], [22475, 23515, 17], [23515, 24305, 18], [24305, 25823, 19], [25823, 27315, 20], [27315, 27470, 21], [27470, 27624, 22]], "primary_language": ["None", "None", "None", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]}}]
