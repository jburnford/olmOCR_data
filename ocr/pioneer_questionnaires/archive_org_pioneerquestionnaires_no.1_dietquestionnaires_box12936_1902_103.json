Dug outs are a further source of water supply for stock & supplementing laundry purposes when rain fails.\n### 11.

Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include items not mentioned above, quality, methods of merchandising, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. [Use back of page if more space is needed].\n\nWe moved to this district in 1904. At that time there was no railroad. Our nearest store and P. Office was Great Bend about 20 miles from us. We made the trip weekly. We milked 20 cows at that time. The butter we made we took to the store & traded for groceries. You can imagine how hard it was to deliver butter in good condition in the hot weather driving 20 miles in a wagon. We made the butter into 1 lb. points. Butter was in short supply so the store keeper had no difficulty in disposing it to the many farming homesteaders. The price was 25\u00a2 in summer.\n\nIn Whitehead from 1902 to 1904 we packed the butter in 25-lb wooden pails. This was shipped by the store keeper and we received 15\u00a2 per lb during the summer.\n21. When did you begin to rely on pure and fresh foods and organic forms instead of canned or preserved foods?

Include items not mentioned above, quality, methods of preserving, prices, availability of stores, character and other details. Use back of paper if more space is needed.\n\nWe moved to this district in 1904. At that time there was no railroad. Our nearest store and P.O. office was Great Bend about 30 miles from us. We made the trip weekly. We walked 3-0 cows at that time. This better we made we took to the store to trade for groceries. You can imagine how hard it was to deliver butter in good condition in the hot weather driving 30 miles in a wagon. We made the butter into 1 lb. pints. Butter was in short supply but the store keeper had no difficulty in obtaining it so the money backing homesteaders. The price was 25\u00a2 in summer to the winter wood from 1902 to 1904 we packed the butter in 25 lb. wooden kegs. This was shipped by the storekeeper and we received 15\u00a2 per lb during the summer.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jessylee/PioneerQuestionnairesPDFs//PioneerQuestionnaires_No.1-DietQuestionnaires_Box12936_1902_103.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 22, "total-input-tokens": 36520, "total-output-tokens": 6453, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 4], [0, 1766, 5], [1766, 2915, 6], [2915, 4190, 7], [4190, 5058, 8], [5058, 6434, 9], [6434, 7384, 10], [7384, 12191, 11], [12191, 13386, 12], [13386, 17633, 13], [17633, 18946, 14], [18946, 20265, 15], [20265, 20646, 16], [20646, 22205, 17], [22205, 23035, 18], [23035, 24747, 19], [24747, 26073, 20], [26073, 26073, 21], [26073, 26073, 22]], "primary_language": ["None", "None", "None", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "None", "None"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, true, true, true, true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]}}]
