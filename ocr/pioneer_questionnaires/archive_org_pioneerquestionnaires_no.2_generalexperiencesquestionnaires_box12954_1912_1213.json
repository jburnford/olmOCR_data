If you or any of your family or friends were \"first\" to have or do something in the district, mention it here giving dates wherever possible. (Such as owning the first automobile, combine, organizing the first lodge, etc.)\n\nWill Mr. Henning had a small threshing outfit about 1913 or '14. He sold this to the three Wyman families about 1914-15. It was run by an engine that was drawn by horse when it was moved from place to place. The bands on the bundle were cut by hand. Most people use an outfit from another settlement that had a steam engine.\n\n38. How did the places in your community get their names? (School districts, Post Offices, villages, railway stations, creeks, hills, etc.). Try to give: (1) name and occupation of person suggesting place-name (2) origin and meaning of the name (3) date of its adoption (4) any changes in names since the first name was given date and reason for change. Give facts of new name as above (1), (2), (3).\n\nAs so many of these early settlers came from Iowa, U.S.A., the name \"Hawkeye\" just seemed to come naturally. (Iowa is the \"Hawkeye State\" - it's an Indian name.) We are still called the \"Hawkeye Settlement\" to distinguish it from the Hawkeye station. (see page 2 of school questionnaire, reverse side of page)\nYes, some bachelors who were \"foot loose\" and some that had homesteaded or pioneer and\n\nDuring the war some families moved away and\n\nthe older people retired or passed away.\n\nIn 1916 my husband was elected as a Trustee for several years also as a Councilor for R.M. #499. In 1953 he again served as Trustee and Councilor.\n\nWe all moved to a small threshing outfit about 1918\n\nHe added this to his three Wyman families about 1918\n\nGet more information about these Wyman families by looking at the records in the county courthouse.\n\nHow did the place get its name? The name \"Hawkeye\" first appeared in the newspaper (Davenport)\n\nThe \"Hawkeye State\" - an Indian name\n\nWe are still called the Hawkeye Settlement\n\nTo distinguish it from the Hawkeye Station. (see page 2 of school questionnaire)\nQuestions regarding historical source materials:\n\nDo you have in your possession or do you know the whereabouts of diaries, old letters, old posters and programs, minute books of community organizations, old pamphlets, old photographs, written recollections and reminiscences? (Describe).\n\nWe still have our first school ledgers where I listed all supplies bought, also all the school registers (list of pupils & their attendance) since first school opened in 1916.\n\nWould you or the person who owns them either\n\n(1) be willing to lend them to the Provincial Archivist for copying? .......\n\n(2) be willing to present them to the Archives Division of the Legislative Library, Regina, or the Archives Office at the University in Saskatoon?....indicate your preference, if any) ..................\n\nI shall ask at our next annual rate payable.

What do you think are the most important changes in your community since you first came West?\n\nAs tractors came into use farms are larger and people retiring and selling out more away, our community is smaller in population than it was in homesteading days. The railroad was very important to us and we also have an improved gravelled highway close by.\n\nPlease give the names and addresses of other pioneers who could answer this questionnaire.\n\nI previously sent two names of earlier settlers than we are, but apparently they did not fill out questionnaire.\n\nIf someone else has filled in this questionnaire for you, please have this person give name and address here:\n\nfor No. 40.\n\nLyla Wyman, Vancouver, B.C. telephone\n\n[signature]\nWe still have our first school building where I started all my children through their attendance since first school year in 1916.\n\nPayroll book at our most recent rate\n\nMrs. Bertha (my children) Dale Wyman (my children) Smith, mechanic (4 children), Dale Wyman (my children) Smith, mechanic (4 children).
