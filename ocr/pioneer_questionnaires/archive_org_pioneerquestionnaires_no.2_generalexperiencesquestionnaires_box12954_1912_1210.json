Some of the questions here will not apply to your experiences and others may prove impossible for you to answer, so don't worry about missing blank spaces. Use more sheets of paper if there is not enough space between the questions. Don't leave any questions unanswered, or describe particular events, if they help to answer the questions.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1914, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nSaskatchewan Archives questionnaires which have been prepared or projected are listed below.
