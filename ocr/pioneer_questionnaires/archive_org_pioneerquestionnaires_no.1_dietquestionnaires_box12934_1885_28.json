These were plentiful, it was not necessary to travel a very great distance to collect a wagon load; the only ordinance of travel was with a yoke of oxen.\nThere are many differences in the preparation of meals today compared with the earlier days. The earliest days used some simple and planning, then the housewife knew how to come by new and planning to make the food as far as possible. We always tried to eat the best we could, never all that was necessary in a bundle. Many kinds of canned meat, chicken and pork became, and many kinds of canned vegetables. They came in one and processed in glass cases.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on preserved foods? (Olives or canned fruits?)\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of butter production and other foods in your pioneer life. Include things not mentioned above, quality, number of participants, price if more than $1.00 needed.\n\nTrue things not mentioned earlier regarding butter. Shortly, was the abundance of milk. In the early years, milk was gathered from the cows and sheep near the Amish farm. The milk was then delivered to the Amish farm and churned. The Amish farm was also known as Nasholom, all of which were carefully gathered and preserved.\n\nSomething learned about buying provisions in my mind. Could not get much \u2014 fixed meal to chew. How Regina (25 miles away) when we always went there?\nThere are many differences in the preparation of meals today compared with the earlier days. The earliest days were hard times. There was no money and planning was essential. It was as far as possible. We always tried to save at all times.\n\nIn fact, there was little necessity in a large family of bread, sugar, butter, and many kinds of preserved meat.\n\nWhen did you begin to rely on preserved foods? When did you begin to purchase canned goods?\n\nHave you always had a garden? Have you always had fresh vegetables?\n\nIn October, there is a good supply of apples in all the stores. We have always had a good supply of canned meat, canned vegetables, and many kinds of canned vegetables. They are now more plentiful than ever before.\n\nPlease tell other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and other goods. Include any special stories or memories.\n\nTrue, things not mentioned earlier regarding food in the early years. Meats were usually purchased in the fall when they were gathered by families. The Indians would gather in the fall and store them in the winter. The Indians would also store meat in the fall.\n\nWe were very careful about buying provisions in our second summer. We could not get much bread, meat, or cheese. However, we always used (more) oranges (25 miles away) where we always used (more).\nThere are many differences in the preparation of meals today compared with the earlier days. The earliest days were more thought and planning, though I know others the food was to come from and planning to make it go as far as possible. We always took time to read the menus, knew all that was necessary in a tough day of bread, bought butter and many kinds of prepared foods instead of home made bread or root vegetables. (Give as many details as possible.)\n\nHave not yet begun to rely on purchased and prepared foods. Almost always have my own made bread. Have beef, pork, meat, poultry, etc., all the things that have always been there. Have our own canned meat as well as canned beans, and as many kinds of canned vegetables. They cannot be made processed in glass jars.\n\nPlease add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and supplies. Foods in other ways during pioneer days in southern Canada.\n\nIreland was not mentioned above, quality, methods of purchasing, prices, problems of storage, shortages, and other details. (Use back of paper if more space is needed.)\n\nSome things not mentioned earlier, regarding our food supply, was the abundance of wild fruit in the early years. Strawberries covered the fields in the northern prairies. Raspberries were gathered by rail from the South West near the Canadian border. In addition, there were black cherries and choke cherries were to be had most years as well as blackberries, all of them were carefully gathered and preserved.\n\nSomething learned about buying groceries in my second former days 1900-1951 when not to forget anything. Could not get much bread, meat at store often.\nThere are many differences in the preparation of meals today compared with the earlier days. The earliest day's meal was simple and planning was necessary to make sure there was enough food and planning to make it go as far as possible. We always tried to use what we had, new all that is necessary in a tough life.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods instead of home prepared foods? (Give as many details as possible.)\n\nI have not yet begun to rely on purchased foods. I have always prepared my own food. Have beef, pork, meat, fish, and vegetables. We also have canned goods such as canned meat, canned vegetables, canned fruits, and canned vegetables. They are stored in glass jars.\n\n22. Please list other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in eastern Canada.\n\nInclude items such as price, quality, methods of purchasing, and any other details.\n\nIf you could add any other details, please do so.\n\nSome things not mentioned earlier regarding our food. Murphy was the abundance of wild fruit in the early years. Strawberries could be picked in the wilderness. Great near was gathered by Paul from the South West near the Cassiar River. Similarly, blackberries were gathered into the Athabasca Valley were black currants, gooseberries, and cranberries were to be had most years as well as Saskatoon berries, all of which were gathered and preserved.\n\nSomething learned about buying provisions in my second summer days (1900-1931) when not too much money was available. We always went over to Regina (25 miles away) where we always went over.\nThere are many differences in the preparation of meals today compared with those of earlier days. The emphasis has shifted from planning and preparing meals to convenience foods. However, there are still times when planning and preparing meals is necessary.\n\nMany new methods have been developed over the years. For example, canned goods have become more common. However, canned goods should be used sparingly as they can be expensive.\n\nIn conclusion, while convenience foods have become more popular, it is important to remember that planning and preparing meals is still essential for a healthy diet.\nThere are many differences in the preparation of meals in the past compared with today. The earlier days included more thought and planning. Through the years, we have learned how to make do with what we have and planning has become less necessary. As we plan our meals, we always try to use what we have rather than go out and purchase. We also try to use a variety of foods.\n\nHere are some tips to help you plan and save money:\n\n1. Make a list of things you need to buy each week.\n2. Plan your meals around what you already have in the refrigerator or pantry.\n3. Use leftovers creatively.\n4. Buy in bulk when possible.\n5. Shop during sales.\n6. Use coupons and discounts.\n7. Prepare meals in advance.\n8. Use recipes that use ingredients you already have.\n9.
