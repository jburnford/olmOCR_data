I consider myself an Old Timer arrived in Moose Jaw 1884. Was at the first Agricultural Show held in Moose Jaw 1884. We lived on very coarse fare, fish caught in spring, salted enough to last all summer, Jack rabbit of wild game. Salt Side Bacon settlers called it Rattle Snake pork.

Yes, some remember as a boy of 10 years pounding wheel on a smooth flat rock with a hammer to make porridge for the family not once but many times. I will attach a letter to this report wheel I can relate some early experiences you can understand or cannot answer straight off. Need questions, my eyes a small tear from crying at that time.\n260 Athabasca St.\nMoose Jaw\nDec 9th 1950\n\nDear Sir,\n\nPlease send questionnaire on What did Western Canadian Pioneer Eat.\n\nI don't remember getting my last copy of Sask History.\n\nI consider myself an Old Timer arrived in Moose Jaw 1884.

He took salt sufficient to make about three buckets. Some buckets was not in one place mixed with water, narrow mouthed jars trying to get water out of the water they had to wash in these jugs. Out of the water they had to wash in these jugs in front of slender willows tied on the inside of a barrel made of the side of the old wine keg net with a cone inside so fish could not get out again. It had been made Indians. Women together had placed it in the water where it was shallow inside he built a wall of stone on each side of the net. The next morning it was packed full 3 or 4 barrels full each morning it was packed full for summer use. Each morning it was cleaned & salted for summer use.

The farms were called \"The Shrewsbury\" and \"The Shrewsbury Hall.\" The farms were owned by Mr. and Mrs. Smith.\n\nMr. Smith was very kind and generous. He always invited us to his house for dinner. We would spend our afternoons there playing games and talking about our lives.\n\nOne day, we went to visit Mr. Smith at his farm. We walked through the fields and admired the beautiful scenery. Mr. Smith showed us around his farm and explained how he grew his crops.\n\nWe spent the afternoon enjoying each other's company and learning about farming. It was a wonderful day and we left feeling grateful for the opportunity to spend time with such a kind and generous man.\n\nP.S. If you ever need help, just give me a call early morning.\nhad purchased a well on two acres of Brazil pasture land from Mr. Brown. The purchase included a small house and a barn. The new owner was very pleased with the property.\n\nThe barn was in good condition and had been recently painted. It was located near the main road and was easily visible from a distance.\n\nThe new owner decided to rent out the barn to a local farmer who needed storage space for his equipment. The rent would be $50 per month, payable in advance.\n\nThe farmer agreed to the terms and signed the lease. He was grateful for the opportunity to rent such a large and well-maintained building.\n\nThe new owner also purchased a small plot of land next to the barn. He planned to plant vegetables and keep a few chickens there.\n\nThe new owner was very pleased with his purchase and looked forward to making the most of his new property.\nI purchased a lot or two of Bragg's milk and made cheese. He also gave me a cow. The cheese was very good.\n\nWe also had a horse. We made a herd of cattle that were my job. We kept them in the barnyard. We would milk them twice a day.\n\nWell, the whole summer was very busy and we worked hard. We had a good harvest.\n\nWith milk and cheese, we lived off the land.\n\nHoping this message is of some use to you.\n\n[Signature]\nJennings Williams\n\nP.S.
