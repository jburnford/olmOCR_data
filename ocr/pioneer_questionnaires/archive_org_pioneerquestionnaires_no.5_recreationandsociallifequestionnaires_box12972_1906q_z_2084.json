Did you ever have \"bees\" when groups of neighbors came together to put up quilts, make quilts, or other such activities?\n\nTell what you remember about such gatherings, giving dates if possible, telling what the bees were for, and how often they occurred.\n\n7. In the earliest years that you were here, were there any parties, whilst drives or dances in homes? Describe.\n\nThe not married couples would have parties, circled by the unmarried persons and the bachelors and old maids. Sometimes arranged men's dances, mixed parties, bachelor clubs, and a change in dates and a change in dates.\n\n8. Did you socially meet each other? Yes, we did have good parties and dances.\n\nAt the first marriages parties and circled by their own.\n\nDid you follow any kind of informal schedule, every two weeks, once a week, once a month, etc.? Yes, we did have parties and dances.\n\nGradually closed down, and halls were built.\nOn one occasion in 1907, we organized a bee, to map and cut a road through the back around Steynes in order that a settler could get into his new neighbors' land. He was Mr. Blackmore, a Yorkshireman who had been brought in by a homesteader who had recently arrived, who knew many settlers. Mr. Blackmore showed him good land and settled there. However, all the settlers on this land eventually found their way out.\n\nAs a consequence, the old chap couldn't find his way out, so he had three nice daughters. The bachelors soon came calling for them, and their family never lacked company. The bachelors turned up in force. After this, the old man started looking for someone to marry. He fell ill, but some of them went about the same time.\n\nWe helped a neighbor shingle the roof of a log building. It was divided into two rooms by a long partition; there were doors between. The family used no floors in the partition. I believe now the family used to go outdoors before they could get inside. In order to avoid this, they put ladders each side of the partition and climbed up and down when visiting. Later, when the settler finally decided to cut a door in the partition, we helped numerous other bees, such as putting on sod roofs.\n\nThere were numerous other bees, such as putting on sod roofs. There were also many throughout building log barns and houses.\n\nGetting the work done.\n\nParties & Dances.\n\nThe first dance I attended was at the home of Ed Rincon. A man who had served his time on the old sailing ships eventually became a captain. On December 24th, 1906, he had a piano (the same one he Destroyed) which he played on. Also, there was a fiddle with piano provided. Everyone had a great time, and we played a game, cards were also played. The game was called Pig. We were just playing until we heard Ed say \"Come downstairs.\" While playing our game, George and Ed sat down at the piano, and George was asleep on the floor. I believe Ed said \"Come downstairs,\" when George's mother put up her hand. Another lady player thought it was funny and said \"What's so funny?\" She thought that the guest who was not laughing was Ed. However, she did not have any hopes, thinking Ed was indeed.\n\nEd suddenly discovered he was Pig.\nBess, on one occasion in 1909, we organized a bee.\n\nWe met at a local store, where we sold goods to the townspeople. We had a good time, and the people were very kind to us.\n\nOne day, we went to visit a friend who lived in another town. We had a wonderful time there, and we made many new friends.\n\nOn another occasion, we went to a nearby town to attend a festival. It was a very exciting event, and we enjoyed ourselves immensely.\n\nWe also attended a wedding, which was a very special occasion. The bride and groom were very happy, and we wished them well.\n\nIn conclusion, we had a wonderful year, and we look forward to many more adventures in the future.\n8.

Eleven bachelors all the cooking done by Jack.\n\nAbout the same time we had another story party at Walter Cox's, dance & cards, winding up with a huge plum pudding.\n\nHowever dances were few and far between more frequently until 1920 to 1925 when through the activities of the SGG a local many social gatherings were organized at the school and in farm homes.\n\nSix years old time fiddlers and dancers who got to know fiddlers were Norman McMenney Tom Foster Sam Foster Alex MacKenzie Andrew Fisher & others.\n\nBox Pic & Shadow Socials were very popular. Boxes were a work of art and were auctioned off at times being sold for $10.00 and $15.00 when two young fellows were fighting against one another. On occasion they would discover they had won just the girl they liked.\n\nThe late Alex McPhail President of the Earl Wheat Pool attended many of these gatherings.\n\nI believe that the atmosphere of good will, neighbourliness and real pleasure of these events of bygone days can never return because they were free of liquor.\n\nOn the advent of prohibition and the introduction of home brew, the character of social events rapidly changed and to a large extent prevailed today.\n\nAs a consequence schools are rarely used for dances now, because of damage caused in the past.\n\nDances consist of an occasional card party alone being held.\n\nPerhaps I should mention the Chautauquas of early years. They came to Levers in 1920 & 21 and attracted people from all over the country. The entertainment was exceptionally good. In 1922 I well remember an address given by Miss Parkhurst the British suffragette leader.\nPaul's Quince\n\nThen on Jan 18th 1907 I attended my first bachelor's party at Mr. Miller's home of Jack Miller's new year's party.

Many social gatherings were organized.\n\nIn 1920-1921 when the school was closed due to the flu epidemic and classes were held in the gymnasium, many social activities took place.\n\nThe Pale Ale, McPhail, President of the Social Club, attended many of these gatherings.\n\nHe always tried to make sure that everyone had a good time.\n\nAs a consequence, he was very popular among his fellow students.\n\nOn occasion, he would get into trouble.\n\nBut he always managed to get out of it.\n\nIn conclusion, I should mention that the students of early years they came to favor in 1920 and 1921 and all the people from all over the country were remembered an address exceptionally well.\n\nP.S. To Mrs. Penkhus, I am grateful for your kindness.\n12.

Brother did not show up for a while but said the noise was too much and the door opened when we all trooped in Cap. Ruvolon carrying a cream can on which were a number of shiny red herrings. Cap says \"Sit up Frank it is chilly\" but that cap opens the oven door and pops the herrings in after a while he opened the door to get more heat as he said but came a cloud of smoke. Frank's wife says \"That is that awful smell\" oh says cap we brought our supper along\" but they herrings were soon eaten outside where they were placed under the seat and in the engine block of an old car belonging to me of the party who on going home could smell the herrings but did not find them for some time a good lunch ended my one and only chivaree.\n\nSask Grain Growers Association Allenby Local.\n\nThe steps leading to its organization were brought about by the late Alex McPhail who at that time was actively working in the interest of agricultural life and its improvement.

It was a bit crowded, but we managed to find a few spots to sit and relax.\n\nWe also got to meet some new people who were there with their families. It was nice to see everyone enjoying themselves. The music was really good too, and we danced the night away.\n\nOverall, it was a wonderful day and we can't wait to go back next year!\n18.
