The result of this has been to make the outlook for the market less promising than it was at our last report. However, while the outlook for grain is not bright, the dairy business continues to show unusually good prices, and the same conditions in one case brings the highest price the market can pay. Mercantile trade is quiet and the weekly bank clearings do not continue to show the increase in the volume of trade they have done in the past. Interest rates are firmer.\n\nWheat.\n\nThe wheat market quickened about the 10th, and has since with fluctuations kept a little stronger. Our Chicago quotations for Sept. 25 were for No. 1, 78c.; No. 2, 74c.; Nov., 78c.; Nov., 78c. The local conditions point to the bulk of the crop going from No. 2 hard down to No. 3 medium, being exposed to rain. This has given the stocks a bad look; but in some districts the grain when threshed is not so bad as it looked. The chaff keeps the berry in fairly good condition. The barometer looks well today and the outlook for threshing is improved accordingly. Buyers will be sent out as soon as the weather settles.

But if you purpose growing seed oats for sale, sow\nThe following essay was awarded first prize in the competition for prizes offered by the Indian Head Agricultural Society. At some points we have taken the liberty to abridge it.\n\nThe oat crop of this district has for years been a comparative failure, the principal reason being that every decently prepared acre of our land has been given to wheat and only the poorest used for oats. If we want a decent crop of oats we must treat them decently. We must give them all the care we can consistently with due regard to the proper course for this district, soil and climate both being taken into account, is to have two grain crops alternating with a year under summer fallow.\n\nLooking to the conditions as we find them, I would recommend that half of the acreage intended for oats be sown on fallow, as soon after the first week of May the other half to be sown on fallow stubble \u2014 burned or unburned, ever, to dispense with burning stubble if possible. This can be done by either drilling in among stubble without cultivation if land is clean and free from native rubbish, or by cultivating stubble (Moose Jaw cultivator preferred) and sowing crosswise with disc drill.\n\nTo avoid the risk of mixing our oats with wheat or barley, I would use the stubble left by last year's oat crop. It is better to have two oat crops in succession than run the risk of having them mixed up with other grains, as is too commonly the case.\n\nShould it be found desirable to spring plow for the sake of keeping down quack grass, rosebushes, etc., it is important to plough as early in the season as possible, about three or four inches deep, harrow immediately after plowing, and sow as soon as a half day's snowed under.\n\n1. Do not bergridge.\n2. Sow sound, well seed.\n3. Sow on thin side of field two or three inches deep, harrow immediately after sowing, and sow as soon as a half day's snowed under.\n\nThe quality of seed oats is very important. Under no circumstances should frozen or heated oats be used \u2014 even though quite ripe. Formalin or bluetone should be given all seed of the latter being useless for purpose growing seed oats.\n\nThe quantity of seed to be sown is ample time for free sowing. The quantity of seed to be sown is given far too little thought, entering it is one of first importance. With wheat certain amount of plant variety is necessary. With wheat, a half-bushel per acre is sufficient. Many will have grown over 100 bushels per acre, but for home use, may be well ripened by harvesting, oats to moisture to carry to market. In harvesting, oats to field two or three inches deep, harrow immediately after sowing, and sow as soon as a half day's snowed under.\nOat Growing for the Qu'Appelle Valley.\n\nBy W. R. Motherwell, Abernethy,\n\nThe following essay was awarded first prize in the competition for the prizes offered by the Indian Head Agricultural Society. At some points we have taken the liberty to abridge it.\n\nThe oat crop of this district has for years been a comparative failure, the principal reason being that every decently prepared acre of our land has been given to wheat and only the poorest used for oats. If we want a decent crop of oats we must treat them decently. We must give them all the care we can consistently with due regard to the other crops of the farm, of which wheat is properly regarded as the most important. I take it for granted that the proper course for this district, soil and climate both being taken into account, is to have two grain crops alternating with a year under summer fallow.\n\nLooking to the conditions as we find them, I would recommend that half of the acreage intended for oats be sown on fallow, as soon after the first week of May as the condition of the soil will permit. The other half to be sown on fallow stubble \u2014 burned or unburned, cultivated or uncultivated, according to circumstances and requirements of each particular case.\n\nIf weeds, either annual or biennial, are feared, and the success of the present crop only be considered, then burn stubble, cultivate and sow the same time, as mentioned above. I like however, to dispense with burning stubble if possible. This can be done by either drilling in among stubble without cultivation if land is clean and free from native rubbish, or by cultivating stubble (Moose Jaw cultivator preferred) and sowing crosswise with disc drill.\n\nTo avoid the risk of mixing our oats with wheat or barley, I would use the green side. It is better to have two oat crops in succession than run the risk of having them mixed up with other grams, as is too commonly the case.\n\nShould it be found desirable to spring plow for the sake of keeping down quack grass, rosetistles, etc., it is important to plough as early in the season as possible, about three or four inches deep, harrow immediately after plowing, and sow as soon as a half days snowed under.\n\nTo summarize them:\n\n1. Do not beudgegeed plot of fallow for a good oat crop at least.\n2. Sow sound, well\n\n3. Sow on thin side.\nOat Growing for the Qu'Appelle Valley.\n\nBy W. R.
