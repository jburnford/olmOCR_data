Several died. Then every fall every one lived in terror of the prairie fires. Every one made fireguards to protect buildings and feed and even then as the red terror swept for miles across the open prairie we rushed out to renew our guards and make them wider.

So our three children used wet bogs and carried water.\n\n24. Did you travel about much in the early years? (for business, attending church, visiting friends, etc.) How often? How far?

That meant that each place had the entire crowd about once in 5 weeks unless weather was bad. In summer it was more or less like picnics. Our mode of travel was a team and wagon for 2 years or sleigh in winter. Later we bought a buggy. In several cases we had to drive 10 miles to get to our friend's homes.

Settled on a homestead 10 miles north of the village. I went there to stay for two years and left to work on the railway in the U.S.A. again.\n\n23. Is there any particular experience of pioneer days that stands out in your memory which you would like to record?\n\nThe terrible blizzards of 1886 lasted for days when our entire herd started off and in some cases stopping them out 10 weeks. Several died. Then very few sheep could be raised in those days. They were then so thin and weak that they could not stand the open prairie. We moved out three except for two miles across the open prairie. We opened up to renew our herds and make them winter. Our range was 50 miles wide by 100 miles long. We had to watch the weather and carry water. So we had to move our children over at night and keep them away from the sheep.\n\n24. Did you travel about much in the early years? For business, attending church, visiting friends, etc.? How often? How far?\n\nBy that means of travel.\n\nThere were five families from Idaho. We came here about six weeks earlier than we did. Our weather was very good and we had plenty of rain. Our range was 100 miles wide by 100 miles long. We had to drive 10 miles to a spring.

Indicate also what fraction of your total purchases were by mail order and any changes in the proportion of purchases made by mail order since the pioneer period.  \nIn 1913 I bought a very scratchy coat and a very tight sweater from the Simpson Co. at Toronto. I always hated both and we didn't know what we do now, that they could have been returned so we hesitated getting anything else for several years. Mother was a dressmaker by trade so we got along very well and of course we only had one best outfit so it wasn't too difficult to keep up with the new styles. My skirts and jumpers were always grey or brown because they were always made from my very large Uncle's trousers. I was thrilled to death when I grew too large for coast off.\n\n32.
