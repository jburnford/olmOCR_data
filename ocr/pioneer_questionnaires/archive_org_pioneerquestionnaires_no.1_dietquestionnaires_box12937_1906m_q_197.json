Lard etc in tins pails now in cardboard.\n\n17. Give a typical day's menu (breakfast, dinner & supper) for the earliest year you can remember.

So we did not have a special Xmas dinner till way later after having acquired the Canadian custom, and the wherewithal to make a dinner with.\n\n19. Were you ever reduced to almost starvation level living on one or two locally produced foods? Give details.\n\nYes, we were, but through no fault of the country. In the winter of 1906-1907 we ran completely out of \"grub.\" We did have provisions till the first of March, but this being a specially severe winter it lasted much longer. What happened then and how we got through, is another tale; The main thing is we're here to tell the tale.\nOur first heavy order from Cabin Womper came mostly in strong tin containers. For milk and tea, coffee, etc., chunky stitch etc. Now all this comes in cardboard and paper. Dried fruit came in tins also, now also in cardboard. Land etc. in tin packs now in cardboard.\n\n17.

Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\nThere is not any outstanding difference in preparation, that I can see, only we cook a little more elaborate, you might call it. And of course the pressure cookers and the new aluminum utensils make it slightly different.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homestead and home prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible).\n\nLiving as we do, on a farm, I cannot say that we rely on purchased or prepared food, only that we have some of it on our shelves to either round out our home-grown stuff, or to use in case of emergency like \"sudden\" visitors or such.\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include items not mentioned above, quality, methods of merchandising, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. (Use back of page if more space is needed).\n\nLooking at the above question, I'm afraid that you have but a hazy idea of the situation in the early years. Even when the town of Outlook was built in 1907, I believe, the only way to buy groceries was for us to take butter and eggs in there (20 miles) and trade in the store for staple groceries. It was not so much a question of what you wanted as to make that do, what you could get for your produce. Afterwards when the railroad connected us with Saskatoon, and we started to ship cream to the creameries there, we could buy a little better. Also by that time the grocer's shelves were a little better stocked.\nThere is not any outstanding difference in the preparation of meals in the \nwinter. I have no regretted with them.\n\nThere is not any outstanding difference in preparing \nwhen that I can see, only we cook a little more\u2014 \nelaborate upon might call it. And of course the \npressure cookers and the new aluminum utensils \nmake it slightly different.\n\n12. Would you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead \nof home grown? (Olive oil, canned goods, etc., are \nnot perishable.)\n\nHaving as we do, on a farm, I cannot say that we \nrely on purchased or prepared food only that we \nhave some of our own shelves to rely around \nour own home grown stuff, or to use in case of \nsudden visitors or such.\n\nLooking at the above question, I am afraid that \nyou have but a happy idea of the situation in \nthe early years. Even when the town of Pullman \nwas built in 1907 I believe the only way to buy \nprovisions was for us to take butter and eggs in \n(20 miles) and trade on the store for staple groceries.\n\nIt was not so much a question of what you wanted \nas to make that do what you could get for your \ndollars when the railroad connected us with \nJackson, and not started to ship cream to the \ncrematories there, we could buy a little better \nby that time the grocer's shelves were stocked.\nI would be pleased to hear how this venture works out and what response people made to it.
