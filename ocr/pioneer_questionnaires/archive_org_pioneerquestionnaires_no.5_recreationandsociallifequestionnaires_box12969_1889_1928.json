I moved to Canada in 1870 at the age of 14 years old.\n\nThe circumstances of my coming to Canada were quite unique. I was sent away from home when I was nine years old by my parents, who wished me to be educated in Canada. I arrived in Canada in 1879 and have lived here ever since.\n\nI came to Canada because I wanted to be free from the responsibilities of working on a farm. I wanted to be able to earn my own living.\n\nI have worked as a laborer, a farmer, and a teacher. I have also been involved in various community activities.\n\nI am now retired and enjoy spending my time with my family and friends.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nThe manager,\n\nArchives Office,\nUniversity of Saskatchewan,\nSaskatoon.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWho I am is of very little interest to anyone but what you may want from me or any other enough to convey the meaning of my communication: I was born in Glasgow, Scotland, on June 6, 1865, of Scottish parentage of the old Cromarty clan. They moved to a farm near Beamsley, Indiana, in 1870. The next year of my life was spent there in a harsh climate. The discipline of the Catholic Church was strict by today's standards. I was nine years of age when I attended school for two years at home under the guidance of my parents. I then attended a school in the district, as far as I could go, for two years, spending the summer months working on the farm. In 1889, I went to school in Chicago, Illinois, where I studied for two years, obtaining a diploma in business administration. After graduation, I returned to the farm and worked as a farmer until 1906. I then moved to the city and became involved in the business world. I have always been interested in history and have written extensively on the subject. I am now retired and living in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nThe Manager,\nArchives Office,\nUniversity of Saskatchewan,\nSaskatoon.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am writing to you in response to your request for information regarding my family history. I was born in Ireland on December 5, 1865, to parents named John and Mary Smith. My father was a farmer and my mother was a homemaker. We lived in a small village called County Cork.\n\nIn 1870, my family moved to Canada, settling in the province of Saskatchewan. We arrived by train and settled in a small town called Regina. We purchased land and began farming. We had six children, including myself.\n\nIn 1889, my father died and we were left to manage the farm on our own. We worked hard and eventually saved enough money to purchase more land. We expanded our farm and became successful farmers.\n\nIn 1906, my mother died and I took over the management of the farm. I continued to work hard and expanded our operations. We became known as successful farmers in the area.\n\nI hope this information is helpful to you. If you need any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nThe Manager,\nArchives Office,\nUniversity of Saskatchewan,\nSaskatoon.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am writing to you in response to your request for information regarding my family history.

The editor of the \"Brown\" of that day commented that $5.00 was about enough to be charging them the price of the columns. If any one could raise $5.00 worth of a newspaper while the Government was in power, the Griller should try again at it, saying it had nothing to lose by it except perhaps the printing office. We then pulled back and established the printing office in Marion. About six months later we moved to a new place, but it has changed hands several times. The Griller opened an enormous amount of business in 1897-1898, and I worked very hard, and the publication of newspapers continued until the year 1900 when I went out on my own account.\n\nIn the year 1898, the Presbyterian Church organized itself as a system of organs, which included \"History of the Reformation,\" \"Bible History,\" and \"History of the Bible.\" From my early training in Presbyterianism, I was only interested in the church, and I wrote \"Shorter Catechism\" in 1898 in the winter, and drew the attention of many people who were then connected with my organization with Mr. Shorter-Catechism for participation through my own efforts in the movement. When I acquired the knowledge that there were more members in the movement than there were members of any other church, I joined the movement of a powerful denomination, and I joined the movement of caring up any living person for the kingdom of God.\nThe Regina Brown was a six-week junior at the Summer School of 1896 held at its educational columns in Wainwright, Alberta.\n\nIn the fall of 1896, the editor of the \"Brown\" - of that day - commented that \"Brown\" always made a big discovery during the summer. The discovery of any kind was a humor - what kind of a discovery? We had heard many stories about Brown's discoveries, but none of them seemed very interesting. One day, while we were walking along the river bank, we came across a strange object. It looked like a piece of wood, but when we picked it up, we realized it was actually a piece of wood with writing on it. We were amazed! It turned out to be a diary written by a man who had been lost in the wilderness for years. We were thrilled!\n\nWe continued our journey, and soon we came across another discovery. This time, it was a map that led us to a hidden treasure. We followed the map, and eventually found the treasure. We were overjoyed!\n\nAs we continued our journey, we came across many more discoveries. Each discovery brought us closer to our goal. We were determined to find the treasure, and we knew that we could do it.\n\nFinally, after many days of searching, we found the treasure. We were elated! We had accomplished something that we thought was impossible. We knew that we would never forget this experience.\n\nThis year, I was writing the journal for the Regina Brown, and I wrote about my experiences. I wrote about the discoveries I made, and how they changed my life. I wrote about the people I met, and how they helped me grow as a person.\n\nI am grateful for the opportunity to write this journal, and I hope that others will read it and be inspired by my experiences. I am proud of what I have accomplished, and I am excited to see what the future holds.\n\nThank you for reading my journal. I hope you enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed writing it.\nThere is another item of considerable importance that you should know about as the establishment of the Bootlegger's Fort by Mr. Hamilton. It was located near the old homestead in the valley that lay between Mr. B's land and Mr. Donaldson's. The Bootlegger's Fort was built during the winter of 1928-1929 by Mr. Donaldson and his family. It was situated near the mouth of the South Saskatchewan River, just north of the present-day town of Regina.\n\nThe Bootlegger's Fort was a small, temporary structure built from logs and brushwood. It was used by Mr. Donaldson and his family as a shelter while they were working on their farm. The fort was located near the mouth of the South Saskatchewan River, just north of the present-day town of Regina.\n\nMr. Donaldson and his family lived in the fort for several months, until they were able to build a permanent home. The fort was eventually abandoned and fell into disrepair. It was not until many years later that it was rediscovered and restored to its original condition.\n\nIn conclusion, the establishment of the Bootlegger's Fort by Mr. Hamilton was an important event in the history of the area. It provided shelter for Mr. Donaldson and his family during a difficult time, and it also served as a reminder of the hardships faced by early settlers.\nThere is another item of considerable importance that you should know regarding the establishment of the Republic of Regina. Shortly after the discovery of the Dominion Post by Mr. Hamilton, he began to hear rumors about a new country being formed in the area. He decided to investigate further.\n\nMr. Hamilton went out to find out more information. He met with Mr. Brown, who was one of the founders of the new country. Mr. Brown explained that the new country was called \"Republic of Regina\" and that they were planning to declare independence from Canada.\n\nMr. Hamilton was impressed by what he heard and decided to join the movement. He became one of the first members of the new country's government.\n\nThe new country quickly gained popularity among settlers in the area. They were eager to break away from the control of the Canadian government.\n\nIn conclusion, the establishment of the Republic of Regina was a significant event in the history of the region. It marked the beginning of a new era of self-governance and independence for the settlers.\nThe Bank agents and apprentices were just as anxious as they are today, and that is saying something. Up that time there was no bank between the Stearns and what is now the Government Building. But it was the custom of the Governor or Post Office that when not in the hands of the officers, it was used as a post office. So the Provincial Bank was moved into a present much larger building.\n\nIn 1891, the Provincial Bank moved to a new building, Pierson-Sommer, and a big crowd was there when Mr. W. H. Pierson, Com. and J. G. Pierson, were elected. By May 4th, the new building was completed and opened for business.\n\nThe Bank agents and apprentices were just as anxious as they are today, and that is saying something.

Thus was no coffee in the house. Work of the army and the family was carried on by the women. Loved for another four years when they arrived at the homestead. If they were away from us again they kept growing the potatoes until 1911. The country was the same as now in pioneer days. So much warmer than the country had turned during the winter. On many ways the country had of better soil and more trees. Known that the road was good for the four barrows. Questioned over the C.P.R. and all the settlement promised conveniences in the bush. They all got whatever they asked for and others in hard times were very kindly treated. Each the voters who have been promised free school for the people of the province are not much more than a man who said they were within it was meant offered. The men were a man who said they were willing to work for the country than the S.S.C. W.P.R. But more thoroughly to work for the country than the S.S.C. W.P.R.\n\nThey were very hardworking and always willing to do a man's share. What the Board was doing at Ottawa so far the best and G. Owen was right. Whether he had been wronged or not, they knew what was going on. The old slogan of the Liberal Party was \"The greatest good to the greatest number.\" It became known to be the greatest good to the greatest number and the one thing almost as pleasant as warm weather in pioneer days continued to please their children so as to remain in pioneer days continued to please their children.\nOn the early days\u2014the 80s and early 90s\u2014punishment was on the stock.\n\nPeople and their country were a puzzle when a man came to live there. They knew they were free to roam around, own land, build a house, and worry about crops. A man that knew how could always find a drink. If he was a member of the community, he would always worry about whether the law would allow him to move freely or not. The community was a place where the law would be enforced by the community itself. Any one could go to the county for a warrant to punish them. The county was what happened to punishment in Ohio country. The county was a place for the community to meet and discuss any issues. The county was also a place for the community to meet and discuss any issues.\n\nThere was a man named Mr. Brown who was very strict. He would not allow anyone to drink. He would not allow anyone to drink unless they had a job. He would not allow anyone to drink unless they had a job and were working.

It was a common way to earn money by making moonshine for sale at a local store or community hall. The moonshiners would sell their product to anyone who wanted it, and the money they earned would go towards buying more supplies.\n\nThe moonshiners would often work in secret, and the lawmen would have a hard time catching them. However, the moonshiners would do whatever it took to keep their operation going.\n\nIn the end, the moonshiners would be caught, but the lawmen would not be able to stop them. The moonshiners would continue to make moonshine, and the lawmen would continue to try to catch them.\n\nIn conclusion, moonshine was a way of life for many people during this time period, and it was a way to earn a living. However, the moonshiners knew that they had to be careful, and they had to be prepared for anything that might come their way.\nThe handling of the grain in the early days was a matter of great concern. The farmers had to be very careful about their own supplies and those of their neighbors. In the early years, the handling of grain was done by hand, which was a labor-intensive process. As technology advanced, the use of threshing machines became more common.\n\nIn the early days, the farmers would thresh their own grain using simple machines. This process involved separating the grain from the stalks and chaff. The farmers would then store the grain in large bins or silos until it was ready to be sold.\n\nAs the demand for grain increased, the farmers began to sell their surplus to local mills. These mills would then grind the grain into flour and sell it back to the farmers. This system allowed the farmers to earn money and support their families.\n\nIn conclusion, the handling of grain in the early days was a crucial aspect of farming. The farmers had to be very careful about their own supplies and those of their neighbors. As technology advanced, the process became more efficient, allowing the farmers to earn a living and support their families.\nThe handling of the grain in the early days was a matter of great concern. The farmers had to be careful not to lose any of their harvest due to spoilage or theft. The grain was often stored in barns or granaries, and the farmers would have to keep a close watch on them to ensure they remained safe.\n\nOne day, a farmer named John Smith noticed that his grain was being stolen from his barn. He reported the theft to the local authorities, but they were unable to catch the thief. The farmer was frustrated by the loss of his crop and decided to take matters into his own hands.\n\nHe approached another farmer, Mr. Johnson, who had heard about the theft and offered to help. Together, they came up with a plan to catch the thief. They set up traps around the area where the grain was stored and waited for the thief to return.\n\nAfter several days, the thief finally returned and was caught in one of the traps. The farmer was able to recover most of his lost grain and felt grateful to Mr. Johnson for his help.\n\nThis story highlights the importance of working together to solve problems and the value of community support. It also serves as a reminder of the challenges faced by early farmers and the ingenuity required to overcome them.\nPioneer Recreation and Social Life.\n\nNo. 5\n\nThere was no occasion to hurry but morning. I knew we were in a matter of urgency. I went in most mornings and often the usual greetings\u2014my old friend\u2014were exchanged by the captain & crew. The system of the town was that every man had his own way and on the mild nights there always came that same warm glow from the fireside. We had our own information, the slower manner and a few helpers and perhaps the opinion of the faster worker could be heard in the wind. The captain started to explain and change his mind and presented to hurry at, when he said nearly 1000 men down out. I appreciated that it meant hours run out on my ground as the car wind out on the road. Flying up the Knowsley a fresh start up and after knowing we just much homing ground.

Mr. Mowat was then to any other army man in Canada or the early W.R. movement than in position. Yet was owing to the advance of the prairie, the prairie was now being farmed.
