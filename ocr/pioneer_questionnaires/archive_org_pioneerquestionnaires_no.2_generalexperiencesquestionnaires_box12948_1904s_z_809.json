Traquair James Miller\nPIONEER EXPERIENCES\n\nIt is difficult to prepare a general questionnaire on pioneer life because no individual who is asked to answer it has exactly the same experiences as another. Some of the questions here will not apply to your experiences; others may prove impossible for you to answer, so don't worry about leaving blank spaces.\n\nDon't hesitate to give more than one answer, or to describe particular events, if they help you answer the questions.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada for ten years or more, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should vote to them on separate sheets or reply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nSaskatchewan Archives questionnaires which have been prepared or projected are listed below.
