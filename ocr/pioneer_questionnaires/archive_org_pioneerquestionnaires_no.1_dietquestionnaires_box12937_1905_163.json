Water usually supplied the keeper.\n\nRegarding water supply, mention any changes which have taken place since you first started housekeeping, giving dates where possible.\n\nLater hauled a mile by barrel - 1910 from slough until well was dug on homestead. In 1910 two wells were dug - about 20 ft deep - one in house well - one in barn well. Both excellent water, and plentiful. Used a pail on rope pulley to obtain water.

WRAPPINGS AND CONTAINERS\n\nMention any changes which you recall in the wrappings and containers received with the food you purchased (give dates where possible). In the early years, nearly all food was bought by bulk from plain wrappers. Later years advertising became important and we bought foods because of their label - fancy wrapping. The old style tasted just as good.\n\nSunday breakfast - pancakes, hot water, fried eggs\n\n17. Give a typical day's menu (breakfast, dinner and supper) for the earliest year you can remember. Give the year and list the members of the family with their ages at the time. State the approximate month, e.g., winter or summer.\n\nYear 1925:\nBreakfast: rolled oat porridge, milk sugar, fried potatoes, and egg (or meat pate), coffee, no sweets.\n\nDinner: Meat, potatoes, vegetable, pickles, pie or pudding, little bite of bread (brown bread), baked in oven. Also pie or cake.\n\nSupper: Meat, fried potatoes, I or bread with tea. Fruit (preserved if on hand) or hot apple made from apple, water, and placed over stale steamed bread.\n\n18.

List those present and give their approximate ages at the time.\n\nChicken, potatoes, dressing, gravy, turkey, carrot pie, similar pumpkin, pickles.\n\nMother: 36 yrs.\nFather: 38 yrs.\nFour children - age 6, 5, 2, and \u00bd year old (all girls)\n\n19. Were you ever reduced to almost starvation level living on one or two locally produced foods? Give details.\n\nFor instance, we bought quantities of food with no money, and my parents sold food in parcels for a few weeks. Here were times when we were starved for fresh fruit and vegetables, meat, but needed for our existence length of time. We have lived for months on both rice, eggs, but always had flour, milk, butter, etc. From 1910 on we supplemented our diet with wild game and fish. Helped relieve an otherwise monotonous diet.\n16. WRAPPINGS AND CONTAINERS\nMention any changes which you recall in the wrappings and containers used.\n\n17. Give a typical day's menu (breakfast, dinner and supper) for the earliest year that you can recall. Give the year and list the members of the family or household who ate at the table. State the approximate month, e.g., winter or summer.\n\nYear 1905:\nBreakfast - eggs (as many as possible), coffee.\n\nDinner - meat, potatoes, vegetables, pie, milk.\n\nSupper - meat, potatoes, vegetables, pie, milk.\n\n18. What year did you serve your first Christmas dinner in Western Canada? 1906.\n\nGive the season. List those present and give their approximate ages at the time.\n\nChristmas dinner, gravy, turkey, cranberry sauce.\n\nMyself, 3 yr. old; age 4, 5, 3, and 2 years. (Children)\n\n19. Were you ever reduced to almost starvation level living on one or two locally produced foods? Give details.\n\nNo, never. We always had plenty of food.\n\nIf you were ever forced to live on a certain diet, describe what it was like.\n\nWe lived on bread and tea for a while during the war.\n\nIf you had to live on a certain diet, describe how it affected your health.\n\nWe didn't have much variety in our diet.\n\nIf you ever had to make do without luxuries, describe how it affected your life.\n\nWe had to be very careful about our expenses.\n20. Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today. The modern generation has far more variety in food stuffs, etc., than they did in cooking utensils; nevertheless, the old art of meal preparation is gone. My husband and his children-in-law have had too many outside interests, and food is hurriedly prepared and eaten. There seems to be no food craving\u2014perhaps because all have a well-balanced diet.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homegrown and home-prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible.) Always relied on home grown and home prepared foods as much as possible, until 1925, when my husband died and I went to live with my children. In 1910, our garden was planted on acreage, and we had little fresh produce. Bought more food from store often.\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include items not mentioned above, quality, methods of merchandising, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. (Use back of page if more space is needed).\n\nFor several years I baked bread for several families. They would buy two or three pounds each of flour. I would have one sack in payment for baking the other sack. This was fine, but seemed as if I was always preparing extra meal for the bachelor when they came for their bread. Storage was always a problem as milk were plentiful. However, a flour sifter usually took care of that. Dried foods were kept in tight wooden containers, usually under the bed-boards.\n20.
