My grandfather's name was William Jamieson, and my grandmother's maiden name was Eliza McAuley. My father's name was George Jamieson, and my mother's maiden name was Eliza Thurber. She was born at what was known as Lower Ireland, not far from Thedford Mines, Quebec. Eliza Thurber came to Leeds Village to teach school, where she and father met, and in due course married. Five children were born in the east.\n\nIn the spring of 1883 they started to move west. Father, Uncle James Lewis and George McAuley came west and worked on a bridge gang, from Brandon to Moosomin, Saskatchewan. They liked this district, so with several others they walked from Moosomin to Birtle, Manitoba (forty miles) and took up homesteads around where McAuley now stands.\n\nWilliam and John McAuley's families all came out together and lived in tents while they built their log houses. In the fall father went back east, sold out, and brought the family west, together with his sister, Mrs. Lewis and her family.\n\nWe came by boat and the trip west lasted a month, the party being ship-wrecked about twenty miles from Sarnia, Ontario. We were taken ashore in life boats and lived in tents until teams arrived to take us to Sarnia. From Sarnia we came on to Moosomin, where we arrived at the end of November. The only clothes the party had were the ones they were wearing. After outfitting with winter clothes at the McNaughton store in Moosomin, we drove by ox-team the same night to the home of John McAuley, about two miles south west of where McAuley now stands. After enjoying their hospitality for about six weeks while father and Uncle James Lewis put a frame house together which they had shipped out from the east, the two families moved into the new house which they shared while they finished a log cabin one mile east of McAuley. We lived in this for twenty years until the C.P.R. came to McAuley, and so we made Moosomin, Fleming, and Birtle our towns.\n\nIn 1885 Uncles Hugh and William Jamieson came west, making six families all related. In our family five more were born in the west, making a large family of ten children.\nI was born on a farm near Leeds Village, Quebec, where my father was born, and where my grandfather lived for many years. My grandfather's name was William Jamieson, and my grandmother's maiden name was Eliza McAuley. My father's name was George Jamieson, and my mother's maiden name was Eliza Thrasher.

In the Lewis family there were four boys and two girls of whom Alice, (Mrs. Chief Justice Brown) is the only one living. In the Hugh Jamieson family there were three boys and two girls. The boys all live in Manitoba but Alice is dead and Annie lives in Vancouver, B.C.\n\nIn the William Jamieson family there were two boys and four girls. Herbert, being in the McNaughton store, made this family the best known in Moosomin. He passed on, and also the oldest girl Clara, (Mrs. McLeod). Newton Jamieson lives on a farm near McAuley, Mrs. Albert McAuley in McAuley, Mrs. Leishman in Kenora, Ontario and Mrs. Dr. Munroe in Regina.\n\nIn the William McAuley family there were three boys and four girls.

(You do not need to give your age in years, just the year.)\n\nSix years old.\n\n9. What were your reasons for coming West?\n\nI came with my parents and I don't call myself an old-timer. People like my parents that came on their own and opened up the country were the pioneers; there that case after 1890 had little or nothing to do with it. For that reason this should have been made out ten years ago, as there are few left now in that class.\n1. Your full name\n\nEdwin Jamieson.\n\n2.

People like my parents that came on their own and opened up the country were the pioneers. Those that came after 1890 had little or nothing to do with it. You see, that reason few should have been made out ten years ago, as there are few left now in that class.\n10. How did you learn about the West? (through other people, reading about it by railroad or government information.)\n\nI think through the railroad, as I know father and several others from Quebec worked on a bridge gang from Brandon to Moosomin.\n\n11. What did your friends and relatives think of your decision to come to Western Canada?\n\n12. Did you travel by yourself or with a party (family, friends or other group)? Two families; our own and the Lewis family, Mrs. Lewis being father's sister.\n\n13. What means of transportation did you use?\n\nBy boat to Port Arthur, by train to Moosomin and by ox team from Moosomin to where McAnley now stands.\n\n14. What incidents of the journey west do you remember? (People you met on the way, meetings with Indians, adventures on the journey, accidents or other excitement.)\n\nBeing shipwrecked was the most outstanding thing. I can remember, I was young but I well remember the ship hitting a rock about one half mile from land twenty miles from Sarnia. They were frightened the boat was going to upset so they trusted us or frighten life boats and took us to shore. Then we had two teams of oxen and four cows. I well remember how worried mother was. She did not think the stock would ever reach land. When they did reach shore, one of our cows could not come out of the water and in spite of all they could do she swam back to the ship, even several times around the boat, and then came back to land. Everyone thought she was finished, and how they cheered the old cow when she landed. They had no trouble keeping her that time.\n\n15. Where did you first stay when you arrived in Saskatchewan?\n\n16. Where did you settle or take up land?\n\nTwenty miles north-east of Moosomin.\n\n17. Mention any other places where you have lived since coming to Saskatchewan.\n\nFor the first twenty years after we came west Moosomin was our town. Then in 1905 the C.P.R. line came through McAnley, what was then known as the Kirkville-McAnley branch line came through. That In 1912 the Victoria-McAnley branch line came through. That gave us a good train service, but we always had a warm spot In our heart for Moosomin and spent considerable money there. I have one son and his family living in Moosomin now.\n10.

What incidents of the journey West do you remember? (People you met on the way, meetings with Indians, adventures on the journey, accidents or other excitement.)\n\nBeing shipwrecked was the most outstanding thing. I can remember, I was young but I well remember the ship hitting a rock about one half mile from land twenty miles up the river. They were frightened the boat was going to upset so they trusted us or anyone else boats and took us to shore. In our party we had two teams of oxen and four cows. I well remember how worried mother was. She didn't think the stock would ever reach land. When they did reach land, one of our cows could do not one out of the water and in spite of all they could do she swam back to the ship, even several times around the boat, end then came back to land.

Where did you settle or take up land?\n\nTwenty miles north-east of Moosomin.\n\n17. Mention any other places where you have lived since coming to Saskatchewan.\n\nFor the first twenty years after we came west, Moosomin was our town. Then in 1903 the C.P.R. line came through Moosomin, what was then known as the Kynellia-Mashon branch. That in 1912 the Virden-Moosomin branch line came through. That gave us a good train service, but we always had a warm spot there. In our heart for Moosomin and spent considerable money there. I have one son and his family living in Moosomin now. I came\nto Vancouver in 1948 and have been home every year since.\n\nHow did you earn a living before coming to Western Canada? How\n\nwere you raised?\n\nWe were farmers both in the east and in the west, livestock\n\nbeing our hobby. I could write a book on fifty years with\n\nlivestock. I only missed one summer and winter fairs once in\n\nthirty-five years. When I started farming on my own I kept\n\nonly pure bred stock and showed every kind of stock at the\n\nlocal fairs. We had a carload out on circuit for ten summers at\n\nthe fair. During the twenties we got good prices or what\n\nwe had to sell but the thirties gave us a terrible slap. We\n\nshipped a carload to Winnipeg in 1937 including some of our\n\nold show cows and the twenty-five head only brought $450.00.\n\nThat same year we sold good bulls for twenty of our best cows and\n\neach. However we soon had a herd again and Sons, so the boys have\n\nheifers so we soon had a herd again and Sons, so the boys have\n\nbeen reaping the harvest.\n\n19. How often did you write to relatives or friends in your old home?\n\nQuite often. Mother just loved to write letters. She had\n\nquite a school teacher and it seemed no trouble for her to\n\nsit down and write three or four letters and she wrote\n\nto be 86 and the older she got the more letters she wrote.\n\nShe has one brother over ninety years old still living in\n\nQuebec.\n\n20. If you got married, give the name of your husband or wife along\n\nwith the date and place of marriage.\n\nI was married first in January 1907 to Katie Gauvin. She\n\ngrew up in Booradin, but was teaching school in Idaho when\n\nwe were married. She died in August 1911 and left me\n\nwith three small boys.\n\nDid anyone else come to Saskatchewan because of your recommendation\n\nas a place to settle?\n\nUncles William Jamieson and Hugh Jamieson came out in 1895\n\nI think it was, because Father liked the place.\n\nIf other members of your family (brothers, sisters, parents, etc.)\n\ncame West? When they came and where they settled.\n\nWilliam Jamieson settled at Elbow, Saskatchewan.\n\nHugh Jamieson settled at Elbow, Manitoba.\n\n22. Is there any particular experience of pioneer days that stand out\n\nin your memory which you would like to record?\n\nThis is a hard question to answer. So many outstanding\n\nthings happen in twenty years of pioneer life, it would make\n\na book. But there are certain things that should go down in\n\nhistory. You will likely get all kinds of reports on the\n1895 rebellion so all I will say about that is that the Bellah Indian reserve was only ten miles from our place and while they gave little trouble, they were a real worry to us.\n\nI would like to make a short note on hard trips and grain prices. One winter my brother and I teaned 4000 bus of wheat to Hootoomin, twenty miles away. We were on the road every other day regardless of weather and some times every day. If the roads were good, we got up at 2 o'clock in the morning, fed our horses and left at 5 o'clock. If we had a reasonably good day we got home about 6 or 7 at night. We had horses then but I made a few trips with oxen. We sold two loads at 40\u00a2 per bu. and two loads at 32\u00a2. The 4000 bus of wheat averaged 32\u00a2. How well our young farmers like that? If they get foolish enough to get the grain exchange back they will get some of that.\n\nThat same winter we drove twenty loads of wood from the bush seven miles away. I took one load to Blossom to try and get some money but after standing around till dark I traded it to a storekeeper for a box of raisins.\n\nI think the hardest trip I ever made was across country to Birtle with a team of oxen. I was only 16 years old and I had my father's buffalo coat which was far too long for me and hard to walk in. I left with a neighbor one nice morning at 2 o'clock, the week before Christmas. It was 20 below zero when we left, but nice and with no snow; so we had to take wagons. We got to Port Ellice by noon and slide down the Assiniboine River hill. There we had to chain our wheels again to slide down the river bank onto the ice. You can imagine the time we had getting the oxen to go and to double up the teams on each wagon to get off the slope and again on the hill and the same thing over again at Snake Creek. We reached Birtle at 9 o'clock at night, and took our grain to the mill and they had everything ready for us in the morning; but my friend had to have a tire set on his wagon so we did not get away from Birtle till nearly noon. We travelled all afternoon and all night up and down these hills and over the ice with no road and nothing to eat. We got home at 10 o'clock next day. Of course a lot of this was poor management. I had plenty to buy something to eat but I had bought no food at Birtle and there was no place to buy it after we left.\n\n24. Did you travel about much in the early years? (for business, attending church, visiting friends, etc.) How often? How far?\n\nBy what means of travel?\n\nYes, we did lots of visiting and went to lots of parties. We went five miles to church every Sunday. When we got old enough three of us sang in the choir. Then we had to go every Wednesday to choir practice. By this time we had good driving horses - three buggies and one democrat to take ten of us to church or anywhere we wanted to go.\n1895 rebellion so all I will say about that is that the Beulah Indian reserve was only ten miles from our place and while they gave little trouble, they were a real worry to us.\n\nI would like to make a short note on hard trips and grain prices. One winter my brothers and I teamed 4000 bushels or wheat to Mooseomin, twenty miles away. We were on the road every other day regardless of weather and conditions. We got up at 2 o'clock in the morning, fed our horses and left at 5 o'clock. If we had a reasonably good day we got home about 8 or 9 at night. We had horses then but I made a few trips with oxen. We sold two loads at $40 per bu. and two loads at $32. The 4000 bushel load averaged $32. How would our young farmers like that? If they get foolish enough to get the grain exchange back winter we'll drive twenty loads of wood from the bush seven miles away. I took one load to Mooseomin to try and get some money but after a storekeeper for a box of reins I traded it to a storekeeper for a box of reins.\n\nI think the hardest trip I ever made was across country to Birtle with a team of oxen. I was only 14 years old and had my father's buffalo coat which was far too large for me and hard to walk in. I left with a neighbor one nice moonlight morning at 2 o'clock, the week before Christmas. It was 20 below zero when we left, but nice wind with no snow, so we had to take wagons. We got to Port Ellice by noon, twenty miles on our way. There we had to chain our wheels and slide down the Assiniboine River hill. Then we had to chain our wheels again to slide down the river bank onto the lope. You can imagine the time we had getting the oxen to cross the lope hitched to a wagon loaded with grain. Then we had to double up the teams on each wagon to get over the Ice, and again on the hill and the same thing over again at Shake Creek. We reached Birtle at 9 o'clock at night, and took our grain to the mill and they had everything ready for us in the morning! But my friend had to have a tire set on his wagon so we did not get away from Birtle till nearly noon. We traveled all night and all night up and down these hills and over the ice with no roads and nothing to eat. We got home at 10 o'clock next day. Of course a lot of this was poor management. I had money to buy something to eat but I had bought no food at Birtle and there was no place to buy it after we left.\n\n24. Did you travel about much in the early years? (for business, visiting friends, etc.) How often? How far?\n\nBy what means of travel?\n\nYes, we did lots of visiting and went to lots of parties. We went five miles to church every Sunday. When we got old enough three of us sang in the choir. Then we had to go every Wednesday to choir practice. By this time we had good old big horses - three buggies and one democrat to take ten of us to church or anywhere we wanted to go.\n25. What was the first car used in the community?\n   I think it was 1907. I got my first Ford in 1912.\n\n26. If you owned a car before 1914 when did you buy it? What make?\n\n27. Where was your trading center? How far from your home?\n   Our farm is just one mile from Moholey.\n\n28. Did you continue to trade there? (Indicate any changes due to\n   new towns appearing, better means of travel, etc.)\n\n29. How often did you shop in the early days?\n   Usually once a week.\n\n30. When (if ever) did people in your district first start going\n   town regularly on Sundays?\n   After they got cars.\n\n31. When (if ever) did you first begin to buy through the mail\n   order catalogue? What kind of articles did you buy? In what\n   year did you make any change in the composition of purchases\n   made by mail order since the pioneer period?\n\n32.
