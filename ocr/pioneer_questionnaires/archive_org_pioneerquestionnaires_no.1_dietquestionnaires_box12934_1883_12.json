For breakfast:\nDinner, boiled rabbit, and cubes of fat pork, and B Powder dumplings and dessert of more molasses. Butter B Powder turns hard because no butter for several years, some boiled buckwheat, very little sugar, perhaps some dried apples. Some cold beans, possibly some cold boiled pork belly. These times were the painful dishes for poor people and with all these luxuries we never complained. Later when we got a cow or cows, we would milk milk and butter. I recall that the first event, a little Pigeon Chicken saved my life at a crucial time.\n\n18. What year did you serve your first Christmas dinner in western Canada?\n\nRabbits, meat, fish. The menu. List those present and give their approximate ages at that time.\n\nFather & mother, between 40 and 50\nSister II, myself 8, Brother 6, sister 4.

Give details.\n\nRabbits saved our lives without them, we children might have gone under. In the following summers we lived better. Black chicken flowers, Black birds and the occasional beaver helped out, but the beaver was an oily thing nauseating meat, it took a strong stomach to handle it, personally I preferred beaver or muskrat.\n17. Give a typical story, who (or what) was there? What happened? How did it end?\n\n18. Describe a meal you cooked or ate recently.\n\n19. How do you feel about living in our country?\n16. **TRAPPINGS AND CONTAINERS**\n\nDescribe any changes which you recall in the trappings and containers received with the food you purchased (give dates where possible).\n\n---\n\n17. Give a typical day's menu (breakfast, dinner & supper) for the earliest year you can remember. Give the year and list the members of the family with their ages at the time. State the approximate month, e.g., winter or summer.\n\nIn 1863, anything you could get but fed scarcely and the grease thrown over a fire. For breakfast, I had breakfast, dinner, boiled rabbit, and cuber of fat pork, and a brown dumpling and dessert of more molasses. Dinner B. B. had two hashpans no butter for several years, some boiled vegetables, very little sugar, perhaps some dried apples. Some cold beans, possibly some cold boiled pork belly.

What was the most common food eaten by your family during the Depression?\n\n19. How did you handle the lack of food?\n20. Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\nThe meals eaten in the earlier years were greatly less edible than present fare, and I have heard men claim that on pioneer food, a man was much better off. Gradually as livestock increased, the standard of living improved until today, we live in luxury. And kings or politicians live on the same foods as the ordinary man's families of today.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homestead and home prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible).\n\nThese changes have come so gradually that it is impossible to give data. Today our foods are semi-prepared, semi-cooked, less and less cooking is done by all walks of life. Housekeeping is so simplified that there is nothing to it; whereas in the early days you had to hunt and kill before you ate, and live off the land. I was a pioneer, I saw the whole experience of life and death, both plenty and semi-starvation. I would not wish to live it again. Incidentally, the good old days never existed.\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Eastern Canada. Include items not mentioned above, quality, methods of merchandising, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. (Use back of page if more space is needed).\n\nI claim that the mail order stores did much for the people. That the railways gave us good transportation. That the machine companies brought help, but they led us. That the mortgage companies brought capital into a country otherwise valueless, and set the wheels of progress rolling. And Lastly, that churches of all creeds gave comfort to both the living and the dying, and preached the word of God constantly and steadfastly through all the years of war and bloodshed. Amen.\n\nFred S. Baines.\n21. Then did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homestead and home prepared foods? (Give us many details and ideas.)\n\n22.
