The intention of this form is to secure as much information as possible covering the experiences of the pioneer family, or describe the particular events if they help to answer the questions.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1914 and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or supply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires:\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1 entitled \"Pioneer Pictorial History\" was distributed to all members of the Saskatchewan Pioneers' Association. It is still being circulated.
