(People you met on the way, meetings with Indians, adventures on the journey, accidents or other excitement, etc.) We left Preston in the morning and came out for dinner at noon there. Then started on again. There were no roads. Everything was done by horseback. We traveled all day until we reached the South but the prairie had been swept by fire every year so there was nothing but dust and grass everywhere you looked even below. The land was little butts some places. We just camped around there, would sit there all night. But for the Indians. They were friendly. They would have come early days back plenty of game but they were gone. We traveled all day and arrived at our new home at dark every time.\n\n15. Where did you first stay when you arrived in Saskatchewan? My husband had built a little house for us to move into. Just the outside shell - we gradually fixed it up as we could later.\n\n16.

I would milk the cows - do what work I could to help so my husband could stay at the Breaking - was slow work with a walking plow just turn one furrow at a time - three horses to draw it. Horses were very valuable at that time. Could not work them too long a hours. They had to be taken care of.\n19. How often did you write to relatives or friends in your old home?\n\n20.

Is there any particular experience of pioneer days that stands out in your memory which you would like to record?\n\nWhat stands out in my mind more than any other thing was the Prairie Fire. There was so much prairie to the south of us in the North about 15 miles & further scarcely any one living in between us & another small town. The fire seemed as though started from the main when ever they went there. For the first time when the grass was dry, we heard it coming for days burning around the buildings which was full of death so hot it burnt some. We could see it at night flaming up so bright. We had to place guards around our buildings & also the land. Then would go out a piece from three to four times a day. Putting it out so as when the fire got there it wouldn't be so close to the building. As it got there close the crackling of the flames & the smoke from it really put fear into your heart. Not knowing if your house was safe or not.\n\nThe grass had such a growth because of no stock grazing on it. We would stand a watch with buckets of water & wet sacks so as to put out any sparks that blew over the guards.\n\nBurned all the little trees & everything in sight. As settlers came in the land gradually got broke up & so stopped the fires getting such a sweep over the prairie.\n\nAlso stands out in my memory the beautiful flowers I used to pick on the prairies planted by God's hand & watered. More beautiful than the ones growing in my garden today. Crocus, Lilies, Buttercups, Blue Bells, Golden Rod, Lady Slippers & many other kinds too many to mention here.\n\n24. Did you travel about much in the early years? (for business, attending church, visiting friends, etc.) How often? How far? By what means of travel? Did not travel far only 15 our nearest town Bamboro 6 miles had to go once in a while for provisions & to trade in our Butte eggs for groceries.\n\nHad only our horses to go with so was slow going.\n\nAlso went to Sunday school & church after our school was built opened in 1913.\n\nP.S. I feel I have received more in life by going through those pioneer days of hardship & some sickness in the family. No doctor near had to depend on our own help & God's help to pull them thru. The young people of today have everything to work with & still don't seem satisfied have that restless spirit & can not settle. Do not look to go to church or worship like we always did & pray to God to give us strength to still carry on. I had eight children & never saw a hospital or doctor more within so mile at that time. Had a neighbor woman come in at the time to take care of the baby & with God's help always came thru. Now at 70 years of age I am still strong & healthy & happy with most of my family near me also many kind friends what were does one want in life. I feel God has been very kind to me.\n25. When was the first car used in the community? In 1914 an old Ford Car.\n\n26. If you owned a car before 1914, when did you buy it? What make?\n\n27. Where was your trading center? How far from your home? (Distance)\n\n28. Did you continue to trade there? (Indicate any changes due to new towns appearing, better means of travel, etc.)\n\n29. How often did you shop in the early days? Always tried to go to town once a week to get rid of our butter & eggs; could not keep it long as only had a hole dug under the house for a cellar, no fridges in here those days.\n\n30. When (if ever) did people in your district first start going to town regularly on Saturdays? Not till late years when people were able to buy some kind of a car as Grimsboro is our nearest town with a picture show there.\n\nMilitia about 2 miles from here with a good show room so there are the two towns people from this district mostly go to on Saturdays nights.\n\n31. When (if ever) did you first begin to buy through the mail order catalogues? What kind of articles did you buy in this way? Indicate also what fraction of your total purchases were by mail order and any changes in the proportion of purchases made by mail order since the pioneer period.\n\nUsed to buy from Eaton's mail order catalogue first years. This mail order was from Toronto. Eaton's built in Winnipeg. Used to buy overalls, smocks, underwear, shoes, rubbers, just the things that were necessary was all we could afford to buy.\n\nThese items were cheaper at the Mail Order than at the store.\n\n32. When did you first have a telephone and what company provided it? In 1915\n\nA Rural Telephone located after by the Municipality.\n\nI think it was supplied by the Telephone Company.\n\n33. When you came to Saskatchewan the first time was it with the idea of staying permanently? Or did you make up your mind after trying it out? When did you make this decision? Yes, I always liked farming, stayed with it with the help of our family till 1951. When we retired & our son took the farm over. Of course in those number of years we bought more land. Owned a section of Land when retiring.\n34. Did any people move away from your district prior to 1914? What reasons did they have for moving?\n\n35. Did many people move away during the 1930's? Did many return?\n   No.\n\nThe young men went away to work other places that weren't dried out also the girls didn't work too during harvest. Returned for the winter. The older folks tried to work the land ready for spring. A little relief was given in here where needed by the municipality. The Great Depression did not harm us here than the drought. They ate everything they could find to eat.\n\n36. If you or some member of your family have held public office, or have been active in any organizations, mention it here, giving dates wherever possible.\n   Mr. Pickard was councillor in this municipality for several years. Also was secretary for the United Grain Growers early years.\n\n37. If you or any of your family or friends were \"first\" to have or do something in the district mention it here giving dates wherever possible. (Such as owning the first automobile, combine, organizing the first lodge, etc.)\n   Mr. Pickard & Mrs. Joe Davis owned the first threshing machine in this district. We were part-time in buying it.\n   Garnet & Clifford Pickard our two sons bought & owned the first combine in the district.\n\n38. How did the places in your community get their names? (School districts, Post Offices, villages, railway stations, creeks, hills, etc.). Try to give: (1) name and occupation of person suggesting place-name (2) origin and meaning of the name (3) date of its adoption (4) any changes in names since the first name was given, date and reason for change. Give facts of new name as above in (1), (2), (3).\n   Our District was named Council at first but after the Railway came here. The C.P.R. wanted the name changed because there was a Council & so many things seemed to get sent there. So they suggested Fertile instead of Council.\n39. Questions regarding historical source materials:\n\nDo you have in your possession or do you know the whereabouts of diaries, old letters, old posters and programs, minute books of community organizations, old pamphlets, old photographs, written recollections and reminiscences?

Macmillan Don't do Dallas Baby yet at 6 days, married to Maurice Brown Minion, first granddaughters birthmarks.\n\nWhat do you think are the most important changes in your community since you first came West?\n\nThis District has changed from Wild Prairie Land to every acre available being farmed & fairly well settled. The low land around the bluffs are growing Poplar Trees since the fires. Cartage thru here now. These trees supply every farmer all the wood he needs & burn also instead of horses every farmer has a tractor. Line of complements most of the farmers have their own combines. Most every farmer has his land fenced & our highways are being built up better. We have a good school teach to grade 12. Also a good united Church in our little town.\n\nPlease give the names and addresses of other pioneers who could answer this questionnaire.\n\nIf someone else has filled in this questionnaire for you, please have this person give name and address here:\nPIONEER EXPERIENCES: A GENERAL QUESTIONNAIRE\n\nA brief explanation of this questionnaire:\n\nIt is difficult to answer a general questionnaire on pioneer life because no individual is asked to answer it has exactly the same experiences or problems.

Is there any particular experience of pioneer days that stands out in your memory which you would like to record?\n\nWhat stands out in my mind more than any other thing was the Prairie Fire. There was so much prairie to the south of us & to the north about 18 miles. Another fire started & we were living between two prairies & a small town. The fire seemed as though it got started from the train when we thought we were there. We could see it coming, just burning around the sloughs which was full of water, so held it back some. Could see it at night flaming up so bright. We had to put guards around our buildings & stored up feed. Then would go out a piece from River Bank. They kept putting it out so when the fire got to there it wouldn't be too close to the buildings. But got close. The crackling of the flames & the smoke from it really just went into your heart. Not knowing if your house was safe or not. The grass had such a growth because of no stock grazing on it. We worked hard & watched with buckets of water & wet sand so as to put out any spark that blew over. The guards returned all the little fires every thing in sight. As settlers came in the land gradually got burnt up & so satisfied the fires getting such a start over the prairie. Also stands out in my memory the beautiful flowers I used to find on the prairie planted by God's hand & watched more beautiful to me than the new growing in my garden today. Butterflies, Blue Bells, Goldmoss, & many others to many kinds to mention here.\n\n24. Did you travel about much in the early years? (for business, attending church, visiting friends, etc.) How often? How far? By what means of travel?\n\nDid not travel far only to our nearest town Gainsboro 16 miles had to go once in a while for provisions & to trade in our Butler's shop for groceries.\n\nHad only our horses to go with so was slow going.\n\nP.S. I feel I have received more in life by going through those pioneer days of hardship & some sickness in the family. No doctors nearby had to depend on our own before God help to pull them thru. The young people of today have everything to work with & still don't seem satisfied have that healthy spirit & can not settle. Do not look to go to church, worship like we always did & pray to God to give us strength to still carry on. I had eight children never saw a hospital or doctor none within 5 miles at that time. Had a neighbor woman come in at the time of the baby with God's help always came thru. Now at 70 yrs of age I am still strong & healthy & happy with most of my family near me also many kind friends who make one smile in life. I feel God has been very kind to me.\n25.
