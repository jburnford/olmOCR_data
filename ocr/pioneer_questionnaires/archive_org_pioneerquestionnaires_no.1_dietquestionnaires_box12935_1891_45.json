We knew that when we left Ontario no one was thinking of Christmas, and there were no stores here to buy anything, so if we would have presents to give our little sisters we must make them. We planned to ask Mother to let us sit up a little later at night than the little ones so that we could sew in the evenings after they had gone to bed and we could make each one of them a rag doll. Mother had a truly wonderful rag-bag as she had been doing our sewing for years and years, and always saved the scraps as she intended to make quilts of them. We soon got among the scraps and chose the best and prettiest to dress our dollies. But of course we had to speak very quietly as our house was small and all one room, only for curtains hung around the beds.\n\nFirst we must make the heads and bodies for the dolls. We wished we could have chosen china heads as we had on some of our dolls but that couldn't be, so we just had to make them of cotton and sew the eyes and all the features in with black thread. We had to cut out the cotton many times to get a suitable figure for our lady dolls, and we must not waste any cloth, so they usually started large and got smaller before we could make them a good shape. Heads were the hardest to make and we suffered much discouragement in getting them of proper dimensions, and many tired and much-pricked little fingers we had before\nPerhaps the happiest Christmas I ever knew was our first in the Saskatchewan Valley in the North West Territories as it was called.\n\nA month or more before the important day arrived, my eldest sister, a little girl who had quite lately passed her twelfth birthday, told me very emphatically that our happiness depended on ourselves. \"We are big enough to know that there is no magic in Christmas gifts; they must be made by someone, and it is the spirit of Christmas that is the real Santa Claus.\" We must do something to make others happy if we would be happy ourselves.

Mother helped us with advice and cutting,\nbut we must learn to sew and make a good job of it.\n\nWe enjoyed the sewing but had only a short time each evening\nbefore we too must go to bed. It seemed to take many evenings before\nwe had a dolly for each of the three little girls. One was a bright red\none, another a royal blue and the other had a plaid skirt with a red\nblouse. All the underwear was of fine white cotton, neatly hemmed and\nwith buttons and button holes, and they just had to be neat.\n\nEventually our sewing was done and Mother said it was very nice\nand she was sure a rag doll was a much better one to play with for\nNellie as she could not hurt herself with it, as she might with a china\nhead on her doll and the little girls always loved a dolly even if they\nwere made of rags, they were very bright and pretty.\n\nWe two older ones were very happy in that the little ones would\nfind something in their stockings on Christmas morning, and we were big\ngirls now and knew better than to expect to get anything in ours.\n\nThe early morning was cold and dark as Christmas morning usually\nis. Father had a nice lot of kindling and dry wood handy, so we made the\nfire as the little ones wanted to see what was in their stockings and\nwe wanted to see their surprise. Then we found a surprise for us too.\nSomething was in our stockings. A small package of raisins and cookies\nwith real currants in them. We couldn't guess where the fruit had been\nfor we had been using dried Saskatoon berries and we knew there was no\nchance to buy it here, but it must have been watched over by the business\npaters in the bottom drawer of the old bureau \"where children must not\nmeddle\".\n\nAfter breakfast Father got busy to finish making the new table\nand the biggest job at that was to find some nails to fasten on the top\nboards.

We children were to take the cattle to the slough for water.\nFather put the yoke on the oxen and hitched them to the barreige, a\nstone boat with a seat on it, and we took the little girls out for a\nsleigh ride. 'Twas only half a mile to the slough but by the time we got back the children were crying with the cold. It was so warm and sunny at the door of the house with a south exposure that Mother didn't realize it really was so cold, but out of the sun's warmth it was not so warm. Mother had a lovely dinner cooking of stuffed beef's heart, potatoes of course, and a boiled pudding of with real raisins and currants, and we had sharp appetites. Our first meal off our new table was that Christmas dinner.\n\nAfter dinner we had another surprise. Mother had a card with two little brooches on it and there was one for each of us older girls I had first choice, and as usual I chose the plainest one. Mary said she was glad of that for she liked the other one best, but I kept mine for over thirty years. After mine got unclasped and fell down the well, it was lost for keeps. I was very sorry for I treasured mine, though a jeweller had told me that it wasn't worth regilding. I got it done though and shortly after that I lost it.\n\nIn the evening we had a nice time with Christmas stories told by Father and singing led by Mother. We all tried to sing \"While humble shepherds watched their flocks on Bethlehem's plains by night\" as it was sung then. Some of the words have been changed since, especially in the first verse, but we first learned it the old Presbyterian way. Father told a wonderful story about the shepherds so that we could almost see them around their little fires and hear their opinions as they talked over the great sight they had seen, and decided it was the prophecies come true at last. Of course they too thought they were to be freed from the Romans at once and have a king of their own. Then the wise men came a little later following a star. After singing our hymns we were feeling very tired and sleepy and happy for we had really enjoyed Christmas.
