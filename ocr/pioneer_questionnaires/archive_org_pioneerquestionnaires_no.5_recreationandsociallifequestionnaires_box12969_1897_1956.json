Of course, I was born in the Yorkshire Dales at the foot of the moors. My parents were farmers from North Yorkshire. They came to Yorkshire in search of work and built a small cottage near the town of Harrogate.\n\nMy father was a carpenter by trade and worked as a laborer on the railway. He had no formal education but was very hardworking and resourceful. He taught me many valuable life lessons, such as the importance of hard work and perseverance.\n\nIn 1914, I joined the army and served during World War I. After the war, I returned to Yorkshire and continued working as a carpenter. In 1920, I married my wife, Jane, and we moved to a small village near Harrogate.\n\nIn 1939, I retired from my job and moved to a smaller house in the countryside. I enjoyed spending time with my family and friends, and I often visited my old neighbors in the village.\n\nIn 1944, I died at the age of 85. I am remembered fondly by all who knew me, and my legacy lives on through the memories of those who loved me.\n\nThis is a brief summary of my life in Yorkshire. I hope it gives you a sense of the place and the people who lived there.\nFurther information in regard to my stay in Yorkshire.\n\nOctober 1897 - November 1897 left Yorkshire in 1904. Of course, I was in the Yorkshire Dales at the time. The first few months in the Dales were hard for me, but I soon found my feet.\n\nI was raised by a family who lived about two miles from the town of Harrogate. They welcomed me into their home without question. They treated me like family.\n\nIn the summer, we would go to the beach. It was a wonderful experience. We would play in the sand and build sandcastles.\n\nWe also went on many trips to the countryside. We would hike up hills and explore the woods.\n\nIn the winter, we would go skiing. It was a lot of fun, but it was also very cold.\n\nOverall, my time in Yorkshire was a great experience. I will always remember it fondly.\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8\nOxford\nNo. 613 S\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jessylee/PioneerQuestionnairesPDFs//PioneerQuestionnaires_No.5-RecreationandSocialLifeQuestionnaires_Box12969_1897_1956.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 30, "total-input-tokens": 49800, "total-output-tokens": 8147, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 4], [0, 1131, 5], [1131, 1131, 6], [1131, 3094, 7], [3094, 4579, 8], [4579, 6908, 9], [6908, 8243, 10], [8243, 10020, 11], [10020, 10892, 12], [10892, 12244, 13], [12244, 12386, 14], [12386, 14308, 15], [14308, 15867, 16], [15867, 17567, 17], [17567, 19135, 18], [19135, 20946, 19], [20946, 22568, 20], [22568, 23938, 21], [23938, 24961, 22], [24961, 26153, 23], [26153, 27239, 24], [27239, 28360, 25], [28360, 29484, 26], [29484, 30730, 27], [30730, 31519, 28], [31519, 31607, 29], [31607, 31758, 30]], "primary_language": ["None", "None", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false, false, true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]}}]
