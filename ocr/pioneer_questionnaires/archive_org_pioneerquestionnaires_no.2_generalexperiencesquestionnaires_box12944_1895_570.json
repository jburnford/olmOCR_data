It is impossible for you to answer so that every detail may be given. It is better to give details, or describe particular events, if they help to answer the questions.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for anyone who lived in Western Canada before 1934, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Board Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer Life That Has Changed,\" is still being circulated. If you have not already answered this one, and are willing to do so, please get a closer mark here ( ).\n\nSaskatchewan Archives questionnaires on other subjects will be prepared at a later date.

It is necessary to have some idea of what may be expected from such a visit.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Eastern Canada before coming to Saskatchewan. It is not intended for persons who have lived in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them out separately and apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer Life: What Will You Remember?\" is still being circulated.
