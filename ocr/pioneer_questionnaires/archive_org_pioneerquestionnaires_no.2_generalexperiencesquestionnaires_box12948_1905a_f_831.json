Some of the questions here will not apply to your experiences; others may prove impossible for you to answer, so don't worry about leaving blank spaces. Use extra sheets of paper if there is not sufficient space to answer the questions. Don't hesitate to give details, or describe particular events, if they help to answer the questions.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1914, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nSaskatchewan Archives questionnaires which have been prepared or projected are listed below.

They thought I had something fixed up to make it come through the loud speaker. One man yelled down the loud speaker when a song he liked. He yelled play it again. It was very hard to make some people believe that it had to be tuned in. It was a Westinghouse four tube radio using W.D II tubes & a loud speaker.\n\n38. How did the places in your community get their names? (School districts, Post offices, villages, railway stations, creeks, hills, etc.).

As we have a lake a few miles from the town of Pipe Lake still keeps its name. The Indians saw the lake dry years ago. But we couldn't credit it. But in 1937 we saw it dry & could walk all over it. Wes Grant in the early days lost his gun in the middle of the lake. & when it dried up he remembered it & went to the spot where it fell out of the boat. & there was the gun. This is a big valley. & old Daddy Vallens always would say what a delightful some valley. Hence the name. We never changed any names.\n39.

But I pray that this year\u2014not for the minority but for the great majority of us\u2014it may be the festival of God that it is meant to be. May all of us, adults and young people, plan our observance of Christmas, not around Santa Claus and the Christmas Tree, but around the worship of the Christ Child. Then in our Church and in our homes, we, like the shepherds and Wise Men of old, will kneel in adoration before Him whose Birthday we are celebrating; we will make room for Him in our hearts and in our homes; we will demonstrate our love for Him by offering to Him on His Birthday ourselves, our souls and bodies to be used in the service of His Church and Kingdom.\n\nMy prayer for you all, is that with your loved ones you may have a happy and blessed Christmas, and that you may make the day unforgettable in your life by saying from the bottom of your hearts, in the words of Phillip Brooks:\n\n'O Holy Child of Bethlehem\nDescend to us, we pray;\nCast out our sin and enter in;\nBe born in us today.\"\nCROP & WEATHER REPORT FROM FIFE LAKE COUNTY 1909 TO 1935\n\n1909 was a good crop year lots of heavy grass all over.\n\n1910 was a very dry year.
