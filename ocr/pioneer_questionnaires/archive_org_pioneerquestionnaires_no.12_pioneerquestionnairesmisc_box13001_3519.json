WHAT THE POOR MAN'S FULL NAME WAS JABEZ HAUGHTON PORTER, THE POOR MAN'S FULL NAME WAS JABEZ HAUGHTON PORTER.\n11. What did your friends and relatives think of your decision to come to Western Canada?\n   They wished us all the luck in the world in our new venture although they knew we would be missed very much as we belonged to the popular young set around town.\n\n12. Did you travel by yourself or with a party (family, friends or other group)?\n   Just our two selves, as it was our honeymoon. We became friendly with all the people in our car and had a wonderful time on the trip west.\n\n13. What means of transportation did you use?\n   The train. Richmond, Que., was a Grand Trunk Town in 1910 and filled with Grand Trunk workers. Many years later G.T.R. and C.N.R. merged and it was run under the latter name.\n\n14. What incidents of the journey West do you remember? (People you met on the way, meetings with Indians, adventures on the journey, accidents or other excitement, etc.)\n   Nothing of incident. Our car was termed \"tourist\" not as swanky as the 1st class cars, but with all modern conveniences and we enjoyed every minute of it. We stayed in Montreal two days, after which we again broke our journey at Winnipeg, for two days. It was very windy at W'peg, which most people say is a characteristic of the western city. I liked the city very much, the streets were so wide, not like eastern cities, especially Quebec.\n\n15. Where did you first stay when you arrived in Saskatchewan?\n   We landed at Lanigan and stayed over night, but the next day Dr. Armatage came after us and took us to his home (in the So. African script, half-section) five miles south of Plunkett, where we remained until spring.\n\n16. Where did you settle or take up land?\n   We filed on a homestead, 2 miles south of Dr. Armatage's land, and lived the first year with Dr. A. In the spring we went on our land. We, as so many others did, got a loan, in order to live and buy implements. Between the stones on our land (which, by the way, nearly wrecked my poor husband's back) and dry years when there was very little crop, we finally had to give up our homestead, as it was impossible to pay off our loan. The interest was too high.\n\n18. How did you earn a living before coming to Western Canada? How, after you came?\n   I was a stenographer and book-keeper, after I left school, which I attended until I was 18 years old. After I came West, as I have already told you, I was a farmer's wife. We had become involved with \"The Royal Trust Co.\" in the matter of the loan. They were wonderful people to deal with, and were sympathetic to my man as they knew he worked very hard and gained nothing.\n11. What did your friends and relatives think of your decision to come to Western Canada?\n\nThey wished us all the luck in the world in our new venture. Although they knew we would be missed around here, we belonged to the popular young set.\n\n12. Did you travel by yourself or with a party (family, friends or other group)?\n\nJust our two selves, as it was our honeymoon set. We became friendly with all the people in our car and had a wonderful time on the trip west.\n\n13. What means of transportation did you use?\n\nThe train. Richmond, Que., was a Grand Trunk Town in 1910 and filled with Grand Trunk workers. Many years later G.T.R. and G.N.R. merged and it was run under the latter name.\n\n14. What incidents of the journey West do you remember? (People you met on the way, meetings with Indians, adventures on the journey, accidents or other excitement, etc.)\n\nNothing of incident\u2014our car was termed \"tourist\" from when not as swanky as the first class cars, but with all modern conveniences and we enjoyed every minute of it. We stayed in Montreal two days after which we again broke our journey at Winnipeg, for two days. It was very windy at which most people say is a characteristic of the western city. I liked the city very much. The streets were so wide, not like eastern cities, especially Quebec.\n\n15. Where did you stop when you arrived in Saskatchewan?\n\nWe landed at Langan and stayed over night, but the next day Dr. Armata came after us and took us to his home on the South African Script (half-section) five miles south of Plunkett, where we remained until spring.\n\n16. How did you earn a living before coming to Western Canada? How after you came?\n\nI was a stenographer and bookkeeper. After I left school, which I attended until I was 18 years old, after I came west, as I have already told you, I was a farmer's wife. We had become involved with \"The Royal Trust Co.\" in the matter of the loan, they were wonderful people to deal with, and were sympathetic to my man as they knew he worked very hard and gained nothing.\n19. How often did you write to relatives or friends in your old home?\n\nEvery few days naturally, I was very lonely the first year.\n\n20. If you got married, give the name of your husband or wife along with the date and place of marriage.\n\nI have already given this information.\n\n21. Did anyone else come to Saskatchewan because of your recommending it as a place to settle?\n\nI have no idea, if they did they did not show up, as I was far from enthusiastic about it for a long time. Now, I love it, and wouldn't go back east, as my parents are long dead, also one sister. Everything changes in time and now my roots are here.\n\n22. If other members of your family (brothers, sisters, parents, etc.) came West, tell when they came and where they settled.\n\nSome of them came to visit me, mother, dad three sisters and their husbands at odd times, but they all returned home. Dad was a musician and owned a music and book store so was just up for visits. My sisters were married to railroad men conductors, so were not interested in taking up land etc.\n\n23. Is there any particular experience of pioneer days that stands out in your memory which you would like to record?\n\nLots of things, but this space is not sufficient. I have many experiences that stand out in my memory and many of them I have written. One thing I can remember, tho' and that is, that homesteaders were a hungry lot, and would walk miles for a home cooked meal. The bachelors were as thick as grasshoppers around the homes of married men. One in particular, his name was Kitchenerman, I did not think he ever bought any groceries, he ate at Dr. Armata's so often, and called what he ate \"snacks\". He ate enough for a horse, it looked like he was only interested in seeing if he could eat us out of house and home.\n\n24. Did you travel about much in the early years? (for business, attending church, visiting friends, etc.) How often? How far? By what means of travel?\n\nNot very much, distances were too great. Once I can recall the first summer, the three of us drove to Humboldt. Sir Wilfred Laurier was expected. When we arrived at Humboldt, they put the team in a livery barn. There were very few cars at that time. Then we registered at the best hotel. That night, (it had been a very hot day in July) I had a hard time to get to sleep. It seemed to be very itchy, after awhile I could stand it no longer, and lit the lamp. Well\u2014bed-bugs started running in all directions. They cleaned up the room next A.M.\n19. How often did you write to relatives or friends in your old home?\n\nIn every few days naturally, I was very lonely.\n\nThe first year.\n\n20. If you got married, give the name of your husband or wife along with the date and place of marriage.\n\nI have already given this information.\n\n21.

If other members of your family (brothers, sisters, parents, etc.) came West, tell when they came and where they settled.\n\nSome of them came to visit me, mother, dad, three sisters and their husbands. Dad was there times, but they all returned home and book a musician and owned a music store so was just up for visits. My sisters were married to railroad men conductors so were not interested in taking up land etc.\n\n23. Is there any particular experience of pioneer days that stands out in your memory which you would like to record?\n\nLots of things, but this space is not sufficient. I have many experiences that stand out in my memory and many of them I have written. One thing I can remember, tho' and that is, that homesteaders were hungry lot, and would walk miles for a home cooked meal. The homes of married men, one hopper circular, his name groceries in ever bought called what he ate snacks. He ate enough for a horse. It looked like he was only interested in seeing if he could eat us out of house and home.\n\n24. Did you travel about much in the early years?

I seemed to be very tired, after awhile I could stand it no longer and lit the lamp well\u2014up. Bed-bugs started running in all directions. Next A.M.\n25. When was the first car used in the community?\n   NOT FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS, BEFORE I CAME WEST THE FIRST CAR I HAD A RIDE IN WAS A LITTLE STANLEY STEAMER, ONE OF THE BEST THAT WAS RUN BY A MAN NAMED COFFIN.\n\n26. If you owned a car before 1914, when did you buy it? What make?\n   WE DID NOT.\n\n27. Where was your trading center? How far from your home?\n   THE FIRST SEVERAL YEARS OUR TOWN WAS PLUNKETT, I THINK IT WAS THE LAST TOWN THE LORD MADE AND HE FORGOT TO FINISH IT.\n\n28. Did you continue to trade there? (Indicate any changes due to new towns appearing, better means of travel, etc.)\n   YES, FOR SOME YEARS, UNLESS WE DROVE TO GUERNSEY, OR LANIGAN. BOTH THESE TOWNS WERE BETTER THAN PLUNKETT BUT PLUNKETT WAS NEARER WHICH WAS A CONSIDERATION IF YOU HAD TO DRIVE HORSES. THEY ALL HAPPENED TO BE ON THE C.P.R. AND WERE ALREADY SETTLED WHEN WE ARRIVED IN 1910.\n\n29. How often did you shop in the early days?\n   WHENEVER WE RAN OUT OF THINGS, THE FIRST WINTER MY MAN WENT TO TOWN ON SNOW SHOES AND CARRIED THE GROCERIES ON HIS BACK. HE COULD GO VERY FAST THAT WAY.\n\n30. When (if ever) did people in your district first start going to town regularly on Saturdays?\n   PEOPLE DID GO TO TOWN ON SATURDAYS NOT SO MANY YEARS AFTER WE SETTLED THERE. AT FIRST IT WOULD BE IN BUGGIES, I THINK WE WENT AS SOON AS WE GOT HORSES. WE HAD OXEN AT FIRST, AFTER THAT THEY WERE SOLD AND WE BOUGHT HORSES, AND THEN SOMETHING FASTER THAN OXEN TO DRIVE.\n\n31. When (if ever) did you first begin to buy through the mail order catalogues? What kind of articles did you buy in this way? Indicate also what fraction of your total purchases were by mail order and any changes in the proportion of purchases made by mail order since the pioneer period.\n   WE ALWAYS SHOVED BY CATALOGUE. WHEN OUR FAMILY, 3 BOYS AND TWO GIRLS, WERE ALL AT HOME WE CERTAINLY HAD TO SPEND PLENTY AND IT WAS ALL MAIL ORDER, ESPECIALLY IN THE FALL, WHEN WE SHOVED FOR WARM CLOTHING. SOMETIMES WE EVEN BOUGHT GROCERIES THAT WAY. NOW, THEY DO NOT EVEN SEND ME A CATALOG AS I DO MOST OF MY SHOPPING EITHER HERE OR IN PRINCE ALBERT, AN EXCELLENT PLACE TO SHOP. OUR OWN ST. LOUIS IS O.K. FOR SHOPPING ALSO. I THINK IT WILL SOON BE CLASSED AS A TOWN NOW THE SEWER AND WATER HAVE BEEN INSTALLED. I AM ALL ALONE NOW AS MY DEAR OLD MATE (EVERETT WILBUR NICHOLS) DIED OF A STROKE IN 1957, OCT 22. AT THE AGE OF 79. ALL THE CHILDREN ARE MARRIED, AND MY FIRST BORN SON FRANCIS ABBA DROWNED IN HIS 24TH YEAR, IN HIGHWOOD RIVER ALBERTA.\n\n32. When did you first have a telephone and what company provided it?\n   I BELIEVE IT WAS AROUND 1915, BY THAT TIME WE HAD A LOT OF NEIGHBORS TO TALK TO. AT THAT DATE I THINK IT WAS A LOCAL PHONE CO., NOT VERY SATISFACTORY, AFTERWARDS THE SASK.\n\n33. When you came to Saskatchewan the first time was it with the idea of staying permanently? Or did you make up your mind after trying it out? When did you make this decision?\n   YES INDEED, OUR MIND WAS MADE UP WHEN WE CAME WEST, AS WE HAD NO MONEY FOR TRAVELLING, WE WERE LIKE MOST EVERYONE, WE EXPECTED TO WORK WHEN WE CAME, SO WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED IN THAT RESPECT. AS YOU KNOW, ROME WAS NOT BUILT IN A DAY AND WE WERE YOUNG ENOUGH TO TAKE WHATEVER CAME IN OUR STRIDE. WE BOTH HAD GREAT FAITH IN GOD WHO STUCK BY US ALL OUR LIVES. AFTER WE CAME HERE IN OCT, 1940, I WAS ALMOST IMMEDIATELY MADE PRESIDENT OF THE EMMANUEL ANGLICAN WOMANS AUXILIARY.\n25. When was the first car used in the community?\n   NOT FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. BEFORE I CAME WEST THE FIRST CAR I HAD ARRIVED IN WAS A LITTLE STANLEY STEAMER. ONE OTHER MAN BUILT BACK A FARM RUN BY A MAN NAMED COFFIN.\n\n26. If you owned a car before 1914, when did you buy it?

AFTER WE CAME HERE IN OCT 1940, I WAS ALMOST IMMEDIATELY MADE PRESIDENT OF THE EMMANUEL ANGLICAN WOMANS AUXILIARY.\n34. Did any people move away from your district prior to 1914? What reasons did they have for moving?\n\nI do not recall the moving out of any of our neighbors. By the time 1914 came, the west was us and we were the west. People weren't moving out, when he went, they were going to fight for their country. Some came home to take up where they left off, but a few couldn't come and are part of the silent ones in whom we honor today.\n\n35. Did many people move away during the 1930s? Did many return?\n\nVery few left during the \"hungry 30s\" they were like us, broke, so had to stay put, and take what was handed out, which, it must be admitted, was very little. We made a bennet wagon, like others did. Those were hard times! I think you get the idea. At that time they were building up Watrous, Manitou resort, and only good conservatives could organizations, mention it here, giving dates wherever possible.\n\n36. If you or some member of your family have held public office, or have been active in any organization, mention it here, giving dates wherever possible.\n\nNothing of note, although Everett was always on the school board. The dates will likely be on the records in Regina. The meetings of the board in the early days, were something to write home about. There were two factions, Englishmen (and practically all related) and the rest of us composed of well, just people, and all good folks. The majority was us, bucked whenever possible by Englishmen. Now we, many of us were partly English, but some were, for instance, Hungarian, that is just an example. My man was from Massachusetts USA, but a naturalized Canadian.\n\n37. If you or any of your family or friends were \"first\" to have or do something in the district mention it here giving dates wherever possible. (Such as owning the first automobile, combine, organizing the first lodge, etc.) One of our neighbors could, I think claim the distinction of owning the first car (Ford) Lizzie and many were the rides we had with his family. His name was Herb Ernst. His father came from Kitchener and were of German extraction, wonderful people, very honest and upright. Speaking of lodges, my husband belonged to the Oddfellows but we lived too far from town (Watrous Sask.) after we moved down there in 1924 to attend meetings. He was a very hard worker and when night came he turned on the radio and loved to delve into space seeking something unusual in the air, especially on short wave.\n\n38. How did the places in your community get their names? (School districts, Post Offices, villages, railway stations, creeks, hills, etc.) Try to give: (1) name and occupation of person suggesting place-name, (2) origin and meaning of the name, (3) date of its adoption, (4) any changes in names since the first name was given, date and reason for change. Give facts of new name as above in (1), (2), (3).\n\nUntil 1940, when we moved to St. Louis, as I have said, we farmed. In 1910 there was no school in our part of the country, but in a year or two a school district was formed which was named Eltham pronounced Elton by the trustees who came from England, the reason for the name was nostalgia I think. They wished to have a bit of the old home to remind them. They were all farmers & some of the men were named Langstone, (they are not there now, they retired and I don't know their destination. One of the men was named Walter Streeton of whom I am sure you have heard, he was very prominent in the Hudson Bay Railway building and organizing. Names of places around us were already given as the names were mostly on the C.P.R. There was very little water around of note except a flowing well near Guernsey.\nDid any people move away from your district prior to 1914? What reasons did they have for moving?\n\n34. Did not recall the moving out of any of our neighbors. By the time 1914 came, the west was us and we were the west. People weren't moving out.\n\n35. They who went were going to fight for their country. They who came home to take up where they left off, but very few could not come and be part of the silent ones.\n\n36. Did many return during the 1930s? Did many return very little during the \"hungry 30s\"? They were like us; broke, so had to stay put, and take what was handed out, which it must be admitted was very little. We made a Bennett wagon, like others did.\n\n37. If you or some member of your family have held public office, or have been active in any organization, mention it here, giving dates wherever possible.\n\n38. How did the places in your community get their names?
