It was a mixture of this sort that partly caused the deterioration of the real Indians of the earlier days. As I remember them as a kid (and there were lots of them in the district where I was born) between Lake Winnipeg and Lake Manitoba, they were a dignified and fine people, mostly Crees.\n\n15.

Did you travel about much in the early years? (for business, attending church,\n    visiting friends, etc.) How often? How far? By what means of travel?\n    In the Homestead days, yes. Mostly by Ox team and wagon or\n    horse and buggy (could almost write a book about those oxen were\n    I that way inclined) we had church service at Neighbors 2 miles away\n    young Homesteader preached, most people attended. Visited neighbors\n    in winter a lot, played cards, danced, often stayed till sun up in\n    morning. No one seemed to be in a rush, if one were on road and\n    came to house at mealtime they simply stayed and ate and fed their horse\n    or whatever they had. Same thing at night wherever we happened to\n    reach a home there we stayed, and if no one home we stayed any way\n    ate whatever provisions there were, went to bed, and next morning\n    left everything exactly as we found it (houses were never locked in those\n    days.\n19. How often did you write to relatives or friends in your old home? Write to my mother about every month until she died in 1921.\n\n20. If you got married, give the name of your husband or wife along with the date and place of marriage. Married William Edward Stafford in Winnipeg February 28th 1906.\n\n21.

If other members of your family (brothers, sisters, parents, etc.) came West tell when they came and where they settled. All stayed in Manitoba.\n\n23. Is there any particular experience of pioneer days that stands out in your memory which you would like to recount? No had good times and tough times but mostly happy times made money well, broke, made money again.\n\n24. Did you travel about much in the early years? (for business, attending church, visiting friends, etc.) How often? How far? By what means of travel?\n\nIn the homestead days yes. Mostly by ox team and horse and buggy. Could almost write a book about those oxen were. In the early land we had church service at neighbors' homes. Often stayed till sun up in the morning. Sometimes they would stay and eat and fed their horse.\n25. When was the first car used in the community? Think I saw my first car in Saskatchewan in 1914, Model T Ford.\n\n26. If you owned a car before 1914, when did you buy it? What make?\n   Never owned a car until 1919, Model T Ford.\n\n27. Where was your trading center? How far from your home?\n   Watson, 18 Miles\n\n28. Did you continue to trade there?

How often did you shop in the early days? Only about once a month in summer, and sometimes about once in three months in winter; didn't buy much, flour, coffee, tea, coal oil.\n\n30. When (if ever) did people in your district first start going to town regularly on Saturdays? This custom really seemed to come in with the cars starting about 1914 and increasing till present day.\n\n31. When (if ever) did you first begin to buy through the mail order catalogues? What kind of articles did you buy in this way? Indicate also what fraction of your total purchases were by mail order and any changes in the proportion of purchases made by mail order since the pioneer period.\n   Quite an event on the homestead starting 1906, just once a year start of winter, mostly clothing. This was not a large proportion of the year's purchases. Of course purchasing power was small in the pioneer days. Today so many people drive to nearest city to buy special things, but local stores make regular weekly and daily sales of groceries, etc., and mail order houses get their business. First year on Homestead my wife and I spent about $50.00 for year's necessities. Today we spend probably $100.00. We lived off what we raised on the Homestead, snared rabbits in winter & shot deer, summer lots of ducks. Well, I didn't have to pay the drayman to haul away a couple of loads of empty cans in the spring. We had $10.00 after we had our shack finished, and that's all, and didn't know where any more was coming from. My wife and I made hay (and it plentiful) up to your knees in grass and peavine, we put up about 100 loads, and a lot of settlers came in the fall of 1906 and needed feed we sold them hay at $2.00 a load, then we had about $150.00, we were well away.\n\n32. When did you first have a telephone and what company provided it?\n   No telephones in that district till about 1918. Don't remember what Company.\n\n33. When you came to Saskatchewan the first time was it with the idea of staying permanently? Or did you make up your mind after trying it out? When did you make this decision? My ambition was to make enough money out of the homestead as soon as I proved up to go to whatever the Hudson Bay port proved to be, as I was sure that would turn out to be a great seaport, I didn't think it would take 45 years and then not amount to much. I didn't understand much about politics in those days and never dreamt that a project that could mean so much to the western people, could be held up so long.\n25. When was the first car used in the community? I think I bought my first car in Saskatchewan in 1914, Model T Ford.\n\n26. If you owned a car before 1914, when did you buy it? What make?\n\nNever owned a car until 1919, Model T Ford.\n\n27. Where was your trading center? How far from your home?\n\nWatson, 18 miles.\n\n28. Did you continue to trade there? (Indicate any changes due to new towns appearing, and names of travel, etc.)\n\nUntil 1900, then the railroad was completed to Saskatoon to Lethbridge and the Village of Jansen was 10 miles south from my homestead.\n\n29. How often did you shop in the early days? Only about once a month in summer, and sometimes about once in three months in winter.\n\nDon't buy much, flour, coffee, tea, chocolate.\n\n30. When (if ever) did people in your district first start going to town regularly on Saturdays? This custom really seemed to come in with the cars starting about 1914 and increasing till present day.\n\n31. When (if ever) did you first begin to buy through the mail order catalogues? What kind of articles did you buy in this way? Indicate also what fraction of your total purchases were by mail order and any changes in the proportions of purchases made by mail order since the pioneer period.\n\nQuite an event on the honest and starting 1906, just once a year except in winter, mostly clothing. There was not a large population in the early years, but to buy postage stamps, newspapers, etc., was a big thing to do. We had to go to town every two weeks or so to get our supplies.\n\n32. When did you first have a telephone and what company provided it?\n\nNo telephones in that district yet about 1918.\n\nDon't remember what Company.\n\n33. When you came to Saskatchewan the first time was it with the idea of staying permanently? Or did you make up your mind after trying it out?\n\nI don't know as soon as I arrived up to go to school over the Hudson Bay. My first prospect to be exact, I didn't think it would take 45 years and then not amount to much. I didn't understand much about politics in those days and never thought that a project that could mean so much to the average worker could be held up so long.\nM. Did any people move away from your district prior to 1914? What reasons did they have for moving?\n\nMany moved away as soon as they proved up some went to the Peace River country. Probably 25% stayed and many took a loan on the Homestead, bought some machinery and really started to farm.\n\n35. Did many people move away during the 1930's? Did many return?\n\nVery few moved away from this district in the 30s (District now includes Watson, Le Roy, Jansen, Spalding, St. Gregor) many new settlers came in from the dryer areas, especially from Simpson, Imperial, and different places farther south. The District has a good record over a long period of years, mixed farming mostly.\n\n36. If you or some member of your family have held public office, or have been active in any organizations, mention it here, giving dates wherever possible.\n\nI was the first postmaster in the immediate district, being successful in getting a post Office in 1906, Neidale P.O., I was Reeve and Le Roy R.M. many years later. Served on the Le Roy School Board for a number of years. I was one of the delegates who went to Ottawa in 1902, to ask the Government to do something about the price of wheat. I was active in organizing the C.C.F. from its beginning, and have never been ashamed of it.\n\n37. If you or any of your family or friends were \"first\" to have or do something in the district mention it here giving dates wherever possible. (Such as owning the first automobile, combine, organizing the first lodge, etc.).\n\nCan't recall of anything\n\n38. How did the places in your community get their names? (School districts, Post Offices, villages, railway stations, creeks, hills, etc.). Try to give: (1) name and occupation of person suggesting place-name (2) origin and meaning of the name (3) date of its adoption (4) any changes in names since the first name was given date and reason for change. Give facts of new name as above in (1), (2), (3).\n\nIn speaking in all cases in this report of the Watson Dist. which covered a wide area in the early days. Le Roy Village, a family of Le Roys were early settlers about 2 miles from what is now Le Roy. One of the boys was killed in the 1st Great War.
