Dowling Jemima McKenzie (Mrs. William)\nSASKATCHEWAN ARCHIVES QUESTIONNAIRE\n\nNO. 2\n\nPIONEER EXPERIENCES: A GENERAL QUESTIONNAIRE\n\nA NOTE OF EXPLANATION TO THE PERSON ANSWERING THIS QUESTIONNAIRE\n\nIt is difficult to prepare a general questionnaire on pioneer life because no individual who is asked to answer it has exactly the same experiences as another. Some of the questions here will not apply to your experiences or those of your parents. If you answer \"no\" to any question, do not worry about answering others. It is better to be truthful or to leave the questionnaire blank than to answer the questions incorrectly or dishonestly.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1911, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nWestern Saskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer Past: What Did We Do?\" would also be useful if it is still being circulated. If you have not already answered this, and would be willing to do so, please put a check mark here ( ) and one will be sent to you.\n\nSaskatchewan Archives questionnaires on other subjects will be prepared at a later date.
