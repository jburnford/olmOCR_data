He also homesteaded the N.E. section 12 in the same township. Here he erected buildings and put up hay and purchased a herd of good cattle. This in 1887.\n\nIn coming to the ranch from Prince Albert he followed the traveled trail to near Kinistino, there south along the west side of Wetaskiwin Lake following an old Indian trail, fording the Carrot River, building a brush bridge over the boggy Willow Creek and fording the Yellow Creek on the east side of which his building stood.\n\nA word about Mr. Traill's background. He was born at Kintail, Ontario to the son of Captain Thomas Traill and Catherine Part Stirketland, his wife. Educated at Peterborough he with a couple of school chums, Ford and Peg, Betty, with the love of adventure strong in their veins decided to go west and join the H.B. Co.

Co. officer, decided on retiring to go into cattle raising and knowing of a good location South of the Waterhen Lake (Kinistino district), from an old native, investigated, and finding it satisfactory, located on the N.E. 1/4 16-44-22 W 2nd on the bank of the Yellow Creek.

He was born at Lakefield, Ontario, the son of Captain Thomas Traill and Catherine Parr Strickland, his wife. Educated at Peterborough he with a couple of school chums, Ford and Reg. Beatty, with the love of adventure strong in their veins decided to go west and join the H.B. Co. Mr. Traill and Ford Beatty going first reaching Fort Garry in 1862.\n\nAs apprentice clerk Mr. Traill was posted to Fort Ellice serving under William McKay (later his father-in-law). So began his career as a fur trader. While there he was in charge of various outposts. From one of these he often travelled the old hunting trail (Ft. Ellice, Nut Lake, Lac Lenore, Basin Lake, and through to Batoche), passing south of the present Meskanaw. This was a rich fur country. The finer furs were very plentiful, Fisher, Martin, Beaver and Mink. It was Salteaux and Cree country.\n\nFrom there he was transferred to Carlton serving under Chief Factor Lawrence Clarke. While there he was almost killed by a drunken Indian, to whom he refused liquor and who struck him on the head with an axe injuring him severely. It was many months before he recovered fully.\n\nFrom there he was transferred to Prince Albert to operate an experimental farm in an effort to see if wheat could be ripened there. While barley could be successfully grown at a number of posts wheat had been a very indifferent crop as frost always got it before it was ripe. The farm was located on the ridge east of Prince Albert.\n\nWhile at Carlton he played a heroic part during the smallpox epidemic. See Butler report appended.\n\nAfter leaving Carlton he served as Post manager at several important posts. Amongst them - Fort Pitt, Slave Lake, Vermillion, Fort St. James and others. He retired on pension from Fort St. James B.C. coming to Prince Albert and from there to the present Meskanaw. Meskanaw being a Cree word meaning Trail or Road.\nIn 1897 his daughter Maria joined him as housekeeper. She was also called settlers and pioneers of the district.\n\nAt the Trelill house, some liked the country and decided to homestead there, etc., Albert Owen, W.M. Trelill and John McCloy, others to homestead that year were Mr. Bowser, Thomas McCloy, F.J., McCloy, T.E., McCloy, Walter Trelill, P.J., Hicks, P., Crocker, W., Prewson, T., Wilson and I., Layton, All located within a two mile radius of Keshena. Those who came first opening the way for others.\n\nThe Trelill family moved to the ranch in 1900 and they certainly opened their hearts and home to all these newcomers. Some of whom came direct from England others and were very green \u2014 very much so. For instance \u2014 they put green logs to build their stoves and building them heavy to load decided to take the waste off the wagon and load them on the body. This very old, but when they tried to put the wheels back on \u2014 oh well \u2014 that's the way to learn.\n\nPeople lived very simply in those days food being the big problem. In the winter one could kill a steer or pig, were generous that supplies in bulk. This was at times a hard trip due to weather. At other times though it was looked on as a hobby or place to several traveled together and camping out around a fire cooking and burning.\n\nWhile some supplies could be purchased at Keshena, people had occasionally to go to Prince Albert to purchase their supplies in bulk. This was at times a hard trip due to weather. At other times though it was looked on as a hobby or place to several traveled together and camping out around a fire cooking and burning.\n\nSo this wasn't by any means the hardship that some people plante.\n\nQuite a number of settlers came in the next few years. Amongst them \u2014 Hansberg, Selness, O'Gordelle, Partridge, Kerr, Larvence and others soon followed.\n\nSome pressing problems came up, viz. a survey of TP. 44-22 W of 2. The surveying of this township had been carelessly done. Only one mound could be found in the whole township.\n\nA road direct to Keshena through Greentop Hill was needed.\n\nIt was deemed advisable to have some organization through which they could officially express their desires.\n\nA post office was also a necessity. In order to co-ordinate their efforts it was decided that the same person may be given to the district. The Bee, Press, and the Post Office arose, when we got one, thereby honouring Mr. Trelill, the first settler. (This in 1904.)\n\nAt a meeting held in Mr. Trelill's house it was unanimously decided to organize a Green Groves Local. John McCloy was elected President, and John Caldwell, Sec'y. Press, and the Post Office arose, when we got one, thereby honouring Mr. Trelill, the first settler. (This in 1904.)\nIn 1897 his daughter Maria joined him as housekeeper. She with Alex Dubois, (who was employed by him at that time), are still alive and can be truly called settlers and pioneers of the district.\n\nIn 1901 on return from South Africa, Boer War, several young men came to visit the Traill home. Some liked the country and decided to homestead there, viz., Albert Dower, W.M. Traill and John McCloy. Others to homestead that year were Mr. Dover, Thomas McCloy, T.J. McCloy, T.B. McCloy, Walter Traill, F.J. Riggs, P. Crocker, W. Frashton, T. Wilson and L. Clayton. All located within a two mile radius of the present village of Miskanaw. These may be truly called the Pioneers of Miskanaw. \"Those who came first opening the way for others.\"\n\nThe Traill family moved to the ranch in 1900 and they certainly opened their hearts and home to all these newcomers. Some of whom came direct from English cities and were very green \u2014 very much so. For instance \u2014 they cut green logs to build their shacks and finding them heavy to load decided to take the wheels off the wagon and load them on the body. This they did, but when they tried to put the wheels back on \u2014 oh well\u2014 that's the way to learn.\n\nPeople lived very simply in those days food being the big problem. In the winter one could kill a steer or pig, but in summer this wasn't easy to handle. However, ducks, prairie chickens and rabbits were plentiful and if one had a gun and most people had, either a muzzle or breachloader, and could buy ammunition the meat problem was solved. For instance, one day Mrs. Traill was out of meat so she gave an old Indian who happened to be there, a gun and two shells (hand loaded) and asked him to get some ducks. In a short time he returned with 17 ducks.\n\nWhile some supplies could be purchased at Kinistino, people had occasionally to make the trip to Prince Albert to purchase their supplies in bulk. This was at times a hard trip due to weather. At other times though it was looked on as a holiday or picnic if several travelled together and camping out around a fire smoking and yarning.\n\nWhile there were no graded roads the prairie trails, following the higher ground as they did, were generally good and wood and water were plentiful. So this wasn't by any means the hardship that some people picture.\n\nQuite a number of settlers came in the next few years. Amongst them \u2014 Hanberg, Selness, Caldwell, Farstad, Kerr, Lawrences and others soon followed.\n\nSome pressing problems crept up, viz. a resurvey of Tp. 44-22 W of 2. The surveying of this township had been carelessly done. Only one mound could be found in the whole township.\n\nA road direct to Kinistino through Crescent Hill was needed.\n\nA post office was also a necessity. In order to co-ordinate their efforts it was deemed advisable to have some organization through which they could officially express their desires.\n\nAt a meeting held in Mr. Traill's home it was unanimously decided to organize a Grain Growers Local. John McCloy was elected President, and John Caldwell, Sec. Treas. It was decided that the name Miskanaw be given to the district. The G.G. local and the Post Office also, when we got one, thereby honouring Mr. Traill, the first settler. (This in 1904.)\nThe organization carried on more or less efficiently during a little bulk buying in addition to pressing for the re-survey, post office and road.\n\nThe matter of re-survey was taken up in the Dominion Government and with our member, Mr. T.O. Devitt, M.P., After some correspondence a request was decided on, provided that each land owner agreed to accept this re-survey as legal and binding. All signed and the re-survey was made.\n\nAt a meeting held joint McLoey and John Freeman were named a committee to interview the Crescent Hill people as to their desire for a P.O. A meeting was called together at Mr. Weatherby's house and at this meeting it was agreed that they ask for a P.O. to be named Crescent HILL.\n\nAs to the road - In 1905 the first provincial election was held and Mr. Thomas Sanderson, Liberal, was elected. He promised that if elected he would press for the building of this road which he considered necessary. He did - one of the few members who lived up to pre-elected promises.\n\nIn the summer of 1906 a survey of the road was made, two bridges built and a grant of money given to fill in the approaches to these bridges and cut some bush from the road allowance. This money grant was a god send to the settlers even if the pay was only $2.50 a day for a man and team, 10 hour day - and he had to feed himself and team.\n\nThe Grain Grocers Local carried on with its ups and downs until the amalgamation of the two farm organizations, Grain Grocers and Farmers Union where it boasted a membership of over eighty members (paid up) and was represented at the amalgamation convention by eight delegates whose expenses were fully paid by the local. This showed a healthy state in the local.\n\nThe spiritual life of the people was looked after by the Anglican and Presbyterian denominations. Canon Thomas Clarke, an old timer in missionary work, represented the Anglican and various students the Presbyterian. Canon Clarke, an old time traveller carried his blankets with him ready to sleep on the floor either in the Trall home or in a bachelor shack. Mr. Trall donated a parcel of land for a church and grave yard. A church was erected (Anglican). This was later moved to the Meekanaw Village.\n\nThe first Presbyterian ordained minister was the Rev. Mr. Murdoch, a very fine man liked by all. Today a United Church stands in the village and takes care of those of that faith.\n\nIn 1907 a terrible tragedy occurred a few mile south of the site of the Meekanaw Village. When a family of Selkirk Indians from James Smith Reserve, Naqagawasoo, a Saltbox, his wife and two children, a girl of 16 and a boy of 12, lost their lives. They and some other Indians came from the same reserve were trapping on McGoy Creek near where the old hunting trail crossed it S.E. of Meekanaw. On Sunday morning they had a dispute over harvesting and Meekanaw decided to move to a lane a few miles south of Meekanaw. They had to travel through\nThis organization carried on more or less efficiently doing a little\nbulky buying in addition to pressing for the re-survey, Post office and road.\n\nThe matter of re-survey was taken up in the Dominion Government and with\nour names, Mr. T. Davis M.P., After some correspondence a resurvey was decided\non, provided that each land owner agreed to accept this re-survey as legal and\nbinding. All signed and the re-survey was made.\n\nBe the Post office. The P.O. Dept. said that when a direct road was\nmade passable we could get a P.O. especially if it would serve two Post offices.\n\nAt a meeting held John McCloy and John Freeman were named a committee\nto interview the Crescent Hill people as to their desire for a P.O. A meeting was\ncalled together at Mr. Weatherby's house and at this meeting it was agreed that they\nask for a P.O. to be named Crescent Hill.\n\nAs to the road - In 1905 the first provincial election was held and Mr.\nThomas Sanderson, Liberal, was elected.

When a family of Saulteaux Indians from James Butts Reserve,\nlost their lives. They and some other Indians came from the same reserve were\ntrapping on McCloy Creek near where the old hunting trail crossed it S.E. of\nMeekanaw. On Sunday morning they had a dispute over something and Meekanaw\ndecided to move to a lake a few miles south of Meekanaw. They had to travel through\nA dense bush of poplar killed by fire several years before. It was mostly in windfalls and under a tree that had been standing for several days started up again and burned by a very strong wind caught them and they had no chance of escape. The two children perished and the parents terribly burned. One of the horses although terribly burned was able to travel and the woman, suffering terribly, managed to mount him and ride back to where the other Indians were camped, for help. These brought them out as far as the Dead River and sent a young man to Kinistino for a doctor. The local doctor refused to go. The young chap then went to the station to hire Melfort for a doctor. He had no money and the Station Agent refused to take the wire.\n\nIn the meantime a merchant in Kinistino, Mr. Devlinie, wired the Indian Agent at Duck Lake of the tragedy.

(No telephones or cars in those days.) Mr. Devlinie did everything.\n\nEverything possible was done for them but both died. They suffered terribly.\n\nThe matter of the Station Agent was brought up in parliament by a private member but nothing was done about it.\n\nThe whole tragedy might truthfully be traced to a trader who visited the camp on the previous evening.\n\nToday Maskanaw is a thriving district containing some of the best land in Saskatchewan. This is reflected in the many fine homes and the number of elevators to be seen by the many who travel the old 44 Trail. Now a highway.\na dense bush of poplar killed by fire several years before.

They worked hard to build them on the top of the hill.\n\nThey didn't have any money to buy the whole back on - or will - that's the way to earn.\n\nPeople lived mostly simply in those days, for being the big problem.
