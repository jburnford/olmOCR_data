Use extra sheets of paper if there is not sufficient space to answer the questions. Don't hesitate to give details, or describe particularly events, if they help to answer the questions.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1914, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should fill out separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nSaskatchewan Archives questionnaires which have been prepared or projected are listed below. Please mark the ones you would be willing to answer.\n\n- All questionnaires\n- Pioneer diet\n- Pioneer schools\n- Pioneer churches\n- Pioneer recreation and social life\n- Pioneer farming experiences\n- Folklore in Saskatchewan\n- Pioneer health and housing\n\nPreservation of Questionnaires\n\nAll questionnaires will be preserved in the Office of the Saskatchewan Archives at the University of Saskatchewan as part of the permanent record of our province.
