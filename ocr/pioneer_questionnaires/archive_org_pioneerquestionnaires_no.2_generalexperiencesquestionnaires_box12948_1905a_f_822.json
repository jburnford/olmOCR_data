Some of the questions will not apply to your particular experience.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who have lived in Western Canada before 1914, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or reply on a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer Life: What Did Western Canadian Pioneers Eat?\" is still being circulated. If you have not already answered this, and would be willing to do so, please put a check mark here ( ).\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaires on other subjects will be prepared at a later date.

Sometimes bread would run short for so many, then we bought soda crackers or biscuits as we called them. I hoped it never have to eat them ever again. \"Would never be a suitable substitute for bread.\" There were no roads, and we got stuck in the mud with the road, and we had heavy loads. A huge Dukhobor came as we held heavy loads. A huge Dukhobor helped us once. Would not take money. Said he'd help us once. \"Would not take money. Said he'd help us once. Would not take money.

The first time I heard the coyote howl about 1904 when Lord Minto, then Governor General of Canada was touring the country in a democrat band team of horses. A mounted policeman was driving and a couple of policemen on horseback preceding the way, or flanking the democrat.

Clearing the land of brush, trees and roots by hand was very hard work for the men.\n\n35. Did many people move away during the 1930s? Did many return? Yes, many left but few returned.

Better schooling.\nHospital and doctor, only 16 miles away at Maidstone.\nMotor school vans in place of horse drawn vans.\nTravelling by air.\nNo more canning to do.

I thought nothing of putting up lots of beef\nin sealed in spring. Canned our own bacon ham. And it was very good.\n\nPlease give the names and addresses of other pioneers who could answer this questionnaire. Most of those pioneers don't care to bother. It would be easier to dictate to someone else. Our hands get clumsy makes it hard to write tidy.\nSome are too bashful to send their story in, as below.\n\nIf someone else has filled in this questionnaire for you, please have this person give name and address here:\n\nMy friends:\nMrs. W.

Also, all returned questionnaires will be preserved in the Saskatchewan Archives Office as part of the permanent record of our province.\n\nLewis H. Thomas\nProvincial Archivist\n\nIn 1952 when my husband was diagnosed with incurable disease, I entered a competition telling of something that happened 25 years ago. Deciding to enter, we decided on our new home built in 1928. I said nothing more to him, but worked at it between visits to the hospital; a week after we laid him to rest, the diamond ring came for me from McKenzie's Ltd of Regina. I was very proud naturally, but would have been more so had my husband lived to share my pleasure, as we knew he would have.\n\nThe story had to be written in 300 words, but here it is, covering 50 years of life in Saskatchewan, now 57 years, as it was written eight years ago.\n\nI have the letter from McKenzie's telling of getting or rather winning the ring. If the story is of use to you, you may keep it as I have a copy here.\n\nThank you for your good work. Sincerely, Edith Beaton\nDear Sir,\n\nThis questionnaire has been among my papers for several years. For several reasons, I couldn't get in the mood to answer it. Coming across it a few days ago, I decided to try it.\n\nIt looks rather jumbled to me now\u2014its finished, but maybe you can gather something from it. I tried to make things clear as possible.\n\nIn 1952 while my husband lay sick of an incurable disease, I entered a competition telling of something that happened 25 years ago. Deciding to enter, we decided on our new home built in 1928. I said nothing more to him, but worked at it between visits to the hospital; a week after we laid him to rest, the diamond ring came for me from McKenzie's Ltd of Regina.

Sincerely, Edith Beaton\nIt Happened 25 Years Ago\n\n1928 was a banner year for us \u2014 We built our dream home.\n\nMy husband as a bachelor, homesteaded in 1902 at Paynton Sask. We met the following summer, and were married in 1905.\n\nOur log home consisted of one large room at first; then as the children came (six in all) we added three more rooms. The last winter in the old house I'll never forget.\n\nThe north kitchen wall was blanked on the outside with oat sheaves \u2014 and the mice moved in.\n\nWe spared over house plans, more or less all winters; and in spring ordered a car of lumber, the largest box car that, to that time, had come to our village.\n\nWe located a contractor, and construction started early in July, on a ten-roomed house, with full basement, and a hundred barrel tank for soft water.\n\nThe days passed swiftly with extra men to feed, and lunches twice a day.\n\nWe moved in the end of October.\n\nOur new home was spacious, with high ceilings, sleeping porch, clothes closets, a screened verandah, and electricity (32 volt).\n\nNow the family enjoyed their new quarters! The youngest at this time was six years of age, and the eldest twenty-two. The children, three boys, and three girls, are all married now \u2014 with homes, and\nfamilies of their own, and we have fifteen grandchildren.\n\nOur youngest son married overseas, while serving with the R.C.A.F. They and their little son have a suite in our home, are partners in the home farm, and a great comfort to us.\n\nLast year our eldest daughter was home from Europe with her four children.\n\nThis year our youngest daughter is home with one little lad.\n\nSo our home still echoes to the sound of children's voices, and the patter of little feet.\n\nEdith & Beaton\n\nThe above story was written in May '1952' was entered in a competition sponsored by Mackenzies Jewellery Store of Regina, and won a prize of a diamond ring valued at $100.
