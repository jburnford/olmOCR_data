Give details.\n\nIt would be about the year 1930 that we were forced to ask for relief but got along with $10.50 to $12.50 a month with 3 and my husband and 4 children to feed but we didn't fare too badly for we had our meat and potatoes and cows and chickens prices at the local store were quite moderate at the time. I think the hardest task was trying to get enough surplus to buy a sack of flour which was only about $2.50 a hundred at the time, eggs bought as low as 10\u00a2 a doz. and butter 10\u00a2 a lb.\nOur food was all bought in bulk outside\nof dried fruit in wooden boxes. During\nthe war, sugar tin came with a tight\nsealing lid partitioned packages.\n\nWhen we came to the country in 1920 our daily\nmenu was oatmeal, mush, apples, potatoes, dried\nfruit, molasses for breakfast, meatless potatoes, offal or\ndried fruit, rice and gravy, building up dinner,\nmilk, potatoes, dried fruit, and cake the following day.\n\nMother was from northern New York, winter always being very cold.\n\nIn about 1915 we served our first Christmas dinner.\n\nWe served turkey, potatoes, stuffing, apple and onion pie,\ngravy and sauce, puddings, hot and cold.\n\nMrs. Earl Marsh, 35 yrs., Mrs. Earl Marsh, 40 yrs.,\nMiss Agnes Stebbins, 26 yrs., Miss Agnes Stebbins, 28 yrs.\n\nIt would be about the year 1930 that we were\nfound to be fairly but getting along with $10.50 to\n$12.00 a month with 3 and my husband and 4\nchildren to feed, but we didn't have too badly\n\nFor our food we had meat and potatoes and eggs\nand chicken, brown rice at the local store were\nquite moderate at the time. I think the\nhard luck was trying to get enough to eat\nto buy a sack of flour which was only about $2.50\na hundred at the time. Eggs brought a dollar\n10\u00a2 a day, and butter 10\u00a2 a lb.\nThere are a great many recipes for dainty foods to eat, but they are still a luxury only for a change as the groceries are so high such as nuts, dates, currants, etc., but we have plenty of eggs on the farm. We could buy these articles in olden times easier than we can today.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homestead and home prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible).\n\nWe were so busy up till about 1935 that we didn't raise a garden but up to that time we could buy canned vegetables quite reasonably but when we began raising a garden we canned plenty to do us for a year. Quite a few of the women in the country worked an outfit in the field so the garden became sadly neglected.\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include items not mentioned above, quality, methods of merchandising, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. (Use back of page if more space is needed).\n\nWe lived so far from a railroad when we came to the country that we only made about two trips a year to the store for groceries. I remember one year specially that we lived on just 100% of food from the store but prices were so reasonable we seemed to have enough. In the olden days we all lived in log houses that were really comfortable in summer as well as winter. The logs were hauled with teams and wagons from the Cypress Hills which were about 5 miles from here. There were surface deposits of what is called white mud which lies over\nWe were so busy at that time that we didn't have a garden but by that time we could try our hand at it. We had a nice little garden and we raised plenty of vegetables and fruits. We also had a few chickens and a couple of cows.\n\nWe lived on farmland where we could roam freely and enjoy the outdoors. We had two acres of land and we lived there for many years. We raised crops and animals and we always had enough to eat.\n\nIn the olden days we all lived in big houses that were usually comfortable and warm even in the winter. We had a fireplace and we would sit around it and talk about our families from time to time. We were very close and we always looked out for each other.\nabout 40 miles from here towards the hills\nand I would take a team and spring wagon\nand get a few sacks of it to white wash the log\nhouse which made it nice and clean again but\nwould rub off on our clothes if you leaned against\nit. The logs were chinked with mud and pieces\nof sod were laid on the boards for a roof and\nsometimes would leak through when it rained.\nThe logs were infested with bed bugs which\nwere impossible to exterminate or get at them\nthey came with the logs from the hills. We would\nhave the occasional dance in the log house\nwith the harmonica and fiddle for music. There\nwere some half breeds living up in the hills that\nplayed the fiddle and we would dance all night\nfor we were usually a long ways from home.\nThe half breeds were of French and Indian\norigin and were quite complacent.\nAs food we were never short although we didn't\nhave very much money to spend it didn't seem\nto take a great deal. We were quite a happy\ncontented lot but didn't have any luxuries.\nWhen we came to the country the land wasn't\nsurveyed to about 10 miles north of us so our men\nmeasured the distance by the revolutions of a wagon\nwheel so we then fenced a pasture under what we\ncalled squatters rights and it was pretty accurate\nwhen the land was finally surveyed. Our cattle\nran at large and each rancher rode around his own\ncattle every day to keep them from straying away\nthere were no fences only a pasture to keep the horses\nwe used.\nI hope I have covered this record to the best of my\nknowledge it is difficult to remember exactly but\nthink it is nearly correct. Mrs. Kate Sterling.\nabout 40 miles from there towards the hills and we would take a turn and driving wagon and get a few sacks of it to wash wash the by horses which made stoves and clean again but would not offer any of them a second again. The logs were chinked with mud and pine sometimes would leak through when strained. The logs were used for a roof and were impossible to get under or put them they came with the log from the hills. We would have the occasional dance in the big house with the harmonica and fiddle for music. There were some half-built living in the hills that played the fiddle and we would dance all night.\n\nFor our wives usually a long way from home. If she had been more of church and of prayer, and was quite content. After we were moved about although our eldest have very much money to spend it didn't seem to take a great deal nor were quite a happy contented lot but didn't have any luxuries.\n\nWhen we came to the country the land wasn't surveyed to about 10 miles north of us so our own measured the distance by the surveying of a wagon wheel so we knew a pasture wouldn't be called a quarter right and it was pretty accurate when the land was finally surveyed. Our cattle run at large and each rancher took around his own cattle every day to keep them from straying away there were no fences only a pasture to keep the herds in mind.\n\nI hope I have covered this record to the best of my knowledge it is difficult to remember exactly but think it is nearly correct.

Were you ever reduced to almost starvation level living on one or two locally produced foods? Give details.\n\nWhen the depression came in the 30s we were on relief for a few years and it was hard to manage the household on $10.50 a month sometimes food was very scarce but we managed to get enough to eat. I think the hardest task was to be out enough to buy a sack of flour for the small amount of relief only covered the smaller needs. I sold some butter and eggs, butter at 10\u00a2 a lb. and eggs @ 4\u00a2 each which was down to the lowest price, a crate of eggs would bring 48\u00a2 which wouldn't buy many groceries.\nBefore I was married with my mother and brother when I was 16 years old, my brothers and sisters were very young.\n\nAt breakfast, we had oatmeal mush, toast, bacon, and eggs. For dinner, we had roast chicken, mashed potatoes, pickles, and canned vegetables (tomatoes). We also had applesauce for dessert.\n\nWhen the depression came in the 30s, we were in relief for a few years and it was hard to manage the household. We had to economize and save money but we managed to get enough to eat. We tried to save money by buying a sack of flour for the small amount of flour only covered the smaller meals. We would save butter and eggs, but not at all, and eggs etc., which were down to the lowest price a crate of eggs would bring.\n\nI don't see much difference in the containers.\n20. Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\nWe cooked and prepared our meals in the same way as today comparing the common foods we didn't have any luxuries. We didn't have fruit and vegetable salads like we have today but sometimes had potato salad. My mother would boil corn beef and cabbage which was a luxury those days.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of homestead and home prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible).\n\nWe didn't raise a garden until about 1940 when I came quite a quantity of vegetables up till then we depended on prepared foods from the store although we didn't use them extravagantly. We used quite a lot of macaroni with cheese or tomatoes. When the farmers settled in this district they worked up garden patches but didn't have too much success for some time. Plant life doesn't do too well in this southern part of Saskatchewan.\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include items not mentioned above; quality, methods of merchandising, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. [Use back of page if more space is needed].\n\nWe have turned this district into mixed farming for we seem to be in a dry belt our rainfall is very sparse outside of our 10-year cycle when we will have about two rainy years enough to produce a crop to about 25 bushels an acre. Cattle raising seems to be the mainstay but grain production provides straw for stock in the winter. There are very few horses left as everything is mechanized. We need to drive a team and wagon over 50 miles of prairie to Chinook and Shaunavon and get some of our groceries which were cheaper than at our own place.\nWe worked hard and harvested our own vegetables in the same way we today consume the common foods we didn't have any vegetables. We didn't have potatoes or tomatoes but sometimes had potato salad. My mother would boil corn by hand, cabbage which was a luxury these days.\n\nThen all you bought to buy on purchased foods until my parents forced me to eat them. (Give us many details and facts)\n\nWe did not have a garden until about 1940 when I learned how to grow vegetables. Although we didn't need them, extravagantly we used up a lot of vegetables with cheese and tomatoes. Then the farmers settled in this district they worked up gardens quickly.\n\nBut didn't have to mind because for some time plants didn't do well in this northern part of Idaho.\n\nPlants and other details from your early experiences of buying vegetables.\n\nInclude dates not mentioned, locations, names, and other details.

My mother would fill a small dish with rendered beef tallow and put a small roll of white cotton rag in the center and light it at night to see to read by.

My mother would fill a small dish with rendered tallow and put a small roll of white cotton rag in the center and light it at night to see to read by.\n\nIt would make quite an odor in the room this would happen in the winter time if we happened to get short of oil and it was 50 miles to the nearest town.\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8\nOxford\n\nNo. 613 S\n\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jessylee/PioneerQuestionnairesPDFs//PioneerQuestionnaires_No.1-DietQuestionnaires_Box12939_1911_311.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 40, "total-input-tokens": 66400, "total-output-tokens": 14148, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 2], [0, 1422, 3], [1422, 1880, 4], [1880, 2799, 5], [2799, 3393, 6], [3393, 5422, 7], [5422, 6446, 8], [6446, 11377, 9], [11377, 12537, 10], [12537, 16551, 11], [16551, 18086, 12], [18086, 19396, 13], [19396, 19846, 14], [19846, 21562, 15], [21562, 22798, 16], [22798, 24417, 17], [24417, 25097, 18], [25097, 26691, 19], [26691, 28193, 20], [28193, 29805, 21], [29805, 31216, 22], [31216, 33677, 23], [33677, 34273, 24], [34273, 35665, 25], [35665, 36394, 26], [36394, 41053, 27], [41053, 42317, 28], [42317, 46206, 29], [46206, 47852, 30], [47852, 49137, 31], [49137, 49602, 32], [49602, 51645, 33], [51645, 52420, 34], [52420, 54282, 35], [54282, 55742, 36], [55742, 56737, 37], [56737, 57710, 38], [57710, 57798, 39], [57798, 57952, 40]], "primary_language": ["None", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, true, true, true, true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, true, true, true, true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]}}]
