(Mrs. John)\nMartin, Mrs. Ester (Mrs. John)\nSintaluta.\n\nTo Sask. - September, 1882.\n\nPIONEER QUESTIONNAIRES: A GENERAL QUESTIONNAIRE\n\nA LIST OF QUESTIONNAIRES TO THE PIONEERS\n\nIt is difficult to prepare a general questionnaire on pioneer life because no single item has been able to cover all the varied experiences of the pioneers. It is therefore suggested that each question be answered in detail, giving as much information as possible about the pioneer's life. If there is not sufficient space to answer the questions, the answers should be written on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer Life: What Did Western Canadian Pioneers Eat?\" is still being distributed. If you have not already answered this and would like to, please mark the clause you would be willing to answer.\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 2, entitled \"Pioneer Life: What Did Western Canadian Pioneers Wear?\" is still being distributed. If you have not already answered this and would like to, please mark the clause you would be willing to answer.\n\nEnrollment of Questionnaires\n\nAll questionnaires will be preserved in the Saskatchewan Archives Board Office at the University of Saskatchewan as part of our Provincial Archives. Please send your completed questionnaires to:\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Office,\nUniversity of Saskatchewan,\nSaskatoon, Sask.\n\n[Stamp]\nMartin, Mrs. Ester (Mrs. John)\n\nSintaluta.\n\nTo Sask. - September, 1882.\n\nPIONEER EXPERIENCES: A GENERAL QUESTIONNAIRE\n\nANSWER SO CAREFULLY AS TO THE BEST OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE.\n\nIt is difficult to impress a great quantity of information on pioneer life because no individual has been able to answer all of these questions. Some of the answers will be given in detail by those who have personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1924, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write their own answers on separate sheets or apply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires:\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer Life,\" has already been answered by Mrs. Martin and would be willing to do so, please get a check here.\n\nWestern Canadian Pioneers' Estate is still being investigated, so please get a check here.\n\nA later questionnaire on other subjects will be prepared at a later date. Some of these are listed below. Please mark the ones you would be willing to answer.\n\nAll Questionnaires\n\n| Pioneer health conditions |\n|---------------------------|\n| Pioneer social life, sports and recreation |\n| Pioneer education and churchwork |\n| Pioneer business experiences |\n\nInterpretation of Questionnaires\n\nAll questionnaires will be preserved in the Saskatchewan Archives Board Office at the University of Saskatchewan as part of the permanent records of our province.
