Is there any particular experience of pioneer days that stands out in your memory which you would like to record?\n   The first year or two were hard to get through with no money in the purse, for meat we had to live by the gun, the Mounted Police Patrol watched over new settlers and we were always glad to have them pay us a visit and join us at a meal. One morning we ate the last piece of bread for breakfast and about ten o'clock Mr Hitchins came along in a buggy and said, \"I was up to Battleford yesterday and the cook oil can got a leak and some oil got on this bag of flour and the Missus won't use it do you think Mrs Harrison could use it?\" I said \"Yes I think she could and thank you very much\", I might say there was very little oil on the flour. Mr Hitchins was a very good friend to us up to the time of his death which occurred on October 8th 1906. I was once walking over the river on the ice in early November and the ice gave way and let me through the box of groceries that I was carrying jammed in the hole and stopped me going through altogether, I scrambled out on to the ice and so along the shore, when I stood up my clothes froze. I was about four miles from home, I started to jog trot and a team caught up with me and took me home, after nights rest I was no worse.\n\n24. Did you travel about much in the early years? (for business, attending church, visiting friends, etc.)\n   Our means of travel was by team and wagon oft times by saddle horse say from 1903 to 1907 we had to go to Battleford for all our requirements and that was 25 miles from Baljennie. The first church services were held in Mr Hitchins house when an Anglican student Mr Maine came from Battleford on snowshoes. The first resident minister was Mr Love who lived in the old police detachment and was later moved to Quill Lake to be followed by Mr Cardwell. This gentleman was instrumental in getting a church built in Baljennie with funds donated by some ladies in Ireland who named the church St Bridgits (sad to relate this church was struck by lightning in the night of July 4th 1952 and was burnt to the ground, and was a total loss) We did most of our visiting in the winter, with the neighbours and dances, once hitching up four horses to a double sleigh box and driving 30 miles to Guiness school in 20 below zero.\n19. How often did you write to relatives or friends in your old home?\n\n20. If you got married, give the name of your husband or wife along with the date and place of marriage.\n\nMy wife's name was Catherine F. Crawford. We were married in St. Thomas Church, Pendleton, Manchester, October 27, 1902.\n\n21. Did anyone else come to Saskatchewan because of your recommendation? It as a place to settle? My wife's sister and her son of 16 years.\n\n22.

Is there any particular experience of pioneer days that stands out in your memory which you would like to record?\n\nThe first winter we had to live by the gun, the mounted police patrol watched over us. We were settlers and we were always glad to have them pay us a visit and join us at a meal.\n\nOne morning we ate the last piece of bread for breakfast and said, \"We'll go to Battleford yesterday and the coal oil will run out.\"\n\nI wanted to get oil on this bag of flour and the oil was very thin.\n\nIt was hard work to think Mr. Harrison could use it.
