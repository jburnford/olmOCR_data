(Give as many details and dates as possible).\n\nAfter 1915 when there was more money to spend we began to branch out but always tried to grow all we could to store vegetables for winter.

Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include items not mentioned above, quality, methods of merchandising, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details. (Use back of page if more space is needed).\n\nOne winter when the two men were planning to leave in the spring for work they wanted to get a supply of groceries from a small store 9 miles away in the middle of nowhere. A neighbor had promised to let them go along when he drove his horses to the store. They helped him for a day digging out shovels out of a snow bank only to be told by the sister-in-law that her husband had told her not to let the team go. So they took a child's sleigh with a boy on & walked to the store & back with supplies for myself, sister-in-law, niece & daughter.\nAfter 1915 when times were worse money to spend we began to branch out but always tried to grow all we could in our small garden for winter which saved much and we certainly paid out for beef when in town we didn't do too badly for meat.\n\nThe winter when the two mines were planning to close in the spring for work they wanted to get a supply of green manure a small store 9 mile away in the township I bought a mule for a mule team to go along when he came back from the mines. They kept him for a day digging out claims only a small hand only to be told by the owner-in-law that his husband had told him not to let the team go so they went child asleep with a boy or girl hand in to pack a wife to pull walked to the store & back next morning for myself, auntie & law, niece & daughter.\nOne time when driving by team I went to wagon to visit a neighbor I got a violent tooth ache. I sat in the wagon with a bright red blanket around my shoulders & held to my chest & smothered my brother-in-law's pipe hoping to get relief. As I jumped to the ground at the journey's end, the tooth ache stopped for the duration of the visit. Afterwards, I drove almost 40 miles to Gull Lake to have it teeth pulled.\n\nAnother time the form of us, sister-in-law & daughter myself & daughter hitched on or to a buggy & visited a neighbor.\n\nOur first garden was put in a circular fire break & we had a wonderful garden. A wash tub full I grew tomatoes among other things.\n\nOur mail was but in from the post office by a neighbor who was a minister who held service in two or three school houses. Every Monday I walked nearly 3 miles to his home for mail.\n\nWas lost once while driving home & made for the only light we could see & spent the rest of the night with neighbors.\n\nSaw some fearful storms & cold weather but had wonderful times.\n\nOur first winter we wore ragged a set of Flinch cards.\n\nOur neighbors were mostly bachelors, only one other woman who would not neighbor (the one whose husband owned the team I knew)\n\nI am sorry but I did not do the buying to any great extent & could not remember prices. We bought in quantities to last a season.\nOur time when driving by train I met a woman who was walking along the road. She looked very lonely and seemed to need someone to talk to. As we passed her, she turned to me and said, \"Do you want to go for a walk?\" Without hesitation, I agreed.\n\nWe walked for about an hour, enjoying each other's company. It was a beautiful day, and the fresh air cleared my mind. We talked about our lives and shared our hopes and dreams. It felt like we had known each other for years.\n\nAs we walked back to our homes, I couldn't help but feel grateful for the opportunity to connect with another human being. It reminded me of how important it is to reach out and connect with others in our community.\n\nI'm grateful for this experience and hope to find more opportunities to connect with others in the future.\nOxford\n\nNo. 613 S\n\nIf Slimtrim Fasteners are to be included, please specify.\n\nSp\u00e9cifiez si vous voulez des agrafes Slimtrim.\n\nMississauga, Ontario L5T 1M8", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jessylee/PioneerQuestionnairesPDFs//PioneerQuestionnaires_No.1-DietQuestionnaires_Box12939_1911_298.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 22, "total-input-tokens": 36520, "total-output-tokens": 5696, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 34, 2], [34, 1555, 3], [1555, 2464, 4], [2464, 3675, 5], [3675, 4387, 6], [4387, 5793, 7], [5793, 6605, 8], [6605, 11093, 9], [11093, 11292, 10], [11292, 15181, 11], [15181, 15529, 12], [15529, 16674, 13], [16674, 17072, 14], [17072, 18648, 15], [18648, 19238, 16], [19238, 21010, 17], [21010, 21799, 18], [21799, 23145, 19], [23145, 23943, 20], [23943, 23943, 21], [23943, 24097, 22]], "primary_language": ["None", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]}}]
