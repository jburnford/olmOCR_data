Some of the questions here will not apply to your experiences; others may prove impossible for you to answer. Do not worry about leaving blank spaces. The purpose of these questions is not to collect information, but to assure that questions are included to give details, or describe particular events, if they help to answer the question.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1905, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or reply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nSaskatchewan Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer Life: West 1870-1920\" Western Canadian Pioneers' Battalion is still being circulated.

One experience I had is worth the time to quote here.\n\nOn making my first trip to Montana for fuel to keep my house warm, I stopped to inquire at a farm house where I could get water. My owner said they had not had a drink all day. I was told I would find along the road near the trail after traveling what seemed quite a long way. I knew some water not far from trail and needed my own. Toward the end of the journey I heard footsteps. The men being followed for drink made a race for the water but on account of thin heads found it was white ahead and the water was probably 25\u00b0 of fever. They immediately they were into the mud right up to their knees. I jumped to the front of the wagon gear and yelled and shouted the trip and they came running around and out. They had been down in mud at least three feet. A neighbor of mine took a team of horses the same way home. Time later the good Lord was surely with me for if not I got out very safely.\nI have filled in questionnaires to the best of my recollection and trust it will be of some help to your poems. One experience I had is worth the trouble to quote here.\n\nOn making my first trip to Montana for the purpose of homesteading, I stopped to inquire at a farm house where I could get water. My host was very kind and offered me a drink all day long. I was told I would find plenty of water near the trail. After travelling what seemed quite a long way, I came upon water not far from trail and headed my oxen towards it. Through some accident, however, the oxen being frightened for drink made a race for the water first on discovery of their heads. It was white ash, mud, and the water was probably not fit for anything immediately they were into the mud right up to their bodies. I jumped to the front of the wagon gear and yelled and shouted the whole way down the trail. They have been down in mud at least three feet deep. A neighbor of mine took a team of horses the same way some time later. The ground was very muddy with me for a fellow. I got out very dirty.\nI would have gone down also.\n\nThe summer of 1900 was extremely dry and no snow the previous winter. About Aug. 5th it started raining and every other night for weeks there was a heavy thunderstorm.\n\nThat summer settlers further east came long distances looking for hay to cut. Some had hay cut and coiled in the very deep sloughs very soon the water covered the hay.\n\nThere was only one slough for miles around where all settlers watered their animals and I was fortunate enough to live within half a mile of it. For drinking water I dug a hole in center of a very deep slough close by and got some soakage water. (This was early spring)\n\nI might state I was one of the pioneer growers of grass for seed. In 1907 I sold my first Western rye seed to McKenzie Seed Co. Brandon. After that I increased my acreage every year and cleaned and petalled my seed and there was very few towns or prairies that I didn't ship seed to. Mr. Pearson of the Dom Seed branch at back has been at my farm a great many times inspecting my brown seed of later years.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nL.W.
