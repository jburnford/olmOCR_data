Other wise in her teens in the period after 1905, she herself was not actively housekeeping until 1918, but she remembers much of the housekeeping of her mother (and mine) home.\n\nI hope this will help you more to you in the study of early diet, which is contemplated. Incidentally, I might say that, as it was impossible for us to get Kellogg's products often we came here from the States, it affected my father's health, and helped to cause his untimely death at the age of 49. He had been able to get these foods in Chicago, and was much better down there for that reason. And thus in knowledge we have from our family history, it isn't necessarily what a letter tells us. It was an experience for knowing the facts of our own food supply.\n\nI hope you understand my point from.\n\nSincerely,\n\nC.T. Holstrom\nDear Sirs:\n\nI have been able to get my dear wife a\nfull set of music in the form of 60 records. God\nwilling she will be able to play them in the Grand\nHotel next summer. I am enclosing a copy of the\nbill of sale.\n\nThe northern lights are very beautiful at\nnight and still is an impressive sight. God\nwilling we shall be able to see them from\nhere.\n\nLet us hope that you will be able to come\nback soon. We miss you very much.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nR.T.
