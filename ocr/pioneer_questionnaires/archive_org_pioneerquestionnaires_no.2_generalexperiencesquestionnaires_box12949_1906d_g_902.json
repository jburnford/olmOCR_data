Darwent\nPIONEER EXPERIENCES: A GENERAL QUESTIONNAIRE\n\nAn Aid in the Preparation of the History\n\nIt is difficult to prepare a general questionnaire on pioneer life because no individual who is asked to answer it has exactly the same experiences as hundreds of others. The questions here will not apply to your experience; others may prove more useful to you than they do to others. You may find it easier to answer the questions in detail, or describe particular experiences if they help you to answer them.\n\nThis questionnaire is intended for persons who lived in Western Canada before 1924, and may be answered by anyone who has personal experience of the pioneer years whether born in this province or not.\n\nIf more than one member of the family can answer the questions, they should write them on separate sheets or supply for a separate questionnaire.\n\nOther Questionnaires\n\nWestern Canadian Archives Questionnaire No. 1, entitled \"Pioneer Diet: What Did They Eat?\" is still being circulated. If you have not already answered this, and would be willing to do so, please put a check mark here and one will be sent to you.\n\nWestern Canadian Archives Questionnaire No. 2, entitled \"Pioneer Life: What Did They Do?\" is still being circulated. If you have not already answered this, and would be willing to do so, please put a check mark here and one will be sent to you.\n\nPreservation of Questionnaires\n\nAll questionnaires will be preserved in the Saskatchewan Archives Board's Office at the University of Saskatchewan as part of the permanent record of our Province.
