Give a typical day's menu (breakfast, dinner & supper) for the earliest year you can remember. Give the year and list the members of the family with their ages at the time. State the approximate month, e.g., winter or summer.\n\nOat meal, not rolled. Bread and butter and milk.\ntea for the elders, very little coffee.\n\nI left home while many of the younger grew up,\nbut our main dish was oatmeal and I today never start breakfast unless I have oats. This boxed puffed, rolled,\npeanut butter, and all this other monstrosity so called\nfood is represented in the children today. Nine of our\n10 children are still alive. One Sister was killed in a runaway\naccident, and there is over 170 direct descendents in Canada\nI get a pension, and that is what I have to show for 64 Years of\nwork. I do NOT drink liquor, but am classed as too big hearted\nand my education stopped at age of 12 Years, but I am still\na going concern.\n\n18.

Mention any outstanding differences in the preparation of meals in the earliest days as compared with today.\n\nI will give you my reactions to this question. There is no animal on Earth today that knows less about feeding than man.\n\nThe so-called food is a lie; most of it, we are too busy making money to worry about food, but this joining up of the young men who sell the tales, wait and see. No teeth, poor vision, bottle babies drowning by the hundreds. Canada's liquor bill for 1949, and it is away above these figures now. For the Prov. of B.C. alone $57,000,000, liquor profits increased in 1950 one and half million dollars. The U.S.A. spend $2 billion, 800 million in one year, you can't expect to raise a healthy nation with figures for so value in return except wrecked homes, cars, people, suicides mental cases etc., and cigarettes were unknown when I was a boy, today the U.S.A. takes 1 billion, 800 million dollars in this racket, and what are the Churches doing about it, or anyone else for that matter.\n\n21. When did you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead of home grown and home prepared foods? (Give as many details and dates as possible).\n\nI never relied on purchased processed food, there is no money in pure food. Pure food is a lie. Half the people are dying from putrid meat. Cancer was unknown years ago. We have cancer, now the racket is asking for funds to start a heart fund. If people would take some exercise instead of riding, we would grow, we don't grow now, we evolve, in other words we are what we eat, believe it or not, mentally or physically. Young women telling mature mothers over the air how to raise their kids, give them the bottle so I may have time to go to the numerous shows, and nite life, while the baby sitters give liquor to the baby, oh yes, we are progressing.\n\nListen to the radio, read the pulp that is allowed to be sold murder, crime, etc., the children love this stuff. Crowds will block the entrances to shows, prize fights etc., pay $20.00 to see two men literally try to kill each other, they expect that. Thrills is what they pay for and they want it. Same with sex, where are the morals of our mothers gone, how can we blame the delinquency among the young, it is NOT the children's fault, it is the fault of our teaching, or not teaching. We will learn when it's too late.\n\n22. Please add other details from your early experiences of buying groceries and securing foods in other ways during pioneer days in Western Canada. Include items not mentioned above, quality, methods of merchandising, prices, problems of storage, shortages and other details.

He'd played with guns and gunmen, but this case got his goat.\n\nThe culprit was a baby who's countenance was very stern. He picked it up, it belched, and then he began lit up his eye. The baby passed out, least protein. The officer heard a sigh, the sitter moved unduly. The clue, just simply rye.\n\nA short investigation revealed a small containing between arms in the crook and baby wide open jaw.\n\nThe evidence completed and ready to disburse. The officer had found a crock in baby sitters purse. The baby herself in question had disturbed the sitters note. So in a nice convivial mood they cleaned it off the slate.\n\nThe moral to this story is as I see it today. The cost, the human wretch's extent that litter our history. All points to one conclusion. The Motions in a swoon we've paid the price, we've had our choice. And now await our doom.\n\nH. Battey\n\nOsoyoos, B.C. Feb. 23rd.
