From your subscriber D.W. Baker.\nmuch so we have always done only new\nfruits. Grapes are the awakened fuddings;\ninstead of new citrus or macadamia,\nbeing alone to do all the housework. I found\nsomething much, and too in the morning\nwe will be spared cereals instead of\nmorning.\n\n21. Then that you begin to rely on purchased foods and prepared foods instead\nof home grown.
