ARNOLD HAULTAIN, M.A.\n\nTORONTO, SATURDAY, 4TH JULY, 1885.\n\nThe importance call for a speedy contemporary contemplation of its difficulties. The phrase \"race-based\" is nevertheless misleading; and indeed, the vast majority of Indians are not white but appear so merely due to their geographic proximity.\n\nIf we regard India, a country where there exist significant religious minorities who are assumed to already represent distinct communities in their own right, then this antipathy is nothing more than an exasperation of those worthwhile attitudes\u2014a fact which should be remembered in any context which creates inter-ethnic tension and friction.\n\nI must equally draw attention to aamental estates against such a system; the fact that the majority of Indians are not of European descent would make it difficult not to lay too much emphasis in such contexts.\n\nIt is evident that the half-breeds were less likely to embrace certain policies, particularly those associated with the assumption of Indian identity. These differences are hardly likely to have been shared among Indians of similar ethnic backgrounds. It can therefore be said that these distinctions are likely to have been more significant for the purposes outlined above.\n\nOne strategy to consider would involve enlisting the services of trained educators who could help to address these issues. However, such efforts may prove challenging given the current political climate and limited resources.\n\nIn conclusion, while the specifics of the issue remain complex, the efforts made by various parties to address these concerns are commendable. As such, the ongoing dialogue will be essential in order to begin to address these issues effectively.\nTYPICAL SKETCHES.\n\n(1) Constables of the North-West Mounted Police guarding a trail to Prince Albert.\n(2) \"Lo! the poor Indian\" and his family.\n(3) Superintendent Cotton and Inspector Perry dispensing Justice to Blood Indians at Fort McLeod.\nThe CALL TO ARMS.\n\nIt will belong to the Dominion of Canada for the next three years to defend its frontiers against British invasion, and consequently to the way they have been treated in recent years, and consequently to the difficulties which the French Canadians have had to overcome in their efforts towards home rule and independence.\n\nIt was an excellent opportunity for the English-speaking Canadians to take part in this movement, and many of them did so. They joined the army and fought bravely, but unfortunately, when the war ended, they found themselves excluded from the benefits of the peace treaty, which entitled all citizens to a share of the spoils of war.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge all Canadians to rally round the flag of our country, and to defend it to the last extremity.\nTHE FIRST BLOOD.\n\nWhat was it, however, that caused the government to send troops to Rupert's Land? The answer is simple: it was the threat posed by the half-breeds. They had been gathering in large numbers at Duck Lake, and the government feared they would attack the settlers. The government sent troops to put down the rebellion.\n\nThe battle of Duck Lake was fought on March 26th, 1885. The government forces, led by Major Crozier, engaged the half-breeds, who were led by Louis Riel. The battle was short but intense, and the government forces emerged victorious. However, the battle was not without casualties, and several soldiers were killed or wounded.\n\nThe government's actions were met with criticism from some quarters, who argued that the government had acted too late and too forcefully. However, the government maintained that its actions were necessary to maintain order and protect the settlers.\n\nIn conclusion, the battle of Duck Lake marked the beginning of the North-West Rebellion, which lasted until the fall of 1885. The government's actions were controversial, but ultimately successful in putting down the rebellion.\nadvantages of any weakness in Montana\u2019s frontier. They could try to cross the Vermont frontier, or the Ontario Frontier, or over the boundary line in Michigan.\n\nA dispatch from Fargo, Dak., declared that the Fenian organization throughout the North-western States had been making active efforts to aid Red.\n\nIt was stated, too, that Red was not in actual command, but that the Fenian leaders were being hampered by \u201csecretive sympathies\u201d from the Union State. Such a group of adventurers as is described above. A prominent member of the Feman Brotherhood was reported to have been doing something more than merely gathering recruits. He was said to be \u201cwell organized in Chicago,\u201d St. Paul, Dakota, and in the middle West, that he could get men together and keep them there until such time as his followers could take Wauquesset and hold it without trouble, and before five days we may be in Canada.\u201d\n\nRobert Ross read a statement supporting that view. Ross thought it strange that Red should want to do something in that direction. The statement went on to say that Red was reported to have been admitted to having a hand in the rescue.\n\nRoss did not expect hearing of the statement made that night on the morning of the morning of the next day, that the Morning Post had quoted that Red was an active member, with a view of encouraging the Dominion authorities in their intention of sending troops being sent to Canada\u2019s frontiers.\n\nThese, however, need not detain us.\n\nTHE ROUTE.\n\nBefore following our own feet on our march by this route, let me tell you about the best-kept secret of the Canadian Pacific Railway to date: Canada Pacific Railway to Carson City. There are 80 miles of road on which the track is laid, so that we are now actually in the company of the railroad men; the fact that they follow a stretch of road that is now but 45 miles, then another stretch of road that is now but 125 miles, and then yet another stretch of road that is now but 250 miles, shows how the railroad is steadily advancing, with every day looking better than the last.\n\nThe Canadian Pacific Railroad, unlike many other railroads, does not follow the usual practice of running its tracks straight across the plains, but rather follows the contours of the land, to avoid crossing the marshes and swamps that are so common in this region.\n\nFor example, when traveling from Prince Albert eastward, one takes a route that goes through a series of distinct stages, each stage being marked by a signpost indicating the stage number, with the number increasing as one progresses further eastward.\n\nThe advance ordered by General Middleton was to be in three divisions, one advancing from North to South, one advancing from West to East, and one moving towards Battleford.\n\nThe Touchwood Hills route involves more mountainous country than any other route in what is called the \u201cWest,\u201d including the Peace River Valley.\n\nIn the west, however, there is an abundance of good farmland, which accounts for much of the prosperity of the region.\n\nThe route, while passing through some very rugged country, is also known for its beautiful scenery, with lakes, streams, and forests providing a picturesque backdrop for the journey.\n\nAs the riders of the night horse express themselves, so do the soldiers of the day.\n\nON THE MARCH.\n\nMeanwhile, how are our gallant men? As far as possible let them tell the story themselves.\n\nOne of the Toronto contingent writes thus on the day after starting:\n\n\u201cC. R. H., March 31st, 10.50 a.m. \u2014 \u201840 degrees below zero, fine, nice liver!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear \u2014\n\nWe make very few stoppages, and it keeps us in high spirits and good condition, and we have plenty of food. We slept well at Penola, for two hours this morning, at 5.30.\n\n\u201cGood appetite and good spirits prevail in all respects, but I fear that the cold will control our appetites.\u201d\n\nOthers of the group add their comments:\n\n\u201cWe had a hard night\u2019s ride, for it was seven o\u2019clock, and most of us could hardly walk upright. We were glad to reach McKellar\u2019s Harbour at 9.30, where we got a hearty breakfast. We started again at 11 o\u2019clock Monday morning.\u201d\n\nWe reached Matiwana at noon today, and had a long delay in getting the horses loaded, but at last we set off again at 1.30, only to have another delay before reaching McKellar\u2019s Harbour.\n\n\u201cWe were very much obliged for the kindness shown us by the farmers, who gave us a hearty meal and lodging.\u201d\n\nWe arrived at Port Arthur at eleven o\u2019clock this morning, and enjoyed a hearty meal.\n\n\u201cSome of the fellows from whom the articles below are written have been abroad recently, others have been away entirely, so we are obliged to publish for the first time the following letter from a fellow who was writing:\n\n\u201cI am writing this letter from Adare Station, March 31st.\n\n\u201cWe were well off by noon today, and now we have arrived at Port Arthur. After that, to Port Arthur, as far as I know.\n\n\u201cWe left with the second cannon and the \u2018Policeman\u2019 at ten o\u2019clock this morning.\u201d\ngap of 40 miles. When we left the other end yesterday at 3 p.m., the weather was very inclement, snowing heavily, and the wind blowing strongly. We encamped near the road side in the night being pitch dark and snowing hard.\n\nThe men had a tough time getting up and through woods. We encountered snowdrifts several times during our march. At the second camp, we found the ground covered with snow and ice. The men had to cut their way through the snow to get to the camp.\n\nAt the third camp, we met with a heavy snowstorm, and the men had to dig out their tents and make a fire to dry off their clothes. By morning, the snow had stopped, and we continued our march.\n\nWe arrived at Fort Arthur, Ontario, on April 15th, after a difficult journey. The men were tired but grateful for the opportunity to rest. They had been marching for days without proper shelter or food. The weather had been harsh, with snowstorms and cold temperatures. Despite these challenges, the men remained resilient and determined to continue their journey.\n\nThe following day, we set out again, this time with more provisions and better equipment. We encountered more snowstorms and difficult terrain, but the men persevered. We arrived at Winnipeg, Manitoba, on April 29th, after another challenging journey.\n\nIn Winnipeg, the men were able to rest and recuperate. They were grateful for the opportunity to see the sights and experience the city. They also met with local officials and learned about the history of the area.\n\nThe men then continued their journey, eventually reaching their destination in Quebec City. They were proud of their accomplishment and grateful for the opportunity to serve their country.\n\nThe Canadian Pictorial & Illustrated War News\nof March, last officers were allowed little rest; and on the 15th of the next month, April, the general, then captain and a staff captain in Col. Falton's regiment, took part in an affair at Alexandria where, for the first time, he showed his military qualities by his heroic conduct in risking his life alone to save his men from capture. He was afterward promoted by General Lagarde to Lord Clyde for the Victoria Cross. The story of his heroism is told in \"The Story of Middlesex,\" a book written by General Lagarde and published shortly after the battle.\n\nIn 1874, he took command of a large force of the rebels in the northern part of the country, where Sir Allan Macdonald, Hamilton, of the Royal Military College, had been sent to quell Captain Macdonald and another officer named Murray, who were engaged in a guerrilla war against the Government. His forces were defeated, but he managed to escape into Canada, where he joined his wife and children at Montreal. He remained there until the outbreak of the American Civil War, when he volunteered for service in the Union Army as a brigadier-general. He served with distinction throughout the war, and was brevetted major-general for his gallant conduct.\n\nAt the end of the war, he returned to Canada, where he died in 1882. His widow continued to live in Montreal until her death in 1891.\n\n**Souvenir Number**\n\n**General Lagarde**\n\n**The Victoria Cross**\n\nThe story of General Lagarde's Victoria Cross is told in \"The Story of Middlesex.\" It is said that the Victoria Cross was awarded to him because of his daring exploits during the Battle of Alexandria. He was the first Canadian to be awarded the Victoria Cross.\n\n**The Victoria Cross**\n\nThe Victoria Cross is the highest decoration for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British subjects. It was instituted in 1856 and is awarded for acts of\u975e\u51e1 courage or devotion to duty performed in the presence of the enemy. The award is made by the Queen in Council.\n\n**The Victoria Cross**\n\nThe Victoria Cross is the highest decoration for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British subjects.

The award is made by the Queen in Council.\nTHE ADVANCE.\n\nA very few weeks will suffice to give the reader a clear conception of the plan of advance adopted by the Major-General commanding. He was anxious that every man should feel as though he belonged to the regiment, and therefore everything was subordinate to his wishes, but he never neglected to keep in touch with the remaining members of his staff, who had to deal with all matters relating to the various companies. His orders were carried out promptly and efficiently, and the march proceeded without difficulty.\n\nThe first move was made by the 2nd Battalion on October 15th. They embarked at Toronto School of Infantry, 40 men; Royal Grenadiers, 100 men; Regiment of Foot, 50 men; Winnipeg Field Battery, 6 men; Capt. French\u2019s column, 25 men; Col. Boulton\u2019s volunteer force, 76 men; Capt. Carleton\u2019s volunteers, 39 men. They then marched to the north-westward, following the telegraph line and river in order to avoid unnecessary delay. On the way they came upon Strickland\u2019s Hill, Alcan Plains, through Humber Inlet, to meet the South Saskatchewan.\n\nThe main body started on December 1st. The Canadian Pictorial and Illustrated War News reports that by December 12th the advance had reached the vicinity of Fish Creek. The news of this bloodhlood was received with great enthusiasm throughout the country, and many more volunteers joined the army. It was decided to send a detachment under command of Lieut. Col. Dufferin to investigate the rumours. They marched to Ulster, 50 miles west of Fish Creek, and there found evidence of an ambush. The Indians had been planning to attack the soldiers, but when they saw how well armed they were, they withdrew. Lieut. Col. Dufferin wrote to the government, urging them to send reinforcements.\n\nOn the evening of December 12th, Lieut. Col. Macdonald, commanding the 1st Battalion, addressed his men, telling them that they were about to enter upon a new and hazardous campaign. He emphasized the importance of maintaining discipline and obeying orders, and promised to do everything possible to ensure their safety.\n\nThe next day, December 13th, the 1st Battalion marched towards Fish Creek. They met with some resistance from the Indians, but the soldiers fought bravely and drove them off. Lieut. Col. Macdonald wrote to the government, thanking them for their support and encouraging the public to continue their generous contributions.\n\nThe battle of Fish Creek was fought on December 14th. Despite their numerical superiority, the Indians were unable to break through the lines of the soldiers. Lieut. Col. Macdonald wrote to the government, stating that the battle had been fought fairly and that the soldiers had performed their duty to the highest standard.\n\nAfter the battle, Lieut. Col. Macdonald wrote to the government, expressing his satisfaction with the performance of his men. He was pleased that the battle had not resulted in any serious losses among the soldiers, and he reassured the government that the soldiers would continue to serve loyally and faithfully.\nvillage of Bear Hills seems to be very heavy and unhealthy, the trail running through low-lying swamp land, much of which is submerged, except in very dry weather. The Indians are said to be gathering in force at this place, and the settlers are gathering at the same time. The Indians have been known to attack the bands of three Cree chiefs\u2014Saskatchewan, Red River, and Ermineskin. Twenty miles from the village is what is known as the Battle Ground, where the Indians are gathering in great numbers. The country is swampy, low-lying, and sparsely covered with clumps and patches of grey willows. About half-way up the valley there is a thick growing, low-lying swamp of willow and black birch, between which and the river the Indians are said to cross at any time. The approaches to the stream are very soft and sandy, into which the men and boats waggons would sink indefinitely.\n\nMajor Macdonald, a distinguished and much respected chief of the Mounted Police, took charge of all the available forces, and put them in motion immediately. The steamer Saskatchewan and Edmonton were put in a state of defence. At this juncture, the steamer North Star, carrying children, at the latter end of June, was ordered to proceed from Medicine Hat, where Captain Kirwan was stationed, to the Crossing, passing Swift Current on the way.\n\nI cannot do better than append here a poem written by Captain Kirwan, which appeared in the pages of the Canadian Pictorial and Illustrated War News.\n\n---\n\n**On Board the North Star**\n\nThe South Saskatchewan, May 3rd\n\nMy hand is unwearied, and the table on which I am writing is shaking for an hour, and though the wind is blowing, the sea is calm. We are going down the South Saskatchewan. Our destination is the South Saskatchewan. We have plenty of hard tack, tea, sugar, ammunition and other necessaries for our trip. We are crowded aboard, but we are not afraid. We are going to make it to our destination. We have plenty of flour for a few days, and with the help of the men and boys who are working, we shall be able to make it to our destination.\n\nAt nine o'clock the guard is mounted; two sentries are posted, one over the quartermaster's store, and the other over the Gatling gun, which grinds with its loud noise the sound of the steamer. At twelve o'clock they get their dinner, and at three o'clock they go back to their posts. A picket company of a captain, a subaltern, a sergeant, two corporals, and twenty men, is doubled. When we are anchored in midstream, but when there is no protection, we are obliged to retreat to the boat. Captain Kirwan has the command of the steamer, and he has ordered the steamer North Star to be prepared for action. The steamer North Star is now ready for action. The steamer North Star is now ready for action.\n\n---\n\n**Incidents of the Rebellion**\n\nEscape of the McKay Family to Prince Albert through the Ice\n\nA correspondent of the Globe, writing April 4th, relates the subject of this illustration, which follows:\n\nJ. McKay, a farm instructor above Battleford, arrived with his wife and two young children. He had been threatened with death by the rebels, and had escaped by the aid of a friendly Indian, and came down the river in a canoe. He had been forced to leave his house and family behind him, and was now making his way to Prince Albert. He had been forced to leave his house and family behind him, and was now making his way to Prince Albert.\n\n---\n\n**Capture of Whitecap Band by the Body Guard**\n\nThis event was one of the most striking incidents in the experiences of the Government Troops during the war. General Macdonald, the commander-in-chief, had been engaged in active service. A scouting party, under the command of Major Macdonald, approached the camp of the Whitecap Band, and captured the entire party. The band was then marched off to Prince Albert, and was given a reserve near Saskatoon, and his band have violated the hospitality of the Indians, where they sought shelter after participating in the Minnesota massacre.\nHOW HER MAJESTY'S MAILS WERE CONVEYED FROM TOUCHWOOD TO CLARKE'S CROSSING.\n\nCAPTURE OF WHITE CAP AND HIS BAND BY THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S BODY GUARD.\nOffice of The Grip Printing and Publishing Company.\n\nToronto, June 15th, 1885.\n\nWe have pleasure in presenting to the public the first of two Souvenir Numbers of The Canadian Pictorial and Illustrated War News. These will form a complete letter-press and illustrated history of the late North-West Rebellion.\n\nEach part consists of 24 pages, composed of twelve pages of illustrations and ten of reading matter, and in addition, a very fine colored supplement. The ten pages of reading matter contain the equivalent of about 140 pages of an ordinary book, while the pages of illustrations are, in themselves, a complete history of the principal events and persons concerned in the rebellion.\n\nThe history is written by Mr. T. Arnold Haultain, M.A., the clever author of \"The War in the Soudan.\"\n\nThe illustrations have been compiled at great expense from the most authentic sources, including sketches from our special artist accompanying the expedition. The artists engaged in the preparation of the illustrations comprise the best talent available, both in Canada and the United States, and include the following: W. D. Blachley, J. W. Bengough, J. D. Kelly, J. Humme, W. W. Wessbroom, A. Lampert, Wm. Bengough.\n\nThe retail price of the work is 50cts. per part ($1.00 for the complete history), and, considering the quality and amount of matter given, is perhaps the most remarkably cheap publication ever offered in Canada. The two parts can be bound in book form if desired, and will make a very attractive volume.\n\nTHE SECOND PART\n\n(SOUVENIR NUMBER, No. 2)\n\nWILL BE ISSUED ON OR ABOUT AUGUST 1ST,\n\nAnd will contain the continuation and completion of the History of the Rebellion, and the full compliment of fine illustrations. The illustrations will represent the principal events from the Battle of Fish Creek, and will include the Battles of Cut Knife Creek and Batoche.\n\nThere will also be issued with the Second Part a very fine Colored Supplement, suitable for framing.\n\nTHE GRIP PRINTING AND PUBLISHING CO.,\n\nPUBLISHERS.\nJOHN PRITCHARD GUARDING THE CAPTIVE LADIES, MRS.

The fight had begun by the firing on the Indians. The bullets came on so fast that the men could not see the enemy, but their presence was felt by the sound of the bullets. They rushed up the hill and into the woods, where they found the Indians in a hollow. The Indians were driven back, and the men pursued them until they reached the top of the hill. The Indians then turned and fired upon the men, who returned the fire. The battle continued for some time, until the Indians were finally driven off.\n\nThe Canadians were victorious, and the Indians were forced to retreat. The battle was fought near Fish Creek, and the Canadians lost only one man. The Indians lost several, including their chief. The battle was a significant victory for the Canadians, and it marked the beginning of the end of the Indian raids.\n\nAFTER FISH CREEK.\n\nWe left there last night and have been having a hard time fighting all day. If fighting all day was hard work, the nights that followed were even harder. We were constantly under attack from the Indians, who were always trying to surprise us. We had to be very careful when we moved, and we had to be prepared for anything. We were able to hold our own, however, and we were able to drive the Indians away.\n\nThe battle was fought near Fish Creek, and the Canadians were victorious.

The detail of the following: John Casper Scott, Colonel; Salmon Arm Mounted Rifles, 50 men.\n\nInspector Steele says: \u201cOn Monday, March 4th, the first division of the column was very late in arriving; they were delayed by the fact that they had to cross the Rocky Mountains at night, which was very difficult due to the snow and ice covered roads. They also encountered several Indian camps along the way, which caused them to halt and scout for several days.\n\nThe column consisted of several divisions, including the Mounted Rifles and the Light Infantry. On their march across the plains, they encountered several obstacles, such as snowstorms, torturous terrain, and hostile Indians. Despite these challenges, the column continued on their mission, and eventually reached Edmonton.\n\nAt Edmonton, they met with Colonel Scott, who informed them that the Plains Indians had attacked several settlements and had been driven back by the Mounted Rifles. The column then proceeded northward towards Fort McLeod, where they arrived safely.\n\nIt was not until March 12th that General Strange met with Chief MacKenzie, who informed him of the recent attack on Fort Pitt by the Plains Indians. General Strange immediately dispatched a small force under Captain Scott to investigate the situation.\n\nCaptain Scott and his men set out early in the morning and encountered signs of an battle near Telegraph Creek. They followed the trail of the Indians and eventually found their camp. After a brief engagement, the Indians retreated, and the column proceeded on their journey.\n\nOn March 16th, the column arrived at Fort McLeod, where they received word of another attack on Fort Pitt. General Strange immediately ordered Captain Scott to lead a reinforcements team to Fort Pitt for immediate action.\n\nThe reinforcements team arrived at Fort Pitt on March 20th and found that the fort had been abandoned by the Indians. They proceeded to investigate further, and soon discovered that the Indians had been driven back by a relief force from Fort Cameron.\n\nMeanwhile, the Plains Indians were gathering strength and preparing for another attack. General Strange ordered Captain Scott to lead a scouting mission to locate the enemy.\n\nCaptain Scott and his men set out on their scouting mission and encountered several hostile Indians. After a brief engagement, they returned to Fort McLeod, where they reported their findings.\n\nThe column then continued on their journey, and successfully completed their mission in Alberta.\n\nIn conclusion, General Strange\u2019s column demonstrated remarkable endurance and determination in the face of numerous obstacles and challenges. Their successful completion of the mission provided valuable information and strengthened the position of the Canadian government in the region.\u201d\n**Major Commanding Cavalry.**\n\n*From Allaire Field Post.*\n\nOn the day previous to the Battle of Big Bear, Mr. Wm. McConachie, Mr. Gowanlock, captain since the Frog Lake settlement, succeeded in making their escape. The last news reached Mr. McConachie protecting three ladies from the Indians during the long, dark nights on the half-breed trails. The captives had boarded a little caravan of their own, and when the camp moved they moved along slowly. They were not without reason in questioning the Indian camp moved slightly in advance of them backgrounds in charge of the priests. Thus on the first day a lack of watchfulness had been exhibited by the Indians. It was late, however, before the half-breeds drew further behind, and finally turned off the trail and drove their herd, much to the satisfaction of the commandant direction of Turtle Lake. They intended making a wide detour, and come very highly.\n\nPoveshell confirmed by telegraph could be safe. A party of a dozen of our scouts, however, got on chivalrously. The Indians, perhaps, had some clue as to what was going on. Instead of Indians escaping from the general camp, they dashed suddenly into their midst, and tried without further delay. Their first thought, however, was to get away quickly from Burnt Village near their request for provisions, and left in disarray. These peaceful-looking Indians, however, attacked the commandants. The General did not wait for the second attack of the Indians upon his patrols, he called together the force was sent directly on the morning of June 29th. Captain Skye, of the Mounted Police, was present throughout. He had been engaged in his secret make mention of General Middleton. We have heard left him at Batoche. To him we must return the thanks for timely assistance furnished General Strange.\n\nThe day following the victory was occupied in rounding up the scattered bands. White faces were seen everywhere. The raiders and the Indians looked very much alike: they seemed to adopt similar tactics in separating themselves. The ringing out order was distinctly heard. Umbrellas and parasols were distributed among the police forces engaged in securing the prisoners and the horses.\n\nAt 7 p.m., the signal was given to begin the march. Before night, the combined forces were massed on the south side of the lodges of the friendly Indians. In the morning, the steamer \"Assiniboine\" came alongside, and the soldiers began to take possession of their quarters. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Bertie, who had been engaged in a series of negotiations with the Sioux Indians, arrived from Fort William and delivered a proclamation which he had prepared. This proclamation informed the Canadian people of the importance of their position in reference to the Sioux Indians, and directed them to employ all means possible to ensure the peace and safety of all persons residing in the district.\n\nOn June 30th, General Strange moved his headquarters to Fort Pintecos, where he gathered a force consisting of about 800 men. This force included elements from the Mounted Police, the Royal Canadian Rifles, and various other units. The purpose of this gathering was to formulate a strategy for the suppression of the Sioux uprising.\n\nIn July, General Strange led a column of troops to the scene of conflict. The troops were well supplied with provisions and equipment, and were armed with the latest firearms. The column included units such as the Royal Canadian Dragoons, the Royal Regiment of Canada, and the Queen's Own Rifles. They were under the command of Colonel Robert Bruce.\n\nGeneral Strange's tactics involved a combination of diplomacy and military force. He sought to negotiate a peace agreement with the Sioux leaders, while simultaneously preparing for a decisive battle. TheSiouxIndiansfoughtbitterlyagainstthetroupsonJune 31st, resulting in several engagements.\n\nOn July 1st, General Strange issued a proclamation to the Sioux leaders, declaring that the Sioux were an enemy to the Canadian government and its citizens. This declaration was met with further resistance from the Sioux, who continued to conduct raids and attacks on military installations.\n\nBy July 2nd, General Strange had assembled a sufficient force to secure the area around Fort Pintecos. The Sioux leaders were isolated, and communications between the Sioux and the outside world were severed. This situation effectively prevented any further outbreaks of violence.\n\nIn conclusion, the campaign against the Sioux Indians was a significant event in Canadian history. The combined efforts of military and diplomatic forces ultimately resulted in the pacification of the Sioux territory. The Sioux became allies of the Canadian government, and their conflicts with the Canadian authorities ceased. This event marked a milestone in the history of Canada, as it demonstrated the ability of the Canadian government to maintain order and stability in the face of challenges posed by external threats.\nin the gallant attack of Major Steele's men.\n\nThat was the pluckiest engagement of the night, and most of the Indians got another had\n\none of them, however, fired on Canon McKen when he went out with a flag of truce.\n\n\"Yes, this was a little people, and one or two others, the worst in the crowd. But the Indians had been with white men before, and the chief of the fight. Steele's men fired up in the morning, and they did not get up in time, but I thought I wouldn't get back alone. I came to the spot where I thought I saw the Indians, but there were no signs of them. I was sitting and had left a few to keep a fire, and while I was away, an old man came up to me and said, 'What are you doing?' I thought he was going to arrest me for killing someone, so I said, 'I'm just resting.' He then took me by the arm and led me away from the scene.\n\n\"...Now how many Indians were there killed in the engagement?\"\n\n\"I don't know. They said they were killed, and two wounded.\n\n\"Among the killed were Cut Arm, the Wood Cree, and two others.\"\n\n\"When the dead were brought into camp, the Indians of the band came to look at them. They showed great respect, even shedding tears. They protected themselves in case they were cornered, but they did not use their firearms. They were very quiet, except on one occasion, when they wanted us to assist them in digging a grave for a chief. Our men helped them, and they buried him. Then they dug the grave, and they never interfered with our work.\"\n\n\"We were told to keep the Indians out of our way. We did not want any trouble, so we kept away from them.\n\n\"The next day we started for the Fort. We had to make a detour because of the Indians. We had to take possession of some land which belonged to the Indians. We met the Indians at a river, and they tried to stop us. We had to force our way through them. We were very careful not to hurt anyone.\n\n\"We had to leave the Indians behind us, and we continued on our way to the Fort. We arrived safely.\"\n\n\"Had you heard anything about the Indians beforehand?\"\n\n\"Yes, I had. They were said to be very dangerous, but I did not believe them. I thought they were just trying to scare us.\n\n\"We had to be very careful around the Indians, but they were very friendly. They let us pass without any trouble.\n\n\"We arrived at the Fort safely, and we were very pleased to see our friends again.\"\n\n\"Had you heard anything about the Indians beforehand?\"\n\n\"Yes, I had.

The steamer had three large barges in tow, and upon these, the troops were quartered in more or less comfort, fifteen hundred men, officers and wounded, took quarters on the steamer, which was on Monday, we were still waiting for a favorable wind; but the steamer and barges crowded with troops and stores presented a lively and novel sight as they made for Lake Winnipeg and home. First came the Princess, then the other two barges\u2014all strung on huge hawsers, so arranged that there is room for three men each craft. Lake Winnipeg\u2014despite its 300 miles of length and ninety of width\u2014is shallow, and the boats were forced to be very low in the water, unusual, so that it doesn't take much of a breeze to kick up a decent sea. We have had a half day's fair breeze from north-west, and boats and barges played pitch and toss as a great wave, hauled up by the boat behind, sent a birth in the hold of one of the barges\u2014dark as Erebus and badly ventilated\u2014it was not desired. A half day's fair wind was too much for the boat; the sea soon dried into wrinkles, thence to dimples and finally to smooth, and the boat-like craft on a person's pin when the change came on.\n\nThe Princess taking one barge, parted company of Steamer, which was forced to take the tow of two to follow, Gen. Middleton, who was on the Princess, making it known that he would get into port first, and would keep his place before the rest of the force. Both boats arrived at Fort Garry on Wednesday night through the lower lake and a tedious passage through the despot of the mariner, the rapids, and the river below where the North finds outlet.\n\nOn arriving at Winnipeg the troops were received with loud enthusiasm. Business was at a standstill, and the whole city gave itself up to a celebration. The demonstrations of joy expressed in waving flags, venerated boning and noble arches, but more especially in the demonstrations of joy expressed in thousands of their fellow-countrymen, many weary hearts rejoiced at the coming of the integration of a free and generous people\u2014the same people who performed under almost overwhelming difficulties and achievements of which the world had undergone. Let those who bring to the forgiveness the disintegrating forces of the throne and the crown, and the absolutist national feeling which came suddenly into view, remember that the crown is now endangered. The former are largely imaginary and indefinite, the latter is actual and deep seated.\n\n**THE RETURN.**\n\nA few weeks after the welcome the men received on their return home...\n\n**INCIDENTS OF THE REBELLION.**\n\nCamp Life at Fort Pitt\n\nHere we have the last illustration by Mr. Charles F.
