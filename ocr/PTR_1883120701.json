He noticed that when the conductor pulled the rope the train stopped, and he did not direct the passengers to get off. The old fellow attached to pull a cord, but determined not to exhaust himself by doing so. He often crashed into locomotives\u2014his head was always hanging out of the window of the waiting farm house and there seemed to be trying to keep up with the train. Sprouting from his neck began the balloon-like growths which caused him to stand still. The old fellow got off, and found himself in a field where he had been carried along by the motion of the train. When he recovered the conductor came up and tried to pull the bell cord as though he would break it, and turn- ing to the old fellow said:\n\n\"What have you been doing?\"\n\n\"Sprouted my hair,\" snatched thoughtfully back his head once more! How I didn't break myself!\n\n\"I wish you had broken yourself and not used me as a support!\"\n\n\"You've continued me as much as you pleased,\" said the conductor. \"I'll try if I could take a pull at the bell cord.\"\n\n\"Why did you hang that bell?\"\n\n\"What made you hang that bell line? I told you to hang it on my hat.\"\n\n\"You hate's not worth fifteen cents.\"\n\n\"Not to hang it, because you hate's not yours,\" said the conductor. \"But you hate's all I've got, and I'm glad if I could take a pull at the bell cord.\"\n\nPull that rope again and I'll leave you in the woods.\"\n\n\"I won't hang it now, but I'll hang it on my hat, so when you take it off, look out.\"\n\n\"If I did hang it, you'd have your hat on.\"\n\n\"The window was put here to look out of, not to hang a bell line.\"\n\nAfter while the train stopped on a bridge and the old fellow came out. A dog of wild appearance came up and barked.\n\n\"There!\" he exclaimed. \"Hanged if she ain't gone.\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked the conductor who had witnessed the calamity.\n\n\"Yonder she goes!\" said the old fellow pointing to the dog.\n\nThe conductor laughed. \"How did she happen to go?\"\n\n\"See back there,\" said the conductor, \"she was there first after she had run.\"\n\nThe conductor looked at the old fellow and said:\n\n\"What do you think of that fellow?\"\n\n\"Try hanging your rope again.\"\n\n\"There is nothing very handsy\" and he handed the old fellow a half pint bottle. \"Take a little of this, it will do you good.\"\n\n\"Yes, but you mustn't hang it on your hat.\"\n\nThe conductor looked at him a moment and said:\n\n\"What do you think of that fellow?\"\n\n\"Try hanging your rope again.\"\n\n\"There is nothing very handsy\" and he handed the old fellow a half pint bottle. \"Take a little of this, it will do you good.\"\n\n\"Yes, but you mustn't hang it on your hat.\"\n\nThe conductor looked at him a moment and said:\n\n\"What do you think of that fellow?\"\n\nPROSPECTUS OF THE Prince Albert's Directory AND BUSINESS GUIDE.\n\nIt is proposed to issue a Business Directory for the town of Prince Albert and District of Lorne in a pamphlet form which will contain the advertisements of each business establishment, to be inserted at a nominal rate and a descriptive notice of each.\n\nThe purpose will contain a history of Prince Albert and District, together with future prospects, together with a statement of this year's crops as far as they can be ascertained, the number of District Lots, the extent of average forestland, number of bovine per acre, increase over last year's crop, population of District, a list of local information written by a well known journalist.\n\nAbout 500 or more copies will be published and distributed free of charge to residents, which will be distributed throughout the Dominion and the Mother Country.\n\nIt is hoped that by this means, benefits will result, not only to each individual advertiser and subscriber, but to the whole community, by increased trade and an appreciation both of the land and climate and a healthy emigration encouraged to this country.\n\nPrice of advertisement, single page with notice on opposite page, $10; two pages given free.

There stood Philip Adams, Emma's husband, and their child, all seated around the hearth watching the walls.\n\nThe whole bitter truth came upon him with terrible force. Anna, supposing Emma to be dead, had married Philip, so as to have a house and herds and child to take care of. She had come back for Emma, and he was mad about it. Not only was his own child had to be sent to live with his aunt, but Emma, though that was a bitter pill, as the child needed a little Philip anyhow.\n\nNeither of them knew as to what Philip was doing. Anna, supposing Emma to be dead, had married Philip, so as to have a house and herds and child to take care of. She had come back for Emma, and he was mad about it.

O. DAVIS.\nCOMMUNICATIONS.\n\nTHE TELEGRAPH.\n\nTo the Editor of The Times.\n\nSir,-After an absence from Prince Albert that has been considerable, I find that there have been considerable developments over telegraph matters, so attention has been drawn to the latter in the last issue of the paper. It appears that a letter was written to Prince Albert, some of whose contents are included in which I am unable to quote.\n\nFrom this letter again: \"Mr. Clarke will appear that the offer of a site for an office at Guelph was made by Mr. Clarke, but accepted by Mr. Hartley until he arrived at Prince Albert on November 2nd. When I was in Barrie about two weeks ago I had a conversation with Mr. Hartley Gibberson, District Telegraph Superintendent, who informed me that he had heard nothing of this matter, and that he had no knowledge of it. He said that he had heard nothing of this subject, having been a member of the committee appointed to procure the place required by the Government, and when he said that he had heard nothing of this matter, Mr. Clarke had offered two lots then, and the question had been discussed. Mr. Clarke was not the largest contributor, he (Gibberson) considered that he had the best right to be heard, and that he should not suffer from anybody else. I pointed out to him that the place selected was very inconvenient for the people of Prince Albert and I offered myself to give him a convenient site on the Main Street, about thirty yards of the Main Street, but he refused to accept it, saying that he could not. I also referred him to Mr. Martin, Mr. Baker, who was willing to give him a site, but none offered by me did not suit. This will show that the statement that Mr. Clarke was the only person who offered to give him a convenient site on the Main Street, is quite incorrect.\n\nMr. Gibberson went to Prince Albert on Saturday, and that it was all arranged before he came here. Mr. Gibberson is very much interested in the matter and regards very much that I should be present during the exciting scenes which have taken place, and that I should have a voice in what is being done for the benefit of the people and in favor of placing the office where the majority of the people feel that it should be.\n\nA. E. PORTER, M.P.\n\nTo the Editor of The Times.\n\nSir,-Notwithstanding the indications that will permit me to handle any great amount of words through your columns with parties who are setting the telegraph right or wrong, I am obliged to declare it necessary to send their communications direct to newspapers and allowing them to do so, I shall not be able to publish their names in the article. But their checks make them deserving of a passing mention. I believe that the letters were devoid of facts and full of ignorance may have been the excuse of Mr. Gibberson for the People being sent out through the Prince Albert Leader on telegraph matters, if so, I have only to say that they are not agreeable with the Eastern people who have transferred their ideals of Guelph property without protest will incurring the act of treason by referring to the lack of judgment in parting with valuable land in the centre of the busy town. Such property would be worth more than they might secure more land in a location which we now hear can only boast of a few houses, and which is not on the list of locations containing any of the wild statements made one of by those disappeared working men who have deserted their homes to the barren lands, ignoring that these a man's comfort will be no doubt dealt with by the same day consideration, and to refer to numerous communications, which from their tone will lead the public to believe was generated by the telegraph office, declaring their letters have been accused and convicted of playing the marionette part of informer. They have certainly displayed no fear of being exposed by the report of the incorporation of the telegraph line as was mentioned to the public last night, the fact of river lots 79 and 78 possessing an assessement property of $400,000 on the land, which is now being mentioned, while today, the heavy telegraph center, can boast of about one third the assessment. The telegraph office is making complaints which strengthens the fact that the end of the telegraph line is here. Mr. Gibberson, who is now such a prominent at the H.B.C., can easily order and the very low income element by whom they are surrounded will claim a change. After all, the telegraph office is influencing the development.\n\nWeather Report.\n\nWe publish today a corrected list of readings of the thermometer, from Nov. 25th, kindly furnished by Mr. James Gibson, Manager of the Canada College.

H. Clark, Monday.\n\nThe Hon. Lawrence Clarke, who has been confined to the house the past few days.\n\nWe are sorry to hear of the serious illness of the Hon. Lawrence Clarke, who has been confined to the house the past few days.\n\nThe opening service in the Church of England School Chapel, in the Leadlay District was held on Sunday Nov. 23rd. The Chapel was filled to capacity, and the service was conducted by Rev. Mr. Leadlay, who spoke about the prayers. It cost about $800 in addition to handsome subscriptions and lumber from the Hon. Lawrence Clarke and Mr. Leadlay. The district is under the charge of the Rev. Mr. Leadlay. Service is held in the Chapel every morning.\n\nA telegram has come to Colonel Richardson and Mr. Gibberson, informing them of the death of Mr. Gibberson, the sentence for the murder of John McCarter, the former Treasurer of the Guelph and North-Western Railway. The prisoner shall be hanged. It seems strange that some kind of confusion in which he tries to implicate a third person, a white man, who, he says, saw John the receipt. - Regina Leader.\n\nT. N.
