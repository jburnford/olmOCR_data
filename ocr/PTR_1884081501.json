Under the rule of the peace it is an old proverb that foreign policy is at an end; consequently national enthusiasm has ceased to a great extent to arouse national enthusiasm, but until quite recently the Egyptian policy of Mr. Gladstone's government was so open and so obvious that the question which would constitute the ground of appeal to the people, by the dissolution of the present parliament. This question happens to be one which touches the commercial interests of the English people, who were spoken of so contemptuously by Napoleon as a nation of shopkeepers, until he was taught to his cost what was meant by being employed by the working people on the field of battle, prepared the way for something of the old English sentiment to burst forth, on the apparent intention to show the world how much they had suffered. The French outrage of the dynamiters, perpetrated in the most crowded centres of the country, cannot fail to have been paid for in kind, whilst added to these minor subjects of interest, come what at one time would have been entirely absorbing topics, the present epidemic of cholera, the Irish troubles, and the approach of the far more terrible scourge of cholera. It must be stated something of most vital moment to the nation which can allow the subject to be left to pass away into temporary obscurity, nothing very like oblivion, but all wonder ceases when we learn that it is what is regarded by the English people as an attempt to interfere with their constitutional privilege that has made interest in every other question disappear. The action of the House of Lords in opposing themselves deliberately to the wishes of the people represented by their representatives in the House of Commons, is by no means unconstitutional in form, and furthermore the Lords may plead so far towards the purpose of the people that they may claim the only constitutional means of allowing the people to declare by new elections whether the Franchise Bill does actually represent the wishes of the present existing or not. Under these circumstances it may seem strange that a people so little given to losing their heads should be so much excited, but the truth is that just as you may always find some one upon whom a generally tolerant individual becomes rabid and violent, so it is with nations. The Franchise, or representation of every free and honest man, is the basis of every country, is what the people must and will have at any cost, nor would the House of Lords dare to oppose the Franchise Bill if sent up to them after such determined representations by the electors. If the English people become so intensely excited over the mere extension of the franchise, surely no wonder need exist at the people of our territories, so strongly objecting to having our thousands of free and independent inhabitants represented in the Dominion Parliament. Surely the Government cannot intend to persist in the undignified and immoral course of refusing us our simple right of representation, and particularly, until we are strong enough to force them into doing so. We would advise our people to make the matter of representation the most prominent feature in their agitation to obtain redress of grievances, not only because it is of itself the most important one, but because as we have said before, representation in the Dominion Parliament is the only method by which with any certainty of a substantial hearing, we can hope to proclaim our reasonable demands, and appeal to that spirit of justice, which can not be dead in the Dominion.\n\nTELEGRAPH LOCATION.\n\nAn order has been received this week from the Master of P.W. regarding the permanent telegraph station to be built on the part of the town which the inhabitants think will be most convenient, as he believes that petitioners represent public opinion. There is nothing to say against the uniformity of all the other sites spoken of, or of the great accommodation to the majority of the public to have it erected in the centre of the town where the most immediate advantage may be obtained. The Minister has clearly declared he has located it according to the wishes of the public. Can it be supposed he is unwilling to listen to the wishes of the people? In other words, or that his colleagues will consign all petitions sent from here to the waste basket? Can it be said he has not taken immediate steps to give the matter his personal attention, this the only time he has been asked. Doubts were raised at a public meeting held lately, whether a certain telegram had been for some reason delayed, but full assurance may be placed in the statement, that no properly drawn out petition or prayer has ever been forwarded before this one. Can it be supposed the Minister is not aware when it consists of a cutting from a newspaper, purporting to be a faithful copy of a certain gentleman's harangue, pasted on a sheet of telegraph paper. The same sort of blatant supposition is now being created into a second-class parliamentary society, for we can assure them a first-class one would not entertain such a scurrilous paper as they considered fit to print. Matters are now in hand. When petitions are sent to the legislative assembly to command attention and respect, they must be drawn out in proper form. The question of public opinion has shown its willingness to comply with the reasonable wishes of the public, and as we have all along insisted, we are sure his colleagues will be as ready to enter into the spirit of the wishes of the inhabitants as they are accustomed to a correct manner. The committee are to be congratulated on the successful issue of their labors, and are due the thanks of the citizens for the valuable way they have done their duty.\n\nLieut.
