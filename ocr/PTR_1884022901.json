T.\n\nTHE SCHOOL LAW\nThere would not appear to have been any\nmany difficulties in connection with the\nestablishment of schools in the North.\nDistricts. In most districts the matter\nremained undetermined without any de-\ncision having been made by the Govern-\nment. The several religious bodies have\nnot applied for land and the question of\nsettlement, the large number of settlers\nhaving been unable to make any progres-\nsive advance in distance from the settle-\nments of the Orientals.\nWith regard to the manner in which the\nfunds have been applied, it must be con-\nsidered that the amount of money involved\nis quite small compared to the great\namount of expenditure required. The\nquestion of the manner in which the-\nservices of the school system are being\nmaintained, is a matter of serious con-\ncern. It appears that the funds are being\nused for purposes other than those intended,\nand that the services of the school system\nare not being maintained in a satisfactory\nmanner.\n\nNOTICE\nThe following notification is hereby given:\nThe Board of Trustees of the District School\nDistrict No. 19, Prince Albert, N. W. T., are\nasked to meet at the Town Hall on Thursday,\nFebruary 26th, at 8 p.m., to consider the\nquestion of the consolidation of two school\ndistricts into one.

I have neither the desire nor the ability to quote any extracts of the context in question, but I wonder why you should sign yourself \u201cFacts\u201d? Facts, as indeed they are, are facts, yet not all facts are equally important. Since you have been very careful to sign yourself \u201cFacts,\u201d let me justify my action by saying that I do not believe there can be any gain whatever by publicising the minute details of Government business or in the ordinary routine of everyday life, unless it is clearly of particular interest to the nation at large. Such matters as the Queen\u2019s birthday, the State visits to foreign countries, and other similar events, may certainly be considered as matters of national importance, and it would be quite reasonable to expect that such matters would be made known to the public at large through the medium of the press. However, there is another reason why I feel it necessary to make a statement to the effect that I do not agree with the practice of signing oneself \u201cFacts\u201d on matters of public interest, and I should be glad if others would take note of this fact and follow suit.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTHE NORTH WEST AND ITS CLIMATE.\n\nTo what extent the climate of Canada for the summer months offers suitable conditions for the encouragement of emigration? This question has been much discussed recently, and during the past year the opinions expressed have varied widely. It seems to me that the main factors influencing the decision whether or not to emigrate should be the economic benefits which may accrue from the settlement in that country.\n\nThe following extract from a report on the Canadian climate states:\n\n\"The climate of Canada for the summer months is generally agreeable, and offers many advantages for emigrants. The average temperature is about 70\u00b0 F., and the humidity is high, with a marked tendency towards the hot moist conditions prevalent in the Southern States. The climate is generally healthy, and the air is clean and pure.\"\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the decision to emigrate should be based on a consideration of all the facts and not solely on the climate.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-06", "created": "2025-10-06", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_sask_test/PTR_1884022901.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 4, "total-input-tokens": 6180, "total-output-tokens": 3140, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 6471, 2], [6471, 9948, 3], [9948, 12315, 4]], "primary_language": ["en", "en", "en", "en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false]}}]
