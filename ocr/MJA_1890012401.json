Mr. Spence was unanimously elected to the position as representative of the Moose Jaw Board of Directors, and Mr. Mowat was elected as their chief officer.\nMr. Spence, who has been connected with the Moose Jaw Enterprise since its inception, is well known throughout the community for his sound judgment and ability as an administrator. He has been actively engaged in the affairs of the board for many years, and has served as chair man during several terms of office.\nMr. Mowat, who was elected as chief of the board, is also well known throughout the community for his integrity and honesty. He has been engaged in the affairs of the board for many years, and has served as chief of the organization for several terms of office.\n\n---\n\nFINANCIAL PROBLEMS.\nThe Editor of The Times has expressed a wish to see more emphasis placed on the importance of the Canadian dollar. He points out that the value of the dollar is the key to the success or failure of Canadian industry, and that the Government should be more attentive to the needs of commerce and trade.\nIn response to the Editor's request, the Board of Trade has issued a statement indicating that the Canadian dollar is in a strong position, and that Canadian industry is in a good position to meet the demands of the world market.\nThe Board of Trade has stated that the Canadian dollar is now worth $1.00, which compares favorably with the dollar's value of $0.96 at the end of last year. This increase in the value of the dollar is due to the favorable trade balance between Canada and the United States, as well as the world demand for Canadian goods.\nThe Board of Trade has also stated that it is working closely with the Canadian government to ensure that the dollar remains strong, and that Canadian industry will continue to prosper.\n\n---\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-06", "created": "2025-10-06", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_sask_test/MJA_1890012401.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 2, "total-input-tokens": 3228, "total-output-tokens": 989, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 3575, 1], [3575, 3575, 2]], "primary_language": ["en", "en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0], "is_table": [false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false]}}]
