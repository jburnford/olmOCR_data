A check was also made at C.M.R. station and at Bus Depot with negative results.\n\nPhysical description of subjects are as follows:\n\n\"John Henry SEVRITE - Nationality treaty Indian, age 15, height 5'8\", Complex dark hair black, was wearing khaki coveralls, grey air-force pants, grey cap, with fur ear flaps, was wearing heavy low rubbers.\n\nGraham RAZOR - Nationality treaty Indian, age 15, approx. same height and description as SEVRITE, was also wearing clothing similar to SEVRITE.\n\nWilliam John MINTUCK - Nationality Treaty Indian, age 13, quite big for his age, and same description would fit this subject as above mentioned boys.

This applies to pupil No. 262 Joseph Nepinak who was in residence forty-six days only. Pupil # 291 William Ross was absent during the September quarter due to sickness at home.

All new pupils entering school and those being discharged during a quarter should be shown on the form # 411 for that quarter.

Huest, O.M.I., Principal, Pine Creek Indian Residential School, Camperville, Manitoba.\n\nWith reference to the June Quarter Return of the Pine Creek Indian Residential School, it is noted that pupil No. 0321 and pupil No. 0353 entered the sanatorium on April 8th and eight days grant was requested. In drawing your attention to circular letter 150-87 dated December, 1944, a copy of which was mailed to you recently, it would appear that these two pupils were entitled to a hospitalization allowance of thirty days and, therefore, a grant of thirty-eight days should have been requested.\n\nIt is noted that there are numerous pupils who have been absent from school for at least three quarters. If they are not expected to return, it is suggested that their discharge be applied for. If at a later date they return to the school, the Department should be advised to approve their re-admission.\n\nThe Department approves the discharge of the following:\n\n| No.   | No.   |\n|-------|-------|\n| 0239  | 0355  |\n| 0273  | 263   |\n| 0279  | 297   |\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada:\n\nSeptember 1, 1947\n\nSir,\u2014\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Pine Creek Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child: Melvyn Ivan Cooke\nEnglish name: Melvyn Ivan Cooke\nAge: 23 years, Sept. 1929\nName of Band: Waywayseecappo\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid: 274\nFather's full name and No.: Wilbur Peter Cooke 274\nMother's full name and No.: Sally McKish 274\nParents living or dead: Father living, Mother dead.\nState of child's health: Good.\nReligion: R.C.\nDoes applicant speak English?: Yes\nPreviously attended: No school for years\n\n(Signature of father)\n\nNorm\u2014If mother or guardian signs, agent must forward full explanatory note.\n\nI hereby certify that the above application for admission has been read over and interpreted to the parent or guardian and that the contents were understood by him or her and that I witnessed his or her signature to this document.\n\nSignature of Missionary or other Witness\n\n*Principal or other official of the school must not sign as witness.\n\nNorm\u2014All the above particulars must be fully given, especially the \"Name of Band,\" \"No. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\" and \"Religion.\" The minimum age for admission is seven (7) years except in the case of an orphan, destitute or neglected child.

If circumstances are as described, I am sure that you will want to have these children returned to Pine Creek.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O.

No explanation was given. When the RCMP was summoned to do the job of telling the parents, the said police found some elusive explanation for not going. When he was told that I would pay the expenses he did not care for.\n\nDuring that time the local authorities admitted these children at the Birtle Res.School under the pretext that the Father who was a widower had remarried a Protestant woman and was supposed to have his children, who were catholic, re-baptized in the Protestant religion.\n\nDuring that time what becomes of the first admission of these children to our School? Does it suffice to any minister of any religion to have the children supposedly baptized in their denomination at the will of anybody, to change them from a school were they had been admitted?\n\nThe procedure used in this very particular occasion would be for us, Roman Catholics, if acknowledged and accepted by the Department, a mean of recruiting where the whims of some Indian Parents could be changed on our behalf as well; it is a double edged sword.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.M.de Bretagne OMI\nPrincipal\nOctober 14th, 1949.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nConstance Cook and Ivan Cook, whose father is Wilbur Cook, No. 274, Waywayseecappo Band, were admitted to the Pine Creek Indian Residential School in September, 1947. Their application forms stated that the religion of these children was Roman Catholic, and their applications were approved by the Indian Agent, who was at that time Mr. A.G. Smith.\n\nWe are now advised that these children have not returned to the Pine Creek School, but have been accepted at the Birtle Residential School. From the information that we have on file, it appears that they are not eligible for admission to the Birtle Residential School, and the Principal of that school should not have accepted them.\n\nIf they are in the Birtle School, they should be returned at once to the Pine Creek School. Please let me know when you have taken action in this matter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nCamperville Man\n11-Oct'1949\n\nRev.O.Plourde OMI\nCommission Oblate des Aff.Indiennes\nOTTAWA Ont.\n\nDear ahd Rev.

School on the First Nov. 1947, son of Paul & Annie Cloud, of the Lizart Point IR, Rossburn PO Man.\n\nThat child has a sister present at our School and was supposed to be taken back here after the thrashing by his own Father, such was the promise of the parents to the Sub Agent Mr Boyne.\n\nInstead of this he was spirited away to Birtle like were the two others: Constance and Ivan Cook.\n\nIf we admit such a strange way of proceeding, I am afraid that we will have no more authority on any discontent Indians.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.M.de Bretagne OMI\nPrincipal\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nRe: Lawrence Cloud now at Birtle Residential School.\n\nThe enclosed letter from Reverend Father Maurice de Bretagne of the Pine Creek Indian Residential School needs no comment on my part.\n\nWould you be good enough to rectify this matter if it can at all be done.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O.

Hamilton,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nIn a letter dated October 14th you were written regarding Constance and Ivan Cook, who were reported to have been placed in the Birtle Indian Residential School, although they are regularly enrolled pupils at the Pine Creek Residential School.\n\nWe have now had another letter stating that Lawrence Cloud Pupil No. 311 of the Pine Creek Residential School has been accepted at the Birtle Residential School. This boy was admitted to the Pine Creek School on November 1st, 1947.\n\nIf he is at Birtle, he should be returned immediately to the Pine Creek School.

I have never met nor seen either the children nor the parents. I have had telephone enquiries from the father requesting me to admit his children but he was informed that he could not as long as they were enrolled in another school, without the permission of the Department.\"\n\nRegarding Lawrence Cloud, the Principal writes:\n\n\"This boy was brought to the school late in the fall by his parents. I knew nothing of their intentions of sending him here but he arrived when I was away for three days to Calgary. Had I been here I would not have taken him in, but when I came home I could not open the door and send him out to shift for himself. I expect the parents will be at Birtle at Christmas time, and I will send him home with them.\"\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\n### ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT RICE CREEK SCHOOL DURING OCT.

The girls are living 200 yards from a day school and have been going there until now. I would strongly recommend that these children attend the day school provided for them, as the family is capable of taking care of them.\n\nR. S.

School at Camperville (Pine Creek Indian Residential School). As you are aware Father Dumouchel is now the Principal of this school.\n\nLast year the same thing occurred - taking children to Residential School without referring to our officials or having applications approved. It is about time this kind of thing was stopped.\n\nIt is noted in Mr. Minnis' letter that five of the children are shown as Protestants. This school has been warned as I advised Father Dumouchel when he was in the office that applications had to be approved before children were taken into Residential School. Therefore, I would strongly recommend that this school be advised to take the children back to Island Lake. We have R.C. classrooms at Island Lake and also a Protestant School. If the Church are made fly these children back at once they will not be so anxious in future to break rules and regulations. I have advised Mr. Minnis by wire to forward all the applications here but not to sign them. As soon as they arrive I will forward them to you.\n\nR. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\nMr. R. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nI have before me the applications for admission to Pine Creek Indian Residential School of fifteen Indian children of the Island Lake Band. These children were recruited on the Reserve by Father M. Dutil, O.M.I., and flown directly to Camperville without reference to this office. The applications have now been received from Father DeBretnagne, Medical examination having been given the children at Camperville.\n\nIn checking these applications for Church affiliations, I find that five of the children, shown as Roman Catholics on applications, are from families shown on our records as being adherents of the United Church. This is entirely possible, as a good many children whose parents are Protestants are baptized as Roman Catholics by the priests.\n\nHowever, in the new Indian Act, Sec.117, I note that no child of a Protestant parent may enter a Roman Catholic School except by written declaration of the parent. I wish to know if the signature of the parent on the Application for Admission to Residential School is considered by Dept. as \"written direction of the parent\". If not, I wish to be advised of the form of written direction necessary in cases of this type, and would ask that a sample of such be furnished me for future use.\n\nKindly let me have your direction in this matter at the earliest, as I have no wish to become involved in any Denominational argument which may arise over these children.\n\nJ. D. Minnis,\nSuperintendent,\nNorway House Indian Agency.\nOctober 6, 1951.\n\nReverend Paul Dumouchel, C.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nPine Creek Indian Residential School,\nCamperville, Manitoba.\n\nDear Father Dumouchel:\n\nIt has been brought to my attention that 15 children from Island Lake have recently been brought to the Pine Creek School.\n\nWe are further informed that the Indian Superintendent was not consulted before the children were taken from Island Lake and, in addition, five of the children are stated to belong to families shown on the records of the Norway House Agency as adherents of the United Church.\n\nThere is a day school at Island Lake conducted under Roman Catholic auspices and consequently no children should be taken to a residential school from that reserve without the Indian Superintendent being first consulted with a view to deciding whether or not admission to a residential school is justified.\n\nAs the action that has been taken is contrary to the usual practice in regard to admission of children to a residential school, it will not be possible for the Department to allow per capita grant for them, and they should be returned to Island Lake School at the earliest possible date. It would be appreciated if you would let me know when you have complied with our wishes in this matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nCopy sent to R. S.

Nield, 3 application forms for the admission of three catholic children to the Pine Creek Residential school, at Camperville. The three catholic children are: Marina, Caroline & Ethyl Sutherland, daughters of Campbell Sutherland of Peguis Reserve.\n\nI wonder who is holding these application forms so they will not reach your office, and by so doing deprive these three children from a catholic education, as the parents have the right to choose for them.\n\nWe are already in the middle of October, and I would be very pleased if you would rush this matter at your earliest convenience. As our day schools here are all protestants, the parents have decided to send their children to a Catholic residential school and the New Indian Act has provided for that at Article 117.\n\nI am waiting very anxiously for your answer and your approval to their admission to the Pine Creek residential school.\n\nHoping my request will be brought to your attention immediately,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nReverend E.

Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n537 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nRe: Pine Creek School\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 26th ultimo regarding the applications for admission of the Sutherland children to the above school. The father of these children is stated to be Roman Catholic and no exception has been taken to that statement. If he desires to have his children receive an education in the Catholic school, I feel that we have no right to refuse him, in view of the Indian Act.\n\nThe admission of the Sutherland children to the Pine Creek School is therefore approved.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nThe above noted boy, who is twelve years of age, is in the Winnipeg General Hospital with a cast on his leg. Dr. Wood advises me that Joseph should not be sent home, owing to home conditions, but should be put in one of our Residential Schools. The boy's father is dead and the mother has remarried and is now Mrs. Louis Sutherland, Sandy Bay Band. She refuses to sign the application to admit Joseph to school.\n\nWould it be in order for me to send the boy to Pine Creek Residential School, as the hospital bill is running up and the child would be better in a school than the hospital? As the mother does not wish the boy to enter Residential school, I consider it would be better to send him to Pine Creek than the Sandy Bay School.\n\nI might state that Joseph can run around with the cast, so it will not bother him very much.\n\nWill you please wire me at once, upon receipt of this letter, what action to take.\n\nR.

But due to the fact that the Rev. Father Fich\u00e9, Provincial was to call at your Office, I wanted to know about the decisions that would come from your meeting with him. Upon his return to Winnipeg, he has made known to me your views on the matter discussed in the aforesaid letter.\n\nThe admission of the Children from Island Lake into the Pine Creek Indian Residential School came before my arrival in Camperville. In the files, I see that they arrived in Camperville on the 8th of September, while I took over as Principal on the 15th of the same month. Father de Bretagne who was then Principal had made all the arrangements with Father Dutil, and had cautioned him to have the approval from the Indian Superintendent of Norway House before taking the children to Camperville. Father de Bretagne was not the less concerned when he saw the children arriving without the proper permissions from the Department. He immediately wrote to Mr. Mennus, asking for approval.\n\nYou realise that a quick decision had to be taken, once the children had come to Camperville; either keep them with the hope to see the Department approve of the admission, or send them back to Island Lake. Father de Bretagne took the former decision.\n\nIs it that the Father from Island Lake did not know of the usual procedure for admission of children to Indian School? This I believe to be the case.\n\nYou are aware also that ten of those children are from Ste. Theresa Point and five from Garden Hill.\nAs for the children being from families adherent of the United Church, I am assured by the missionary that they have been instructed and baptised upon the request of the parents.\n\nIt might be wise to find from the Missionary himself the reasons that led him to send those children here. Father deBretagne accepted his proposition in the first place, knowing well the difficult situation of our School in recruiting the necessary number of children towards a sound administration of the School.\n\nI am ready to submit to the decision of the Indian Department, and will await to hear from you to take any move. May I mention that the trip from Island Lake to Campbellville has cost $64.00. If we are to send the children back, before the end of the year, I do not know how I will book for the year. Of course this is a minor consideration when we face the whole problem.\n\nWould there not be a means to arrange for approval till June. If then, the Department decides, the children would be left home. This I ask for the welfare of the Children and for no personal reasons or considerations.\n\nYou can rest assured, my dear Mr. Phelan, that I realise the hard task that is before you in passing so serious decisions. I would by no means make it harder. In giving you those details, I do not try to be exonerated, since I had no part in the actual situation.\n\nI think I have complied with your desire expressed to Father Provincial, and I hope the informations given will prove that the action taken might have been a false move, but in no way a desire to bring about a situation for which the actual Principal would be penalized.\n\nKnowing that you will consider the case in its true light, I assure you of my wholehearted cooperation in the discharge of your responsibility in settling the problem.\n\nYours very truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nOctober 29, 1951.\n\nMr. R. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n537 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nRe: Pine Creek School\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of October 3rd and official letter of October 6th with reference to certain children who were placed in the above school without first receiving the approval of Superintendent Minnis.\n\nIn reply to my communication of October 6th, a copy of which was forwarded to you, Reverend Paul Dumouchel, O.M.I., Principal of the Pine Creek School, writes as follows:\n\n\"I should have answered your letter of the 6th inst. a long time ago.

If then, the Department decides, the children would be left home. This I ask for the welfare of the children and for no personal reasons or considerations.\"\nIn view of the information contained in the Principal's letter, I am inclined to feel that we should approve the admission of the children to the Pine Creek School and (if Superintendent Minnis and yourself consider it necessary, we can discharge some or all of them next June. Please let me hear from you.)\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nNovember 1, 1951\n\nRev. J. Lambert, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nSandy Bay Indian Res. School,\nMarius, Man.,\n\nDear Father Lambert:\n\nIt has been brought to my attention that arrangements had been made to transfer the two Houle children from the Sandy Bay to the Pine Creek Indian Residential School without authority from the local Indian Superintendent.\n\nIn order to maintain friendly relations with the local Indian Superintendent, it is only fair to arrange these matters through his office. This procedure will not hamper the arrangement in any way but will lead to mutual good will.\n\nWhen recruiting children for the first time you should also consult the local Indian Superintendent in each case in order that he may approach the Department for authority to admit the children as grant-earning pupils.\n\nWe have had complaints from local Superintendents that children are brought to the school first and later the Superintendent is asked to recommend the approval of the admission. This is hardly fair to the Superintendent concerned as he is responsible for all the children in his Superintendency.\nand there may be cases that he knows about where children need institutional care more than the children picked out by the Missionary.\n\nPlease bear this in mind for future transfers and admissions.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nNovember 1, 1951\n\nMr. J.H. Staunton,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nDauphin, Man.,\n\nWith reference to a letter dated October 29 from Regional Supervisor R.S. Davis, the Department approves the transfer of pupils O280 Bernice Houle and O281 Irene Houle from the Sandy Bay to the Pine Creek Indian Residential School.\n\nWe are also writing Father Lambert instructing him that no transfer of pupils should be carried out without approval from your office.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n537 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba,\nNovember 9/51.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI am enclosing applications for admission to the Pine Creek Indian Residential School.\n\nI understand that these pupils are already at the school.\n\nErnest Catacas #77 Valley River\nMargaret Moosetail, #175 Pine Creek\nAlice Cook, #155 Shoal River\nCecilia Cook, #149 Shoal River\nAlex Cook, #155 Shoal River\nCharley, #155 Shoal River\nJohn Russell Prince, #353 Sandy Bay\n\nG.

H. Staunton,\nSuperintendent, Indian Affairs,\nDauphin, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd inst., which is far from satisfactory. Mrs. Sutherland would like to know:\n\n(1) Why was her son moved from the Winnipeg General Hospital to Pine Creek Indian Residential School without her consent or knowledge or approval?\n\n(2) Why was he not returned to Sandy Bay School from where he was taken?\n\n(3) Why is it necessary for him to be moved so far away making it impossible for his mother to visit him and should the ordinary rights of a mother with respect to her child be ignored and the child placed beyond her reach without her consent or approval as has been done in this case?\n\nSuch action would not be tolerated for a minute in the case of a child of a white woman. Surely an Indian mother still has some rights with respect to her own child.\n\nYou state in your letter that the matter has been referred to the Department. I presume you refer to the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa. Are the mother's rights to be ignored until such time as a disposition of the case and a decision is reached by the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa.\n\nIf there are any good valid reasons why this child should be so far removed from his mother please let me know what they are.\n\nThe Indians have been led to believe that under the provisions of the new Indian Act they would be given the rights of a Canadian Citizen.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6272, file 582-10, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMrs. Sutherland is at least entitled to have without delay valid reasons why her son should be taken away from her.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. A. Lye.\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nRe: Joseph Beaulieu\n\nIn a letter dated October 19th, Regional supervisor Davis recommended placing the above-mentioned boy in the Pine Creek School. Mr. Davis' letter read in part as follows:\n\n\"The above noted boy, who is twelve years of age, is in the Winnipeg General Hospital with a cast on his leg. Dr. Wood advises me that Joseph should not be sent home, owing to home conditions, but should be put in one of our Residential Schools. The boy's father is dead and the mother has remarried and is now Mrs. Louis Sutherland, Sandy Bay Band. She refuses to sign the application to admit Joseph to school.\n\n\"Would it be in order for me to send the boy to Pine Creek Residential School, as the hospital bill is running up and the child would be better in a school than the hospital? As the mother does not wish the boy to enter Residential School, I consider it would be better to send him to Pine Creek than the Sandy Bay School.\"\n\nAs it was considered in the best interests of the boy to follow the advice of Mr. Davis, approval was given for the admission of the boy to Pine Creek.\n\nSince the receipt of the letter of November 30, written by H.A. Lye, K.C., we reviewed our file and find that this boy was admitted to Sandy Bay in January, 1949, and the application form was signed by the father.\n\nEarly in 1950 the boy was placed in hospital and has not been in the Sandy Bay School since that time.\n\nI telephoned Mr. Davis yesterday and he pointed out again that the boy's father is now dead - that the mother has\nre-married and that he considered home conditions unsuitable. He further stated that Dr. Wood did believe that after the boy had been in hospital for some time it would be preferable to have him placed in a residential school rather than in a home on the reserve.\n\nMr. Davis further stated that it was impossible to return the boy to Sandy Bay as they had their full quota of pupils and he therefore considered it advisable to recommend placing him in Pine Creek.\n\nMr. Davis said that he would write to us to the above effect.\n\nP. Pholm,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nOttawa, December 5, 1951.\n\nH. A. Lys, Esq., K.C., LL.B.,\nBarrister, Solicitor, Notary, etc.,\nMacgregor, Manitoba.\n\nRe: Joseph Sutherland\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have had brought to my attention your letter of November 30, addressed to Mr. J. H. Staunton, Superintendent, Indian Agency, Dauphin, Manitoba, and a copy of which was forwarded to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.\n\nIt is understood that you refer to Joseph Beaulieu, No. 234, Sandy Bay Band, who has been in hospital for over a year. In October last, the superintendent of the hospital stated that the boy should be removed from the hospital and placed where he would receive proper care and he was consequently sent to the Pine Creek Residential School.\n\nIn view of the contents of your letter, further inquiries are being made and I will write to you again when we receive a report from our field officials.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\n\nPP/III\n### ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT OCEAN CREEK SCHOOL DURING SEPTEMBER QUARTER, 1957\n\n| No. | Name                  | Band | State of Education | Remarks Upon Discharge |\n|-----|-----------------------|------|--------------------|------------------------|\n|     |                       |      |                    |                        |\n\n### DISCHARGE OF PUPILS\n\n| No. | Name                  | Band | State of Education | Remarks Upon Discharge |\n|-----|-----------------------|------|--------------------|------------------------|\n|     |                       |      |                    |                        |\n\n**NOTE:** One or more of these forms should be forwarded with each quarterly return and full particulars should be given regarding all pupils either admitted or discharged during the quarter.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. P. Phelan, Superintendent of Education\n\nWith reference to telephone conversation regarding Joseph Beaulieu, #234 Sandy Bay, I am attaching, hereto, a copy of a letter from Dr. Wood, which is self explanatory. I would also like to point out that before Joseph Beaulieu was sent to Pine Creek Residential School the situation was discussed with the Medical Branch.\n\nIf Joseph had been placed in the Sandy Bay School, where they are crowded, they could not have given him any extra supervision. This is a case where the boy will have to stay in the hospital or be in a Boarding School. I was not aware that this boy had been a pupil at the Pine Creek School.\n\nI tried to get the mother to sign the application. Mr. Guillas advised the mother by mail that the boy had been placed in the Pine Creek School. He did so by mail as on a previous occasion when trying to get in touch with Mrs. Sutherland he drove to McGregor, Manitoba, where she was reported to be living but she was not home and no one could tell him of her whereabouts.\n\nThe only thing we can do is discharge the boy and have the Medical Branch place him in a hospital. Regarding the placing of a child in a school of their own choice - this can only be done when there is room in the school as you know a number of our schools are crowded.\n\nR. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n522 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba,\nDecember 4, 1951.\n\nMr. R.S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\n537 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg.\n\nRe: Joseph Beaulieu\n#234 Sandy Bay\n\nThis boy was under treatment by Dr. A. Gibson during 1951 when in June he was operated on to give him a stable hip. He was then placed in plaster of paris. On October 25th Dr. Gibson wrote this office that he was ready for transfer from hospital and advised that he be placed in a school. The cast had to be changed every three months for a year.\n\nIt was clearly necessary that he be in a place where supervision could be given as to the care of the cast and where a good diet could be provided. This was not advisable in a home, particularly his own.\n\nThe only satisfactory place for this boy was in a residential school where nursing service and care could be provided and discipline in order to prevent breakdown of the cast and malunion in the operative site. The alternative was to leave him in hospital at a cost of $6.00 or more a day.\n\nIn order to provide the care required the Pine Creek Residential School was considered desirable and he was transferred to that school.\n\nW.J. Wood, M.D.,\nRegional Superintendent,\nIndian Health Services.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship\nand Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nActing on instructions from Mr. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor, Mr. A. Nicholson, Dauphin Agency,\ntoday conveyed Therese Tait, pupil #40426 Pine Creek\nIndian Residential School, from Dauphin to Fort\nQu'Appelle Indian Residential School at Lebret, Sask.,\nper Department car.\n\nMrs. A.

A. Lye, Esq., K.C., LL.B.,\nBarrister, Solicitor, Notary, etc.,\nWagmegger, Manitoba.\n\nRe: Joseph Sutherland\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of November 30 and my reply of December 5 with reference to the above-noted boy.\n\nA very complete report has recently been received from the Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies and it appears that it was necessary to remove the boy from the hospital.\n\nThere was no accommodation at the Sandy Bay Residential School and consequently he was placed in the Pine Creek Residential School where he could receive proper attention. At the time the transfer was made, our officials endeavoured to get in touch with his mother but were unable to do so.\n\nIt is felt that the action taken was in the best interests of the boy.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDirector.\n\nFP/IM\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received through the Dauphin Agency the instructions you have issued re THERESE TAIT pupil #0426 Pine Creek Indian Residential School.\n\nHad I been consulted before, I would have given you the following information, which might have changed your decision in the matter.\n\nUp to around 1940, the Indian Children from Roseau River attended the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School. It was at that time that they were transferred to the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School. As missionary to The Roseau River Indian Reserve, I was asked many times why the Children from the Reserve could not go anymore to Lebret. I think the explanations I gave were clear and to the point. The Indians of Roseau River would therefore consider a child at the Lebret School as a very fortunate and privileged one.\n\nEven last fall, when it was clear there would be no facilities for these Children at Fort Alexander, the parents insisted that the Children go to Lebret.\n\nThe parents know well the position and the advantages of this School. It is true that Therese Tait is there under the direct custody of the Indian Department. But I do not think the Indians, and the Children will understand the legal aspect of this move. To them, Therese will be a fortunate one, to have found her way to Lebret.\n\nMy dear Mr. Davis, I have made known to you this information, with the sole conviction that it was not known before by your Department. See in it no reproach, nor any thing of the kind. You and I have at heart the welfare of the Indian Children entrusted to our care, and I felt that my cooperation was wholeheartedly given in doing so.\n\nI remain, yours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs.

I would refer you to our letters dated 14th December, 1951 and 22nd December, 1951, file 149/25-2-582, in answer to yours of December 11th, 1951.\n\nIt should be noted the children in question:\n\nJubet Hastings\nJacques McDougall\nDonald Wood\nJoseph Harper\nJosias M. Wood\nBilly Taylor\n\nare not members of any Band under the jurisdiction of this Agency, consequently it is impossible for me to submit an application for their admission to Residential School. Not having their religion or their status as Indians, on record.\n\nThe onus of submitting and signing the application lies with the Superintendent in charge of the Agency to which the children belong. If you will refer to Agency letter dated December 22nd, 1951, previously mentioned, you will note the applications for admission for these children, were forwarded to Mr. Minnis, Superintendent, Norway House Agency. If these ap-\n\ncont'd Page \"2\"\nDEPARTMENT OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nIF THESE APPLICATIONS have not yet been received, it is suggested Mr. Minnis be contacted on the matter.\n\nAs regards the first paragraph of your letter stating you have not yet received the necessary applications for admission for all children listed on Form I.A.411 - December Quarterly Return. The same situation exists, the children for whom you have not received applications do not belong to this Agency. They come under the jurisdiction of the Portage Agency and Fisher Branch Agency. It is suggested the two Superintendents concerned be contacted re admission forms. To my knowledge, there is no child belonging to this Agency, attending Residential School, for whom an application has not been submitted.\n\nI trust the above information will clarify the situation.\n\nJ.H.

Indian Agency,\nDauphin, Man.,\n\nWith reference to your letter of January 25th regarding admissions to the Pine Creek Indian Residential School, we have noted the contents of your letter and feel that an explanation is required for your future reference.\n\nIt is a normal practice that an Indian Superintendent is responsible for all schools in his Agency and the Pine Creek school falls under your jurisdiction. Correspondence dealing with residential school matters is referred to the Superintendent under whose jurisdiction the school comes; consequently all outstanding applications for admission to the Pine Creek school are referred to your office and if some of the children are from other Agencies you are obliged to ascertain from the Principal under what circumstances the children were brought to school and under what Superintendent is responsible for their applications.\n\nIt is then your responsibility to write the Superintendents concerned asking them to have these applications forwarded with the least possible delay.\n\nThis practice is followed in all our residential schools across the country as there are few residential schools who draw children from one Agency exclusively.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttn.

Marcoux who urged me to write to you.\n\nWe have here at school a George McKay age 14 who has become a disciplinary problem to the staff.\n\nIt is true that the boy has always been hard to handle, and full of mischief, but since a while, I feel he has become a hindrance to the good order of the School.\n\nIt seems that the boy has mental spells and that nothing is to stop him from breaking spoiling and ruining the material at the children's disposal. As soon as the Supervisor has her eyes away from him, he is sure to be in trouble.\n\nThere is no point of the regulation that he will not do away with. In recreation he will be rough with the smaller boys, going as far as choking them till they can stand no more.\n\nHe is extremely audacious to show others his smartness. Not later than yesterday he was walking on the narrow edge of the roof and could have cause a tragedy.\n\nI have discussed the case with Mr. Marcoux who thinks the boy is a mental case to some extend and who should be sent to a psychiatrist. I made it clear to Mr. Marcoux that no disciplinary measure ever had any effect on him, and that he is a handicap to the Supervisor.\n\nI feel that this boy should be discharged from the Indian Residential School and probably turned to the Health Department for a mental examination.\n\nI am positive that in such dispositions he will not profit by his being in School any longer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Staunton, our Indian Superintendent at Dauphin, inquired about the children from Garden Hill, Islans Lake, whether they had been sent home.\n\nIn a letter from the Regional Inspector of Indian School, Mr. Marcoux, dated March 12th, I was asked to discharge these five children at the end of the academic term. This I have done, and the children were returned home at the end of June.\n\nWhen Mr. Marcoux was here, in May, I asked him if the discharge was to effect the children from St. Theresa Point. He did not know. A few days ago, I asked him the same question, but he did not have any definite answer, and he advised me to write to your Office.\n\nI know that the Missionary from St. Theresa Point is anxious to send some of his children here, since the school facilities there are not adequate. In my letters I have told him to have the proper authority before sending any children here.\n\nI would appreciate your decision on this matter. Will you be kind enough to let me know the views of your Department on this question.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. Paul Dumouchel, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nMr. R. S.

I was uncertain whether it referred to new pupils desirous of entering this term or whether it referred to the five children whose status has been the subject of considerable correspondence. I proceeded to Island Lake on the 23rd and interviewed both Father Rho and Father Dutil concerning this situation. Father Rho advised me that there are some twenty children at St. Therese Area whose parents had expressed a wish to have them attend a Residential School. He was good enough to list these children for me with the details of their family circumstances and with an indication of those whom residential schooling would be necessary. There were six in number, three of whom were intended for Cross Lake and three for Camperville. These applications are enclosed herewith having been approved by the undersigned and I trust, will receive Departmental approval.\n\nOn August 8th last I submitted to Mr. R. S. Davis, Regional Supervisor, Winnipeg, originals of letters received from Father M. Dutil, O. M. I. at Island Lake, Manitoba concerning the five\nAugust 30th, 1952.\n\nchildren of Protestant parents who were sent to Pine Creek School in the fall of 1951, and whose applications were held up at that time by lack of approval from this office. Also enclosed in my letter to Mr. Davis were letters from parents of these children requesting their admission to a Roman Catholic Residential School. This formal request on the part of the parents appears to comply with the provisions of Section 117 of the New Indian Act, and as the children were baptized as Roman Catholic and lack any day School in the area of the Reserve in which they reside (Garden Hill) I have now approved these applications and same are attached for your consideration.\n\nI trust this letter will provide the information requested in your telegram of August 19th. However I would appreciate advice from you as to the nature of the representations made Department and referred to in your telegram. As you are aware it is necessary to deal with Residential school applications on an individual basis, and I would not care to generalize on the eligibility of any children in that particular area.\n\nJ. D. Minnis,\nSuperintendent Indian Agency,\n\nEnc. Applications\n\nJDM/NM\nOctober 6, 1952.\n\nMr. J.D. Minnis,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nNorway House, Man.,\n\nWith reference to your letter of August 30th regarding the admissions to the Pine Creek Indian Residential School, please be advised that the Department approves the admission of Maurice Wood, Peter Harper and Robert Harper to this school as grant-earning pupils.\n\nWith reference to William, Luke and Victoria Harper and Isaac and Juliette Hastings you are referred to official letter signed by the Director and forwarded to Mr. Davis regarding these families. We are forwarding you a copy of the above-mentioned letter. From this letter it will be noted that these children can not be admitted to the Pine Creek Indian Residential School as these children are of the United Church faith.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nEnclosure:\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Principal claimed grant for less than the prescribed number of days in the Quarter, however, he has neglected to indicate in the Remarks Column the exact dates these pupils did return to school. We are attempting to pay the September Return without this information but will be obliged to return future returns for adjustment if this information is not shown.\nIt would be appreciated if you would bring these facts to the Principal's attention for his guidance when preparing future returns.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nOctober 6, 1952.\n\nDepartment of Citizenship & Immigration,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI am enclosing herewith applications for admission to the Pine Creek Residential School on behalf of the under mentioned:\n\nErnestine Pauline Seenie\nAlphonse Larocque.\n\nThe reason these applications have been delayed was because of correspondence between this office and the Pine Creek School and I am attaching hereto a copy of the Rev.

The expenses involved are to be met by the School, and the time such a trip requires is not always available.\n\nSince you had admitted the children from the same families, last year, it was thought that it would be advisable to take them, even though they would be listed on the Quarterly Returns as per the time of their admission by Ottawa.\n\nI had asked Father Bilodeau to contact you on the matter, but when he passed in Portage, the Office was closed, the first Monday of Sept. being a holiday.\n\nIt is with no intention of bypassing the orders of the Department that these children were taken here, but it was judged more practical due to the actual circumstances.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. Paul Dumouchel, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nOctober 22, 1952.\n\nMr. J. Rayson,\nSupt.

Phelan, Superintendent of Education\n\nI am enclosing, herewith, applications for admission to the Pine Creek Residential School for Tom and Louis Crate, #395 Fisher River Band, both of these children being United Church faith. I am also attaching a request from the parents that these children attend Pine Creek R.C. Residential School. These forms were left at the office by Father Dumouchel, Principal, Pine Creek Indian Residential School.\n\nYou will also find attached a letter from Superintendent Minnis. Would you please give me a ruling on this case. You will note the applications have not been approved by Mr. Minnis.\n\nR. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nRSD/MH\nEnclos.\nMr. R. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor,\nNorlyn Bldg., 309 Hargrave St.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nDear Mr. Davis:\n\nRe: Admissions to Pine Creek Res. School,\nTom & Louis Crate, #395 Fisher River.\n\nThe enclosed applications are submitted for a decision from the Department as to the eligibility of the a/n children for admission to a Roman Catholic Residential School, and applications have not been approved by the undersigned.\n\nApplicants are the sons of Louis and Gertie Crate, #395 Fisher River Band. Both these parents and their sons, Tom and Louis are shown on Agency records as adherents of the United Church of Canada, as outlined on application forms. The children have been attending the Fisher River U.C. Indian Day School, but their attendance has been interrupted considerably due to their residing at the far north end of the Reserve, some 2\u00bd miles distant from the school, across the river; plus the fact that their father, a commercial fisherman took the family to the fishing grounds on Lake Winnipeg during fishing seasons. About a year ago, the family moved to within a short distance of Murdoch Day School (U.C.) where the children attended part of 1952-53 term. It was presumed by this office that the family had made this move with easier access to schooling in mind, as both boys are only at the grade 2 level.\nA verbal request for admission of the children to the Pine Creek School was made by the parents yesterday, and a visit was paid the writer by Reverend P. Dumouchel, O.M.I., Principal of the Pine Creek School. Father Dumouchel informed me that the mother was preparing to enter the Roman Catholic Church, and that the parents were willing to have the boys do likewise. At my request, Father Dumouchel secured signed statements to this effect, plus a statement signed by both parents agreeing to the admission of their boys to Pine Creek School. Originals of these three statements are attached. I informed Father Dumouchel that I could not conscientiously approve of the admissions, but would submit the case to Ottawa for decision.\n\nThere is no doubt that, at the present time, both parents and children are adherents of the United Church, and that the father, Louis Crate, will continue this adherence. The applications appear to be based on the future conversion of the mother and the two applicants to the Roman Catholic faith, plus consent of both parents to admission of the children to Pine Creek. There is no Roman Catholic Day School on this Reserve, and had the parents and children been bona-fide Roman Catholics at the time of application, with the desire to educate the children in a school of their own faith, I would have approved the applications.\n\nIt should be mentioned that the elder of the two applicants, Louis Crate, was taken to St. Mary's Roman Catholic Residential School at Kenora, Ontario, in 1949, but his admission was found irregular and the child returned home. Correspondence in this connection may be found on Ottawa file #465-10 (D.l.A.); Department's decision in the matter being conveyed to the principal of Kenora Residential School in a letter written April 1, 1950 by the late Mr. D. M. McKay. Mr. Davis' file #136/25-2-465 is also quoted in this connection.\n\nMy own thought in regard to these applications is that they should be denied for the present, and re-submitted at a future date, when religious affiliations of the mother and the two applicants may be so stated on the applications as to conform to the Department's requirements.\n\nIt would be appreciated if the Department would hand down a decision in regard to the attached applications, advising Father Dumouchel by letter of the action taken, with copy here. In the meantime, I intend advising Mr. and Mrs. Crate that their\nchildren should continue to attend the Murdoch U.C. Indian Day School while the question of admission of the boys to Residential School is under advisement.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Minnis,\nSuperintendent.\nWe, the undersigned, ask the Department of Indian Affairs to allow our children, Louis and Tom, to be taken to the Pine Creek Indian Residential School.\n\n(Signed)\n\n(Louis Crate)\n\n(Mrs. Gertie Crate)\n\n(Napoleon Reeves)\nI, the undersigned, after having taken the necessary instructions, wish to be received in the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nMrs. Gertie Crate\n\nIndian Affairs.

She is a girl of 13, and according to her parents, she becomes hard to handle at home, and they thought that a few years at the Residential School would do her good.\n\nDonald Henry and his brother Thomas are here because their father thought that Donald, of Grade VII would do better if he could have the periods of study available at a Residential School, but hard to have in their homes. Since Donald was coming, the father wanted his brother to come along also.\n\nLarry Patrick was sent here, because his parents realize that the boy is reluctant to go to school on the Reserve. They had the experience with one of their daughters, older than Larry, who not returned to the Residential School became impossible to handled.\n\nI regret that these children were taken here without the knowledge of the Superintendent or the Assistant Superintendent, but I know that Father Beaulieu did not know of the procedure in taking new children to the School.\n\nHoping this will clear the matter, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

I immediately got into communication with Dr. George Hilton, Department of Agriculture, Ottawa, and after an exchange of one or two more telegrams received one this morning stating that arrangements would be made to test the cattle at the School upon the distinct understanding that reactors must be destroyed, and no compensation paid.\n\nI will write you again after I receive the report of the Veterinary Surgeon.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 17th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 208-11 A of the 30th ultimo, stating that you have arranged to have a test made of the cattle at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School. We will be pleased to have the report of the veterinary as to the results of the test.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., April 29th, 1925\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th instant 126-1-14, and reply to say that a test has been made of the cattle at the Pine Creek Residential School, and 18 head of milk cows have proved to be reactors. I am enclosing herewith a copy of the Principal's report.\n\nThis is a heavy loss for the school, and it seems to me that the Department should come to their rescue. I strongly advocate that nothing but a good milking strain of cows be sent to this institution, if the Department will consider the purchase of cows.\n\nI do not like the idea of keeping diseased cattle anywhere near the school once we send in an accredited herd; it would be a serious mistake. Nor do I approve of sending cattle there until the stables have been passed by a competent Veterinary as being safe.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 4, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 208-11A of the 29th ultimo and I note with regret that 18 head of milch cows have had to be destroyed at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School. I should be pleased if you would make a definite recommendation as to how many animals should be purchased. You might ascertain how far the school authorities can assist. I agree with you that the stable should be made safe before an accredited herd be allowed to move in.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nBefore more cattle are shipped there we should have the Veterinary Inspector visit the school again to see whether the necessary steps have been taken to clean up the barns. I am ascertaining from Father Brachet how many cows the school would be prepared to purchase on their own account, and advise him that the Department are willing to assist him but think that the school should bear some of the cost. As soon as I hear from him I will communicate with you and give you my recommendation on the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nSir:-\n\nI am in receipt of your letter #126-1-14 of the 4th instant in connection with the 18 head of milch cows that have to be destroyed at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School.\n\nI beg to inform you that I have just received a communication from Mr. Olette, the Agent, with a copy of a letter attached from the Principal of the above mentioned school, in connection with the cattle. Father Brachet suggests in this communication that he be allowed to keep the cows until Fall with a view to securing a better price for them, and states that he has them in a separate pasture. He closes his letter by asking the Agent to recommend that the Department furnish him with milch cows to replace the ones that reacted under the tuberculosis test.\n\nI might say that the Reverend Father's suggestions do not meet with my approval, as I think it would be absolutely wrong to keep the cattle that are infected with tuberculosis around the place, and even if they are kept in a separate pasture there is no doubt they would get mixed with the other cattle sometime during the summer. It would be a useless waste of money to buy a new herd of cows and place them there under present conditions, as, coming in contact with the other cattle they would probably become infected with the disease. If the tubercular cattle are got rid of now, the sun would kill the tubercular germs in the pasture where they are kept. Whereas if they were kept there until Fall the germs would not be killed by the frost. The only solution is to get rid of all the cattle that have reacted, and thoroughly clean up the barns before any more cows are purchased. I am writing to the Principal to this effect.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter #126-1-14 of the 4th ultimo in connection with the 18 head of milch cows which were destroyed at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School, these cows having reacted under the tubercular test. I beg to inform the Department that this matter was taken up by me with the school, and the Principal advised me that the state of his finances at the present time did not permit him to spend any money in the purchasing of additional milch cows. Under these circumstances I would recommend that the Department purchase about 10 head of good milch cows for this school to replace the 18 head that will be destroyed. The cost of these cows will be somewhere in the neighborhood of $90.00 each shall be pleased to have your authority for this expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nJune 16, 1925.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nEighteen milch cows have had to be destroyed at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School, following a test undertaken by the Department of Agriculture. Mr. Commissioner Graham strongly recommends that ten animals be purchased, at an approximate cost of $900, to replace those destroyed. He reports that the principal of the school is not in a position to incur the expense. I shall be pleased to have your instructions.\n\nRussell D. Brier\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, June 17, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 208-11A of the 6th instant, with reference to the purchase of milk cows to replace those that had to be destroyed at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School. You are authorized to expend $900 for this purpose. Please make the best arrangements possible and inform the Rev. Principal that the Department expects him to make some sacrifice at the present time, so that the school management can supplement the herd that the Department is purchasing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nHealth of Animals Branch\n\nOttawa, June 24, 1925.\n\nDr. J. H. Grisdale,\nDeputy Minister of Agriculture,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Dr. Grisdale,\n\nI beg to advise you that Mr. Graham, Superintendent of Indian Agencies at Regina, requested in March last that immediate arrangements be made to test the herd of cattle at the Pine Creek Indian School in Manitoba. This school is situated in the Dauphin district, and as the herd did not contain the required number of registered cattle Mr. Graham was informed that the Department could only accept it under the supervised herd plan.\n\nI later received a communication from the Reverend J. Bracket, the person in charge of the Indian School and I forwarded, in accordance with his request, the usual agreement form which must be signed in this connection. This form was duly signed and the herd was tested on April 2nd and 3rd last. The report of the test has not, however, yet been forwarded to this office, owing to the fact that difficulty has been experienced in getting the nineteen animals, which reacted, destroyed. According to the agreement form signed there were fifty cattle in the herd.\n\nDr. Still advises me that Inspector Bishop informed him that Mr. Bracket made arrangements to ship the reactors to an abattoir in Winnipeg immediately the roads were in a fit condition to drive them to Winnipegosis for loading on the cars, while he was on the premises. As Mr. Bracket did not do so Dr. Still wrote to him on April 7th and again on May 28th. He then took the matter up with Inspector Bishop, who wrote to Mr. Bracket and received a reply on June 6th stating that he had turned the reactors loose on the open prairies far away from the Indian School after the test was conducted. He also stated that these reactors were now dispersed through the bush and swamps and that it would be impossible to gather them up again until the fall. He, however, agreed to have them all destroyed before winter and to allow none of them to go near the premises again. Mr. Bracket does not consider a retest of this herd necessary.\nIt is quite evident that Mr. Bracket is ignorant in regard to the measures which should be taken in connection with the control and eradication of tuberculosis, as he apparently thinks it is all right to turn reactors loose on the prairies and does not think it is necessary to retest a herd in which about 38 per cent of the cattle reacted.\n\nI am of the opinion that the Department is wasting time and money in endeavouring to clean up a herd with a man of this character in charge, but as it is evidently a Government institution I have thought it well to draw your attention to this case, as you may consider it advisable to take the matter up with the Department of Indian Affairs here.\n\nIn the meantime I have instructed Dr. Still to take no further action in the matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) George Hilton.\n\nVeterinary Director General.\nOttawa,\nJune 25, 1925.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am including, herewith, a copy of a letter addressed to me by our Veterinary Director General with reference to the testing of the herd of cattle at the Pine Creek Indian School in Manitoba.\n\nYou will note that the Veterinary Director General is of the opinion that under present conditions it is useless to attempt to clean up this herd, but before taking any action in the matter I should be glad to hear from you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.H.

Report from Veterinary Director General indicates that reactors in herd Pine Creek Residential School have not yet been destroyed. Do not purchase milch cows until conditions for new animals are satisfactory.\"\n\nI have received from the Deputy Minister of the Department of Agriculture a copy of a communication to him from the Veterinary Director General and it appears that the Rev. Principal at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School did not destroy the reactors following the test for tuberculosis. The Principal informed the local officer of the Health of Animals Branch that the animals would be destroyed in the fall and that he was unaware that a further test would be necessary.\n\nWhen making arrangements with principals in this connection in future, special safeguards will have to be taken, or the Health of Animals Branch will hesitate to cooperate with us.\n\nPlease write to the Rev. Principal at Pine Creek and be guided by instructions of my night letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, June 27, 1925.\n\nDear Dr. Grisdale:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant, enclosing copy of a communication from the Veterinary Director General with reference to the herd of cattle at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School, in Manitoba. I regret to learn that the Rev. Principal did not destroy the reactors after the completion of the test.\n\nUpon receipt of your letter, I telegraphed the Indian Commissioner at Regina that no replacements to the herd be made until after the reactors were destroyed and conditions were found satisfactory.\n\nI have to thank you for the assistance of the Health of Animals Branch in this connection and I will send instructions to our officers who arrange for tests, so that there will be no repetition of this difficulty.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nJ. H. Grisdale, Esq., D. Sc. A.,\nDeputy Minister,\nDept. of Agriculture,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:-\n\nI am in receipt of your telegram in connection with the purchase of cows for the Pine Creek School to replace the ones that re-acted under the tubercular test, and note what you state that the Veterinary Inspector General has indicated that this herd has not as yet been destroyed.\n\nI beg to inform you that I had no intention of purchasing these cows until such time as the instructions of the Veterinary Inspector were carried out. I wish to quote a portion of my letter written to Father Brachet on the 12th ultimo with reference to this subject.\n\n\"I wish to inform you that I think it would be a great mistake to keep the cattle around after being condemned by the Veterinary Inspector, and I think you should act on his instructions, and get rid of the animals affected immediately, for if you keep them around they would probably sometime or another get mixed with the other cattle and in that way more of your herd would likely become infected. Under the present arrangements I would be absolutely opposed to buying any more milch cows until such time as you get rid of the tubercular cattle, and the sooner this is done, the better. As soon as these have been shipped I will arrange with the Veterinary Inspector\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept.of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nto go over the stables again and see that all necessary precaution has been taken. I will then view favorably the question of the Department giving you some assistance in the way of purchasing more milch cows, if you will be good enough to let me know how many new cows you will require.\"\n\nI am again writing to Father Brachet today advising him of the telegram I received from the Department and pointing out my instructions to him of the 12th ultimo. I realize that it would be a great mistake to spend $1000 on the purchasing of milch cows and put them into a barn that had not been properly fumigated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

Hays\nSuperintendent,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nWelfare and Training Service,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn answer to your letter I26-I-14, dated Ottawa 31 January 1938, I beg to inform you that we have altogether 16 milking cows, 9 of which are giving milk at present.\n\nOur cows are tested regularly twice a year by Dr. Caldwell, from Dauphin, Manitoba. The last test, made in November 1937, proved to be satisfactory.\n\nWe do not purchase any milk. Our cows supply all the milk necessary.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nL. Gauthier, O.M.I.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Phelan,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe milch-cows of the Pine Creek School are far from giving satisfaction. They are poor producers and therefore, expensive to keep.\n\nAs you have never, to my knowledge, supplied this School with good milkers, would it be in order to ask for two or more good cows?\n\nI am told that pure bred animals can be purchased in Northern Manitoba directly from farmers at reasonable prices. If given authority by the Department, one of our Brothers could do the purchasing at no cost to the Department.\n\nMay I hear favorably from you regarding this matter.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6272, file 582-14, part 1)\nOttawa, August 18, 1941.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nYour letter of the 13th instant, addressed to Mr. Phelan, has come to me for consideration and reply. Mr. Phelan is at present absent on holidays and is not likely to return for a period of 2 weeks.\n\nI am of the opinion that we have never supplied cows at residential schools at any time since I entered the Department. It is just possible, of course, that cows may be supplied, together with other equipment at the time a residential school is established. In any event, the funds at our disposal this year are not sufficient to justify us in considering the purchase of live stock at Pine Creek this year.\n\nIf, as you say, the cows are unsatisfactory, I am of the opinion that the Principal would be well advised to dispose of them and buy regular dairy cattle.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nReverend J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nThe Secretary  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAttention Mr. Philip Phelan\n\nOn August 13 last I wrote the Department regarding the supplying of a few milch cows for the Pine Creek Indian School. On the 18th I received an answer to my letter signed by Mr. R.A.

As a matter of fact we are not even purchasing cows for use in agencies at the present time.\n\nIn a letter dated March 7, 1938, the then Principal of the Pine Creek Residential School wrote as follows:\n\n\"We have altogether 16 milking cows, 9 of which are giving milk at present. Our cows are tested regularly twice a year by Dr. Caldwell from Dauphin, Man. The last test made in November, 1937, proved to be satisfactory. We do not purchase any milk. Our cows supply all the milk necessary.\"\n\nThe natural increase from the above number of cows should have ensured sufficient milking cows to continue to provide the milk that is needed.

Plourde, C.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n1940, stated that they had 20 cows at the Pine Creek School but did not definitely state if all of them were milking.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\u2014 INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH \u2014\n\nCLOSED FILE\n\nFILE NUMBER 582 - 14 VOLUME 1\n\nSUBJECT LIVE STOCK\n\nPINE CREEK RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nCORRESPONDENCE FROM MARCH 1925 TO SEPT 1941\n\nNO FURTHER CORRESPONDENCE TO BE PLACED ON THIS FILE\n\nNOTE: For subsequent correspondence relevant to the subject matter of this closed file see\n\nFILE ........................................

In this space record any recommendations which the Board consider should be made to the Department in relation to the health or safety of the pupils of this School.\n\nChairman\u2014Indian Agent.\nThe Department Of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nRespected Sirs:-\n\nOn Sunday December 1st I was called to Pine Creek Indian School to treat Cook. I went at once and found this boy in coma. His face and eyes were puffed and swollen. Features pale, pulse irregular and little slow, respirations normal per minute but with a rattle in throat. The urine was loaded with albumen. There was some twitching of muscles. I made diagnosis of an acute nephritis. The chest appeared negative. There was no sign of regitity of neck or back. The ears were negative. There was vomiting when I arrived and I was able to elicit that this boy had a headache.\n\nI irrigated bowels with good results, placed boy in hot pack between woolen blankets in warm room isolated and gave sips of soda water. I secured Nurse Whale from Winnipegosis and continued treatment remaining at Pine Creek till boy died Monday morning. Monday morning I found signs of a pneumonia with pulse, temperature and respirations much increased. I believe the two conditions had developed at about the same time and as result this little boy died.\n\nThe Superintendent of the school and staff had done everything possible. They assisted in every way. I had been called as early as anyone would expect. The condition was acute rapid, with a sudden termination which was expected and which\nwas unavoidable.\n\nMr. Cook at Shoal River reserve was notified Monday by wire to effect that his little boy had died. It was impossible to notify him sooner or before death took place. A married sister of this boy, who was living at Pine Creek was called and brought her to the school to be present also a sister in the school.\n\nOn Saturday this boy was skating and appeared well. I know this Cook family and this boy and can report that he appeared well to me. The ailment was acute and the termination sudden. I believe everything was well done that could be done to help this little boy. Every attention was given. The School Staff under the direction of a wonderful Sister Superior, had done everything that was possible under the circumstances.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSirs,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.E. Medd\nWinnipegosis Sept/9th38.\n\nMr. J. Waitr,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage La Prairie.\n\nDear Mr. Waitr,\n\nRe. Alexander Cook- Shoal River Reserve.\n\nThis boy took sick with temperature and cough at Pine Creek School May 1st. He was isolated and seen by me and was detained at the school - given nursing care and medicine. This boy was thoroughly checked and I realized that I could keep him at the school for further observation which was necessary and then have him checked by the T.B. clinic at Dauphin and further disposed of. There was no improvement - his parents were notified of his condition on three separate occasions. He was too sick to be taken to Dauphin to the T.B. Clinic. I had him removed to the Crerar Hospital Winnipegosis June 9th.\n\nHis condition did not improve. The cardinal findings as shown by the chest were - cough, expectoration, irregular temperature, sweating, haemorrhage from lungs, loss of appetite, and weight.\n\nThe haemorrhages were the late findings. There was no t.b found in first specimens of sputum later I had definite T.B. bacilli in sputum.\n\nThe chest was explored for fluid or pus but none found.\n\nThe findings in the chest were respirations in first two weeks of May 20 to 26 per minute Pulse 100 to 110 and temperature 100 to 101.\nThe last part of May respirations were 20 to 28 per minute, temperature 101 to 102 and half with pulse increase. During June the respirations remained at thirty per minute and the temperature varied but remained rather higher and the pulse increased; this was due to haemorrhages and involvement of the lungs.\n\nThis condition carried through till time of death. The lungs showed a progressive involvement with spread of area involving whole of left lung and upper part of right right lung.\n\nThe general medicines used were stimulating expectorants in the first instance\u2014rest and good nursing care, with isolation. Later the complications were dealt with as thought necessary. For haemorrhages he had calcium lactate\u2014ice bag\u2014sedative.\n\nThe condition was steadily progressive to fatal termination.\n\nThe Summary\u2014\n\nI believe that there will be detention at the larger Indian schools of such cases where isolation can be maintained. The reasons for this is that we will have breakdowns at school of Indian children who mostly have been contacts as in this case. The second reason for this detention is for diagnostic purposes and I believe that any child with expectoration should be isolated and sputum test made.\n\nIf all chest cases are sent out on temperature and cough there would be no end of the number sent away when it would not be necessary and when we would not know if we had tuberculosis or not to deal with.\nWhere the parent is at a distance it is not pleasant to have the responsibility of a little child that is not progressing well.\n\nRepeated check ups will not avoid the breakdowns we will still have first diagnosis of T.B. made at the schools - There will still be detention at the school and good care given each child and disposal of such child and in reasonable time where we feel that something can be done to save that life it will be sent to Sanatorium. This case was discussed with Staff Of T.B. clinic at Dauphin and I made the case known and the boys condition discussed along with his brother who was at the clinic.\n\nIn my opinion everything was done and good attention given to Alexander Cook while at the Pine Creek School and I have given him the best of attention. I realized that his progress was not good. I reported same to parents and School Principal.\n\nI expect that we will have others that will have their break downs at school and as I review this case I can visualize that any other case will be handled in much the same way.\n\nYours Truly\n\nA.E.

BASHUCKY, Coroner, that he had received a phone call from one of the sisters at the Indian Residential School at Comperville to the effect that one of the boys of the school had been found dead. No other particulars were received at the time.\n\nThe writer accompanied by Dr. Bashucky and Sgt. R.L. Shell patrolled to the school via Dr. Bashucky's private car. Father de BERTAGNE, Principal, was interviewed and gave the following statement:\n\nComperville, Man.\n6th April 1951\n\nAlbert HEPINAK was a pupil of this Pine Creek Indian residential school. About 4.30 P.M. 7th April, I saw John FLATFOOT, T.I., and he said \"I met three of your boys and I think they were beating him\". He said one was Arsene HEPINAK's boy. As soon as John told me I went to see the Supervisor in the yard. I said John told me some boys go across the river. Then George HEPINAK says, \"yes my brothers going home I'll go and get him back.\"\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6272, file 582-23, part 1)\nPar. 2. Cont'd.\n\nGET HIM BACK.\" Albert's father who was working on the farm had also gone home so I was not worried when they didn't come back. At 6:30 p.m., the little boys came back all wet with no supper, that had gone to look for the first boys. When they came to the river they came back because they did not cross for fear of getting wet. I then considered Albert and the other two were in a house at the west side of the Reserve. I saw Arsenio this morning and he said that Albert hadn't come home. He left after the mass to go to Camille Nepinak's the boy's grandfather where he thought he must be. After dinner at 2:10 P.M., Father Phillpott told me Paul Moosetail is here with Gordon and Lindy, two of the runaway boys who had left with Albert. Then I suspected that Albert might be lost. I questioned the two boys then decided to go and hunt for him to see if he had not reached another Indian house and at that very time Noel Nepinak, T.I., came to tell me that the boy had been found dead by his father. I asked the sister to call the Coroner and went to the house to tell the boy's father Arsenio not to move the body but it was already in the house.\n\nSIGNED REV. P. deHartagne,\nPrincipal R.N.S.\n\n3. Father de Hartagne explained that it is customary if any of the boys leave that other members of the family will go to look for them as was the case in this instance when the deceased's brother George and two other boys started after the three boys who had left. The boys got their feet wet crossing the meadow and did not attempt to cross the river but returned to the mission. He did not have any reason to believe that the deceased was not safe with the boys he left with until the other two were returned to the mission by Paul Moosetail.\n\n4. The following statement was taken from Lindy Marchese, one of the boys who left with the deceased:\n\nSTATEMENT OF LINDY MARCHESI, T.I., AGE 13, APRIL 8TH, 1951.\n\nAt 4:30 yesterday, Gordon Moosetail left, and Albert Nepinak left the mission with me. We walked a few miles and came to the river on the way to Gordon Moosetail's home. I crossed the river first. I jumped in the water and walked and swam to the other side. Gordon Moosetail followed me walking through it, but Albert said \"I cannot go across I am going to go back.\" He was about half way across the river. Then he took his coat off, and the last I saw him he went back across the trail we had come on. We were all soaking wet and we were very cold when we got home. When we got to Moosetail's I told Mrs. Paul Moosetail that Albert had been with us and went back.\n\nSIGNED Lindy Marchese, R.N.S.\n\nThe statement of this boy refers to the Duck River which runs through the reserve. Gordon Moosetail could not be interviewed at this time as his father had come to the mission and taken him home which is six miles across the reserve by team and it was already 10:30 P.M.\nPer. 4 Cont'd.\n\nWAS ALREADY 10:30 P.M. WHEN THE PATROL RETURNED TO THE MISSION.\n\n5. The patrol proceeded via the mission truck with Father deBRETAGNE about 5 miles into the reserve to the home of the father of the deceased. Here Dr. BASHUCKY made a thorough examination of the deceased; it was about 7:00 P.M., and the doctor stated the boy had apparently died during the early morning hours of the same day and had been dead approximately 16 to 20 hours. He stated there were no marks of violence on the body and that the deceased had apparently died of exposure. The deceased had on dry clothes and the father explained that the one he was found in were soaking wet so he had changed them. He produced the clothes which were tied in a bundle and which consisted of blue denim coveralls, 1 pair brown striped pants, 1 pair of green socks, 1 pair of grey socks, black rubber ankle boots, blue sweater, white combination underwear. These clothes were all soaking wet and were identified by the father as those the boy wore at the mission.\n\n6. The following statement was taken from the father of the deceased:\n\nBEGIN:\n\nSTATEMENT OF ARSENE NAPINAK, T.I., Pine Creek Reserve, April 8th, 1951.\n\nI went to church at 10:00 A.M. today at the mission. Father deBRETAGNE asked me if my boy Albert NAPINAK, age 10, was at home. I told him he wasn't. I thought he was at the mission where he stays. The father then said he had left the mission yesterday and went to the west line with some of the boys. After mass Noel NAPINAK, T.I., told me that two of the boys were at home on the west side of the reserve. Then I went to look for my boy. I took the trail he would take coming home and about two miles from home found him lying dead on the bottom of an old hay stack. I went back and got my brother Joe who was following me and he brought the horse over and we took the body back as far as another stack 200 yards away. Then Joe went home and got a team and we took his body to the house. Then I sent Noel NAPINAK to tell the priest. It was 2:00 P.M. today when I found the body. It was quite cold and stiff. I believe he died from getting wet and cold and exhausted.\n\nSIGNED Arsen NAPINAK, R.H.S.\n\nAt this time Arsen NAPINAK pointed out that the boy had walked approximately 2\u00bd to 3 miles from the point to where he had been in the river to where his body was found. At this time it was quite cold and the going was very tough the horses at times being knee deep in snow and water. The boy had been following a trail which he knew led direct to his home. The patrol, accompanied by Arsen and Joe NAPINAK proceeded by team to the spot where the body was found as indicated by the boy's father. He pointed to the spot in the hay. From the look of the hay the boy had apparently tried to gather enough together to keep warm but had given up and just lay on the hay exhausted. At the time the patrol was made it was quite cold and Dr. BASHUCKY pointed out that anyone soaking wet would soon become numb with cold.\n\nContinued, Page 4.\nHURT WITH COLD (Par. 6 cont'd)\nand be unable to move, after which his body temperature\nwould lower gradually to a point where his heart would\ncease to function. The temperature during the night would\ngo below freezing.\n\n7. The patrol then returned to the house of Arseno\nNEPINAK. The following statement was taken from Joe\nNEPINAK:\nPine Creek Reserve, Man.,\nApril 8th, 1951.\n\nSTATEMENT OF JOSEPH NEPINAK.\n\nI followed my brother Arseno who went to look for\nhis son. I was about a mile behind him on a little lake\nand my brother came and said he had found his son Albert's\nbody. He showed me where he was lying on a hay stack\nbottom and I recognized him. We took him a little ways\non my horse then I went for a team to take him home.\nSIGNED Joseph NEPINAK.\n\n8. It would appear that the deceased, accompanied\nby two other boys from the mission Lindy MANCHESTER, Age 13,\nand Gordon MOOSETAIL, Age 13, left the mission with the\nintention of going to the home of Paul MOOSETAIL. Gordon's\nfather. About 4 miles from the Mission in a North Westerly\ndirection they came to the Duck River. Here Gordon and\nLindy crossed the river which was open by wading through it\nbut Albert got half way across then turned back and got out\nthe side he had come from. The water was about 4 feet deep.\nThen he proceeded back on the trail until he came to the\ntrail leading to his father's house. He started out along\nthis trail but only got about 2\u00bd miles before he was over\ncome by the cold and could go no further and perished from\nexposure. There are no houses along this trail. It also\nappears that the other boys who were also not thought he\nwould get home alright as they arrived at Gordon's father's\nplace which was a mile and a half West of the river.\n\n9. Dr. BASUCKY stated that in his opinion no inquest\nwas necessary and released the body to the boy's father for\nburial. The writer concurs with the opinion of the Coroner.\n\n10. The writer would suggest that this file remain\nopen until Gordon MOOSETAIL can be interviewed.

From perusal of this report it appears as though the deceased, together with Gordon Moosetail and Lindy Mancheese ran away from the R.C. Indian Residential School at Camperville, Manitoba with the intention of going to the home of Gordon Moosetail. On the way to Moosetail's home they had to wade across the Duck River. The deceased who apparently decided he could not get all the way across the river, turned back from the middle of same and then tried to walk to his own home. After walking a distance of about two and a half miles he could go no further and attempted to cover himself with hay. Unable to do this the boy apparently lay on the hay exhausted and succumbed to the cold.\n\n3. Gordon Moosetail, one of the above mentioned boys, will be interviewed in the near future and a further report will be forwarded to you in due course.\n\n(W.W. GRAY) SGT. FOR\nOIC DAUPHIN SUB/DIV.

It appears that the boys ran away from the school, and yet there is no mention of any member of the staff making an attempt to locate them. It has always been felt that when pupils run away it is the duty of the staff to make an endeavour to find them and bring them back. Occurrences such as the one we are discussing reflect on our residential school system and on those operating the schools.\n\nI would appreciate it if you would investigate this matter further at the earliest possible date, because if necessary, we must issue special instructions to the principals of all residential schools regarding the procedure that must be followed when pupils desert.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education\nATTENTION: Mr. P.

The following may clarify the matter:\n\n1. The deceased boy's father was working at the school at the time.\n\n2. The Principal thought the boy had followed his father home. Nevertheless, he sent the boy's brother to get him.\n\n3. The following day the father came back to the school and told the Principal that the boy was not at home, but was probably at his grandfather's home.\n\n4. Action was taken to check on this information and a search was started. This search resulted in the finding of the body.\n\nIt appears to me that in this case reasonable steps to find the boy were taken, and no blame is attached to the Principal of the school.\n\nR. S.

Since then a new and commodious building has been erected by the church Board under whose auspices the work is conducted at a cost of some $4000.00. There are now 30 pupils on the roll and the accommodation is sufficient for 40, but the amount provided for maintenance is insufficient.\n\nDuring February last your Inspector Major McGibbin made a very thorough inspection of the school and of the tepees at the Indian Village and he seemed to be very favorably impressed with the progress made and the manner in which the work is conducted, and in his report recommended strongly that the number of pupils supported by your Government be increased from 30 to 30.

Hendry, and his address is Portage-la-Prairie, Man.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nJohn H. Norton, Esq.,\nMidland,\nOnt.\nOTTAWA, 10th December, 1904\n\nSir,\n\nI have to inform you that the estimates for the current year provide for the payment of the grant of $72.00 per capita for 25 pupils at the Portage-la-Prairie boarding school. Your return for September quarter last shows only 20 pupils and if there were any more at the school during that quarter, payment for five additional children will be made upon receipt of a supplementary return showing their attendance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLEAN\nSecretary\n\nW.A. Hendry, Esq.\nPrincipal\nIndian Boarding School\nPortage-la-Prairie, Kan.\nPortage La Prairie Boarding School\n\nThis school is situated about one quarter of a mile east of the town of Portage La Prairie. The buildings are frame on a stone foundation and are heated with hot air and lighted by electricity.\n\nIt is a Presbyterian School. The Indians attending the school are Sioux. There is accommodation for forty pupils.\n\nThis school was built by the Presbyterians and the Govt contributed nothing, either for land or for the cost of erecting the buildings. (See D. Moore's letter of the 25th January on file No. 58244)\n\nThis school was first opened as a Day School in 1890 with 26 pupils enrolled and an average attendance of 10. The Dept paid a grant of $300 per annum to Calgary for the teacher of the Day School, $12 per capita for each pupil over the number of 25. The Day School continued to be paid at this rate till the end of the June quarter 1893 when it ceased to be run as a Day School. It is now conducted altogether as a Boarding School.\n\nThe Boarding School was first started during the year 1891 and was run in connection with the Day School till the end of the June quarter 1893. A grant was given by the Dept towards the support of the Boarding School in 1891 which...\namounted to $1000.00 being for 20 pupils @ $50.00 per capita. The same amount was paid for school in 1897. (See annual reports for 1891-97 in the statement regarding Indian schools.)\n\nAt the beginning of the March quarter 1897, the amount was raised to $73.00 per capita for 20 pupils (see Letter of Rev Prof Baird on file No. 94600).\n\nThis school has been paid on the same basis viz.: ($72.00 per capita for 20 pupils) since the above date.\n\nTwo teachers are supported by the Presbyterian Church and are paid $300 each from the funds of the Church.\n\nFor all particulars regarding the size, dimensions or construction of the Portage La Prairie School see Report No. 1194696.\n\nThe land in connection with this school comprised four small lots, equal to about 1/4 acre in all.\nSir,\n\nI beg to draw the Department's attention to the following matter. Ever since the Treaty was made, the Indians of the Long Plain reserve in the Portage la Prairie Agency, have resisted all efforts to place a Missionary or Day school on their reserve. Neither would they consent to their children being sent to a Boarding or Industrial school. But lately a change has apparently come over a few of them and Principal Hendry of the Portage la Prairie Sioux Boarding School, assisted by Indian Agent Logan has succeeded in getting four pupils of school age from that reserve, very much against the wishes and efforts of the Indians there. He also has four Sioux children of school age at the school over and above the number allowed, for which he does not receive any grant.\n\nThis school under Mr Hendry's management has kept out of debt, and I would be glad to have any Official of the Department visit there without warning. They are always ready and up to the mark, and the Pupils from that institution are a credit to them.\n\nMr Hendry remarked to me lately that he found the expense of keeping eight extra children was more than he could finance for without going into debt, on his present grant, and he was afraid that after all his trouble he would have to send the four children back to the Long Plain Reserve.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa.\nReserve. The school being for the Sioux he supposed he should give them the preference. But I asked him to keep them for a short time until I wrote the Department to see if I could get a grant for the extra pupils.\n\nMr Hendry says the two eldest pupils in the school will be leaving this winter, which will leave him with six extra children on hand and I would be very pleased if the Department could arrange to allow him a grant for that number over and above the 25 at present allowed.\n\nIt seems too bad altogether to allow children to go back to the Long Plain Reserve after trying for so many years to get them, and if these are kept at the school it will probably lead to others being sent in the future.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector.\nMr. Frank Pedley,\nDeputy Supt. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nThere is an Indian Reserve near Portage la Prairie called the Long Pains Reserve, that has been impervious to Christian and educational influences up to the present time. However, a change has come, as it is manifestly coming to many reserves. Mr. Hendry the principal of the Portage la Prairie Boarding School, has received a few of these children and others want to come, but he says, on the present per capita grant for twenty-five, he cannot finance it. He had, when I was there, thirty or thirty-one, I think, in the school. Would it not be a pity to refuse any who want to come, and especially after long years of quiet effort to induce them to care for the education of their children?\n\nWould it not be possible to make a per capita grant for thirty instead of twenty-five for the Portage School? I hope this will prove possible in the interests of the children and also in view of the increased cost of living in the west, as well as elsewhere. There is no doubt that the changed conditions will make necessary at an early date a revision of the administrative policy.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nR. P. MacKay\nOttawa, December 16, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Inspector Swinford in reporting on the Portage la Prairie Boarding School states that the Principal has succeeded in obtaining recruits from the Long Plain reserve and asks that the Department pay the grant for five additional pupils at this school.\n\nThe Department will, in view of the circumstances and the successful management of the school, pay for five additional pupils out of the general school vote, and you will be good enough to advise the Principal accordingly.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Hon.

(RG 10, Volume 6273, file 583-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, October 16th, 1909.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nThe Department has been asked by Mr. A. W. Vowell, Indian Superintendent for B. C., to approve the appointment of Rev. W. A. Hendry as Principal and Mrs. Hendry as Matron of the Alberni Boarding School. Although this is the first intimation the Department has had of the transfer of Mr. Hendry from Portage la Prairie to Alberni the approval is being granted through Mr. Vowell.\n\nIt is presumed that the Church has made the necessary provision to replace Mr. Hendry, but of any steps in this direction the Department is quite ignorant. Even if the Department is not consulted by the Church in any contemplated changes of this nature its approval should be received before they are consummated. I should be glad to know whether an appointment has been made to the Principalship of the Portage la Prairie School, and if so the name of the appointee.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. STEWART\nAsst. Secretary.\n\nRev. R. P. Mauzy,\nSecretary Foreign Mission Committee\nof the Presbyterian Church in Canada,\nToronto, Ont.\nOctober 19th., 1909.\n\nMr. S. Stewart,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nYours received of Oct. 16th. re the appointment of Mr. Hendry to Alberni, and enquiring as to whether or not a successor has been appointed at the Portage.\n\nI had not the impression in my mind that it was expected that we should report such appointments to the Department. They are made by the Western Committee, and I am not aware whether or not they have been under a similar impression. When I think of it, however, I recognize the desirability of keeping the Department in fullest touch with what is being done. In the future I shall endeavor to keep that in view.\n\nI am sorry that so many changes are being made. Mr. Hendry, who has done such satisfactory work at the Portage, had a desire to try the British Columbia climate. This request was made some years ago, and only now did the opportunity offer. He was accordingly appointed to Alberni and entered upon his duties.\n\nAt the same time that the vacancy occurred in Alberni we had from Mr. Millar of Ahousaht a request for a change on account of the climate, his throat being affected by the damp on the Pacific coast. Accordingly Mr. Millar was appointed to the Portage to succeed Mr. Hendry. This was even more regretted than Mr. Hendry's removal, because Alberni is a much more difficult place to fill and Mr. Millar has been doing admirably. A letter just received from Mr. Ross says that Mr. Millar has brought the work at Ahousaht to a higher level, possibly, than any other man we could have sent. He has left everything in good shape for his successor. The day school in particular has made great progress since Mr. Millar came into the work.\n\nMr. Millar not only left the Mission, but took Miss Mackay, the teacher, and they are to be married in a week or two. Together they will take charge of the Portage school. Further complications arose from the fact that Mr. Ross became engaged to Miss McNeil, who has been matron at the Ahousaht school, and who has proved herself indispensable, not only because of her ability as the matron of the home, but because of her work in the village amongst the people. It therefore became the problem whether to allow Miss McNeil to go to Ucluelet, or have Mr. Ross transferred to Ahousaht. Mr. Millar when leaving wrote stating that it had become a necessity that there should be two men in Ahousaht. Not only because of the duties of the principal in looking after the institution and the farm, for there a farm, as you know, of ten acres or so, secured by the draining of a shallow lake, but also because of the difficulty in securing wood, and in addition at times the discipline amongst the bigger boys, and even in\nMr. Stewart,\n\ndealing with the village, require two men. The strain proves too great for one. This view was entertained by our Committee and Mr. Ross has been appointed as industrial teacher, and we are looking for a principal who will be the Day School teacher as well as principal. Such we have not yet in view, and we have also the difficulty of having Ucluelet again vacant.\n\nWe are finding greater and greater difficulty in discovering suitable men, and we are exceedingly desirous of not employing men of poor qualifications. I think I can say that in the last few years the average of agents in our schools has risen considerably. We would like to employ none but competent men.\n\nThat is where we stand today, and in writing I recognise how important it is that you should have been kept acquainted with these facts, for it is your work even more than ours.\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRPM/NBA.\nOttawa, October 27th, 1909.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant in reference to certain changes made or contemplated by the Presbyterian Church in the management of schools conducted under its auspices in the West.\n\nThe transfer of Mr. Hendry to Alberni and of Mr. Millar from Ahousaht to Portage la Prairie was approved, and the Department trusts that each will meet in his new field with even a greater measure of success than in the old.\n\nThe appointment of Mr. Ross as industrial teacher at Ahousaht is also approved and, notwithstanding the difficulty experienced in securing the services of capable men, which the Department fully appreciates, it is hoped that you will before long be in a position to make the appointment of a capable person to the Principalship of this school. In the meantime it is presumed that Mr. Ross will take charge.\n\nThe Department will also be pleased to hear of the appointment of a teacher to take charge of the Ucluelet day school at the earliest possible date.\n\nI may here remind you that the school at Dodger's Cove has been closed since Mr. Ross was transferred to Ucluelet in April of last year, and the\n\nRev.

Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a report from its Inspector on the Portage la Prairie Boarding school which shows that, while excellent work is being done at this school, the building and surroundings are unsatisfactory. The Department is of opinion that the only way to overcome the difficulty referred to would be to erect a new building in a more suitable locality, and would like you to give this matter your serious consideration and submit your suggestions. It is thought that if the present building and site were disposed of enough might be obtained to go a long way towards erecting an up-to-date institution which would meet the needs of a school of this class.\n\nIn view of the Inspector's report the Department does not feel justified in going to any great expense in providing material for repairs to the old building, but there are some matters which should be attended to at once. There are no fire escapes on the building and something should be done to remedy this defect.\n\nMr. Millar is admitted to be an excellent Principal and, if better facilities were provided, his field of\n\nRev.

I think your proposal to build a new school at the Portage is the best solution of the problem. It is not possible to extend the present building or to secure land such as is desirable in connection with the Boarding School, and, as you say, it is likely the price of the property will realize a considerable portion of the amount required for the erection of new up-to-date buildings.\n\nOur Committee met the other day and your letter was submitted and cordially approved. I have written to Dr. Farquharson and also to Mr. Miller asking them to consider and report their judgment.

Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nDear Sirs,-\n\nI beg to report to the Department that during the second week in January we were visited by an epidemic of measles of a very virulent type which was followed by pneumonia. There were five cases of pneumonia and on January the 31st a little girl seven years old succumbed to the disease. We engaged a trained nurse and another officer on the staff to take Mrs. Hendry's work so that she could give all her time to the sick children as she is a graduate nurse but our best efforts was not enough to pull them all through.\n\nDr. Hasshard has been very kind and has visited the school almost daily since the outbreak. The little girl who died, Edith Chaske, had only been in school a month, but her mother was with her the week before her death.\n\nWe are still struggling along as best we can as many of the children do not seem to recover their normal condition and we are not yet safe with all our pneumonia cases.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. A. Hendry\n\nPrint.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa, February 12, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nThe outbreak of measles at the Portage la Prairie Boarding School was brought to the attention of the Department by the Indian Agent in a letter dated the 31st ultimo.\n\nIt is noted that the best attention possible is being paid by the doctor and the staff and it is hoped that the epidemic will soon be under control and that there will be no further deaths.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. A. Hendry, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nPortage la Prairie Boarding School,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nOttawa, May 31, 1912.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nIn reply to your inquiry I beg to say that there is now a boarding school at Portage la Prairie conducted under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church where provision is made for thirty-five pupils. The school is situated within the limits of the town of Portage la Prairie and the site comprises only two acres. The building is old and it will be necessary to erect a new one at an early date, as the present building cannot be remodelled to meet the requirements of the Department under the new contract. A suggestion was made to the Presbyterian Church in 1910 that they sell the present building and site and purchase a farm on which to erect a new building. Matters went so far as to choose the location, a farm of 250 acres about two miles from the town, and a sketch plan was prepared by the Rev. J. L. Miller, who was Principal last year. The Church wished the Department to erect the proposed new building.\nOn February 20th of last year Rev. D.F. MacKay was informed by the Department that it was not prepared to assume the cost of a new building and it was pointed out that it might be a good investment for the Church to do so and this drew the maximum grant of $125.00 instead of $100.00 that would be paid if the building were owned by the Department. On the 24th of that month Dr. MacKay replied giving his own personal views and pointing out a number of difficulties from the financial standpoint in the way. Nothing further has been done in the matter.\n\nThe Presbyterian Church is this year making extensive alterations and additions at Birtle and Cecilia Jeffrey, which will entail almost as much expenditure as the erection of new buildings, and they are also putting up a new building at Round Lake. I presume, therefore, that they will not, at present at least, be prepared to consider a new building at Portage la Prairie and no provision has been made by the Department in this year's estimates. This is where the matter stands at present. The first thing to be decided is who will assume the obligation. As the Presbyterian Church at present own all their boarding schools, I am of opinion that they will eventually decide to erect this building and thus control the ownership and obtain the maximum grant.\nI have never been in favour of the purchase of a site at Portage la Prairie and the erection of a building to be owned by the Department. When I was at Portage la Prairie I went personally over several locations on which a school might be placed and the farm of 250 acres mentioned before is by far the best location. Your memorandum has been dealt with entirely as effecting the Presbyterian Church at Portage la Prairie. If the application is from another source I can only say that it would scarcely be possible for the Department to assist the establishment of another denominational school in that district, which has heretofore been recognized as the field of the Presbyterian Church.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6273, file 583-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI beg to ask the Department if the grant for the Portage la Prairie Boarding School could be increased five pupils, from 35 to 40 pupils, until such times as they get into the new building.\n\nThere are now on the roll 41 pupils and there are three others signed to enter. The parents are bringing their children and they do not like it when they are not admitted.\n\nMr. Hendry the principal tells me that he can rent a house across the road directly in front of the school and that he is adding two more members to the staff. Ten of the small children can find splendid accommodation in this house, leaving only thirty in the school building for the winter months. The extra grant on the five pupils would pay for the rent of the house and help to provide for the pupils. They would thus secure a good start in their work and be broken in to school discipline before going into the new building.\n\nI would very much like to see this grant increased five pupils since Mr. Hendry will provide the accommodation and the help to look after them.\n\nTrusting to hear from the Department as soon as possible to enable Mr. Hendry to secure the house.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I think it would be advisable to begin with one or at most two nurses for the four boarding schools in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, that is Portage la Prairie, Birtle, Crowstand and Round Lake. One of these nurses would always be available in cases of epidemics. If there were no diseases of an epidemic nature at the schools they could spend three or four months at each school in rotation. If this plan commends itself to you, we might see if we could engage the services of one or two nurses.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. Andrew S. Grant, D.D.,\nSuperintendent of Home Missions,\nConfederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMr. D. C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am very anxious, for the betterment of our Indian Boarding Schools, that the Government should make it possible for us to have a trained nurse in each one of these schools, to have general oversight and care of the children from a health point of view. I think that, if the Government would agree to such appointments, we could greatly increase the efficiency of the school, and improve, in every way, the health of the children, as you are aware that there are a great many skin diseases among these children, and other diseases that are contagious, and, for the safe guarding of the children, it is necessary that the greatest care should be taken in these boarding schools to prevent the spread of anything of this kind, and, if possible, to correct these conditions. We are striving, in every way, to improve the efficiency of these schools now, and hope that the Government will come to our assistance in this matter, as we are spending a great deal of money and time in this work.\n\nI hope that you have given instructions regarding the\nnecessary improvements at the File Hills School.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Superintendent of Home Missions\nPresbyterian Church in Canada.\nMr. D. C. Scott,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nYour letter of January 28th received. I appreciate very much your decision in the appointment of two nurses. I was hoping that you might go a little further and appoint a third, so that there would be no interprovincial jealousies, as far as these three Provinces are concerned. However, we will have to be thankful for what you have granted, and hope for favourable consideration of others later. Now, I am going to proceed at once to secure the names of two fully qualified nurses of the right type who would undertake this work, and, when I find them, I will submit the names to you for your approval, stating, as you set forth, the salaries allowed.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nAndrew S. Grant\nGeneral Superintendent of Home Missions\nPresbyterian Church in Canada.\n\nA.S.G.-A.V.\nRe nurses in Indian Boarding Schools\n\nMr. D. C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nYour favour of January 20th received. If you would adopt the principle of providing a nurse for each of the Indian Boarding Schools, and agree, for the year 1914, to furnish three nurses for three of these schools, say Cecilia Jeffrey in Ontario, Birtle in Manitoba, and File Hills in Saskatchewan, (the first two named have been rebuilt by us, and the latter by you recently, and are equipped so that a nurse in these centres would be of great benefit, and could work to advantage, because the plant is there); then next year, when Round Lake, Portage la Prairie and Crowstand would have their new buildings, we might get the additional number required for these. My idea is that these nurses should be permanently a part of the staff, to look after the children with diseases that come into the school, not only skin diseases, but tubercular conditions, and also care for the health of the children in the school, insisting on habits of cleanliness and of health.\nand having general care, especially of the girls. Where such service would be rendered, a great deal of sickness would be prevented, and better results would be obtained in the School, saving a great deal of expenditure in the way of drugs and medical attendance, and thus saving the Government money. I would like very much if you would arrange the matter on these lines, and let us select the nurse, subject, of course, to your approval, you fixing the salary to be paid, and then they would be part of our staff, and under the control of the Principal of the School.\n\nSpeaking as a medical man, I feel confident that this would be in the interests of the work, both from the standpoint of the Government and the Church. I hope you will see your way clear to follow my suggestion.\n\nThanking you for the interest that you have taken in this matter,\n\nI am,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Superintendent of Home Missions\nPresbyterian Church in Canada.\n\nA.S.G.-A.V.\nJanuary 24th, 1914.\n\nDear Dr. Grant -\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant in reference to the provision for nurses for schools conducted under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church and I shall be pleased to give the matter due consideration as soon as possible.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General\n\nDr. A.

Salary will be $600 per annum, the School authorities to provide food and lodging. When you are in a position to nominate graduate nurses for these positions I shall be pleased to have the names with full information respecting qualifications etc.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nDr. A.

Mr. Sweet speaks of the hospital that you have in the colony. Would it be possible, now that that is temporarily closed, that the nurse that was there would be available for this position? I have written Mr. Sweet in this particular. Or is it your intention to open that hospital again in the colony? Mr. Sweet thinks that this is not necessary.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nAndrew S.

As before agreed I will have pleasure in appointing the two nurses, one for the Cecilia Jeffrey boarding school and one for the File Hills school. We have no nurse at present at the Colony at File Hills, but I heard from Miss McMullen who wished to join the Indian work, and have written Inspector Graham regarding this.\n\nI do not agree with Mr. Sweet in his opinion that the nurse is not necessary at the Colony. It is the intention that she should teach the day school and act as nurse as well.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. A. S.

I know how you are situated, and that you are governed by certain regulations, and the enormous expenditure on the part of the Government for this work makes it difficult to meet the growing demands, but, if we are going to get results, we have to get more liberal support from the Government for these schools.\n\nThanking you for your courtesy in this matter,\n\nI am,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA.S.C.-A.V.\nIndian Boarding School,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.,\nDecember 31st, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform the Department that the City fire brigade are pleased to be at the service of the new Indian School in course of construction at Portage la Prairie. They wish, however, that the Department supply 500 feet of 4 inch hose for use on the two outside hydrants. This would make it unnecessary for the City fire Department to take any hose out to the school should there be a call sent in, and in the meantime, the school could get the hose attached and turn the water on. Also, the brigade do not wish to have 500 feet of their hose so far away in case a fire should break out over town at the same time, as they require all their own hose at times.\n\nAwaiting the Department's advice in the matter,\n\nI am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nW.

The general opinion among those who know,\nhow well the building is being finished, is that it\nwould not be good policy to use it for barracks, as\nit would only serve this use, for say about six weeks.\nI do not think it will be ready for any one before\nthe 1st of March anyway, and suppose the troops\nwill move to Dewell Camp about the 1st of May\nwhere they camp every year.\n\nI am of the opinion they would do the School more\ndamage in a month or so than for school work in\na year, or perhaps years, if they acted as they have\nin the Armoury building, where our office is situated,\nas they have certainly been going some at the Armoury.\nIt might be that they could get the old school,\nwhich would accommodate for keeping.\n\nThus again, there is the agricultural buildings\non the fair grounds which could be made com-\nfortable, the same as at Winnipeg and Brandon.\nThere are all kinds of buildings on the fair grounds\nwhich could be used for heating.\n\nThose who have seen the Armoury, say it would\ndo the school great injury, considering the short\ntime the troops would occupy it.\n\nI considered it my duty to advise you regard-\ning the above.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nA.

We could use the four monitor rooms, the sleeping balconies and the sick rooms for most of the time, for sleeping accommodation.\n\nThe school at Ahousaht is now closed and possibly we could get part of their grant.\n\nI have nine pupils signed up over and above my 75 which I am allowed grant on at present. I am sure we could get 10 or 12 more from the Long Plain reserve which is only fourteen miles away.\n\nAn extra grant of even ten pupils would help me through financially until the war is over. It would be a very great help.\n\nShould the Department see wise to give this increase I shall be indeed greatly obliged.\n\nI remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nIndian Affairs.

We are glad to be able to submit the name of Miss Jean Derby as successor. She is a graduate of the Royal Alexander Hospital of Fergus, Ont. Dr. Groves, Medical Superintendent, says \"She is a most competent nurse. Her work is the very best and her character beyond reproach\".\n\nMiss Derby is 31 years of age. She graduated in 1913. Since graduation she has been doing district nursing and private nursing. In your letter to us of Dec. 27th you agreed that the salary of the new worker would be $50 per month. Miss Derby is willing to begin work at Portage la Prairie Mar. 1st. I hope this appointment will meet with the approval of the Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJH/EB\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ogletree, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nSerious matter to break up boarding school. Like to know reason for recommendation. If influenza in school sending children home would communicate it to reserve, could not school be quarantined? What does Hendry think? Give matter further consideration and wire me.\n\nDuncan C. Scott.\nSir,\n\nIn your telegram of the 19th instant, I beg to say that in suggesting closing of the Indian School here it was only a precautionary measure; there are some 76 pupils in this school and if the influenza broke out it would be impossible to take care of these children with the present help and it would be impossible to get outside help; there are several cases of influenza in the City and is spreading, several doctors are down with it, Dr. Nassard our own doctor is down with the disease and seven of the nurses in the Hospital.\n\nI consulted the Mayor and Medical Officer of the City and both advised sending the children home for a short time until the danger was over as the children would have a better chance in the open than they would closed up together.\n\nThe influenza has not broken out in the school yet but will be only a short time until it does as it is spreading very fast in the City, there were 10 new cases reported last night and Mr. Hendry the Principal is very anxious to be relieved of the responsibility of the serious situation and the parents of the children are very anxious to have the children home.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6273, file 583-1, part 1)\nI cannot see it is a serious matter to close the school for a short time as the pupils will return when the danger is over, in any case it would be better to close the school for a short time than to have the disease break out and loose a number of children then the Indians would blame the authorities for not allowing their children to come home.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Department.\n\nD.

Hendry, Principal of the Portage la Prairie Boarding School, dated November 4, 1918. Original on 427041/27.\n\nWhen the Department's order came saying that we could let the children out until the Flu was over nearly all the Reserves were under quarantine and only 21 of the small children were let go home on reserves where there was no Flu. So far we are free while all the institutions in Portage have the disease, the Provincial School for boys has 65 cases and the institution had to be managed by help from Winnipeg. We put a quarantine on before any cases came to Portage and I am the only one who leaves the building.\nIndian Boarding School,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.,\nDecember 3rd, 1918.\n\nSirs,\n\nI beg to make a report on a pupil of the school, No. 675.\nAmy Young, whose home is in the Sioux Village two miles South of the town.\n\nThis girl became impregnated when she was home on her holidays and on stated evidence she says that the man who committed the crime was her sisters husband, Edward Pashe, with whom she was staying part of the time. The parents say the she, Amy Young, is sixteen years old on the 2nd of May 1919.\n\nThe case is being placed in the hands of the Provincial authorities and the Department will be informed what the outcome will be as it comes under the criminal code.\n\nI might add that this man Edward Pashe is a thoroughly bad man, and well known as such to the police and Magistrate of the city.\n\nI remain,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Arrangements should first, however, be made for her care. If you consider she would receive proper attention at home with her parents, she can be sent there, and if not, should either be placed in some institution or in the care of an Indian family on the reserve to which she belongs. You will be good enough to state what action is taken in this regard.\n\nIt is noted that the case is being placed in the hands of the provincial authorities and the Department will be pleased to receive information of the action taken, to obtain the conviction of Edward Pashe, whom the girl states is responsible for her condition.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nRev.

He has seen six months of jail, was very abusive to his wife and was a threatening sort of a character.\n\nThe authorities think it best to make him pay for the keep of the child and this will be done as soon as the child is born.\n\nRegarding the discharge of the girl I beg to ask the Department if they think it wise to bring the girl back to school after the child is born and leave her here until she is nineteen or twenty years old. If she leaves school now, not yet sixteen years old and in this condition, she will not have a fair chance to keep right. On the other hand, if she is brought back until she is twenty years old, the past will be forgotten, she will have developed independence of mind, and she might turn out a very good woman.\n\nI remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nIndian Affairs.

We also wish to thank the Crown Prosecutor, Mr. Card, for his assistance, and congratulate him on the fair and concise way each indictment was laid before us. We have had under our consideration nine indictments, for all of which we have returned True Bills.\n\nAccording to your instructions we have visited the various public buildings as follows:\n\nThe Provincial Gaol.\n\nWe were escorted through the gaol by sheriff R. H. Home and turnkey Mr. Thompson, who showed us every courtesy and assistance. We interviewed every prisoner in the gaol and were pleased to find only eleven male prisoners incarcerated and no females, five of these prisoners being aliens. In no case were there any complaints.\n\nWe understand that some years ago better ventilation of the prisoners' cells was recommended by the Grand Jury, but so far there is nothing done. We recommend that an electric exhaust fan be placed over the door at the west end of the corridor, which would draw off the foul air and give good circulation throughout.\n\nWe recommend that the pump pit in the boiler room be enlarged, there not being sufficient room to work at the machinery properly in the present state. Further, that the pit should be deepened at least two feet to allow for proper drainage as there is some...\nDifficulty in drawing off the condensed steam throughout the building.\n\nThe Hospitals.\n\nWe next visited the Hospital and the Jury were conducted through the whole building by Supt. Miss Purvis and Head Nurse Miss Ronnie. At present there are only sixteen patients, eight male and eight female, which in comparison with the same date last year when there were 52 patients, shows the City and District are to be congratulated on the improved health condition. The wards throughout are everything that could be desired and show every care and are certainly a great credit to Miss Purvis and her staff. The Jury were pleased to note that the new laundry building and equipment, separate from the Hospital, is nearly completed. This improvement has been required for many years.\n\nHome for Incurables.\n\nAt the Home for Incurables we were met by Asst. Supt. Mr. McKinnon, and Matron Mrs. Campbell. The whole building was thoroughly inspected and everything was found in excellent condition so far as the management and care of the inmates was concerned. We wish to congratulate Mrs. Campbell and her assistants on the splendid, systematic, and businesslike way the Institution is conducted. There are in the Home for Incurables one hundred and fifty-five male patients and ninety female, and in the Old Folks' Home forty-eight male and thirty-six female patients.\n\nThe Jury would recommend that all of the floors in the rooms now housing the idiots and imbeciles should be covered by non-absorbent cement or tile, as they are at present far from sanitary, and it is utterly impossible for the attendants to make it so. The children's playroom and dormitories are lamentably overcrowded and we ascertained that with the present building accommodation it is impossible to improve matters. The matron informed us that in the Old Folks' Home and in the Home for Incurables, there is not a single empty cot.\n\nWe also wish to draw the attention of the authorities to the fact that the buildings at present have no adequate fire protection, as the hydrants are only supplied from a six-inch main, which could...\nonly supply two streams and which would be absolutely useless should a building of this size catch fire, and in case of a break in this main, which is constructed of wood pipe, the whole water supply would be cut off. Even for sanitary purposes it is a very serious matter for an institution of this kind, and we would recommend that an eight-inch iron main be laid from the pumping station, up Campbell St., and connected with the other line, and necessary valves placed so in case of a break either line can be used, or in case of a fire an abundant supply of water be had. There being nearly four hundred souls in this house, under the circumstances should a fire occur and for want of sufficient water lives be lost, somebody would be criminally liable.\n\nFarm Buildings.\n\nThe Farm Superintendent showed us over the outbuildings; the stock was only in fair condition; the dairy cows were not as clean as they should be, and show lack of care. Of course, we do not know whether the assistance is sufficient there or not. There is certainly ample room for improvement.\n\nIn 1916 the Grand Jury recommended that the stables be painted both inside and out. It is still anything but a credit to the Institution. We have ascertained that 2 years ago sufficient paint was purchased for this purpose, but the said paint is still in the basement of the building, and we would recommend that it be put to its proper purpose in the spring. The litter-carrier in the stable has been out of order for months and should be repaired at once, as the present mode of doing the work is most inconvenient and entails great loss of time. We understand that there have been plans made for some time for a laundry to be built away from the main building. This, in our estimation, should be done at an early date, the present one being divided up into three separate rooms, and therefore very inconvenient for the work to be done efficiently, besides, where it is at present operated is very unsanitary.\n\nIndian Schools.\n\nMr. Hendry the Sup't, and Mrs. Hendry the Matron, showed the Jury around this Institution with great pride, for which they have every reason. It certainly is a credit to themselves and staff.\nThere are 75 pupils in the school and we understand they are all anxious to learn. The only recommendation we have to make in this instance is that the walls and interior of this building, principally the basement, should be given a coat of paint, as apparently nothing has been done since the building was erected.\n\nIndustrial School:\n\nWe then visited the Industrial Training School, and under the guidance of Supt. McKinnon and Matron Mrs. Robinson the Jury made a thorough inspection. In the building at date there are 91 boys, 19 of whom came from Alberta. We found everything in a satisfactory condition, and it is quite evident all through the building that Mrs. Robinson the Matron is doing excellent work. The trades now being taught are Cabinet-making, Baking, Laundry work, Tailoring, Sewing. Shoemaking and Blacksmithing seem to have been discontinued. The shoe-making instructor is now only occupied in repairing the boys' boots. We think this is a mistake and that the latter two trades should continue to be taught. The stables and outbuildings were then visited and Supt. McBride showed the Jury through the buildings, and the Jury were one and all unanimous in their praise of the condition of both horses and cattle, and great credit is due to the individuals in charge and to the boys who ably assist them. We noticed in the root-houses the splendid and abundant assortment of vegetables which were produced in the gardens by Mr. Colin Newman. The amount of produce per acre shows that the land must have been brought into a very high state of cultivation.\n\nIn connection with the cattle stable we find the Supt. very much handicapped as there is neither steam nor hot-water connected, and would recommend that a large size feed boiler be installed there or that the authorities adhere to their original plan.

We would further, for the encouragement of our Home Mission Board, mention Mr. Ross' statement that his work would have been a failure had it not been for the foundation laid in the character of the younger Indians by the work of the Indian Industrial School at Portage La Prairie, and assure them that no mistake has been made in the appointing of Mr. Ross to this particular work.\"\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/HC\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We are writing the Principal of the school and the Church authorities, advising them of the decision of the Department and of the reasons why action is taken.

It has been decided to ask the two schools where the nurses are now situated to conform to the general practice, and I have directed that the Department discontinue paying for the services of nurses at the Portage la Prairie and Cecilia Jeffrey schools as from August 31st and September 30th, respectively.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Sept 11th, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nMy next visit was to the Portage la Prairie School. It is needless for me to say very much about this school as you know what it is like. It certainly is an excellent institution and a credit to any community. I think the Department is very fortunate having a man like Mr. Hendry at the head of this institution. The school is situated close to the city of Portage la Prairie, and unless it was properly managed we would come in for a great deal of criticism, as there are some the best farmers in the vicinity at this point, and everyone of any note who comes to Portage la Prairie is brought out to see the Indian school and its surroundings. They had just commenced threshing when I arrived. This year they have everything under crop + no summerfallow whatever. Mr. Hendry is under the impression that he can farm the land successfully without summerfallow by rotating the crops. For instance, this year he has about 15 acres in potatoes and about 12 acres in corn. He intends putting this into wheat next year, and the ground he has in wheat this year is to be sown with potatoes and corn next year. In fact, he grows everything on this farm that it is possible to grow here in the West. I say some of the finest pumpkins, vegetable marrow and squash that I have ever seen. He also expects to thresh about 7,000 bushels of grain. What wheat he had threshed when I was there was running about 30 bushels to the acre and graded No.2. The whole place looks more like an experimental farm than an Indian boarding school, and the beauty of it is that the work is all done by the Indian boys. The only men around the place are Mr. Hendry and one other man. I must say I always find it a great pleasure to visit this institution. Mr. Hendry is thoroughly practical, and my only regret is that we have not more men of his stamp at the head of Indian boarding schools. I would say that it would do some of the other principals a great deal of good to spend a day or so with Mr. Hendry at the school, and see how he handles the affairs of the institution. The school was filled to capacity, and I believe three or four over the amount the grant calls for, as he has no trouble in recruiting.\nContinued-----------\n\nrecruiting all the children he can handle. This school is in an excellent financial condition, having several thousands of dollars to its credit, and with this year's crop another large surplus will be added. While I was there I made arrangements for the building of the addition to the chicken house and the implement shed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nRegina, Sask. Sept 18th, 1925.\n\nI would particularly draw your attention to what the Inspector says about the Portage la Prairie School. I only wish all of our schools were managed in such an efficient way. We have too many inferior men in charge of our schools; men who have no idea of business, which is very essential in conducting institutions of this kind. At the Round Lake School our Principal has fallen far short of the mark. I regret this as the Indians on this reserve have not had a fair chance. This school should be called upon to do better work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise the Department that Miss Janet Watson, formerly nurse at this institution has never received the money that was deducted from her retirement fund and which amounted to $40.00 plus interest at 5%.

Mr. and Mrs. Hendry are devoted to their work, and know the Indian character well and does everything in their power for the welfare of the pupils, who have the good fortune to be admitted to this school. They are assisted by a competent staff, comprising an Asst. Matron, Nurse, two Teachers, Dietitian, Seamstress, Farm Instructor etc., number of pupils on Register 92 with average attendance 92. The work of this school during the year has been very satisfactory, the attendance has been always over the number allowed (90).\n\nIf there was enough room the Attendance of this school could be raised to 120 pupils. The work of the class room has been well done, and the pupils have made good progress. There has been very little sickness during the year, but one pupil died last November, she was taken to the Hospital and received the best of care but nothing could be done for her, with the exception of this one, the pupils have enjoyed good health. Dr. George A. Hassard is medical adviser for this school.\n\nThe work on the farm was very successful, and the Wheat crop was 1800 bushels. Oats 2000 bushels. Barley 1000 bushels Potatoes 2000 bushels and 100 tons of Corn and vegetables of all kind for house use.\n\nThe discipline of this school is all that could be looked for and the pupils are happy, contented and obedient and try to do the very best possible to make progress with their work and studies.\n\nThe finances of this school are in good shape and are closing the year with a good balance to the credit of this school and a good stock of provisions and fuel on hand.\n\nSgd by pat [signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nPortage la Prairie, Man. - Feb. 17th 1927\n\nWe the people of the Sioux Village of Portage la Prairie called a meeting tonight just for the purpose of looking into matter of the decision that was handed out between the Continuing Presbyterian and United Church in Indian work in the Province of Manitoba by the Commission.\n\nFirst of all we would like to call your attention to take fully into consideration and look into this matter carefully and would like you to settle this matter which would make things easy for us and our children.\n\nIt was about the year 1852 when the Presbyterian people seen us wandering around like wild beasts in this country. Some nice kind ladies didn't like the way we were at the time so in that year they started a Mission work among us Sioux Indians just north of the City of Portage la Prairie, in a tent. When they got things going nicely they told us that they were going to teach us how to read and write English also.\n\nWell, ever since then we have been loyal to the cause of the Presbyterian Church. This Church was really the one that built the Church and our Indian School in the first place. When you come to find out the facts, start plain, it is starting back from 1852, 45 years ago, we have been having church service every Sunday, our children going to school. Instead of 35 years there has been three different generations in both church and school service, starting from 1852 up till today, a long way off before the other Reserves start in church and school service.\n\nWe have been told by Mr W.A Hendry the Principal of the Indians that all our children will be turn out of the school and sent to some other school. To this point we do not believe it and will not stand for it. To this point we wish to say that in case of sickness both us and our children it is very hard proposition for us to bear as we have no money to go and see our children if they get sick when they are put in some other school. Some of the parents of the pupils are old and some are widows. What will they do in case of sickness when their youngsters are taken away?\n\nIn the next case the reason why we call on the Presbyterian people to take charge of church service, we did not have any service in our church for 15 years, starting from 1914 to 1927 but only 25 Sundays in the 13 years, all this work was in charge of Mr W.A Hendry the Principal of the School but he only carried out half of his work and got paid for it all.\n\nIn December 10, 1926 of last year was the day appointed by Govt to take a vote for the Union but to this we did not know a thing about it until later in the year. In this month of May 1927, five weeks later after the set date for the church voting, he taking up votes, going around the people to vote for whom making them promise for six weeks.\n\nAfter he got the votes he did not carry out any of his promises at all, not even one promise that he made in the village.\n\nAt Long Plain Reserve he tried to take a vote on the Church but he was turn down and turn out of the Reserve altogether. He than asked them if they want Mr Ross to come and take charge of their Church service, to this they voted \"Yes\" not knowing what church he said Mr Ross belong. He made out his report that they were not for Union when they really did not vote for Union because they don't know it yet. To this point we would like your department to take it serious and look into it carefully. The Long Plain Indian Reserve are in favor with us and want us to make the appeal against the decision about the school settlement. We hold us we have more to say in the school settlement because we were the ones that started it, both church and school, 35 years ago with the Presbyterian Church.\n\nThe last point of all we wish to tell you that we are loyal to our country, way back in 1812 our grandfathers fought under the British flag against the United States. In 1895 our same tribe fought under the flag against the French halfbreeds in the west, called the North West Rebellion.\n\nIn 1914 the time of the Great war, 6 of our boys offered their service for over seas but we are sorry to say that only two out of the eight went ov seas, the rest of us that stayed at home both young and old, women and men, took up collections in money, handed them over to the Red Cross fund to help the boys who were over seas during the war, not only our boys but to all.\n\nSo this show that we all stand loyal to our country, our both flags, British and Canadian, our Church and last of all, our school.

A writing, dated the 17th ultimo and signed by Peter Ross, John Posha and John Chaske as Councillors of the Sioux Village Reserve, was directed to Ottawa. They asked that the school be handed over to the Continuing Presbyterian Church, so that their children would not be sent away to a distant institution. I wrote Mr. Indian Agent Ogilvie, directing him to inform these Sioux Village petitioners that there would be no change concerning the attendance of their children. In the second communication to our representative, I stated in part as follows: \"If the parents make application for their children to the local institution, they will receive the same favourable consideration as heretofore.\"\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

As most of the graduates of your school will return to reserves that are largely farming communities, it is very important that the girls be fully competent in this particular. The Department expects that the older girls, under proper supervision, will be given a course of instruction in milking, and I shall be pleased to learn that suitable arrangements have been made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. W. A. Hendry,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nIndian Residential School,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.,\nMay 30th, 1929.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nDear Sirs:\u2014\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of May 21st No 127-1-1 re older girls being instructed to milk and beg to say that I will see that all the graduating girls be given a course of instruction in milking.\n\nI am, Very truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nIndian Residential School,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.,\nOctober 7, 1930.\n\nA word about the effect on the school of lowering the discharge age from the 18th to the 16th birthday.\n\nI have found the discipline more difficult at the ages of 14 and 15 years than at 16 and 17 years. There is less logic and more impulse in their mental workings; they will run away from school more readily and fall for acts of immorality. Their breakages are very much higher, have not much definiteness of aim in their work, are less polite to teachers, more disobedient and less truthful. It is strangely wonderful how Indian children will clear up especially in the 17th year. Every instinct to get away from all routine and the four walls of the building seems to be at its highest point in the 14th and 15th years.\n\nAt 17 and 18, they are more steady and are a great help to the discipline of the school, if one gives them an opportunity to take charge of a task with other children under them. They are a very great factor in discipline if carefully managed.\n\nAgain, when the boys receive their discharge at the end of the 15th year the value of the training they receive in farm work is very little when compared with those who remain in school to the end of the 17th year. At an Indian plowing match with over forty entries the four best plowmen on the field were four of our school graduates. There are good men who never have been in school but the farmers on the plains say that the school boys are rounded off in their work and can do anything on the farm. We cannot give this finish to boys of 14 and 15 at all. A boy of fourteen years is not fit mentally to work a four-horse team unless they are plugs and no one can do good work with such horses. We formerly thought a boy of 15 was too young to put with a four-horse team. We only gave them four horses for the first in the 16th year. The same can be said about the training of the girls, in cooking, sewing, ironing, general housework. We do not expect much from our own children beyond their class-room work at the ages of 14 and 15 years. We should expect less from Indian children. We have a history and tradition in work and economy entirely absent in the Indian but we make their children work heavier. The breakages and dangers of accidents and mishaps working with farm machinery and school equipment are greatly increased with the employment of these young children as compared with the older ones of 16 and 17 years of age. They are not able for the heavy work either on the farm or in the school. The trend of the residential schools will inevitably become more academic and less industrial as the Indians are already complaining about the children having to work too much.\n\nThe Meriam report of the U.S.A. Indian work uses very strong language about overworking children in their schools. They say \"that no industrial work should be done by children until they reach the 15th year and that it is done because the small amount of money allowed for food and clothes makes it necessary to use child labour.\" (Page 375) and their grant is $270.00 per capita against our $160.00. The report further states, \"The labour of children as carried on in Indian Boarding Schools would, it is believed, constitute a violation of child labour laws in most States.\" (Page 376)\n\nIt is a very difficult problem to get the work of an institution done with some 14 girls and 10 boys on the half day plan. There is the cooking, mending, laundry work, general housework and dormitories for over 100 including...\nstaff, the care of the lavatories, wash rooms and three floors of over 9000/ft\u00b2 to be scrubbed and kept clean. It means only seven girls in the morning and seven in the afternoon, 14 and 15 years old to do the work, and we receive a circular letter from Regina (No 120, Copy enclosed) telling us that these 14 and 15 year old girls must learn to milk cows, make butter, bake bread and do garden work. The Inspectors will carefully inquire into these matters and report etc., A girl at this age is physically at her lowest, it is her adolescence period. All the 16 and 17 year old girls are on the reserve, where some have cows and there is a farm instructor on most reserves, and the girls have next to nothing to do in house work, or any other kind of work. These young girls in school have too much to do as it is.\n\nComing to our second question - an increase in the per capita grant. The grants in Canada are not entirely standardized. I think there is a difference in a few dollars in some of the schools. Schools with larger attendance, as a rule, receive the larger grants. The opposite is the case in the U.S.A. Portage grant is $160.00 per capita on 90 pupils. This is not enough. This year, because of the low price of grain, and last year because of drought, I have had to put per capita grant into the farm to carry it over. The farm is a liability and will continue so with prices at their present level. The lowering of the discharge age means more hired help and we can no longer cook our bread as these young girls cannot stand the work and this will mean an outlay of $500.00 more each year.\n\nThe U.S.A. Indian Boarding Schools are much the same as ours with farms attached. The Principals of those schools who have called to see us cannot understand how it is possible for us to finance. In the U.S.A. schools of over 200 pupils they receive $270.00 per capita and the Principal's salary and transportation of children is paid extra. In the schools of 200 pupils or less, the Minister of the Interior can increase the grant as high as $300.00 per capita with Principal's salary and transportation of children extra. (Feb. 21 1925,43 Statute L 958.)\n\nTake the per capita grant of Portage school, $160.00 on 90 pupils $14,400.00. Here are a few of the fixed expenses that cannot be changed very much.\n\n| Item                | Cost   |\n|---------------------|--------|\n| Clothing            | $2500.00 |\n| Food                | $5000.00 |\n| Wood                | $1200.00 |\n| Salaries            | $6500.00 |\n| Light, water, power, range | $700.00 |\n\n$15,900.00\n\nNo one can make much change in these items and in some of them no change at all. The farm was our help but now it is a liability.\n\n(Sgd.) W.A. Hendry,\nPrin.\nOttawa, November 21st, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nRev. Mr. Beaton of the United Church Board of Home Missions informs the Department that you have written concerning the age for discharge from Indian residential schools and the amount of per capita grant at Portage. I may say that the Department hopes to secure a Vote which will enable us to make a slight increase in your grant from the beginning of the next fiscal year, viz., April 1st, 1931. It is hoped that $165 can be fixed as the rate per annum for next year.\n\nWith reference to the age of discharge, I may say that it remains at eighteen, as heretofore. Principals, Indian Agents and others interested are expected to bend every energy towards keeping those children that would profit by the full course in the residential school until they reach the age of eighteen years. The Statute during the past few years provided for the compulsory attendance of physically fit Indian children at school between the ages of seven and fifteen years. At the last regular session of Parliament, the section with reference to compulsion was repealed and the following substituted therefor:\n\n\"Every Indian child between the full ages of seven and sixteen years who is physically able shall attend such day, industrial or boarding school as may be designated by the Superintendent General for the full periods during which such school is open each year; provided that where it has been made to appear to the satisfaction of the Superintendent General that it would be detrimental to any particular Indian child to\n\nRev.

(RG 10, Volume 6273, file 583-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nhave it discharged from school on attaining the full age of sixteen years, the Superintendent General may direct that such child be detained at school for such further period as may seem to be advisable, but not beyond the full age of eighteen years, and in such case the provisions of this section with respect to truancy shall apply to such child and its parents, guardians or persons with whom such child resides during such further period of school attendance.\"\n\nYou will note that Indian children may be compelled to attend until their 16th birthday. In certain instances, the Department can also compel attendance to the 18th birthday. It is not intended that compulsion to the 18th birthday be applied to all Indian children or even to a large number. This clause was added to the section so that the Department could postpone discharge for an added two years, when home conditions very strongly suggested such action.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8.

$6648.26505\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Indian Residential School Portage la Prairie, Man., for the Quarter ended September 30, 1941.\n\nPrincipal Rev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Portage la Prairie Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1941.\n\nPrincipal: Joseph Jones\n\nDated: December 31, 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Portage la Prairie, January 2, 1942\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A.403\nReps.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Portage la Prairie School for the Quarter ended 19 .\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 19\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Portage la Prairie School for the Quarter ended 19 Man.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 19\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Indian Residential School Portage la Prairie, Man., for the Quarter ended September 30, 1942.\n\nPrincipal Joseph Jones\n\nDated September 30, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 10\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403 Rep.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Portage la Prairie School for the Quarter ended March 1943.\n\nPrincipal: J.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Portage la Prairie School for the Quarter ended July 3rd, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: J.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate\" number of days pupils in residence during quarter by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Portage La Prairie School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: J.

Fill in all columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Portage la Prairie School for the Quarter ended September 1943.\n\nPrincipal: J. R. McNeill\n\nDated: Oct. 20, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Portage la Prairie Agency this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nBoys.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Portage La Prairie School for the Quarter ended December 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDate: Jan 8, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Portage La Prairie Agency this 8th January 1945.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL Phone 110 - Dover 1299 and tuition at the Portage La Prairie - Man.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupil in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupil in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupil in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Portage La Prairie School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: A.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY THAT THE RETURN IS A TRUE AND FAITHFUL STATEMENT OF THE ATTENDANCE AND TUITION AT THE PORTAGE LA PRAIRIE, MAN., SCHOOL FOR THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: JANUARY 3, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 1, 1946.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19 .\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL Phone 110 Portage La Prairie School for the Quarter Portage La Prairie - Man ended Dec 31 1946 Principal\n\nDated Jan 2 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Portage La Prairie JAN 2 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403 Regn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Portage-la-Prairie Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1947.\n\nPrincipal Rev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days grants in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Fort George-In-Fraser Residential School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30th, 1947.\n\nPrincipal Rev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Portage la Prairie, Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1948.\n\nPrincipal Rev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Portage la Prairie Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1948.\n\nPrincipal Rev.

(RG 10, Volume 6273, file 583-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Portage la Prairie School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1949.\n\nPrincipal Rev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in which all pupils are shown on the Return are accounted for by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Portage la Prairie Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1949.\n\nPrincipal: Rev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is obtained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Portage la Prairie School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1949.\n\nPrincipal: Rev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Portage la Prairie School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1949.\n\nPrincipal: Rev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Fortage la Prairie School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1949.\n\nPrincipal Rev.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils whose names on the Return are determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will any credit be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................

CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on this Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Portage la Prairie School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated July 3, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Portage la Prairie this July 6th, 1950\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**PORTAGE LA PRAIRIE Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the PORTAGE LA PRAIRIE School at PORTAGE LA PRAIRIE on Reserve for Quarter ended June 30, 1950**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY/GIRL | HAND OF RESERVE | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|----------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 293             | Jasper Meeches  | 10  | I        | Long Plain      |               |                   |                         |                             | 4760/2859    |\n| 294             | Teddy Meeches   | 14  | I        |                 |               |                   |                         |                             |            |\n| 295             | William Meeches | 13  | I        |                 |               |                   |                         |                             |            |\n| 296             | David Perwane   | 10  | I        |                 |               |                   |                         |                             |            |\n| 297             | Kenneth Peters  | 10  | I        |                 |               |                   |                         |                             |            |\n| 298             | Gordon Nelson   | 9   | I        | Roseau          |               |                   |                         |                             |            |\n| 299             | Dauphin Myerion | 9   | I        | Long Plain      |               |                   |                         |                             |            |\n| 300             | Alfred A.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No.2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is calculated by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Portage la Prairie School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal L. M. Lea\n\nDated January 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No.2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Portage la Prairie School for the Quarter ended December 1943.\n\nPrincipal: John A. McNeill\n\nDated: January 6th 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFormat No. L.A. 403\nReg.

It is now completed except the slate blackboard and this is expected along shortly.\n\nIt is a very fine class-room and is well built. When it was 36 below with a heavy wind, and the Collegiate over town had to send the children home because they could not heat the West rooms, we could keep the new class-room warm without opening up the furnace.\n\nI have never seen a finer room, it is finished in B.C. fir and the boards were all thoroughly sandpapered by the school boys and stained and rubbed. Everyone who come say that it is the most beautiful little class-room they have seen.\n\nThe basement is fitted up with a store room for new clothing 24x12, a bed room 12x12, and a good wood work room where we can do our special repair work in winter.\n\nWe are all delighted with it and it is going to be economical as the extra expense is the coal only, which will not run over $125.00 a year. We are experiencing no difficulty going to and fro with the children. I believe the little run and the fresh air they get will be beneficial to them.\n\nWe wish to thank the Department and to say that we are very much delighted with this gift and would ask to have our gratitude expressed to your architect, Mr. R.Gurney Orr for his splendid plan and for his advice in all matters regarding the building process.\n\nIt was most interesting and instructive to me and to the boys who helped, wherever possible, in the work.\n\nI am, Very truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nIndian Affairs.

This seems a lot of money for an addition to a new barn. Would you give me particulars of the information you got regarding what is required? I hesitate to discuss this matter with the Agent, without knowing what the Department have promised. It looks to me as if it is an entirely new barn, judging from the amount of money that is asked for.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nB.C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMay 14, 1924.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to the addition required to the Portage la Prairie School barn, I beg to say that the present barn was built for this school at a time when the farm consisted of 56 acres, and now it comprises 176 acres.\n\nMr. Hendry, the Principal, desires accommodation for forty or fifty more head of cattle. This would require an addition to the present building of forty or fifty feet. I think Mr. Hendry would be willing to undertake the work, providing he was supplied with the materials and one or two competent carpenters.\n\nIt would be well for you to communicate with him and ascertain in detail what he requires.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th inst., #127-1-5, with reference to an addition to the barn at Portage la Prairie School.\n\nI note that the Principal desires accommodation for 40 or 50 head of cattle. Surely this must be a mistake. He cannot possibly keep 40 or 50 head of cattle at this institution, and if he could it is, in my opinion, altogether too many and the Department should not be asked to provide accommodation for this number.\n\nWe have just completed a barn at the Qu'Appelle School, which is possibly three times as big as Portage, and it is to accommodate 30 head of stock and I do not think we should carry much more than this number of stock at Portage.\n\nIn taking this matter up with Mr. Christianson, who was at the Portage la Prairie School a short time ago, his recollection is that they have about 32 head of stock now and that they have accommodation for this number.\n\nMight I ask if the Principal of the School or the chief authorities have been given to understand that $8000 will be expended at this School this year on a barn. If they have I fear they will be dissatisfied if this amount is not spent there.\n\nD. C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI note that you suggest Mr. Hendry would be willing to undertake the work, provided he is supplied with material and two competent carpenters. I do not think this is the idea to hand over the work to Mr. Hendry or to any other School Principal. It is to try and get the work done as economically as possible and take the responsibility ourselves for the expenditure of the money.\n\nI have no intention of handing over the work to Mr. Hendry for direction or supervision unless I am so instructed by you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner\nMay 31, 1924.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Commissioner Graham's letter relative to barn accommodation at the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School, I wish to draw to your attention that the Rev. Mr. Hendry has successfully conducted this institution for some years and without doubt is in a position to know exactly what he requires for the satisfactory conduct of the school. I understand that the school management is discontinuing the major portion of the grain production and is desirous of conducting a stock farm. The position of the school on the outskirts of the city leads me to believe that such a programme would be wise.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nJune 7, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of May 21st, with reference to the proposed addition to the barn at the Portage la Prairie school.\n\nI understand that the management of the school is discontinuing the major portion of the grain production and is desirous of conducting a stock farm. You may confer with Principal Hendry on this matter. As he is a competent Principal and has operated the institution successfully for a number of years, he will no doubt be able to give good reasons for his desire to have greater barn accommodation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nIn a letter dated the 3rd of July from W. A. Hendry, Principal of the Portage School, he informs me that last winter he had to plug two of the school boiler flues for leaks. He wrote to the boiler inspector for the Province to come and look over the boiler, and he was there a short time before he wrote. The result of the inspection is that new flues will have to be placed in the boiler.\n\nI wrote to him asking for an approximate cost for having the work done and I am in receipt of a reply from him today, enclosing a copy of a quotation from the Link Manufacturing Company of Portage la Prairie, in which he advises that it will cost $940.96 to re-flue this boiler.\n\nI read this quotation to the Regina Foundry Company here, who do that kind of work, and they informed me that they would do the work in the City of Regina for $540.00, a difference of $400. It looks to me as if there is a wide difference here. This work should not be given to Mr. Hendry to have done until we thoroughly investigate and get prices from different firms.\n\nThere is no doubt the work has got to be done, and it should be done now.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Scott.\n\nA letter has been received from Mr. Graham in which he stated that the Principal of the Portage la Prairie School has advised him that new flues are required in the boiler at the Portage la Prairie School.\n\nAs it is important that the repairs to the boiler be made during the summer, I beg to recommend that Mr. Graham be authorized to have this work done, the cost of which will be approximately $600.\n\nARCHITECT.\nOttawa, August 6, 1924.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo, No. 208-11A, with reference to the repairs required to the heating boiler at the Portage la Prairie school, and in reply to say that you are authorized to have the necessary repairs made before the winter sets in.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.

Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI wish to inform you that on my last visit to Manitoba I called at the Portage la Prairie School, and while there I saw that some interior painting was very necessary, as the ceilings and walls have not been painted since 1915. I would therefore ask for an expenditure of $350.00 to do this work.\n\nThere are also considerable minor repairs to be made around the school, and buildings, and also some work in connection with plumbing for the winter. I would think that there would probably be a week's work for a carpenter, and the same amount of time for a plumber. There will be a little material to buy in connection with this repair work also. This will not amount to much. I would like to have your authority by wire to go on with this work on account of the season being advanced, and I wish to get this work finished before the cold weather sets in.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M.

The school classes had not resumed; however, I saw several of the children who appeared to be quite healthy. The interior of this building requires re-painting at once, especially the kitchen and dining room, in fact all rooms in the basement and on the second floor. I have today written to you specially on this matter, asking for authority to have the work done. While in Winnipeg I arranged with the Vulcan Iron works to go at once and re-flue the heating plant at this institution; I was able to save about $400.00 by placing the order where I did; The price quoted by the Portage firm was altogether too high.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\n29th September ....1924\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to ask authority to employ a carpenter, for about 12 days, to do odd jobs in the Portage la Prairie Residential School, such as repairing and building clothes closets etc., The Carpenter's charge is 75\u00a2 per hour. Also to employ a plumber about 7 days to repair the water pipes etc. The Plumber's charge $1.00 per hour.\n\nIt is necessary to have these repairs done before the winter sets in.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst.

In this connection I have to inform you that Mr. Commissioner Graham, early in September last, requested authority to have some interior painting performed and to engage the services of a carpenter and plumber. He was granted authority to expend the sum of $450 for interior painting and minor repairs.

We could\nthen use the space now occupied by the\nPrincipal for school purposes. This would\npermit of an attendance of 130. Mr. Hendry\nreports that he has had to refuse admittance\nof children from several reserves for the past\nfour or five years. If the Government will\ngrant this request for $6000 Mr. Hendry hopes\nin a short time to be able to take care of the\nenlargement of the barn out of school funds.\n| Description                                      | Quantity | Unit   | Total   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|----------|--------|---------|\n| Retubing Boiler at the Indian School Portage La Prairie |          |        |         |\n| Tubes 4\" x 14'0\"                                | 52       |        |         |\n| as per Estimate                                 |          |        |         |\n| Manhole Gaskets #4                              | 2        |        | 630.00  |\n\nIndian Affairs.

Everything in connection with this institution was in shape and I never saw the place look better. There were 35 harvesting and excellent crops and Mr. Henry, the Principal informed me that he expected to thresh about 6,000 bushels of grain. The summerfallow gardens etc., and the premises in general, are a credit to any institution.\n\nThe outside buildings have all been painted this summer by the school boys and the work has been well done. Considerable painting has also been done in the interior of the school. The repair work to the balconies, etc. that was authorized while you were in Ottawa has not been done yet but the Principal informed me that he expected Mr. Hamilton, who does any carpenter work of that kind around the school, to arrive in a few days. The only expenditure necessary at the present time is the following:\n\nA ventilating system was put in the barn last year with one ventilator on the roof; we find this is not sufficient, another one should be placed there to insure proper ventilation. This will cost about $40.00. Mr. Henry also asked to be supplied with 20 gals. of paint and 5 gals. of oil to do some inside decorating during the winter. Some of the steps in the stairs should also be replaced as a few of them are practically worn out. Mr. Henry will have these replaced if he is furnished with the material. There is about 14 steps that need replacing. I would ask that this expenditure be allowed.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

Graham.\nIndian Commissioner.\nThe United Church of Canada\nBoard of Home Missions\n\nToronto, Nov. 15, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have an application from the Woman's Missionary Society of the United Church of Canada for the enlargement of the Portage La Prairie Indian Residential School which has been under the management of the W.M.S. of the former Presbyterian Church.\n\nThe suggestion is made that the Government Architect prepare a plan for the proposed enlargement. I am informed that there is a waiting list of over thirty pupils who would attend the Portage La Prairie School if there was accommodation for them. The matter of enlargement, I understand, has been under consideration for some years, and it would be very gratifying if an appropriation could be made for this purpose in the near future.\n\nTrusting you will give it your favourable consideration,\n\nI am,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nC.E.

F. Lisson, Tinsmith of Portage la Prairie, Man. This expenditure represents the purchase of a ventilator for the barn at the Portage la Prairie Residential School.\n\nA ventilating system was installed in the stable in 1925, but it was found during the winter that one ventilator was not sufficient, that it was necessary to have two. Mr. Hendry, the Principal, therefore had this put in last summer before the barn was filled with hay. At the time this work was under way, Inspector Christianson was at the school and Mr. Hendry asked him if it was possible for the Department to pay this bill, but stated that if they could not see their way clear to do so, he intended paying it out of the school funds. The Inspector mentioned in his report dated August 24th, 1926, that a ventilator was necessary.\n\nI would therefore recommend this voucher for payment, as the Department are very seldom called upon to pay for extra expenditures at this institution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

As usual, things were in excellent shape there; I never saw them any better. They have just completed seeding operations, and the gardens and farm were in first class condition. The grounds were also clean and tidy, and everything around the place bore evidence of good management.\n\nThe children all seemed bright and happy and were looking forward to their holidays.\n\nThe buildings are also well kept. The only matter that I wish to bring to the Department's attention is that the outside woodwork on the school has not been painted since it was built. This should be provided for in the estimates this year. Mr. Hendry informed me that he had obtained a price, a couple of years ago, for this work of $800.00; it probably can be done for less than that. The dining room tables need new tops as they are in bad shape, and I would suggest that these be factory made with a Linoleum top. They should be supplied this year.\n\nPortage la Prairie Residential School (Cont'd)\n\nyear, if possible, as they are badly needed. There are nine tables in all.

The upper part of the lavatories are pretty well used up and I believe it would be better to have them installed complete.\n\nI wish this matter could be taken up with the Department as soon as possible as we cannot keep the odor down and the lavatories and constantly overflowing on the floor.\n\nI am, Very truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

The chemicals are invaluable in case of a fire just beginning as the boys can use them with dispatch.\n\n5- The chimneys of the school should be cleaned which require an expert cleaner since they are difficult to get at.\n\n6- There should be a fire alarm box in the school which would ring individually to the Fire Dept of the City.

You may also purchase four fire axes for the dormitories and arrange to have the chimneys at the school cleaned. No unnecessary expense should be incurred.\n\nThe Department is ordering two 2\u00bd gallon chemical fire extinguishers.\n\nYou may ascertain the cost of a fire alarm box in the school, so that the city fire department would be called immediately. If such cost is inconsiderable, arrange the installation at once; if expensive, you should telegraph a recommendation with estimate.\n\nYou should immediately secure prices on the two proposed additional fire escapes for the ends of the building, to be placed towards the front in each case.

I have instructed the Principal to have these ladders built, as I did not consider it worth while waiting for special authority.\n\n2. I have not done anything regarding this item, but I think fire escapes should be provided at the front of the building, and with your authority I will have this done.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nIn regard to the question of fire protection in the residential school at Portage la Prairie, I have received a letter from the Principal stating that the School is outside the City limits and on that account the Fire Department is technically under no obligation to protect the school, and to consent to the placing of a special fire alarm would be an acknowledgement of an obligation. On the other hand, however, the City Fire Department is willing to help in any way possible if a fire should break out, and it is the Principal's opinion, in which I concur, that it would be as well to leave conditions in this respect as they now exist and depend on the City to supply the hose for the outside hydrants if and when the occasion arises. I have written to the Principal asking him to endeavor to procure prices on fire escapes of the chute type, and when I receive this information I will at once communicate with you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nPortage la Prairie, Man.,\nNovember 8th 1927\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your Telegram of the 5th instant, I have not been able to get an Estimate on the Installing of the Fire Alarm into the Portage la Prairie Residential School.\n\nI have taken the matter up several times with the Chief of the Fire Brigade, but as yet cannot get anything definite. I think where the trouble is, the Chief does not want to take the responsibility of going out to the school in case of fire.\n\nAs soon as I can get anything definite from the Chief I will report to Mr. Commissioner Graham.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, November 12th, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant with further reference to fire protection at the Portage La Prairie Indian Residential School. I have learned that you will not be successful in arranging with the Fire Brigade for the installation of a fire alarm box at the institution. Further, I understand that Mr. Commissioner Graham is in correspondence direct with the Reverend Principal with reference to prices on additional fire escapes. It will not be necessary for you to take further action re these matters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6273, file 583-5, part 4)\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant #127-1-5 with reference to the matter of providing a residence for a married Farming Instructor at the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School. I think that a residence for a married man is very necessary at this institution, and would strongly recommend that an amount of, say $5000.00, be placed in the Estimates for this purpose. This institution is doing excellent work, particularly along farming lines, and I should be glad to see the Church's request granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nReferring to your letter of the 10th October last, in which you informed me that prices on fire escapes for the Portage Indian Residential School would be forwarded to this office, my letter of Nov. 1st, advising you that these prices had not come to hand, and your subsequent letter of the 5th instant, I beg to say that there has been some considerable delay in getting the proper data before the Department.\n\nRegarding fire escapes, there are three styles, viz:- the ordinary tread fire escape, with a rail, such as we have been using at most of our schools, the sliding pole escape, such as is used in fire halls and at some of our schools, and then there is the spiral chute, which, in my opinion, is the safest and most satisfactory, but which, unfortunately, costs about twice as much as the iron tread fire escape, the price being from $55.00 to $60.00 a foot. This is a complete cylinder with a door at the bottom which automatically flies open when the children come down. This chute will take four or five children abreast and, in fact, there can be a continuous stream of children coming down from one, two or three floors. The price which I have quoted per foot is for the escape erected. The sliding pole is, in my opinion, the next best. We would have to erect steel platforms at each flat, and instead of the children being asked to go out of a window there should be doors cut. The cost for the pole would probably be less than $1.00 per foot and the platforms would possibly cost in the neighborhood of $150.00. I do not think that the ordinary tread escapes are at all satisfactory.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nsatisfactory where there are small children, and especially where we have a high building.\n\nNotwithstanding the cost, I would strongly recommend that we place two of the spiral chutes at the Portage School and two at the Elkhorn School. The order can be placed with the Vulcan Iron Works, of Winnipeg.\n\nWhen I was at Lebret some time ago the Sisters expressed great fear of using the tread escapes, especially in the case of the smaller children. I am sorry now that we did not supply the spiral chutes there also.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nNovember 26, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 308-11A P. of the 17th instant, with reference to fire escapes at the Portage Indian Residential School. The cost of the separate chute is so high, that I believe we should equip with the sliding pole type with suitable platforms at each floor level. I note that you consider these are the next best. You may make immediate arrangements for the installation of two of this type at the Portage School and two at Slikhorn. You should make the best possible arrangements and see that they are placed where they will be most efficient.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nIn Mr. Christianson's report, dated 25th June last, of his visit to the Portage la Prairie School, forwarded under cover of my letter of the 14th of July, he referred to the condition of the tops of the dining room tables, nine in number, and to the necessity of having new tops provided. The condition of these table tops was again brought to his attention on the occasion of his recent visit, and I would recommend that new factory made tops should be provided, with linoleum coverings.

If any couplings, etc., are required, the same should also be supplied. The Principal should see that this new hose is tested from time to time if possible to overcome the danger of it becoming rotted.\n\nAn account, in duplicate, in the usual manner should be forwarded covering the cost of the new hose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The crop was lighter than usual, but the average of all grains was about 22 bushels to the acre, which I think was better than anything in the vicinity of Portage la Prairie and shows that the farming is properly done at this institution, and the fields are in excellent shape.\n\nThere were 97 children in the school. I understand the grant is only for 90, which means that they have seven who are not grant-earning pupils. Mr. Hendry informed me that he had the room for them and for all it cost to keep them he would rather have a few over than under.\n\nWhile there I went thoroughly into the matter of fire protection. There are three floors in the school, viz:- the basement, which is only two or three feet below the ground level, the second floor, about six feet above the ground level, and the third floor which is thirteen feet above the second floor and about eighteen or nineteen feet from the ground. On the second and third floors there is\nthere is a wide hall which runs the full length of the building down the centre. There are four dormitories on the third floor where the children sleep, and there are staff rooms on this floor as well. There are two fire extinguishers on each floor, as well as fire axes and two reel hose, making six lengths of hose in all. I tested the hose and found them to be rotten and useless, as they have been in the building for fourteen years. The six 2\u00bd gallon fire extinguishers were in good shape. In case of fire the means for the children to get out would be either by the stairs located at each end of the hall leading down to the second floor, or by way of the fire escape which consists of a sliding pole leading from the back balcony to the balcony of the second floor and from thence descending by two ladders to the ground, which is only a distance of six or seven feet. The only improvement that I could suggest would be fire escapes leading from the two front dormitories to the ground. The Principal considers that one would be ample, but if any are supplied the type which he desires to have is a chute. I have drawn a sketch of the floor where the dormitories are located, in order to give you a better idea of the situation. The Fire Chief from Portage went over the building, and his remark to the Principal was that he did not have very much to worry about so far as fire escapes were concerned.\n\nThe building is of brick construction and every precaution is taken by Mr. Hendry and the staff to avert a fire. On a cold night when big fires are on Mr. Hendry stays up until one or two\nuntil one or two o'clock in the morning, and the fireman sleeps in the hall just outside of the furnace room. The staff, as well as the children, have been trained regarding what to do in case of fire, and with the children all in bed the Principal can get them to put on sufficient clothing and get them out of the building in less than two minutes. The only difficulty would be in case a fire started in the boiler room which is located near the balcony where the sliding pole terminates. In that case that avenue would be cut off and they would have to use the stairs. The Fire Chief from Portage thought that putting a chute from one of the dormitory windows, as marked on the enclosed sketch, would make it absolutely safe, as this is the corner farthest from the boiler room.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., December 17th, 1927\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith Inspector Christianson's report on the various schools in the Portage la Prairie Agency.\n\nYou will note what the Inspector says regarding the Swan Lake Day School. I should be glad if the Department would authorize an expenditure of $12.00 to supply a flag-pole at this school. I think it is a splendid thing to have flags at all our schools. All rural schools in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta fly the flag during school hours. Once the grounds are cleared up it will be the duty of the teacher and the pupils to see that they are kept in proper order.\n\nRegarding the Dog Creek Day School, I cannot recommend the building of a new school and teacher's residence at this point. I am not in favour of Day Schools, and I think the time will come when we will have to put these children in Boarding Schools.\n\nThe report deals at length with the system of fire protection at the Portage Boarding School. I may say that we have now authorized the Principal to go ahead and have two sliding pole escapes erected, one at each end of the building, and when this is done the children will be amply protected against fire. Mr. Hendry runs a very satisfactory institution and is little trouble to this office or the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C.

No. 208-11A P. I beg to say that The Link Manufacturing Company are sending you drawings and prices on both Pole and Chute fire escapes. They think the pole of no use in cold weather with small children. They are the only concern that I could find that cared to put up the fire escape. I asked Cadman's Babb and Burns but they did not seem interested in the matter.\n\nThe Fire Chief does not think much of a pole fire escape and says it is for inside and summer service and would be of no use for the small children in winter.\n\nThe Provincial Fire Inspector visited the school and went thro all fire equipment thoroughly and got the children together to see how old they were and the problem we would have to meet in getting them out. He also is much opposed to a Pole and says you simply could not put the small children down a thirty foot pole in cold weather, and he says we would be better not to depend on it at all in winter, but have our fire drill for the other exits.\n\nWe are far better fixed than most institutions so far as being able to get out and I am taking no chances in winter as I am having a man sleep in the hall between the kitchen and the fire room until the 1st. of April.\n\nI am, Very truly yours,\n\n(Sgd.)

I am enclosing herewith copy of a letter from the Principal dealing with the subject.\n\nIn view of this I would ask if you do not think it advisable to go ahead with the chutes, instead of the poles?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan G. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 3, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your 208-11A P. of the 23rd ultimo, with reference to fire escapes at the Portage Indian Residential School. In view of the fact that the Fire Chief from Portage is reported as saying the Principal did not have very much to worry about as far as fire escapes were concerned, it is believed that the Department should give very careful consideration before arranging for the installation of chutes, the cost of which you have estimated at $55 per foot. However, if you are of the opinion that the fire escape provision is not adequate, if you will let me have a further report, I will reconsider the matter.\n\nI am also directed to acknowledge and thank you for your 208-11 of the 17th ultimo, enclosing Mr. Inspector Christianson's report on the Indian schools in the Portage agency. Any matters requiring attention will be the subjects for other communications.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M.

He suggests that in view of this, it might be advisable to erect a chute, the price of which is about $600 per foot.\n\nSince writing on that date, I have received a letter from the Link Manufacturing Company of Portage la Prairie offering to erect another form of chute with the necessary platform at a cost of $185.00. This latter is an open metal chute made of galvanized steel, running from the storey above to the ground at an angle of forty-five degrees. This is bolted to the wall by steel brackets and includes the provision and erection of a steel platform outside the door or window of the storey from which the chute commences.\n\nIf you have not already written me in reply to my letter of the 23rd ultimo, I think it might be well to give consideration to the erection of the chute above described at both the schools mentioned. Will you please let me hear from you, as I think some action should be taken as soon as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan G. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt.

It is true that a farmer's residence is required at the Portage School; but I regret that I was unable to include an item in the Estimates for this year. I am quite hopeful that next summer the work can be undertaken. This year, we are doing some painting and are replacing the dining room tables at this school.\n\nI was very glad to get your report on the work of Mr. and Mrs. Ross at the Round Lake School. I have given considerable thought to the question of an addition; but the condition of the main building there is such that I am not satisfied with the proposal. Last month I had some correspondence with Dr. Manning regarding Round Lake, and it is our intention to discuss the future progress for this school the first time he is in Ottawa. Of course, no building activity will be undertaken this year. Mr. Commissioner Graham, of Regina, has recently been authorised to provide a root house, to fix up the fire escapes and to effect other minor improvements.

The Representative of the Manitoba Bridge and Iron Works at Regina was not able to furnish me with complete particulars in regard to the erection of the desired type, and I, therefore, on a visit to Winnipeg called at the Company's office and arranged that they should send a representative to the school to look over the type of building and give me a price on the erection of the fire escapes. This they did and I enclose with the voucher their letter of the 1st February last. You will note, however, on referring to the voucher that the escapes were actually erected for less than the amount which they quoted. The clause in their quotation letter referring to performing other work on a cost plus 10% basis had reference to fixing up the walls of the building after the erection of the fire escapes; such as, replastering etc., and a voucher covering these extras will be forwarded to you when I have received from the Company a more detailed statement of their account, which amounts to approximately $60.00.

The Principal states that it would be more satisfactory to have the painting done by tender, as the cornice work is very high, and the men who do painting by the day in Portage la Prairie have not the equipment for such work. The above are the only two firms who have the necessary equipment.\n\nAs this work should be carried out as soon as possible, I would request that the necessary authority be obtained from Council at an early date.\n\nFunds for the purpose are provided in the appropriation for Indian Education for the present fiscal year.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Curtis advised me that he would expect to be paid 75\u00a2 an hour and was prepared to work a ten hour day and use as much school help as possible.

Mr. Peter Hancock, Carpenter, has made an examination and estimates that it will be necessary to cut from two to four inches from the base of each of eight posts and reset them back in place with base and cap to restore the columns to the proper length. The cost will be $35.00 each, inclusive, or $280.00 for the eight posts. This building is Department property, and I beg to recommend that authority be granted to have the work done at once. The amount seems high for replacing four inches on each column, but a great deal of labour will be involved in jacking up the veranda and removing and replacing the columns.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

It is considered, however, that the cost is rather high and that a price should be obtained from another competent carpenter with a view to having the work done at less cost than that quoted by Peter Hancock. The work should be completed, if possible, before the extreme cold weather sets in.\n\nThe Department will leave the matter with you, to make the best arrangements possible to have the repairs carried out and at the lowest cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst.

The oil absorbs into the shingle and the paint remains like dust on the shingle. The Sherman-Willism took a shingle to Winnipeg and found that by using a filler they can be painted satisfactorily but there is another grave difficulty etc., the shingles being exposed to the weather so long are very brittle and crack when one walks on them and the painters tell me that it would cause many more leaks and there are surely enough of them now. The roof leaks badly in at least thirty places.\n\nThe Cadham Company say that they deduct the amount they allowed in the estimate for the painting of the asbestos shingles, $40.00 or will put the same amount of paint on the bark roofs if the Department think as they do that it is very unwise to paint the asbestos shingles.\n\nI shall be very glad to hear from the Department and to know what they think about the matter.\n\nI am, Very truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nIndian Affairs.

To mark our continued success, a special drive is being made for new members and your share of this effort will be to hand the extra copy of your report to a likely prospect (lady or gentleman), together with a word of explanation and advice.\n\nThis having been attended to, come to the annual meeting (see report for place and date) where the movement on foot to make insurance available at $750 or $1000 is to be discussed and encouraged by your presence there those who are carrying on the Society's business in your behalf. The Publicity Committee, who are sending you this circular, while not expressing any opinion as to the desirability or otherwise of the proposed increase in benefits, do particularly stress the importance of obtaining new members on the principle of extending the Society's advantages to the greatest possible number.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Publicity Committee.\nPORTAGE LA PRAIRIE BOARDING SCHOOL.\n\nAs usual, everything at this institution was in first-class shape. I have visited this school a number of times and I have never been able to find any room for criticism regarding the manner in which the work is carried on. I went over the outbuildings and everything was in order. In the stable I found a very fine herd of Holstein cows, seven of which were milking and some more were to freshen in a short time, so the children are getting all the milk they require. Both horses and cattle were in the very best of shape, and the stable and surroundings spotlessly clean. An excellent crop was harvested last fall, so the financial standing of the school is in splendid shape. I also visited the classrooms and saw all the children and I must say that I never saw them looking better. They all appeared well and happy and so far, since the holidays there has been practically no sickness of any kind in the school. The building itself is in splendid condition, and the same remark applies to all the machinery around the school, as if anything goes out of order it is immediately repaired. In going through the dormitories I noted that the beds were not in keeping with the rest\n\n-of the-\nof the school, and in lifting the mattresses on the beds I found that the springs had been covered by sewing quilts around them. The Principal advised me that this had to be done in order to keep them together. I was then informed that the beds were about thirty years old, and most of them had been brought over from the old school. Mr. Hendry expressed the hope that the Department could see their way clear to supply him with new beds in the near future, and in view of the fact that the Department is put to very little extra expense in connection with this school I would ask that, if at all possible, new beds be supplied. If the Department have not sufficient funds in this year's Estimates, probably they could be furnished after the 31st. March.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a report of an inspection of the Indian Residential School at the Portage la Prairie agency, and also the Day School at Swan Lake by Mr. Inspector Christianson.\n\nThe Day School at Swan Lake is doing good work and the attendance up to the time of the 'flu epidemic was excellent. An average attendance of 21 and 22 out of an enrollment of 25 is certainly splendid. You will notice that the grounds which were reported to be in rather bad shape at the time of the last inspection have been cleared up and an effort is being made to put a proper fence around the school. I think the Department might authorize them to spend $40.00 with which to purchase the posts required.\n\nIt is always pleasing to read a report on the Portage la Prairie Boarding School. This institution is doing first-class work and the Department is fortunate in having a man like Mr. Hendry in charge. It is a credit to the Department. The children are well fed, well clothed and are receiving a first-class training. There is just one matter that I wish to draw your attention to and that is the condition of the beds. It seems to me it would be an encouragement to Mr. Hendry, as well as a pleasant surprise, if the Department were to see fit to supply him with new beds.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nbeds. Beds that have been in use for thirty years in an institution of this kind have served their time. I am particularly anxious that this school should always present a good appearance. It is in rather a public place and they always have a number of visitors, and people get a better impression if everything is up-to-date. With your permission I shall take steps to get prices and see what can be done.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nFebruary 6, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 208-11 of the 29th ultimo, enclosing Mr. Inspector Christianson's report on the Fortage la Prairie Indian Residential School. I am very pleased to learn that this school is continuing its good work. I note that the beds have been in use for 30 years and are in need of replacement. You may purchase new ones, after getting prices from the Simons and Ives Companies, who have branch offices at Winnipeg. It might be advisable to ascertain what size Mr. Hendry would like.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nW. M.

Nothing was said about this matter during 1928, and when the Estimates for 1929-30 were sent in the request was not repeated. After receiving your letter of the 6th instant informing me that the money was available, I prepared a plan and submitted it to the Rev. Principal and I am surprised to learn from him now that the building is not required at the present time. He states that the two young men on his staff are single, and not likely to be married, and that if the building were put up now it would probably remain idle for two or three years. Of course, under these circumstances it would be absurd to build. Mr. Hendry goes on to say that Mrs. Hendry is in very poor health and that it will be necessary for her to leave the main building before long on account of the constant noise. For this reason he would like to get a Principal's residence at some future date, perhaps next year. I think that a Principal's residence should be erected and that an amount to provide for this should be placed in the Estimates. $4,000.00, of course, would not begin to build a house for the Principal, and I am making a note to have the proper amount inserted in the Estimates.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

I was in Portage la Prairie, and at the time I was under the impression that a residence would be built. I had plans in my wallet of a house that I thought would be suitable, and I showed them to the builders. No one was put to any expense, no contract was let, and I do not understand why your telegram was sent.\n\nI may add that there is no place in the country where there is more urgent need of a Principal's residence than at this point, and I am still hoping that the Department will find funds to erect one.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan C.

Scott,\nSupt., of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, ONTARIO.\n\nDear Doctor:\n\nSince I came back I find a rather extraordinary condition in connection with the house at the Indian School here.\n\nMr. Graham had apparently made all arrangements for the building and construction of the house, he had a plan for same and called for tenders and the contract has been let for the supply of lumber to the Corona Lumber Company and for the construction of the house to Peter Hancock, and they expected to start work immediately and were ready to move on to the place when they received instructions to hold up staging pending further word from Regina. I think Mr. Graham has been up in the North Country or Lake Winnipeg for the past week. This, however, places us in a very awkward position as both of these parties are reliable insofar as Contracts are concerned, and the Contractor especially has been holding his men for the purpose of going on to this job as he was told it would be done at once. I would appreciate it if you would take this matter up with Mr. Graham with a view to finding out the exact situation, and while I was inclined to\nfavour non-construction of this building until a detailed plan and specification had been prepared, in view of the labour situation and in view of the fact of the contracts being signed in good faith I am inclined to suggest that they be carried out. You will realize the difficulty it puts me in and if information had been sent to your office as to the exact conditions my viewpoint would have been entirely different. What I was afraid of was the work would be started improperly on day labour without competent supervision and perhaps without proper protection to the Department for costs.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE. A.

I had Mr. Babb, Plumber, Portage la Prairie inspect the plumbing and here-with inclose his report on same. I had Mr. Hancock, Contractor, Portage la Prairie inspect the stairs referred to and his price for the repair including material is $28.00. At the time of my visit, I noticed that the outside porch is in very poor shape, this porch was erected 16 years ago, and I thought it advisable to have the contractor give a price on the material and erection of a new porch. His price for this work is $29.00. I would advise that the stairs are in a dangerous condition and are liable to break down if extra weight is put upon them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst.

The quotation which you forwarded for the repairing of the children's toilets was also received.\n\nThe Department will approve of your arranging to have the toilets repaired, as per the quotation which you forwarded, also the steps from the children's playrooms, and for the erection of a new outside porch. The total cost of the above work should not exceed the estimate as given by you in each case. The above work should be completed at an early date.

Of course, I realize that this will add to the total expense of carrying on the School, as we shall immediately be faced with the necessity of engaging a Matron. However, I am personally quite impressed with the value of Mr. Hendry's services and I am very anxious to retain him if it is at all possible. They have, I think, borne their full share of the burden for us and the Department by their willingness to reside in the school with all the noise and confusion for so many years.\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba,\nApril 15th, 1931.\n\nSir;\n\nI beg to advise you that the roof of the Portage la Prairie Residential School, is now in such condition that temporary repairs are very necessary, otherwise the water will effect the plaster. This matter was taken up with the Superintendent General, at the time of his visit to the school, also with Mr Inspector Hamilton on his recent visit to the school. The cost of the temporary repair work would be in the neighbourhood of $100.00. Will you please advise in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 21, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, informing the Department that repairs are required to the roof of the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School building, the cost of which will be approximately $100.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of the expenditure required, but no unnecessary expense should be incurred, and the total cost should not, if possible, exceed the amount stated above.\n\nAfter the work has been completed, please forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred in carrying out temporary repairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\nPORTAGE LA PRAIRIE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nThe junior classroom is separate from the main building, and is a well equipped classroom. Miss Crockett is the teacher in charge, and the grades are as follows:\n\nGrade I - 25\n\" II - 15\n\nThe children do splendid work, and were bright and attentive.\n\nMiss Havard has the senior pupils, and the classroom is in the main part of the building. There are 53 on the roll, and the grades are ranged as follows:\n\nGrade III - 4\n\" IV - 11\n\" V - 22\n\" VI - 10\n\" VII - 6\nTotal - 53\n\nThese children were well along in their grades, and spoke out clearly. They do excellent writing, and are fairly good in spelling, arithmetic, and English. I consider that Miss Havard is doing good work.\n\nThe pupils were all well clothed, and were neat and clean in appearance.\n\nThe dormitories were all well aired, and the beds were neatly made. The toilets were all in working order and clean.\n\nThe work in the laundry, sewing room, and kitchen is supervised by members of the staff, and I believe the children receive excellent training. The work was in progress in the various departments, and was being done in a quiet\nPORTAGE LA PRAIRIE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\na quiet and orderly manner.\n\nThe children, I believe, are well fed with plenty of vegetables and meat. They receive puddings made from bread and rice, also stewed fruits, and are given tea to drink, and milk when obtainable. Porridge is served for breakfast.\n\nThe fire equipment was in excellent condition, and I was informed by the Principal that fire drill is observed weekly. Water is secured from Portage la Prairie, so that the pressure is good at all times.\n\nThe walls are cracked in places, and the plaster is lifting from the lath. This is due to the leaky roof, which allows the rain to penetrate in many places.\n\n...to be remedied for the present, but no doubt will need to be renewed later.\n\nAt present only 10 cows are kept, 5 of which were fresh. Due to T.B., it was necessary to dispose of all the cattle at this school, and the present herd was selected wherever possible in order that milk could be provided for the school.\n\nAbout 100 rock hens are kept. The poultry house is in fair repair, but lacks light. More windows should be provided.\n\nThe horses were all in good condition, and considerable feed remained, especially for the cattle. The silo was half full of excellent corn silage.\n\nThe outbuildings were all in good repair, and I found the barns and yards tidy.\n\nThe school appeared to be well staffed, and the condition of the school and surroundings would indicate that the...\nPORTAGE LA PRAIRIE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nthat the various members understand their work and are obtaining results.\n\nMr. Hendry, the Principal, is keen and alert to conditions existing about the school, and is a good manager. I would not, however, overlook Mrs. Hendry, who acts as matron, and to whom, I believe, a large amount of credit is due for the spirit and harmony which exists throughout the building.\nRegina, Sask., April 28, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the various schools in the Portage la Prairie and Manitowapah Agencies. This report was made by Mr. Inspector Hamilton, who was occupied from the 25th February to the 11th April in making an inspection of these two agencies.\n\nThe Portage la Prairie Residential School is up to its usual standard and good work is being done. The Inspector points out that the walls are cracked in places, and the plaster is lifting from the lath, due to a leaky roof which allows the rain to penetrate. There is nothing in the estimates for repairs excepting $400.00 to repair the verandah. Part or all of this amount might be used to repair the roof, as it is more important that the roof be cared for than the verandah, if only one of the two jobs can be done.\n\nOn the whole I would say that the report on these schools is very satisfactory.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, May 5, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to Mr. Inspector Hamilton's report on the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School, forwarded under cover of your No. 205-11 of the 28th ultimo, I have to say that Mr. Agent Waite drew the attention of the Department to the condition of the roof, stating that temporary repairs could be carried out for approximately $100. He was authorized to incur an expenditure not exceeding approximately this amount in repairing the roof in order to prevent damage to the walls and plaster.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. W. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nIndian Residential School,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.,\nMay 5th, 1931.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nDear Sirs:\u2014\n\nI beg to report that on May 2nd at 10.00 P.M. Miss Wakefield the cook had some grease in a pan in the oven and in some way it caught fire gave considerable trouble. As it happened I was only a short distance but they were going to use water and than the chemical to put it out. In either case they would have done more harm than good. No damage of any account was done, but I feel that if we had a small quart Pyrene chemical which can be used either on oil or wood in case of fire and is light and can be easily handled by the officer in charge would be a very valuable in the kitchen.\n\nI wonder if the Department would give us one of these quart Pyrene to be placed in the kitchen for just such a case as I have related.\n\nI am, Very truly yours,\n\nW. A. Hendry,\nPrint.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa, May 12, 1931.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have to request that you will forward, charges prepaid, addressed to Rev. W. A. Hendry, Indian Residential School, Portage la Prairie, Man., 1 - 1\u00bd Quart Pyrene fire extinguisher, complete with chemical charge and bracket for hanging same.\n\nYour account, in duplicate, covering the cost of the extinguisher, F.O.B. Portage la Prairie, should be forwarded to Rev.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, reporting a fire which occurred in the kitchen at the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School, and requesting that a small Pyrene extinguisher be supplied for use in the kitchen.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department is today placing an order with the Pyrene Mfg. Co. of Canada, Ltd., Toronto, to ship, charges prepaid, addressed to you, 1 - 1\u00bd Quart Pyrene extinguisher, complete with chemical and bracket for hanging same. This type of extinguisher is for use in case of fire occasioned by oils, greases, paints, etc., and is non-freezing.\n\nThe above Company are being requested to forward their account, in duplicate, to you covering the cost of the extinguisher F.O.B. Portage la Prairie. When you receive this equipment, if in good condition, you should certify the account in the usual manner and forward it to the Department, in order that payment can be made.\n\nYou should see that this extinguisher is placed in the kitchen where it will be easily accessible and ready for immediate use in case of fire.\n\nThe Department is pleased to note that the fire reported by you occasioned no serious damage.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Pierre\nDecorator\nDuring my recent visit to the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School, it was noticed that the walls in the boys playroom and several passages are in need of repair, the plaster being loose through the leaking roof. The roof has been satisfactorily repaired and I asked a local painter and decorator to give me a price on the work of repairing and painting. The main hall should be painted and there are a few repairs to the plaster required. The ceilings in two bedrooms and halls should be painted, as the paint on the metal ceiling is peeling. During my visit the Reverend Principal called my attention to some plumbing repairs which are very necessary also a number of repairs to radiators etc. I asked a plumber to give an estimate on the cost of these repairs, the detailed list and estimate of cost is inclosed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 30, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, relative to the repairs and plumbing required at the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School and forwarding quotations which you received for carrying out this work. In reply I have to say that the Department will approve of having the repairs required to the plaster carried out. As our funds this year are extremely limited, any painting and redecorating will have to be performed by the school authorities.\n\nWith reference to the plumbing repairs and repairs to radiators, as mentioned in the quotations which you forwarded from J. W. Ramsey, I have to request that you will state the more urgent repairs mentioned as being required at the present time. Could not the school authorities themselves do certain of the work? I have to request that you will forward an amended list of the plumbing repairs really urgent and which cannot be attended to by the school authorities themselves and give an estimate of the cost. It is necessary, this year, to limit all expenditure to the carrying out of the most urgent repairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ.

With this amount of income short and all the outlay fixed we can no more than carry on. The Church have no money so cannot put more into this work since cutting down all future expansion they cannot keep up the regular work in hand.\n\nI went over the plumbing and cut out every thing that could stand over, only repairs that have to be done if we are to operate the water system were left in the list. This list will be forwarded to you.\n\nWe can do the painting if the Department will supply the paint. It will require seven gallons of flat wall paint six gallons of Stone Buff and one gallon of Cream. We prefer the Sherman Williams Flat Wall paint as we seem to be able to work with it and get better results than with some of the others.\n\nI am, Very truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

Hendry went all over the plumbing work together and they inform me that any work which they think could be cut out for this year have been left off this list, the work herein mentioned will have to be done before the winter is out, and better work can be done at the present time than in the very cold weather.\n\nI also enclose letter from the Rev.

It is considered that, if the work was properly carried out, it should have lasted for a longer period than in the present case. You should, after consulting the Principal, decide the best arrangement to be made in overcoming the necessity of frequently repairing and renewing the brickwork.\n\nIf you are satisfied that the repairs are necessary at the present time, the Department will approve of you arranging to have the work done at a cost not to exceed approximately $50. If a good grade of fire brick is properly installed, there should not be the necessity of any further repairs for a considerable length of time. After the work is completed, proper care should be taken in operating the heating plant. Please forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred, in the carrying out of the repairs required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

February 10th, 1933.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI have the honour to submit the following report on the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School, inspected on January 19th & 20th, 1933.\n\nThe senior classroom is in the main building and is in charge of Miss R. Havard. The children are arranged in the following grades:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| IV    | 10     |\n| V     | 18     |\n| VI    | 13     |\n| VII   | 11     |\n\n52\n\nThe pupils are well along in the various grades and appear to thoroughly understand their work. The exercise books are all well kept and the work neatly set out. The children speak clearly and excellent discipline is maintained. The classroom is large, well lighted, and is kept well ventilated.\n\nThe junior classroom is located in a separate building situated some 200 ft. from the main residence. This building is heated by a furnace in the basement and I understand it is quite comfortable, even in the most severe weather. Miss E. Crockett is the teacher in charge, and the grades are arranged as follows:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| Beginners | 13 |\n| Grade I | 8 |\n| II | 9 |\n| III | 9 |\n\n39\n\nMiss Crockett appears greatly interested in her work and I would judge, from her manner and the way she presents the lessons.\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6273, file 583-5, part 4)\nPortage la Prairie Residential School (Cont'd.)\n\nthe lessons, that good results should be obtained.\n\nThe children in both classrooms were neatly dressed, especially the girls, and all were clean in appearance.\n\nThe kitchen is in the basement of the main building and Miss M. Wakefield is the matron in charge. The food all appeared well prepared and an effort is made to have it served as hot as possible. The meals served for one day during my inspection were as follows:\n\nBreakfast: Porridge, bread, jam, tea & milk.\nDinner: Potatoes, meat & gravy, bread, butter, water & tea.\nSupper: Potatoes, bread & jam, biscuits or cake, tea & milk.\n\nThe children were given all the bread they desired. I checked over the charts showing the weight of the children each month, and some of them have made excellent gains, which would indicate that they are at least receiving plenty of food.\n\nThe laundry is also in the basement of the building. It is well equipped with machinery, all of which appeared to be in excellent condition. Miss Findley is in charge of this department and also looks after the mending of the clothing.\n\nThe sewing room is supervised by Miss A. K. Robertson, and in this department the girls are taught to do all kinds of plain sewing and in most cases make all the dresses required.\n\nMiss J. Watson is the nurse and in addition to this work she supervises the care of the dormitories. At the time of my visit there were no children sick.\n\nThe dormitories\nPortage la Prairie Residential School (Cont'd.)\n\nThe dormitories were all well aired and very tidy in appearance. The toilets were in good working order and clean. The beds were neatly made and the bedding clean. The children are provided with nightgowns in which to sleep.\n\nThe fire escape from the dormitories is by way of the window, and although these are locked, in case of a fire, it would be a simple matter to break the window and step out on to the fire escape. Fire extinguishers are placed at various points throughout the building, and I understand from the Principal that fire drill is observed from time to time. The weather was very cold on the night I was at the school, consequently I did not ask for a fire drill. This school is fortunately situated, in that they have the same water pressure as the City.\n\nA small herd of holstein cattle is kept, and I found them in excellent condition. The milk supply at the present time is not large, but a number of cows are due to freshen within the next five or six weeks. Hogs are raised, but only sufficient to meet the requirements of the school. Poultry is kept, and I found that they were receiving good attention, with the result that a fair quantity of eggs are being obtained.\n\nThe barns and outbuildings are in good repair and, without exception, were clean and tidy.\n\nThe root cellar is in the basement of the barn. This I found well supplied with potatoes, cabbages, onions, turnips, and carrots.\n\nRev. Mr. Hendry\nPortage la Prairie Residential School (Cont'd.)\n\nRev. Mr. Hendry, the principal, is assisted by Mrs. Hendry, who is matron of the school. Undoubtedly this school is well managed, and the children receive excellent care and good training.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\nOttawa, February 15, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your 208-11 of the 10th instant, reporting on your recent inspection of the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School. The Department is pleased to note that conditions generally at this school are satisfactory; that the children are making progress in their classroom work and that the buildings and machinery are clean and tidy and kept in good repair; also that the school is well managed.\n\nRegarding the fire equipment, it is noted that fire extinguishers are placed at various points throughout the building, and that fire drill is observed from time to time. It is also noted that the fire escape from the dormitories is by way of the window and that these are kept locked. These, as well as door exits, must not be locked or sealed in any manner. I would refer you to paragraph four of the instructions to principals of Indian residential schools dated February 5, 1932, copy of which is enclosed herewith for your information. I would request that you draw the attention of the Principal to the Department's instructions regarding the requirements that windows or doors from fire escapes must not be locked.\n\nIn all other respects, the Department is pleased with the satisfactory conditions at this school, as set forth in your report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It is noted that the school will supply the material.\n\nIn reply I have to say that approval is granted for the employment of a carpenter for ten days. If the remuneration offered for the carpenter's services, viz.: $2.00 per day, is 10% less than the current wages paid last year, he will be allowed the full amount mentioned. If not, the rate will be subject to a discount of ten per cent. You should give full particulars on the voucher which you submit for payment of the carpenter's services.

The Inspector states that, while the general condition of the boiler is good, the following work will be required: \"Left side wall of firebox should be rebuilt, as brickwork is loose and cracked\".\n\nI would request that you take this matter up with the Principal. If only a small expenditure would be required, he might be able to have the work done by the school staff. If, however, it is necessary to engage outside labour, you should forward an estimate of the cost involved in rebuilding the brickwork of the firebox. When the Department receives an estimate of the cost, consideration will be given to authorizing having the work carried out. Our funds are extremely limited, and it is hoped that no large expense will be required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\n\nF.

I am informed by Mr. Jeffery that this boiler is in very bad condition and that it will need new material in bricks etc. to make this boiler safe for the use of this school.\n\nI will get a further estimate on this work and forward same to the Department. I might say that we had another brick-layer look over this boiler but he is unwilling to give an estimate he would only do this work by the day as he considers he could not give a fair estimate on the work as a lot of it has to be torn down and re-built, and all new material is required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I beg to say that I have had Mr. J.W. Rowe go over this boiler and he considers that $20.00 will put this brick work in good condition.

Jeffery, of Portage la Prairie, to furnish all necessary material and labour in connection with the repairs (as mentioned in your memo) required at the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School, for the sum of $312.00.\n\nGeorge Buskard\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nper\nAugust 30, 1933.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 21st with further reference to the repairs required to the heating boiler at the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School, in your letter of August 9th you reported that it would cost $125.00 to put this boiler in proper repair. You now state in your letter of the 21st that $20.00 will repair the brickwork. I note that this $20.00 is to repair the brickwork above the firebox to the boiler, whereas in the Boiler Inspector's report of May 16th of this year, he states that the left side wall of the firebox should be rebuilt as the brickwork is loose and cracked.\n\nFrom the information that you have submitted in your two letters it is difficult for the Department to decide what work is actually required, and what same will cost. I would, therefore, ask you to kindly explain the two quotations submitted, one with your letter of August 9th and the other of August 21st.\n\nI may say that it is desired that the boiler be put in a safe and satisfactory working condition for the winter, but before authorizing any expenditure it will be necessary to know exactly what is required, and the cost of same.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

Rowe re-repairs required to the heating boiler at the above mentioned school. I might say when Mr. Rowe gave a tender last month of $20.00 he was under the impression that it was only for repairing the brick work over the firebox. I am informed by Mr. Hendry that he went over the repairs required to be done to make this boiler safe during the winter months with Mr. Rowe, as mentioned in Mr. Rowe's quotation Mr. Hendry the Principal considers that this work should be done with the least possible delay before the cold weather sets in.\n\nMr. Hendry also advises me this is the same work exactly that Mr. Jeffery quoted upon, as he accompanied him in examining the repairs required to the heating boiler.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

W. Ross of Portage la Prairie for necessary repairs similar to those quoted on by Mr. Jeffrey. Mr. Ross's price is $175.00. Will you please advise if Mr. Ross may be employed as his price is lowest.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSept. 20, 1938.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th regarding repairs required to the heating boiler at the Portage la Prairie School, I beg to say that Mr. Ross's price should have been obtained at the same time as the work was being quoted on by Mr. Jeffrey. His price is considerably lower, but it is difficult for the Department to authorize work where prices have been obtained in this manner. There is nothing to show that Mr. Ross did not know the figures quoted on by Mr. Jeffrey at the time he was preparing his quotation.\n\nI would, therefore, ask you to obtain new quotations from Mr. Jeffrey and Mr. Ross for the work required, and submit same to the Department as soon as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

To do this, I will make use of some of the old material which will cut down the cost of material somewhat, and in addition to this there are some parts of the brick work which can be left, and will no doubt be good for another two or three years without repair. This will effect a saving in labor and material too.\n\nI would submit my tender for doing this repair work to the boiler, substantially as set out in my tender of August the 8th, with the changes as mentioned above, for the sum of $251.00.

Hendry, Principal, Portage la Prairie Residential School, in connection with some necessary repairs to the balcony supports.\n\nRepairs to the supports are very urgent as there is a danger of the balcony collapsing. I have asked Mr. Morley Hamilton, Portage la Prairie, to repair the supports as a temporary measure, and have also asked him to give me the costs of a permanent repair job. As soon as his quotation is received, a further report will be forwarded to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nPortage la Prairie Sept 10/34\n\nMr. J. Waite\nIndian Agent\nPortage la Prairie\nMan.\n\nDear Sir -\n\nI have examined the porch\nto front entrance of Indian School\nand requested and find it in a very\nbad condition. The base of both columns\nhave decayed and broken down\nleaving no support to roof.\nThe railing and pediment on top of porch\nhave decayed so badly they are falling\ndown and will have to be replaced.\nThe turned columns above base are\nin fair to good condition. I would suggest\nputting a 6x6 post inside columns for\nsupport and forming a cement base\nof sufficient height to make up the decayed\nportion or if preferred done with wood.\nTemporary repairs are out of the question\nand to repair and renew the damaged\nportions of this porch as I suggest will cost\n$48.00. I thought mention that the balconies at\nthe back are about as bad as this one and\nshould have attention. Yours Truly\nJ. Hamilton\nSir:\n\nIn reference to my letter No. 37, of the 8th instant, enclosing letter from the Reverend Principal, Portage la Prairie Residential School in connection with some necessary repairs to the balcony of the school, I now beg to enclose a report on this work received this date from Mr J.M. Hamilton, of this City. The letter is self explanatory.\n\nMr Hamilton mentions that repairs are also very necessary to the rear balconies. I asked him if he could give a price on the repairs he considered very necessary. He advises that the work of getting out specifications for these repairs would be very costly, and should be done by an engineer. He recommend that an Engineer of the Public Works Branch see this repair job.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 17, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, enclosing a report stating the repairs required to the balcony at the front entrance to the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department will approve of the repairs required being carried out, as suggested by Mr. Hamilton, viz.: the installing of a 6\" x 6\" post inside columns for support and also the installing of a wooden base of sufficient height to make up the decayed portion of the columns. It is considered that wood would be more satisfactory than cement for this purpose. The railing and pediments on top of porch should also be repaired. It is noted that the cost of the repairs and the renewing of the damaged portions of the porch will be approximately $45. You may have the work done as early as it can be arranged, keeping the costs as low as possible. After the work has been completed to your satisfaction, you should forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nRegarding the repairs to the rear balconies, it is considered that it should not be necessary to have specifications prepared for these repairs. It is believed that a competent carpenter could state what is absolutely required at the present time and furnish an estimate of the cost. You might submit an estimate of the repairs absolutely necessary to the rear balcony. Our funds are extremely limited, and it will only be possible to authorize work that is urgent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ.

E 484, amounting to $150.00 in favour of City of Portage La Prairie, Manitoba, for Rental of 3 Hydrants for year 1934 Portage la Prairie Residential School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. dated\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nIndian Residential School, Portage la Prairie,\nFebruary 27th, 1934.\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nDear Mr. Waite,\n\nThere are two pieces of work which in my judgment ought to be done in the immediate future to bring the equipment of the School here up to standard; and as these would be somewhat in the nature of capital expenditure, I am desirous of placing the facts before the Department through you with a view to requesting a grant to cover the outlay.\n\nI. THE STABLES.\n\nThe first is in connection with the stables. The present stable was erected when the farm was only fifty or fifty-five acres and is quite inadequate for the stock now kept much less for any expansion or specializing in stock which might be undertaken. At the present time six horses seven milk cows, a bull, three young cattle and two calves are housed indiscriminately in a space about 40' x 50'.\n\nI do not suggest a new building, but the use of a skeleton extension already erected at one end of this building. It is of the same width as the stable proper and similar in outward appearance, and requires only to be double-lined, floored and stalls erected to make it usable for a portion of the stock. I estimate that the work would require 2250 feet spruce sheeting, 2250 feet four inch fir ceiling, six rolls building paper and fifty sacks of cement. A local lumber merchant quotes the figure of $195 on these items. In addition there would be required material for partitions or stalls making, as I estimate a total of about $250. This would house the stock comfortably and give much better opportunity for doing effective work in this department. The work of equipping the stable with these improvements could be done by the staff with the bigger boys and a very small minimum of additional labor.\n\nII. THE PLAYROOMS.\n\nThe second piece of work is the fitting of the two large playrooms with fixed wide benches around the walls. At the present time there is practically nothing for either the boys or girls to sit on, and I find that squatting on the floor in the most primitive fashion tends\nto become common. While in charge of the Ahousat School some years ago we fitted the playrooms with fixed wide benches nearly all the way around the walls, and with satisfactory results. They not only afforded comfortable seating, a good chance for organized play and could even be used for reclining or resting at length. The cost is not great and the work of putting them in could be done without any expense. The plank required is quoted by a local dealer at $118, which with the nails or spikes necessary would make the total cost about $120.\n\nI trust that these two proposals will receive favorable consideration and that the Department may see fit to provide a grant covering the cost of the material estimated at a total of $370.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba,\nMarch 4th, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to attach a report of the Reverend Principal of the Portage la Prairie Residential School, in which he asks for an amount of $370.00 for repairs and improvements at the mentioned Residential School. The $370.00 covers the costs of materials only; the labour of erection will be done free of cost to the Department.\n\nI beg to recommend this expenditure, and would be pleased to be advised regarding same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

He estimates the total cost of the material required to be $370. The labour in carrying out the work will be performed by the school staff, without cost to the Department.\n\nThere are funds available in the current year's Appropriation, and, provided the purchase can be made before the end of the present month, I would request your approval to incur the expenditure required - the local Indian Agent to obtain prices from firms on the approved list in Portage la Prairie and purchase the material from the firm quoting the lowest price.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMarch 9, 1935.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nAgent Waite, Portage la Prairie, Man., forwards a request from the Principal of the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School, (Federal District of Portage la Prairie) to be supplied with lumber, cement, building paper, nails, and spikes, to complete an extension to the stable, to provide sufficient accommodation for the stock at the school, and also to provide benches around the walls of the two large playrooms in the school building.

You should obtain prices from firms on the approved list in Portage la Prairie and purchase the materials from the firms quoting the lowest price.\n\nIt is to be understood that the labour will be performed by the school authorities, without cost to the Department. It would be well to consult the Principal as to the materials required. I would request that you give the purchase your prompt attention and have the accounts forwarded to reach the Department by the date mentioned, in order that payment can be made from the current year's appropriation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

In view of the Minister's approval for the expenditure required, Mr. Agent Waite was authorized to obtain prices from firms on the approved list in Portage la Prairie and purchase the materials from the firm quoting the lowest price.

Personally I was never satisfied that it was, but of course I am not a medical man.\n\nHowever, at a meeting of the Board of Trade this very matter was brought up by a number of the residents of the City, and they are all complaining very strongly over this practice being continued. Myself I do not think it is right that the Indian School should allow this drainage. Even if it is not harmful to say the least it is not clean in any event, and I know that the citizens do not like it. I would imagine that this School, which is financed I believe by the Dominion Government, should be able to put in a proper sewerage disposal plant so as not to drain into the Lake.\n\nOn behalf of the City I am therefore asking that the practice of draining this overflow into Crescent Lake be stopped forthwith.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"Signed\" J.G. Miller\nMAYOR\n\nJCM/D\nJune 18th, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nA complaint has been received from the Department of Health and Public Welfare of Manitoba with reference to the discharge of the sewage from the septic tank at the Portage la Prairie School at Crescent Lake. The Mayor of Portage la Prairie has advised the Provincial Government that this practice should be stopped.\n\nI would ask you to kindly instruct Mr. Gos to make an examination and report with an estimate of cost of whatever changes in the system that he thinks necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. Foggie, Esq.,\nChief Sanitary Inspector,\nDepartment of Health and Public Welfare,\nLegislative Building,\nWINNIPEG, Manitoba.\nSir,\n\nI have received your letter of the 18th instant with reference to the condition of the septic tank at the Portage la Prairie Indian school at Crescent Lake.\n\nIn accordance with your request, Mr. Gow has been asked to make an examination and report with an estimate of cost of whatever changes in the system he considers necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer\n\nA. F. MacKenzie Esq.\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nMay 18th, 1954\n\nDr. H.A. Gordon,\nMedical Health Officer,\nCity of Portage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Indian School\u2014Sewage Treatment and Disposal\n\nIn accordance with your letter of request dated May 8th, inspection was made during May 11th, and we desire to state as follows:\n\nThe sewage from the building in question is treated in a septic tank and the effluent is discharged into Crescent Lake. Judging by the quality of the effluent, collected over three different periods, the tank was giving satisfactory service. The effluent was comparatively clear, there being only a slight turbidity with faint odor, which disappeared in twenty-four hours.\n\nThere are two discharge drains from the plant, one only, being in continuous operation, the other being an auxiliary to care for any stoppage or flooding. The drain or sewer is above the present lake water level and in consequence effluent drips on to the bank and traverses a distance of about ten feet before entering the water. On the intervening area between the water and terminal there is naturally a soaking of the ground and resultant decomposition of the minute flocculent sewage particles on the surface. Odors from this condition were noticeable only in close proximity. As the lake is apparently fed from the Assiniboine River by pumping, it is not certain whether the lake level was higher at the time of the septic tank installation some twenty years ago.\n\nFrom a general observation of conditions over practically the entire lake shores, there was not any evidence of nuisance or offence due to sewage, decomposing solids, or offensive odors, except the minor conditions referred to at the point of effluent discharge, which would show that the dilution, oxidation, and other natural purifying agencies are more than adequate.\n\nFrom a public health standpoint there is at present no hazard.\n\nThe Lake is, according to information, not used for bathing, boating, nor as a domestic water supply and would not appear to be adversely\naffected even as a rendezvous or sanctuary for wild bird life. As the sewage is being treated and not discharged in a raw condition into a body of water there is no infraction of the Regulations.\n\nIn conclusion there is no condition, in our opinion, at present, which would warrant any apprehension or be detrimental to the health of the citizens.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. Foggie\nCHIEF SANITARY INSPECTOR\n\nJE/GS\nJune 29, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nThis will acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant referring to a letter that had been received from the Department of Indian Affairs under date of June 18th with reference to the discharge of sewerage from the septic tank at the Portage la Prairie Indian School into Crescent Lake.\n\nOn June 25th, the writer proceeded to Portage la Prairie, looked over the situation at the Indian Residential School and also interviewed the Mayor of the Town, Mr. Joseph Miller. Prior to proceeding to Portage la Prairie, the writer interviewed Mr. Foggie, Chief Sanitary Inspector of the Department of Health and Public Welfare of the Province of Manitoba with reference to the situation.\n\nI was surprised to read in your letter that a complaint had been received from the Department of Health and Public Welfare of the Province of Manitoba, inasmuch as this question of the situation at Portage la Prairie had been discussed with the writer previously and I was of the opinion that the Province of Manitoba officials did not see fit to make any complaint themselves to the Department of Indian Affairs with respect to the situation at Portage la Prairie. In looking over the file in the office of the Department of Health, I noticed that the Department itself makes no complaint with reference to conditions at Portage la Prairie, insofar as the Indian School is concerned but that they merely forwarded a complaint received from the Mayor of the Town of Portage la Prairie.\n\nIn discussing the matter with Mayor Miller of Portage la Prairie, he stated that it was inconsistent of the Town to object to the situation at the Indian School, while at the same time the Town of Portage la Prairie was passing all its raw sewage into the Assiniboine untreated. However, a few residents who live possibly a quarter of a mile from the Indian School were quite loud in their complaints about the odor in the early spring and late summer months and the matter had recently been brought up at a Board of Trade Meeting by one of its members who lives in that vicinity. Mayor Miller explained that very few members of the Board of Trade knew anything at all of the situation and the suggestion was passed to him that he write to the Department of Health protesting the situation. He is very anxious that a disposal bed be put in so as to stop the complaints above referred to.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nI am enclosing with this letter the report by Mr. Foggie, Chief Sanitary Inspector, made to the Medical Health Officer of the City of Portage la Prairie, in connection with the Indian School sewage treatment and disposal situation at Portage la Prairie. I think this report is a complete answer to any complaints that have been received from the Mayor of Portage la Prairie. The writer does not believe that at any time of the year any residents of the town can detect odors from the effluent of the Indian School unless they proceed in close proximity to the outlet.\n\nThe Department of Health and Public Welfare of the Province of Manitoba say that it would be very inconsistent on their part to make any representations to the Department of Indian Affairs with respect to improving the sewage disposal situation at the Portage la Prairie Indian School while the Town of Portage la Prairie is such a great offender against the regulations as set forth by the Department. They furthermore state that there is no infraction of the Regulations on the part of the Indian School. Under the circumstances the writer is of the opinion that it is not necessary to carry out any work at the Portage la Prairie Indian School. However, it would be advisable to notify the Principal of the School that annual cleaning out of the septic tank is essential for efficient operation and that the same should be attended to.\n\nIf it is still the wish of the Department of Indian Affairs that the source of the complaints from the few residents of Portage la Prairie should be eliminated, it would be possible to construct an underground tile system that would eliminate the offensive odors at the outlet. If a report and estimate of cost of carrying out this work is desired, the same will be given attention upon the request of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. B. Gow,\nActing District Chief Engineer.\n\nEnclosure.\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of June 18th regarding the discharge of sewage from the septic tank at the Portage la Prairie School at Crescent Lake, I enclose herewith a report from Mr. Gow dated June 29th, together with a copy of a letter from Mr. J. Foggie, Chief Sanitary Inspector of the Manitoba Government.\n\nThe substance of the report is that there is no cause for complaint and no necessity for taking any action at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIndian Residential School,\nPortage-la-Prairie,\nMan.\nAugust 2nd 1935\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage-la-Prairie,\nMan.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to submit for the Department's approval, a plan to change the furnace of this school from a wood burner to a coal burner by installing a \"Kinkade coal burner.\" This will cost $185.00 which will be paid for from school funds. I would respectfully ask for your approval to this change.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nIndian Residential School,\nPortage-la-Prairie,\nJuly 25th 1935\n\nStatement of improvements urgently needed.\n\nThe flooring, some of the jacks and two of the pillars are rotted and in a dangerous condition as they support the balcony. This should be repaired at once and at the same time the verandah and upper balconies should be screened and fitted with hinged storm sash. Mr Wood has reported the difficulty in heating the building in severe weather, especially on the North-West side, the fitting up of these open balconies will make the building warmer, provide sleeping balconies, and will help the segregation problem.\n\nI have made a careful estimate of this work, including 66 special sashes, special screens, stairs, doors, hardware, flooring, framing, paint, and the services of one carpenter. The school boys will assist in this work. The total cost will not exceed $790.00. May I suggest that the Indian Agent purchase the material from the Corona Lumber Yard, and also pay the carpenter at the rate of 70\u00a2 per hour.\n\nImprovements to the barn.\n\nWe have in the barn at the present time 8 horses (2 I have just bought to replace the aged wornout team) 9 cows, 2 steers, 2 calves, 1 bull. All these are in the one stable, this is not desirable, milk cows should not be housed with horses.\n\nIt is proposed to fit up the shed at South end of barn for the horses, remove the horse stalls in the cow barn and keep that part exclusively for the cows. At the present time we have not the cows we need to supply for the school; three of the cows are dry, three are poor milkers, and the other three are fairly good. When the pupils return to school we shall require six good milk cows in addition to the present herd, and later I propose to replace the poor milkers in the herd by better stock.\n\nTo do this it is absolutely necessary to fit up the barn in a smart and adequate way. To this end I have made careful estimates of materials and costs. The lumber and cement on hand recently purchased is inadequate to the requirements, so my estimate is in addition to the required material on hand.\n\nAdditional Lumber ........................................... $23.20\n70 sacks of cement ........................................... $5.00\n22 yards of gravel @ 2.10 delivered ......................... $46.20\nHugh Winton's tender for skilled labour, use of concrete mixer, putting in cow mangers, stalls, and horse stalls. (Indian Boys assisting) .................................. $71.00\nBeatty's tender for 6 additional stanchions and all the necessary fittings, including partitions .................................................. $98.90\nBeatty's tender for installing 9 double water bowls, 1 single water bowl, one 567 gallon water tank and piping from tank to water bowls .................. $115.10\nThis system will supply water in front of the cows all winter, will give the cows water when they need it and thus increase the milk supply.\n\n8 Storm sash .................................................. $24.00\n\nImplement shed.\n\nAt the present time the separator is housed in the old barn on the \"Stacy Place\" this barn is about to fall down. I propose to take it down and use the dimension lumber and boards in building an implement shed 16 feet x 40 ft. This will house the engine and separator, this with the other shed will provide shelter for all our machinery. For this new shed I shall require 2 m ft. of fir siding 1 x 6 .................................................. $104.00\n10 m shingles .................................................. $47.50\n30 bags of cement for foundation wall ...................... $15.00\n6 yards of gravel @ 2.10 delivered ......................... $12.60\nHugh Winton's tender for skilled labour, use of concrete mixer .................................................. $18.00\nIndian Residential School,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nJune 29th, 1935.\n\nTo The Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nBefore my connection with the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School is severed I wish to place before the Department certain features of the present situation which appear to demand immediate attention.\n\nFirst let me express my personal appreciation of the uniformly courteous and obliging treatment I have received from your local representative, Mr. Waite, during the whole term of my principalship here, and no less of the ready response of the Department to my plea for material for improving stabling conditions and more fully equipping the Boys' and Girls' places in the main building. The grant of $600 provided ample material for the work required, and when it is completed conditions will be greatly improved. I have found the Department in this case, as in former relations with it - ready to accede to every reasonable request, and in all things desirous of providing the best conditions for carrying on the operations of the School.\n\nI have now to direct attention to certain situations arising mainly out of the fact that it is twenty years or more since the main building of this School was erected and that most material things suffer from the lapse of years.\n\nI. The verandahs across the west side of the building from the basement to the third storey, - especially the floors, but, I judge, also the framework - are in need of repair, - if not of replacement. In several places the floors are quite worn through, and very soon might become dangerous to the limbs or even the lives of the children using them. They should be inspected and necessary repair made before another winter.\n\nII. A not less important matter is the condition of the windows, especially on three sides, north, west and south of the main building. They are, without exception so slack in their frames that it becomes increasingly impossible to heat any side of the building if at winter temperatures the wind is directed against that side. For some winters past it has been necessary to pack many of the windows with quilts or other material - a very Indian-like and unsatisfactory method in order to make the dormitories habitable at all. It has even been necessary on occasion to move the children from the side exposed to the wind to the less windy side; and in extreme weather the condition is literally intolerable.\n\nI am advised that there is now available patented metal window strip which can with a minimum of work and expense be fitted to any ordinary window, and will make it practically air-tight. In my judgment there should be no delay in taking some such course with some sixty odd windows of the main building. Without some such provision the building cannot be made reasonably comfortable for staff or pupils next winter.\nIII. The whole problem of the heating of the main building must be faced in the near future. I am not at the moment suggesting a new system; but pending an investigation of furnace efficiency and review of the system I believe that much help might be derived from some system of ceiling insulation\u2014even with ordinary sawdust. It cannot be doubted that much heat is wasted escaping by way of the old-fashioned brick-and-plaster or patent metal ceilings. I am convinced that ceiling insulation on the second stories the whole length of the building would add measurably to the comfort both of the staff and pupils in coming winters.\n\nThe boiler and furnace are both antiquated and much worn, and it may be expected that the boiler inspector one of these years will order their replacement.\n\nIV. Some years ago soft water cisterns for saving the rain water from the roofs for laundry work were constructed, being located in the earth a little distance behind the north end of the main building. They are to all appearance in good shape, but the water they hold has never for any considerable period been available, owing to the fact that there is no connection with the building, or only a connection which does not connect. Without such connection the cisterns are useless. Pipe connection with the building and some means of getting the water into the water heating system used for laundry and bathing should be established at the earliest possible moment. With expert advice on the best method of such connection the cost need not be very great. But most certainly the School should have the use of the soft water which is there;\n\nV. Certain defects in the roofing of the main building are also coming to constitute a real problem. I am informed that the difficulty dates back to the time of a cyclone or severe wind storm a good many years ago which it is alleged strained or warped the tile system so that it has not been possible to avoid serious leaks into several of the staff rooms on the second floor when heavy rains occur. For example during the heavy rain of today (June 29th, 1935) water in pailfuls came down into the senior teacher's room upstairs. An expert inspection of the roof and some repair is urgently needed.\n\nVI. In the matter of farm equipment there is a tractor\u2014a very ancient Rumely Oil-Pull which is still conscripted each fall and made to furnish power for the threshing. It has not, I believe, been used for anything else for some time. The Oil-Pull is out of date and requires constant tinkering, and in my judgment should be replaced by an up-to-date tractor which could be used not only for threshing, but for plowing and other field work and for running a grain crusher or grinder.\n\nThere is a grain crusher\u2014a small one\u2014which has not been capable of normal work for several years. Thus it has been necessary that most\u2014almost all\u2014of the grinding and grain chopping for several years has been done at a milling plant downtown (Portage la Prairie) at very considerable cost. If a modern crusher of moderate capacity were installed driven by an up-to-date tractor it would be a real economy.\nMay I respectfully suggest that some competent person or persons be employed under the Indian agent to report on the conditions referred to, and that steps be taken \u2014 very especially in regard to the building repairs necessary, before winter approaches, to meet whatever needs are found to exist.\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nActing Principal.\nAugust 7th, 1935\n\nPortage la Prairie\nManitoba.\n\nFile No. 37\nJW/R.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith a list of improvements and repairs requested by the Rev. J. Jones, Principal of the Portage la Prairie Residential School.\n\nThere is no doubt that the repairs to the balcony are very urgent.\n\nMaterial for certain improvements to the barn is on hand, but not sufficient for the improvement now proposed by the Principal.\n\nIt is the intention of the Principal to dismantle the barn on the Stacey place, and use the lumber in building an additional implement shed to the one at present in use on the school grounds.\n\nI enclose a letter from the late Principal, Rev. W.R. Wood in which he also makes certain suggestions regarding the school.\n\nI wish to say that I have been over the improvements and repairs suggested, and if sufficient funds are at the disposal of the Department, I would respectfully recommend same.\n\nI also enclose a further letter from Mr. Jones in which he requests the Department's approval to the installation of a Kinkade Coal Burner in place of the wood burner in use at the present time.\n\nPlease advise.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6273, file 583-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, August 15, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, enclosing a communication from the former Acting Principal of the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School and also a statement from the present Principal, regarding the improvements and repairs required, with an estimate of the cost.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that our Estimates for the current fiscal year provide an appropriation, to the amount of $300.00 only, for general repairs to the above named school. I would request, therefore, that you take up the matter with the Principal and inform the Department of the repairs considered absolutely urgent, stating in detail what work you would advise be carried out and the cost of the material and labour. You should also state what outside labour would be required, in excess of the work that can be carried out by the staff of the school. The total estimated cost of the urgent repairs should not exceed the amount provided, as stated above. It might be advisable to consider the placing of weather strip around the windows and repairing the roof of the main building.\n\nThe Department will have no funds to provide the cost of supplying a tractor or a grain crusher or to change the present furnace at the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\nIn acknowledging receipt of the above noted letter of the 15th ultimo, I beg to advise that I have been over the repairs suggested by the Department at the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School. It is my opinion that although the windows are in some respects ill-fitting, this is not altogether the cause of the school being cold. I believe the cold wind comes around the casements, as beside the regular sash, there are two storm windows in addition. The fixing of the casements would be very expensive and could be overcome by the glazing in of the balcony as suggested by Mr. Jones. The roof has not leaked since Mr. Jones took over, although this is an expense that will have to be considered in a year or so's time. The roof was damaged in the cyclone in the year 1923 and has been repaired from time to time. The balcony will have to repaired, otherwise I am afraid serious damage, perhaps involving a number of pupils, may result. The cost of a temporary repair will be in the neighbourhood of $10.00, the staff of the school furnishing the labour. This will only be temporary, and an amount of approximately $790.00 should be spent in completing and improving this balcony next year.\n\nThe Principal is purchasing a herd of Jersey cows and the stable should be enlarged to accommodate this herd. The amount required for this, and it should be done before the cold weather sets in, is $154.50. This estimate includes the cost of material, and labour. A further sum of $254.00 should be spent on barn improvements next year.\n\nThe Principal feels that money can be saved in the installing of a new furnace, and requests an amount of $180.00 for this purpose. I also believe a saving can be made, as wood fuel in this district is now dearer than coal, and the cheapest kind of coal could be burnt. The installation of a coal furnace may overcome the cold condition of the school to some extent, as the fire would not be in and out, as in\nin a wood furnace.\n\nThe Principal has done considerable repair work around the school at own expense. He has removed the silo from the Stacey farm to the Home Farm buildings. This will give him considerable more space for ensilage at home. Windows and wire screens have been repaired at a cost of $194.00. In addition a team of horses have been purchased at a cost of $175.00, and a herd of cows at $1750.00.\n\nI beg to recommend that the sum of $300.00 be spent as follows; improvements to barn $155.00, converting furnace from wood burner to coal burner $186.00.\n\nI would also be pleased if the following amounts be placed in Estimates for repairs and improvements next year.\n\nRepairs and improvements to balcony $790.00\n\" \" \" \" cow barn 254.00\n\" \" \" \" implement shed 209.00\n\" \" \" cistern and new piping 65.00\nPaint, varnish etc, interior decorating 75.00\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,-\n\nThree Hundred Dollars is provided in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year for carrying out general repairs at the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School (Electoral District of Portage la Prairie) Man.\n\nThe local Indian Agent, Mr. J.

He states, further, that the installation of a coal furnace would overcome, to a great extent, the cold condition of the building.\n\nThe Principal has done considerable repair work around the school, at his own expense. He has removed the silo to a new site and repaired it, giving more space for ensilage. Windows and wire screens on the main building were repaired and a team of horses and a herd of cows purchased.\n\nI beg to request your approval for an expenditure of approximately $351.00, for supplying material and labour in connection with enlarging the barn and for converting the present furnace from wood to coal burning.

We find that the truck is registered in the name of the Government Indian School at Portage la Prairie. Mrs. Elders suffered severe injuries and is at present in the Winnipeg General Hospital suffering from several fractured bones. We are calling the matter to your attention at this time as the accident may result in a claim against the Department as we assume the Indian School is under your jurisdiction.\n\nYours truly,\n\nALLAN LAIRD MAGINNES & MILNE,\nPer \"M\"\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n4th Floor, Commercial Building,\nWINNIPEG.\nSir:\n\nAttached is a copy of a letter received from Allan, Laird, MacInnes & Milne, Barristers, of Winnipeg.\n\nI am requesting Mr. Jones, Principal of the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School, to submit a report and will forward same as soon as it is received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nIndian Residential School,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nNov. 12th 1935.\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nFurther to our conversation re-Inspector Hamilton's inquiry about our Truck T6771 being involved in an accident, I wish to say that this truck (owned by the school management and not by the Indian Department) was taken by my two sons aged 20 and 18 to Winnipeg on the 19th of October. While proceeding along Portage Ave., the above mentioned accident occurred. The boys were in no way to blame as they were proceeding very carefully and slowly at the time. I do not think you require the details of the accident. I only wish to point out that the Department of Indian Affairs do not own the Truck, therefore are in no way responsible for the accident. I am going to visit the injured lady this week and will call on Mr. Hamilton while in Winnipeg.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) Joseph Jones\nPrincipal\nSir:-\n\nFurther to my letter of the 12th instant, I now enclose copy of a letter from Mr. Jones, Principal of the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School, regarding the accident in which the school truck was involved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir:\n\nI have been in conversation with the Rev. Mr. Jones, Principal of the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School, and he is very uneasy in connection with the fire hazard at this school. We are fortunate in having the City water pressure, but the building is old and, if a fire started, I doubt if it could be checked. Mr. Jones asked if the Department would supply him with the services of a night watchman during the winter months. He would be quite prepared to carry this out himself, but unfortunately his finances will not permit it. The services of a suitable man will cost from 25 to 30 dollars per month.\n\nI am quite prepared to recommend that this be granted, but I would much prefer if the Department would also install a proper punch clock. My experience has been that a night watchman is not much good unless we have some means of checking on his time. The money involved in connection with this matter is not great for the satisfaction obtained and I am quite sure the extra precaution would justify the expense.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, November 20, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letters of the 12th and 13th instant, with reference to the truck of the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School being involved in an accident in Winnipeg on the 19th ultimo.\n\nThis truck is not the property of the Department, and, therefore, we are not liable for any claim that may be made for damages. It is noted from the copy of the Principal's letter dated November 12th that he realizes that the school management are responsible for any damages that may have occurred.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, November 20, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th instant, you may inform the Principal of the Portage la Prairie Residential School that the Department will allow a grant of $30 a month for the period December 9th, 1935, to March 31st, 1936, in order that he may engage the services of a night watchman.\n\nA voucher should be forwarded by Mr. Agent Waite at the end of each month. This voucher should be prepared in a similar manner to the one enclosed.\n\nOwing to lack of funds, the Department is not prepared to purchase a watchman's clock at the present time. Before signing the voucher at the end of each month, the Indian Agent should assure himself that the night watchman's duties have been properly performed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F.

Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage-la-Prairie,\n\nDear Sir,- We are in need of beds and Mattresses. At present we have to put two children in one bed which is an undesirable arrangement. When I took charge in July we checked over every bed and found that many of the mattresses had to be destroyed, also many of the springs were beyond repair. With the admission of new pupils we require increased bed accommodation.\n\n10 single bedsteads (smallest size)\n20 Mattresses to fit the above bedsteads.\n3 Doz. Pillows.\n\nI shall be grateful if the Department could supply the above as early as possible, it is impossible to purchase these from my grant as I have had to spend considerable sums to improve and equip this institution.\n\nYours sincerely\n\nJoseph Jones\nPrincipal\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith letter received from the Principal, Portage la Prairie, Indian Residential School which is self-explanatory. The approximate cost of the equipment he requests is as follows:\n\n- Single bedsteads - $7.00 each\n- Mattresses - $7.00 each\n- Pillows - $1.50 each\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nEncl.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nOttawa, November 26, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 18th instant, please ascertain from the Principal of the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School the length and width of the beds and mattresses which he requires. When this information is forwarded, an order will be placed by the Department.\n\nOwing to lack of funds, we are not prepared to supply the thirty-six (36) pillows.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F.

MacKenzie, Esq.\nSecretary,\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe sewage disposal system of this school has not been working satisfactorily for some years past and many complaints have been made about the odour from the septic tank and the outlet into Crescent Lake.\n\nMr Foggie of the Department of Health for the Province of Manitoba was here last week in response to the above complaints. We went into the whole matter thoroughly and he recommends a larger septic tank and a chlorine treatment to the liquid before discharge into the Lake. This chlorine system would involve considerable additional expense for construction and yearly maintenance.\n\nI have consulted with Mr Porter (the Engineer for the City of Portage-la-Prairie) on this sewage problem; he agrees with Mr Foggie that our present system is unsatisfactory and inadequate and ought to be replaced with a larger system as early as possible.\n\nWhen I took charge last July I was informed of the constant trouble with the sewage disposal. I had the tank cleaned out, the tree traps cleaned, and excavated to the outlet drain and uncovered the tank. Since then we have had to pump out the tank nine times, the drain has been plugged between the school and the tank and between the tank and the outlet. Not having the necessary equipment to release the obstructions Mr Porter has kindly loaned the City equipment and sent along two men who are used to this kind of work.\n\nNot having any plans of the present system I have traced out the tank and drains and enclose a sketch of the same.\n\nMay I respectfully ask for your early consideration to this important problem.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJoseph Jones\nPrincipal\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nReferred to: Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nMarc-A.

They furthermore state that there is no infraction of the Regulations on the part of the Indian School.\"\n\nMr. Gow then states that in his opinion it is not necessary to carry out any work at the School except the annual cleaning out of the septic tank, in order to ensure its efficient operation. This report was dated June 29, 1935.\n\nI am again, however, asking Mr. Gow for a further report in case there have been some new developments since that time.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\nTo: Rev.

See previous reports 1934-35.\n\nFollowing receipt of information, by telephone, from Dr. F. W. Jackson, Deputy Minister of Health, I proceeded to Portage la Prairie at 11 p.m. via C.P.R.\n\nInspection was made on the above date, conditions noted, and the situation discussed with Mr. J. Jones, Superintendent of the School.\n\nFrom information received it would appear that the sewage disposal system had failed to function on four occasions this winter, resulting in sewage backing up through the traps in the basement floor of the building. In order to remedy conditions assistance was asked from the City of Portage la Prairie, and a diaphragm pump was provided to pump out the contents of the septic tank. No definite cause was given for the choking, and at time of inspection no trouble was being experienced.\n\nFailure of the system may have been due to a number of causes, namely - careless or improper use of the main house drain, due to entrance of some object, entrance of soil into the house drain through a defective joint or break, accumulation of sludge or solids in the tank sufficient to prevent entrance of sewage, freezing of the main drain due to leaky fixture traps providing a thin film of cold water, combined with an extreme frost penetration and freezing, choking of the septic tank outlet or drain. This latter suggested cause was not evidently a factor as water poured into the drain was discharged to the lake. Observation of the residue left after pumping out the tank contents shows that a small amount of sludge had been present.\n\nIt is now suggested that the septic tank is too small for the load imposed, the design being originally for some 60 persons. There are at the present time 115 persons including staff. No plans are, or have been, available to show dimensions or capacity, the local federal authorities in Winnipeg have no such data. There may be some truth in the idea that the tank is too small but no additions have been made to the building, and it is likely that those who designed the tank would provide capacity for full occupation. After more than twenty years of service it is possible that certain drain or other repairs may be required.\n\nPrior to the present superintendent taking over duties in July 1935, investigation showed that the system was giving satisfactory service, judging by the quality of the effluent, a sample of which we still have. At that time the tank was being cleaned not frequently, several times each year, a procedure which should not be necessary as a general rule.\n\nODORS:\n\nDuring previous inspections no grossly offensive condition was ever noted, except in close proximity to the point of discharge on to the lake bank. Occasionally there will be from any such system a sudden discharge.\nof gas from decomposing solids, and in this particular job a wooden vent elevated to a height of about twelve feet above the tank and within 30 - 40 feet from the roadway will provide exit. Persons passing by, driving or on foot, will immediately become aware of the offensive odors and naturally register objection, and suggest danger to the public health based on the old miasmatic theory.\n\nOwing to the distance between the school and the nearest house or residence within the City of Portage la Prairie, I question if any house owner or occupier has ever noticed objectionable sewage odors from this site.\n\nIt may be well to mention that during the recent cleaning and plumping operations, offensive odors would be noticeable at a considerable distance, due to the discharge and spread of highly septic sewage. At time of inspection there was a distinct odor noticeable; its magnitude being due, in my opinion, mainly to the recent cleaning and covering of the ground surface. On approach and in leaving the premises no odor was noticeable from the roadway.\n\nComplaints have been received on several occasions, mainly about discharge of tank effluent into Crescent Lake. As previous reports will show I have repeatedly denied existence of any hazard to the public health insofar as the lake was concerned, because this artificial body of water is not used as a domestic water supply nor for bathing purposes. Periodic filling is from the Assiniboine, a water already sewage polluted, combined with the facts that part of the raw sewage of the City of Portage la Prairie was discharged into the Lake within the limits, a condition corrected since October 1935, and finally the discharge of raw sewage into the Assiniboine River from the City, creating a definite and obvious hazard to those downstream who, by force of circumstances, are obliged to use river water for domestic purposes.\n\nREMEDIAL MEASURES.\n\nIn order that any defect be corrected in the drainage system, and whether or not the septic tank is of sufficient capacity, I would recommend that the federal authorities make a survey and carry out any necessary changes or repairs. The elevated vent mentioned might be dispensed with its function meantime being as a periodic disseminator of odors close to the main roadway. Venting should be through the tanks along the main drain and up through the soil stack or stacks to the roof. At this elevation, odors are less likely to cause offense. Definite printed instructions concerning the care of the septic tank system should then be provided for the use of those in charge of the building.\n\nSuch measures, if attended to, will tend to remove trouble in future, but provide no guarantee of any change in so far as the effluent and Lake are concerned, no matter how well designed a septic tank may be or how apparently well the scheme functions. There is a desire apparently to change the final method of disposal and a field tile system has been suggested. As the existing depth of the outlet around eleven or twelve feet, a disposal system is out of the question. A collecting tank, automatically controlled pump, and shallow field disposal system would be necessary. For a job of this size I do not recommend such a system. Filtering before discharge into the lake would be of little value and probably increase the possibilities of offensive odors.\n\nThe cleanest and most efficient method of treating the effluent before discharge into the lake is by the application of chlorine. This treatment will not only prevent offensive odors, but may be arranged to\ngive complete sterilization. Initial cost of specially insulated housing, water supply, and chlorinator would be the greatest expense. The amount of chlorine required would not be very great.\n\nIn conclusion it is well to note that the City of Portage la Prairie has now ceased to discharge raw sewage into the Lake; this alters to some extent the question of the Indian School, but I would not, in my official capacity, insist on chlorination at present nor until the City of Brandon and the City of Portage la Prairie have adequate sewage treatment systems in use, and no longer continue to pollute the Assiniboine, on which Crescent Lake is dependent for its supply.\n\nChief Sanitary Inspector.\n\nCOPY:\nBJ.\nCOPY\n\nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND PUBLIC WELFARE\n\nWinnipeg, February 28, 1936.\n\nMr. Ferguson,\nChief Sanitary Engineer,\nDepartment of Pensions and National Health,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe - Indian School, Portage la Prairie.\n\nDear Mr. Ferguson,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a copy submitted by our Chief Sanitary Inspector re sewage disposal at our Indian School at Portage la Prairie and would like to particularly refer you to the first paragraph of the \"remedial measures.\"\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(SGD.)

T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer\n\nA. F. MacKenzie Esq.\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nPortage la Prairie Indian Residential School (United), Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School, inspected March 5th, 1936.\n\nThe senior room is in charge of Mr. S. Bailey, who at present is sick. A qualified teacher is substituting. The grades are as follows:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| IV    | 10     |\n| V     | 9      |\n| VI    | 18     |\n| VII   | 9      |\n\n45\n\nThe pupils speak out well and do very neat work. I consider they are making good progress and are fairly well along in their respective grades.\n\nThe junior room is supervised by Mrs. Billyard, who is a qualified teacher. The roll calls for 52, arranged in the following grades:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| I     | 31     |\n| II    | 17     |\n| III   | 4      |\n\n52\n\nIt will be noted that the beginners, or Grade I class, is large and I can assure the Department it certainly keeps one on the move with 52 small children. The teacher is alert and is, I believe, doing excellent work.\n\nThe pupils were all neatly dressed and clean.\n\nI was especially pleased with the well combed heads of hair.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nhair, which, in all cases, appeared to be clean. The pupils are not timid, but good discipline is maintained in both rooms.\n\nThe sewing room is supervised by Miss Robertson. They have recently received three new sewing machines which will greatly help in speeding up the work. At present there are 96 pupils enrolled and this naturally necessitates a lot of sewing and patching. The work is well done and the girls appeared to enjoy themselves.\n\nThe laundry is in the basement and well equipped with the necessary machinery. Miss Findlay is in charge of this department. The soft water reservoir is underground, outside the building, and I understand has been out of use for some time. The connections are broken, no doubt due to the frost. During the summer, this should be given a thorough overhauling and put in good condition as soft water is most essential for washing. The machinery I believe to be in good condition.\n\nThe kitchen is supervised by Miss Desell and apparently is under good management. The children are well fed and appear to be in splendid health. I have never yet received a complaint in respect to the kind or quantity of food served at this school.\n\nThe dispensary and infirmary is in charge of Nurse Hull. Mr. Jones, the Principal, claims she renders good service and is especially helpful in Girl Guide work.\n\nThe dormitories were clean and the beds neatly made. All four rooms are full; in fact, it would be difficult to put in more beds and have any passage-way or space.\nor space between beds. There are 98 pupils in residence; one quite sick, and I understand suffering from T.B., is isolated in the infirmary. Mr. Jones states he wants his allotted number increased from 90 to 100. However, before this is granted, I think the cubic feet of air in each dormitory should be carefully checked. I think, rather than overcrowd the pupils, it would be much better to allow some to attend Brandon School where there is plenty of room. Both schools are supervised by the United Church and consequently no difficulty should arise.\n\nThe fire escapes were all in good condition and fire extinguishers placed in prominent places throughout the building. Water is supplied from the City, consequently there is always good pressure. The night watchman is much appreciated and a punch clock was installed by the Principal.\n\nThe furnace room was clean and everything in good condition. Mr. Dunfield is fireman in the winter and gardener in the summer.\n\nMrs. Jones, wife of the Principal, is matron of the school.\n\nThe barn and outbuildings are all in good repair. Mr. Jones altered the interior of the stock barn and made more room for his cattle.\n\nHe purchased 21 purebred jersey cows and I found these in excellent condition. The whole milk is used for the children and for cooking. Butter is purchased from the City.\n\nThey now have 6 horses. Recently a new team was purchased at a cost of $400. They are of percheron breed.\nbreed and in excellent condition.\n\nMr. Jones is a splendid carpenter and is anxious to obtain a shop where the boys can be taught this very useful trade. If funds can be found, I would like to see a suitable building erected and a quantity of tools supplied. Instructions in carpentry and blacksmithing would be of value to all Indian boys and I believe Mr. Jones is very thorough in his work.\n\nThere is a good spirit prevailing throughout the school and the children seem to be very happy. Mr. Jones is greatly interested in his pupils and appears to be a hard worker. I consider the general management of the school quite good.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G.

The work is well done and the girls appeared to enjoy themselves.\n\nThe laundry is in the basement and well equipped with the necessary machinery. Miss Findlay is in charge of this department. The soft water reservoir is underground, outside the building, and I understand has been out of use for some time. The connections are broken, no doubt due to the frost. During the summer, this should be given a thorough overhauling and put in good condition as soft water is most essential for washing. The machinery I believe to be in good condition.\n\nThe kitchen is supervised by Miss Dezell and apparently is under good management. The children are well fed and appear to be in splendid health. I have never yet received a complaint in respect to the kind or quantity of food served at this school.\n\nThe dispensary and infirmary is in charge of Nurse Hull. Mr. Jones, the Principal, claims she renders good service and is especially helpful in Girl Guide work.\n\nThe dormitories were clean and the beds neatly made. All four rooms are full; in fact, it would be difficult to put in more beds and have any passage-way or space.\nor space between beds. There are 98 pupils in residence; one quite sick, and I understand suffering from T.B., is isolated in the infirmary. Mr. Jones states he wants his allotted number increased from 90 to 100. However, before this is granted, I think the cubic feet of air in each dormitory should be carefully checked. I think, rather than overcrowd the pupils, it would be much better to allow some to attend Brandon School where there is plenty of room. Both schools are supervised by the United Church and consequently no difficulty should arise.\n\nThe fire escapes were all in good condition and fire extinguishers placed in prominent places throughout the building. Water is supplied from the City, consequently there is always good pressure. The night watchman is much appreciated and a punch clock was installed by the Principal.\n\nThe furnace room was clean and everything in good condition. Mr. Dunfield is fireman in the winter and gardener in the summer.\n\nMrs. Jones, wife of the Principal, is Matron of the school.\n\nThe barn and outbuildings are all in good repair. Mr. Jones altered the interior of the stock barn and made more room for his cattle.\n\nHe purchased 21 purebred jersey cows and I found these in excellent condition. The whole milk is used for the children and for cooking. Butter is purchased from the City.\n\nThey now have 6 horses. Recently a new team was purchased at a cost of $400. They are of percheron breed.\nbreed and in excellent condition.\n\nMr. Jones is a splendid carpenter and is anxious to obtain a shop where the boys can be taught this very useful trade. If funds can be found, I would like to see a suitable building erected and a quantity of tools supplied. Instructions in carpentering and blacksmithing would be of value to all Indian boys and I believe Mr. Jones is very thorough in his work.\n\nThere is a good spirit prevailing throughout the school and the children seem to be very happy. Mr. Jones is greatly interested in his pupils and appears to be a hard worker. I consider the general management of the school quite good.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\nEXD.\n\nOttawa, March 17, 1836.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your 208-11 of the 11th instant, reporting on your inspection of the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department is pleased to note that general conditions at this school are satisfactory, that the pupils are making progress in their studies, are well fed and in splendid health, and that the building is kept in a cleanly condition.\n\nRegarding the condition of the soft water reservoir, outside the building, which has not been in use for some time, owing to broken connections, the matter of repairs should be brought to the attention of the Department next summer. Information should be given concerning the work required and the cost.\n\nRelative to the request of the Principal, that a grant be provided for an increase in pupilage, from 90 to 100, I have to say that, when our Estimates were being prepared for the coming fiscal year, definite instructions were received that no increase in pupilage at residential schools could be provided. It will therefore not be possible to make an increase during the coming fiscal year in the pupilage at this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nMarch 11, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI have for attention your letter of March 7th with enclosure relating to complaints being made by the Town of Portage la Prairie regarding the septic tank at the Portage la Prairie Indian School.\n\nFollowing my report of last June re this matter, I was informed by Mr. J. Foggie, Chief Sanitary Inspector, Department of Health and Public Welfare of the Province of Manitoba, that as a result of further investigations carried out by himself, he had ascertained that the Town of Portage la Prairie had a 12\" overflow sewer discharging into Crescent Lake and that at times large quantities of raw sewage was being discharged into the lake. Such being the case the Town's complaints about the effluent from the septic tank, one year ago, were rather out of place.\n\nLast autumn the Town of Portage la Prairie completed a secondary branch sewer that enabled the town to discontinue dumping sewage into Crescent Lake and probably the officials consider that their protests are now more in order. However, the writer does not consider that the town has any grounds for complaint as long as they continue to outlet all of their raw sewage into the Assiniboine River contrary to the regulations of the Manitoba Department of Health.\n\nI have discussed the situation with Mr. Foggie since the receipt of your letter and we also discussed the matter of these complaints two or three weeks ago. The attitude of the Chief Sanitary Inspector is that the septic tanks are sufficiently large, that they are operating efficiently, that the sewage disposal plant meets with the requirements of the Manitoba Department of Health and that there is little ground for complaint and that as long as the Provincial Government permits the Town of Portage la Prairie to dump its raw sewage into the Assiniboine River, it would be most inconsistent for the Provincial Government to make any representations to the Dominion Government about the discharging of the effluent from the septic tank of the Indian School into Crescent Lake.\n\nIn view of the fact that the Manitoba Department of Health have on several recent occasions investigated the complaints regarding the sewage disposal system at the Indian School and have found no reasonable grounds for such complaints, the writer is of the opinion that there is no need for the Department of Indian Affairs to consider any extensions or alterations to the existing system. However, I would again draw to the attention of the Department of Indian Affairs, the necessity of having the septic tanks\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6273, file 583-5, part 5)\nat all Indian Schools cleaned out frequently. The writer has found from visiting several of these schools, that this matter is frequently neglected. As a result the septic tanks frequently fail to give the efficient results that are possible and accordingly become the source of complaints from near-by residents.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. B. Gow,\nActing District Chief Engineer.\nIn further reference to your letter of the 3rd instant regarding complaints made by the City of Portage la Prairie, with reference to the septic tank at the Portage la Prairie Indian School, I enclose herewith, a letter received from Mr. Gow, dated the 11th instant covering this matter. His conclusion is that the City has at present no reasonable grounds for complaint but he suggests that the septic tank should be cleaned out at regular intervals.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

Mr. Jones,\nIndian School, City.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAccording to your instructions I submit the following prices for proposed work at the School.\n\nNo. 1 To supply three water fronts for kitchen range.\n1. 115 Gallon (Imperial) Range boiler & Stand.\nBoiler to be extra heavy, tapped 1\u00bd\", 24\" in diameter and 72\" high. To connect the three water fronts to this boiler and arrange the piping so as to supply the kitchen with hot water first and to be residue if not needed into the general supply. I agree to supply above material and all necessary pipe, fittings and labour for this work and to leave everything connected up in good shape and ready for use for the sum of One hundred and eighty eight dollars ($188.00).\n\nThere is a lot of work connected with this job as Gurney informs me that the water fronts will have to be fitted and there are no holes for them in the range which will mean moving it out. Please notice that the boiler is 24\u00bd x 72 and contains 115 Imperial gallons. This is not the same as the old 100 gallon boiler which is now called #100 and only holds 77 Imperial gallons. 58\" x 22\".\n\nI have been thinking over using the tank in the dairy but I do not think you would get enough heat from the stove to make it really hot so you would only be getting warm water.\n\nNo. 2 To changing small steam boiler into water heater. To supply all material and labour to enlarge openings in boiler and connect up to hot water system for the sum of fifty four dollars ($54.00). This includes the two 2\" gate valves we spoke of using. If these are not needed deduct $12.00. We must remember in using the steam boiler that the flues would have to be cleaned at least twice a week and the smoke pipe would have to be arranged so as to be easily removed.\n\nNo. 3 To supply material and labour for replacing heating coil in boiler and to take out old coil and replace for the sum of thirty dollars ($30.00).\n\nHoping to receive instructions to go ahead with the work.\n\nI am\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Signed) J.W. Ramez\nJ.W. Ramez, Plumber & Fitter.\nThe attached letter was received from the Reverend Principal of the Portage la Prairie Residential School this date. On receipt of the letter I immediately proceeded to the school and inspected the hot water system.\n\nThe water for the laundry, baths, and ablution basins has been heated by a small jacket heater in the basement. The heater is very old and is now beyond repair.\n\nThe hot water used in the kitchen is from pans heated on the cook stove.\n\nThe reservoir tank of the jacket heater is also warmed by pipes through the flue of the heating furnace, the pipes being a supplementary heating system to the jacket heater.\n\nThere is a steam boiler in the laundry which has not been used for a number of years, for the reason stated in Mr. Jones' letter. The suggestion is that this boiler be moved to the basement to replace the jacket heater, which should be scrapped. The cost of moving the boiler, and the additional labour of enlarging the openings to make it adaptable for a water heater would be $54.00. The two 2\" Gate valves would be required. Item No. 2 of the attached estimate.\n\nThe coil through the flue of the heating furnace is corroded and full of a lime deposit, and will have to be renewed. The estimated cost of this work is $30.00. As previously stated, this coil forms an additional heating system for the reservoir tank, and could eliminate the use of the steam boiler (the one to be moved) except on those days when additional hot water is required for laundry and bathing. Item No. 3 of estimate.\n\nThe cost of a range boiler and stand, including water fronts, labour etc., is estimated in Item No. 1. at $188.00. At the present time there is a small boiler attached to the cook stove with a capacity of about 40 gallons. The pipes to this are burnt out, and the boiler is only large enough for an ordinary household. There is no doubt that to have a very necessary supply of hot water on hand in the kitchen at all times a larger boiler should be installed. The heating of water in pans on the cook stove is not only inadequate but very dangerous.\n\nThe estimate enclosed was asked for by the Reverend\n\nReverend\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nReverend Principal from Mr. J.W. Ramez of Portage la Prairie. The work asked for by the Principal is, I consider very necessary and urgent. It would also be cheaply installed and also furnish an adequate supply of hot water at all times. If the Department approve of this work other estimates could be obtained from plumbers in the City of Portage la Prairie if necessary.\n\nWill you kindly advise in this matter at your earliest convenience as at the present time the school is without hot water for laundry and bathing purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnc. 2\nIndian Residential School,\nPortage-la-Prairie,\nMan.\n\nApril 20th 1936\n\nA.M. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMay I call your attention to the lack of an adequate method of heating water in this school.\n\nThe only method that has been in use is a small jacket heater made of cast iron, a little over a year ago Mr Wood had to send it away to be welded, one month ago it began to leak again and I called in the plumber who stopped the leak with iron cement, it is now leaking in another place. Due to the accumulation of scale in the cast heater the circulation has been retarded and the heater has become useless.\n\nThe coils in the heating furnace have been of no use for some years now, they are full of scale so there is no circulation of water.\n\nThe Kitchen Range is not fitted with coils, this range has three fire boxes and if fitted with coils would give a good supply of hot water for kitchen use. At the present time the water has to be heated in pans on the top of the stove.\n\nWhen the Laundry was first equipped it was intended to use a steam boiler for heating the water, but this would involve engaging a certified steam engineer, which evidently was considered too expensive. This steam boiler is standing in the laundry having never been used except to test it. I propose to move it to the basement and use it as a hot water heater.\n\nI am enclosing an estimate of the cost of these three suggested changes.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will give this your early consideration.\n\nYours sincerely\n\nJoseph Jones\nPrincipal\nApril 10th 1936\n\nThe Rev Mr Jones\nIndian School City.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAccording to your instructions I submit the following prices for proposed work at the school:\n\n#1.
