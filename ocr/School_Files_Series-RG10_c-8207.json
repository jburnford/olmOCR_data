They should be replaced.\nThere should be a proper sink and drain\nprovided.\nOttawa, June 28, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Moraviantown Indian Day School, states that the outside closets are in very bad condition and that new ones are needed. He also states that the old double desks are long since out of date and should be replaced. Further, he reports that there should be a proper sink and drain provided.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your recommendation regarding the Inspector's suggestions. You should give full particulars regarding the closets, and, if you recommend that new ones be built, please give an estimate of the cost of the material and labour.\n\nPlease report, also, regarding the sink and drain, giving an estimate of the cost of any work which you would recommend be carried out.\n\nRelative to the desks, you should state the condition of the double desks at present in use also whether, in your opinion, new single desks are required.

Letter No. 15-1-5 of the 28th ultimo, dealing with report made by Public School Inspector when recently he visited the Moravian Bay School;\n\nI would say that the Inspector should state definitely what sort of closets he would recommend installed; I interviewed the Teacher to see if the Inspector had suggested to him what kind should be installed, and he tells me that the Inspector recommended the chemical closets installed in the basement, but the Teacher told him that these were put in at a former Indian School where he taught, and in less than one year had to be taken out and kept out.\n\nI know of several cases where the Inspector asked to have these installed inside, and later had to be torn out, and it was proved that the Inspector had received a bonus from the Firm that placed them for his service in recommending them.\n\nI think it will be possible to repair the present closets so that they will be satisfactory for a couple or three years, at a cost of not more than $15.00, but would say that by that time something more modern should be erected.\n\nI already have your approval for installing sink and drain, and think it can be done during summer vacation at a cost not to exceed $30.00.\n\nAs to desks now in use at this school, they are not modern nor up to date, still it would seem to me sort of extravagant to discard them at present, but possibly it would be wise to include this expenditure in the estimates in the next year or two.\n\nYours Obediently,\n\nNelson Stone,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 10, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to the report of the Public School Inspector on the condition of the toilets at the Moraviantown Indian Day School. We note that it will be possible to repair the present closets, so that they will be satisfactory for a further period, at a cost of approximately $15. You may arrange to have these closets repaired and placed in a good, sanitary condition. This work should be carried out at the same time as the sink and drain are being installed, and should be completed before the school reopens after the present summer holidays. Please forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nIt is noted that the desks can be used for a further period. Should any repairs be required, you may arrange to have same made, so that these desks will be of service for the next school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

I made request to your Department for pictures and moulding on which to hang the pictures. The pictures were sent, but after writing you twice about the moulding, I received no instructions re the purchase of the same. Since the pictures were sent, I took it for granted you wished to have them properly hung on the walls, after consulting with Mr. Stone purchased the moulding and placed the same.\nOn the walls about 90 ft. in all, without purchase charge. This involved the purchase of hooks, wire etc.\n\nYour agent authorized the purchase of a few strips of lumber for repairing the doors. The work is being done without purchase charge.\n\nMr. Stone also authorized the purchase of a small table for the sewing class.\n\nPermission was granted from your department for necessary repairs in and about the school.\n\nSurely it is not necessary that permission be granted from your department for every item of expenditure. The judicious use of the agent and teacher together should be satisfactory evidence to your department that the work is being carefully done and the money is being judiciously spent.\n\nI trust this explanation will be satisfactory to your department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

INSPECTOR PEARSON,\ndated October 30th, 1928, on his inspection\nof the MORAVIANTOWN Indian Day School.\n\nOriginal on File 15-1-6.\n\nThis school is urgently in need of new seats. The ones in use are the old double type, the seat and back consisting of separate boards, and the desk top is in two parts and hinged. You could assist the teacher greatly by including the cost of new seats in your estimate for the next year.\n\nIndividual or paper towels should be supplied.\nOttawa, November 9, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Moraviantown Indian Day School, recommends that new school desks be provided to replace the present old double desks now in use.\n\nI should be pleased to have your recommendation as to whether you would advise that new desks be furnished or not. If you recommend that new desks be supplied, you should furnish full particulars as to the size and number of each size of single desk required. From the returns received, it is considered that single desks to accommodate 30 children would be ample for the needs of this school and, if these were arranged in four rows of six of the same size to each row, with a front and rear seat, accommodation would be provided for 30 pupils.\n\nI may say, for your information, that desks are manufactured in the following sizes:\n\n- No. 1 for Adults,\n- No. 2 for Pupils 15-18 Yrs.,\n- No. 3 for Pupils 12-14 Yrs.,\n- No. 4 for Pupils 10-12 Yrs.,\n- No. 5 for Pupils 7-9 Yrs.,\n- No. 6 for Pupils 5-7 Yrs.\n\nIf you consider that these new desks should be supplied as recommended by the Inspector, you should furnish full particulars as requested, also give full shipping directions. When we have this information, consideration will then be given as to whether they can be supplied or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nNelson Stone, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHighgate, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to Dept., Letter No. 15-1-5, of the 9th inst., relative to having new single desks installed in the Moravian Day School;\n\nI would say that this matter was fully discussed by Dept. and myself, in Dept., Letter No. 15-1-5, of June 28/28 and my reply dated July 6/28.\n\nHowever, if Dept. feel that we should carry out the recommendation of School Inspector, I would suggest the purchase of the single desks next summer and have them installed during mid-summer vacation;\n\nDo not think immediate action is urgent, as the teacher told me in June, that while the desks were old-fashioned, he did not think them uncomfortable for pupils.\n\nWould like to see School & all equipment kept up to standard, but do not like to see any property wasted or discarded needlessly.\n\nYours Obediently,\n\nNelson Stone, Indian Agent.\n\nSEC.

You might bring this matter to the attention of the Department at that time, giving full particulars as to the size and number of each size of desk you would recommend be supplied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I would like to try this scheme for a term. I would suggest that a grant be given for Christmas pleasure and that these be awarded according to faithfulness in attendance, except in cases of sickness and that a similar grant be given at the end of June. I believe prizes would work like magic on some parents as well as on children.\n\nI would also like also to see some more practical operation to prizes to pupils passing the Entrance Examinations. I am\nwilling to offer a five dollar prize of my own to the pupil taking highest standing in passing the Entrance Examination; but it would be a mistake to award nothing to the others who pass. I have three pupils or maybe four who will probably write that exam. The awarding of prizes I believe would stimulate somewhat their efforts and I believe would be a good investment.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTeacher.\nOttawa, November 22nd, 1928.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, requesting that a grant be provided to purchase prizes or other gifts to be awarded the pupils of the Moraviantown Indian Day School at Christmas and also at the end of the present academic year in June, next.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $12 in the purchase of these supplies for the pupils at Christmas. You should obtain itemized accounts, in duplicate, and you should hand same to Mr. Agent Stone, in order that he can certify and send them to the Department for payment.\n\nThe Department would favourably consider the granting of a similar grant at the end of June, next, and you should make application through the office of your local Indian Agent about the 1st of June, next.\n\nIt is not the practice of the Department to provide prizes for pupils passing the entrance examination.\n\nThe Department desires that in future you forward all requests through the office of your local Indian Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Letter No. 15-1-5 of the 23rd inst., and would say in reply, that I am going to give you a little explanation in regard to this grant for a treat to the children of Moravian Day School.\n\nSince my appointment as Agent, I have expended from Six to Ten Dollars each year purchasing candy, nuts, oranges & popcorn, and Mrs. Stone got material and made fancy Christmas snacks & ribbons for each pupil, and these were distributed at closing of school for Xmas holidays.\n\nI am pleased to learn that Dept. have agreed to relieve Mrs. Stone & myself from this expenditure of money & time & work.\n\nRev. C.W. McKenzie wrote me & also interviewed me yesterday on this matter, and I wish to state to Dept. that I can not agree with his method of handling this grant.\n\nHe wants, so he tells me, to purchase a treat of candy etc., for some and toys & prizes for others, and have these placed on the Xmas tree of the United Church for distribution, and in this way help their United Church Xmas Entertainment.\n\nThere is an Anglican Church on this Reserve, of about same numbers as United Church, and in my opinion any grant from Dept. for distribution of a treat to School, said distribution should take place at school and before close for Xmas holiday.\n\nFurthermore, if candy etc., is purchased for some pupils, toys & other gifts for others, dissatisfaction is sure to result;\n\nI would suggest to have Mr. McKenzie purchase a prize worth one Dollar for the pupil in each form that has been most faithful in attendance during year, and have the balance $12.00 used by me to purchase the same treat for all pupils & Mrs. Stone & I will get the fancy snacks and have prizes & treat distributed at School, by Teacher.\n\nPlease advise me at an early date as to your decision in this regard.\n\nYours Obediently,\n\nNelson Stone, Ind.

In this connection I have to request that you will inform Mr. McKenzie that it is intended this amount will be expended in the supplying of a treat to the children, and that the distribution of candy and other articles must take place at the school, and that it is for the benefit of all the children who attend.\n\nMr. McKenzie should arrange for the purchase of a prize of approximately $1 in value for the pupil in each form who has been most faithful in attendance during the year, and the balance of the grant should be used in the purchase of supplies for all the pupils.\n\nYou should show this letter to Mr. McKenzie, and he should be guided by the Department's instructions in the distribution of the treat to the pupils.\n\nIn our letter authorizing Mr. McKenzie to incur the expenditure mentioned above, he was instructed that in future he was to forward all requests through your office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Crosby & Son;\n\nAs we have the same Indian acting as janitor at Council-Hall & School, and he purchases supplies for both together, it is next to impossible for either him or me to place each item purchased where it should be charged;\n\nHowever, in this bill possibly two brooms were for school and balance for Council-Hall, but I am marking out \"School\" on voucher and charging total to Council-Hall or Band funds.\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory to Department, I am\u2014\n\nYours Obediently,\n\nNelson Stone, Indian Agent.\n\nSEC. DEPT. OF IND. AFF.\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. INSPECTOR PEARSON,\nDATED MAY 8, 1929, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE\nMORAVIANTOWN INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 15-1-6.\n\nThe drainage is not satisfactory. A better outlet for the tile from the basement is necessary.\n\nI would recommend that you make sure that the flag pole is safe. If not, it should be replaced. If so, it should be equipped with a rope.\n\nThe basement windows should be repaired. They would not be so apt to be broken off, if they hinged to swing sideways.\n\nForty new seats are urgently needed. The ones in use are the old double type, the seat and back consist of several separate boards, and the desk top is in two parts, and hinged.\n\nThere is the danger of the spread of skin disease, which some pupils appear to have. Individual or paper towels would help to prevent this.\nOttawa, May 28th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Moraviantown Indian Day School, states that the drainage is not satisfactory and that a better outlet for the tile from the basement is necessary. He also draws attention to the condition of the flag pole. He states that if the present pole is not in a safe condition it should be replaced; and that if considered satisfactory, it should be equipped with the necessary rope, guy wire, etc. He further recommends that the flag poles be repaired, and that they would not be so apt to be broken off if hinged to swing sideways. You should arrange to have the above repairs carried out, keeping all costs as low as possible, and you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of any work which has been performed.\n\nThe Inspector further recommends that new desks be supplied. He states the ones at present in use are of the old double type and unsatisfactory. The Department will be prepared to consider the supplying of new desks during the coming summer holidays if you consider that same are necessary. For your information I may say that desks are manufactured in the following sizes:\n\n| No. | Size |\n|-----|------|\n| 1   | adults |\n| 2   | pupils 15 to 15 yrs. |\n| 3   | 12 to 14 yrs. |\n| 4   | 10 to 12 yrs. |\n| 5   | 7 to 9 yrs. |\n| 6   | 5 to 7 yrs. |\n\nYou should consider the number of rows of desks that could be arranged in the classroom, and it would be advisable to have each row of the same size of desk, with a front and rear seat. You might consult the teacher and, if you recommend that these new desks be supplied, you should furnish information as asked for. Shipping directions should also be given.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nNelson Stone, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHighgate, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

C.W. MacKenzie, Thamesville, Ont., R.R. #3, for payment made for shrubbery, bulbs & plants for school border.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. I5-I-5, dated May 3/28.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nNelson Stone,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101.\nHighgate, Ont., July 10/29\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to Dept. Letter # I5-I-I of June 13/39, I would say, that today I had word from Rev. Harold Wilding that he could not state at what date he would arrive at this agency, as his youngest son had recently been under operation.\n\nWould say that I intended to consult with Mr. Wilding on his arrival as to size and number of seats & desks to install at Moravian Day School and try and have these installed during vacation season, but unless he arrives early in August or before, it will be too late to order and have desks & seats delivered & installed before opening of school.\n\nDo not know that it is really necessary or compulsory to do this work just now, nor would it be wise for me to go ahead and do so without consulting with Mr. Wilding.\n\nRev. Arthur Burner, acting for Home Mission Board of United Church of Canada, has asked me to recommend to Indian Department enlargement & improvement to teacherage, this to be effected as soon as convenient after arrival of Rev. Wilding at Moraviantown; I hesitate to do this, as I feel the present plan combining the teaching & preaching to one individual is not in some respects very satisfactory, and may not be permanent, as the Anglicans are about as strong & numerous in membership as United Church.\n\nHowever the present residence is far too small for any family, and is constructed in such a way that enlargement is very difficult.\n\nCan not see what was the idea of erecting a house or stable like this one at that date, one story small cottage with cellar under one corner, and too deep for proper drainage of cellar, one small bedroom; Had they put 2 story higher, bedrooms upstairs, it would have cost but little more and now it would not require enlarging; the stable with loft above has never been used only as garage and a garage could have been built at \u00bd cost of stable;\n\nWould like to be advised at an early date as to what would be your wish in these matters and I will try and carry out your wish;\n\nYours obediently,\n\nNelson Stone, Ind. Agent\n\nSEC. DEPT. OF IND.

Harold Wilding as soon as he arrives to commence duties. You should obtain and forward full information as requested in our letter dated May 25th, last.\n\nRelative to the repairs required to the teacher's residence, I have to say that you will be informed in a separate communication regarding this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nNelson Stone, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHighgate, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to Department Letter No.15-1-5 of date July 17/29, would say that Rev. Harold Wilding has just arrived at Moraviantown, and I immediately interviewed him in regard to new desks for Day School;\n\nHe states, that not being familiar with the school, we cannot furnish the Department with the number or size of desks or seats required until school opens, and then have them ordered to arrive in time to install at Xmas holidays;\n\nTrusting this will meet with your approval, I am-\n\nYours Obediently,\n\nNelson Stone, Indian Agent;\nDear Sir,\n\nI wrote Department Aug. 13/29, stating that owing to change of Teacher at Moravian Day School at mid-summer, it would be impossible to report to Department in regard to size and number of seats required for school, but when school would open and Rev. Harold Wilding became familiar with school, we would then furnish this statement to Department and have seats ordered to arrive for installation at Xmas;\n\nRev. Wilding has since opening of school, conferred with me on the matter and we have concluded, with approval of Department, to have them sent along promptly and we will try and arrange to have them installed some week-end Mr. Wilding considers the present seats very uncomfortable for pupils;\n\nIn Dept. Letter No. I5-I-5 of May 28/29, information was given in the matter of sizes of desks etc;\n\nWe would ask for 6 complete desks No. I. and One Front and One Back seat;\n6 2\n6 3\n7 4\n7 5\n\nThere will be 5 rows of seats, single adjustable preferred;\nWould like to have a Teacher's Desk too, as the present one is out of condition;\nShip Via, C.N.R., Bothwell, Ont;\n\nYours Obediently;\n\nNelson Stone, Indian Agent;\n\nSEC.

The Department will leave this matter in your hands to distribute these old desks among the Indian homes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nNelson Stone, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHighgate, Ont.\nOttawa, December 10th, 1929,\n\nSir:\n\nI inspected the Moravian of Thames Agency on Monday the 25th ultimo and beg to submit the following report.\n\nI visited the one Day school on the reserve. This school is in charge of the Rev. Harold Wilding who is also the Missionary. Twenty-two pupils were present. The teacher reports attendance very good. Emerson Snake, Truant Officer, is an efficient officer and attending to his duties. There is a good live atmosphere in the school. The pupils are a bright healthy looking lot. Agent Stone states that the Rev. Wilding takes a deep interest in the welfare of the pupils at school and in their homes.\n\nSeven pupils from this school are attending vocational and high schools in Chatham and London and are making excellent progress. All the school pupils have been vaccinated.\n\nThe school is a brick building and is in very fair condition. The residence in connection with the school has been greatly improved by the addition built last year by the Department. The school and residence is an example of care and tidiness to our Indian people.\n\nThere are a few small improvements needed at the school and recommended.\n\nA book case for library books. The teacher has been given a quantity of used books for the use of the pupils and has no place to keep them. A suitable book case could be built locally at a small cost.\n\nA porcelain water container with tap for drinking water for use in the classroom, also \u00bd doz. drinking cups. These articles can be procured locally by Agent Stone.\n\nIf the lower half of the three east windows were frosted or given a coat of white lead, it would improve the light conditions. The teacher is anxious to have this done.\n\nThos. McGookin,\nInspector.\nOttawa, December 21st, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector McGookin, in a report on his visit to the Moraviantown Indian Day School, states that the following are required at this school:\n\n(1) Bookcase for library books. The Inspector states that a suitable bookcase could be built locally at small cost, and I have to request that you will arrange to have a local carpenter build a bookcase of the size required. No unnecessary expense should be incurred or expensive materials used. Locks with keys should be provided for the doors, and the bookcase painted or stained to match the general appearance of the room.\n\n(2) A porcelain water container with tap for use in the classroom, also half a dozen drinking cups. The Inspector states that these articles can be procured locally, and I have to request that you will arrange to purchase a water container of a size and type considered satisfactory, also 6 drinking cups.\n\n(3) The lower half of the three east windows should be frosted or given a coat of white lead. The Inspector states that if this were done it would improve lighting conditions and that the teacher is anxious to have these windows attended to as mentioned above. You may therefore arrange to have this work done.\n\nAfter you have carried out the above authorized work, you should forward certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred. These matters should receive your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nNelson Stone, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHighgate, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6146, File 413-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nReplying to Departmental letter #15-1-5 of the 21st inst., relative to equipment for use of Moravian Day School, and which Inspector Mr. Gookin recommends to have installed promptly, I would say in regard to article No. 1, Bookcase for library books, that the Teacher, \"Rev. Harold Wilding\" requested me not to have this bookcase placed in the schoolroom as there was actually no place or room for it and actually no need of it as these books referred to, are not the regular library books.\n\nAfter going into the matter more closely, I quite agree with the Teacher that the schoolroom is already plenty small for the furniture and equipment therein, and to add more would not be wise; The books referred to are housed in entrance shelves, and are apparently more conveniently stored than in the small schoolroom;\n\nArticle No. 3, Porcelain Water Container with tap for use in centre hall not in class room as your letter states, and also drinking cups;\n\nThe Porcelain container with tap, should be a splendid sanitary article, but I may have to wait until I get to Chatham or London to purchase one as regards the cups, we purchased individual drinking cups a little over a year ago on recommend of the teacher of that date, Rev. Mr. Kenzie, but I now understand that many of the cups are missing and but few if any fit for use;\n\nArticle No. 3, frosting lower half of east windows;\n\nThis work could not possibly be done in cold weather, neither would it remain done for long if the work was done in cold weather, frosting would have to be inside and outside, and glass must be warm or the work will not last for long;\n\nAs Department request to give this matter my early attention, I am simply writing to state that it would be unwise, as I view it, to do other than I have stated;\n\nYours Obediently,\n\nNelson Stone, Indian Agent.\n\nSEC. DEPT. OF IND. AFF.\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nOttawa, December 28th, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 24th ultimo, relative to the equipment which you were authorized to have installed at the Moraviantown Indian Day School. Regarding the supplying of a bookcase, I have to say that, if the books are not intended for school purposes, they should be removed to the teacher's residence and not take up the room provided for the pupils' coats, hats, etc. The Department understands that it was the teacher's own suggestion that a small cupboard be provided to prevent the books from being stolen or mislaid. I shall be pleased to hear further from you in this matter.\n\nIt is noted that you will arrange to obtain prices for the supplying of a water container and that you will have the windows frosted when weather conditions permit.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The building as planned is of frame construction on a concrete foundation with a low pressure steam system of heating. In the specifications for the building care has been exercised in providing only what is absolutely necessary for the operating of the school. Everything is included in the plans and specifications with the exception of the water supply system for the building, and the sewage disposal system. It is impossible to include these items as we have not sufficient detailed information in order to prepare the necessary plans and specifications.\n\nIt is rather difficult owing to the location of the building, as all of the materials have to be transported a distance of 35 miles and ferried across the river, to arrive at an accurate estimate of the cost, but I am of the opinion that the building can be built for approximately $75,000. The plans have been approved by Doctor Westgate and Canon Gould.\n\nWill you please advise me the newspapers in which advertisements may be inserted inviting tenders for this building, I beg to submit for your consideration that we advertise in Edmonton, Calgary and Battleford.\n\nARCHITECT.\nMemorandum,-\n\nHon. Charles Stewart.\n\nIncl.\n\nI beg to send herewith a memorandum from the Architect of the Department, with reference to the proposed new Church of England school at Onion Lake, Sask.

The average attendance in most cases is good. The teacher is very capable and energetic young man and takes a personal interest in the community life of the band.\n\nThe classroom walls are dingy and patched. They should be painted or calcimined as soon as funds are available. The six window lights on the east side of the classroom if painted over with white lead would give a more comfortable light in the room and do away with the need for window shades. The cost would be negligible.\n\nThos.

J.A. Ward, Teacher, reported to me when I visited school early in June, that Inspector had been there the day before and stated three new blinds should be promptly installed to replace three that were badly worn and torn. I immediately asked Mr. Beattie to quote me price of shades of this type, as none of the local dealers carry these shades in stock. He wrote away and ordered 3 shades to match the old ones, and when these arrived, I had received Dept. letter #15-1-5 of June 26/35 where Inspector reported light colored blinds were badly needed for the school; the old shades were very dark as were the three Mr. Beattie had ordered.\n\nI asked Mr. Beattie to return the three new dark ones and have six light colored ones supplied, did this after much consideration and if I have acted wrongly in this matter I am very sorry, but did it for what seemed best to me;\n\nYours Very Truly,\n\nNelson Stone,\nIndian Agent;\n\nSEC.

The top is 39 by 39 inches and four inches thick up to six inches in the center, with the approval of the Department I can have an Indian make a new top, a very satisfactory one for about $5.00.\n\nI would like the approval of the Department to have a couple of decorators give an estimate of the cost of redecorating the walls of the Moravian Day School, also a small amount of plastering, the walls are awfully dirty and smokey.

There will be ten, ten inch steps, instead of eight to porch landing. I recommend tearing down porch and closing entrance on the East corner, and filling in door way with the same construction as original, which is brick. On the south corner there is a larger porch and roof, which covers entrance to basement, I would recommend filling in door way, as on East corner, and letting roof of porch down to a proper height, to cover entrance to basement, sealing the same in with material from balance of porch.\n\nAs for the furnace the janitor made some minor repairs last winter, which put all in fair shape. The ash pit door has been broke for some time, I took the matter up with a local Hardware Co. last winter, but it seemed hard to get repairs for this certain furnace; I am informed a firm in Thamesville installed this furnace. I will take the matter up with them at the first opportunity.\n\nI would further like to draw\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa Canada.\nI would further like to draw your attention to, and recommend an expenditure of $25.00 to make repairs on chimney of the school, this is a very large chimney and there is a projection at the top of about 8 or 10 courses of brick which are falling out, this should be taken out and built straight up, with a cement cap on top. The most work in connection with this work will be putting up a scaffold. I am mentioning this, so the work can be done while a brick layer is engaged.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nStuart Spence,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, Ontario,\nJuly 11, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 6th instant with reference to the repairs required at the Moravian Day School.\n\nIn preparing our appropriation for the current fiscal year, it was found possible to include an amount of $125 only for repairs on this school. We have already expended $50 in removing the old cistern and building a new one. This leaves a balance of $75 available for additional repairs. You may expend this amount to the best advantage.\n\nIt is understood, of course, that the $75 will include the cost of both material and labour.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division\n\nS.

There is a great amount of rubbish in the basement. It should be removed. There are no electric lights, though power is available. The front steps are rotted. One entrance would answer for this school instead of three. I would judge that it is many years since this building was painted. It is in a very unsatisfactory condition at present. Toilet paper should be provided. A new roof will be a necessity in the near future. There are very few hooks left in the cloakrooms.\"\n\nIn the current year's appropriation an amount of $175.00 was provided for repairs and improvements at this school.

The chimney of the school is in a dangerous condition and needs repairing. It will require about 8 or 10 courses of brick removed from the top, and built straight up the same as the main body of the chimney, the top projects out and bricks are falling out, the top to be covered with a 4\" concrete cap. I can have this work done by a reliable contractor for $47.00 material supplied, the most work in regards to repairing the chimney will be building a scaffold.\n\nThe porch and steps on the North East side to be removed, also the South West side steps to be removed and porch to be lowered to make a porch over entrance to basement, this work can be done by Fred Stonefish an Indian of the Band well qualified to do the work, and is available @ 25\u00a2 per hour.\nI would also like to build a new fence around the school yard, which will require 60 rods of fencing and I would recommend a No. 9 gauge, 9 wire, 47\" high, with 12 uprights to the rod. This fence, either a Frost or Lundy fence will cost 73\u00a2 per rod. It will require thirty cedar posts for corner posts, braces, and gate posts, and 30 steel posts, the large corner posts and gate posts which will require 19 posts @ 40\u00a2 each, 11 small braces @ 25\u00a2 each and 30 steel posts @ 51\u00a2 each, also 33 lbs of brace wire @ 6\u00a2 per lbs and 50\u00a2 worth of staples, making a total cost of material $72.10\u00a2. I recommend steel posts due to so many trees around the yard, which will be a saving in labour digging holes, the fence row along the back of the school is hedge of large pine trees, and here there is practically no fence at all, these trees was never trimmed and are dangerous on account of grass fires.\n\nPerhaps I can arrange to have old fence removed for old posts and portion of fence that might be of any use. The fence also can be built by Indian labour, and 20\u00a2 per hour. I would estimate all Indian labour at around $40.00.\n\nIf these arrangements meet with the approval of the Department, I would be pleased with an accountable advance of $50.00 to take care of Indian labour in connection with this expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nStuart Spence\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa Canada.\nOttawa,\nJuly 21, 1932.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th instant you may arrange for the following repairs and improvements at the Moravian Indian day school:\n\n1. Repair side entrances and chimney at a cost of $47.00 for material and labour.\n\n2. Repair porch and steps.\n\n3. Build a new fence at a cost of $72.10 for material.\n\nUnder separate cover you will be forwarded an accountable cheque for $50.00 to provide the cost of the Indian labour that will be used in making the repairs mentioned above.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nS.

I would say that these desks are not complete without a seat for the back desk.\n\nI trust that this is clear, and I will hold the accounts of the Globe Furniture Co., anticipating your reply.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nStuart Spence,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa Canada.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 9, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant please forward the account covering the cost of the 7 school desks supplied to the Moravian Indian Day School in order that payment can be made for them.\n\nI am communicating with the Globe Furniture Company and asking them to forward to you 1 front. This will complete the row of desks.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. S. Spence,\nIndian Agent,\nHighgate, Ont.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 9, 1940.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nOn our purchase order No. 29295 of the 14th ultimo we ordered 7 No. 3 single school desks for the Moravian Indian Day School.\n\nIt is now found that 1 front No. 3 is required to complete the seating arrangements and I should appreciate it if you would forward this front to Mr. S. Spence, Indian Agent, Highgate, Ontario. Your account in triplicate should also be forwarded to him.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nThe Globe Furniture Co., Ltd.,\nWaterloo, Ont.\nHighgate January 9th, 1940\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reference to your letter of December 4th, 1939 Department file No. 15-1-5 in regards to an estimate of the cost of closing three windows on the East side of the Moravian school room and opening a window on the west side, I would estimate this alteration would cost $100.00.\n\nSince recommending this alteration and upon the receipt of your letter asking for this estimate, I have made enquiries of Mr. Pearson, School Inspector, and a school board that made these alterations, and I have formed an opinion that by carrying out the above mentioned alterations there would be insufficient light. The Inspector informed me that there should be lighting space a fifth of the floor space of the class room.\n\nThe Moravian school room is much larger than the average rural school it being 26\u00bd x 31 ft long, and in order to comply with the Inspectors views five windows on the east side of the school would not be a fifth of the floor space, and would take up all the space of the west side of the building. Mr. Pearson is making a further inspection in the near future and is making a report of his views in this matter. I would be pleased with his report before any further action was taken, as he has had considerable experience of this nature in his districts.\n\nIf window lighting is not sufficient perhaps artificial lights could be used, as they are available.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa Canada.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nStuart Spence\nIndian Agent\nOttawa,\nJanuary 12, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 9th instant it is considered inadvisable to take any further action with reference to closing three windows on the east side of the Moravian Day School and opening a window on the west side.\n\nI note that you are making further inquiries but in any case it will not be possible to consider the expenditure that will be necessary until after April 1.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. S.

Ross the Moravian Day School teacher, to take up the matter of sinking a water well for the use of the teachers residence. Mr. and Mrs. Ross as well as other Missionaries have had to use water from the school well, which is a community well, in fact it is used by every one, and in a lot of cases not in a very sanitary way. Mrs. Ross has had each school child supply themselves with a water cup, as a prevention of spreading disease.\n\nYou will note in Dr. D.L. Stewart's monthly reports and accounts that syphilis is quite prevalent, and among those who have no other source of water supply other than the school. The children as well as adults continually drink water from the well by using their hand under the pump spout; this practice has been discouraged with some success.\n\nI would be pleased with the authority of the Department to sink a surface well for the use of the residence. I am sure a surface well could be had for the digging. I estimate this would require an expenditure of approximately $50.00 which would include digging, bricklaying, pump and plumbing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nStuart Spence,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa Canada.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 22nd instant, if you feel reasonably assured that you can secure water the Department approves an expenditure not exceeding $50.00 in digging a well at the teacher's residence or the Moravian Indian Day School.

Some form of dust layer should be provided. The caretaker should be required to scrub the floor at least monthly. In general the work of the caretaker is only fair. The steps are in a dangerous condition. They should be repaired at once. The furnace should be repaired or replaced. Additional hooks should be provided for the cloakrooms.\nOttawa,\nMay 6, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reporting on his inspection of the Moravian Indian Day School on the 29th ultimo Inspector Pearson states that the steps are in a dangerous condition and require immediate repairs. He also recommends that the furnace be repaired and that additional hooks be provided for the cloakrooms.\n\nYou may purchase the hooks that are needed and you may arrange for the repairs to the steps. Please let me know what it would cost to repair the furnace.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. S. Spence,\nIndian Agent,\nHighgate, Ont.\nHighgate June 12th, 1941\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of May 6th Department file No. 15-1-5, regarding Inspector Pearson's report of repairs to Moravian Day School.\n\nRegarding repairs to the school steps, they will have to be replaced by new ones, of which I have had Mr. Chas Hubbell of Thamesville Ontario local contractor give an estimate of the cost; at present the school steps are to seep, and I suggest a longer set of steps, of which Mr. Hubbell will install for $65.00, this will include 9, 7\u00bd\" risers and one cement bottom seep. The wooden steps are to be two, 2 x 6 cedar planks 10 ft. long, this is to be set on a cement foundation and given two coats of paint, also side railings.\n\nMr. N.A. Sharp of the Engineering Construction Service of the Department visited the Agency recently and approved of the above.\n\nIn reference to the school furnace, I have to state that this is a very old furnace and just what is wrong with it. \"I am unable to say the only complaint I have is that it smokes this no doubt could be stopped, I am of the opinion this old furnace is just as good as any furnace for burning wood, and wood is all that is used, I would like to report later concerning this matter.\n\nWhile Mr. Sharp was here\nWhile Mr Sharp was here I had him take measurements of the school with the view of painting inside and out. Mrs Ross the teacher has arranged to have the Indian School teachers convention here this Fall, and we would like to be looking our best; would appreciate your approval of these expenditures.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nStuart Spence,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa Canada.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant with reference to the new steps at the Moravian Indian Day School. The amount mentioned in your letter, namely, $65.00, appears rather high for a set of steps for an Indian day school. Your letter is not exactly clear but I am of the impression that you are building a platform 10' long. Why is it necessary to supply a platform of such length?\n\nWith reference to the exterior and interior painting of the school you should let me have an estimate of its cost, also a requisition for the material required, and a decision will then be made regarding the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. S. Spence,\nIndian Agent,\nHighgate, Ont.\nHighgate July 11th, 1941\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of June 17th Department file No.15-1-5 regarding new steps for the Moravian Day School.\n\nFirst I wish to state there is no platform being built, the steps lead up to a porch covering the front entrance of the school. This porch has a floor which is in good condition other than paint.\n\nThe material for the steps alone will cost in the neighbourhood of $35.00, the steps are 10 ft. wide, this is the width of the porch. In my letter of June 12th regarding this matter I recommended a longer set of steps, than the old ones, as they are too steep, this requires new concrete foundation, which adds considerably to the cost.\n\nNew steps can be built on the old foundation which will reduce the cost, I would estimate about $30.00 or perhaps more.\n\nRegarding the exterior and interior of painting the school I estimate it will require about 12 or 15 gallons of paint for two coats inside and out, at an estimated cost of $60.00, being $4.00 per gallon for 15 gallons. Estimate labour at $125.00 this will include washing the ceiling and walls of the interior, and outside wood work cleaned and brushed before painting.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa Canada.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nStuart Spence\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 15, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 11th instant, you may arrange for the erection of new steps at the Moravian Indian Day School. It is noted that the material will cost approximately $35.00 and that labour will cost $30.00.\n\nRegarding the painting of the exterior and interior of the school, you should let me know the colour of paint required and also the number of gallons required for interior and the number of gallons for exterior painting. It will be necessary to purchase this through our Purchasing Branch and the information just mentioned is required before requisition can be issued.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Stuart Spence,\nIndian Agent,\nHighgate, Ont.\nHighgate July 17th, 1941\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of July 15th, Department file No. 15-1-5 regarding painting the exterior and interior of Moravian Day School.\n\nI recommend that paint be requisitioned for as follows:\n\n3 gal of cream colour for ceiling.\n2 gal \" Medium Buff colour for side walls.\n2 gal \" Leather Brown colour for base, doors, and windows.\n5 gal \" white outside paint for exterior.\n1 qt varnish for desks teachers table and chairs.\n2 gal \" turpentine.\n2 gal \" paint oil.\n\nTrusting this meets with your approval,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nStuart Spence,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa Canada.\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nMoravian Indian Day School\n\nVOTE 76 Allotment 10 - 691\n\nSHIP TO Stuart Spence, Indian Agent, Highgate, Ont.\n\nPurpose for which required\n\nNOTE: Requisition for non-consumable equipment, state if New Issue or Replacement.\n\nconsumable equipment and supplies use columns 1 and 2.\n\n| Quantity | Unit Price | TOTAL |\n|----------|------------|-------|\n|          |            |       |\n\n3\u00bd gallons Paint, cream, for interior\n\n3\u00bd \" med. buff, \"\n\n2 \" leather brown \"\n\n5 gallons paint, white, for exterior\n\n1 quart Varnish, for Desks, etc.\n\n2 gallons Turpentine\n\n2 \" Paint oil\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

Mr. Dodson states that on these dark cloudy days it is quite difficult for pupils to see the black board, and further he states he could use visual instructions with lantern slides if Hydro Electric was installed.\n\nMoved voted and carried that the matter of installing lights be referred to the Department for their consideration. This matter was discussed, and I believe the Band would from their funds either install lights or pay electric accounts to get lights in the school. I informed the Council that the Department was handicapped financially due to existing conditions. My opinion is that lights would be of assistance, your comments on this matter would be appreciated.\n\nStuart Spence\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nNovember 24, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to minute of the Moravian Council meeting with regard to installing electricity in the classroom at the Moraviantown School, I may say that it is not the practice of the Department to make such an installation in an Indian day school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

This style of furnace was specially designed for installation in homes that have been built without any provision having been made for a pipe furnace. No piping or stacking is required, thus eliminating the cutting into of walls.\n\nThe installation is very simple and can be made by any handy man. The pipeless furnaces are also large enough to heat large halls, churches and schools, and will give good satisfaction. Every series and size of \"NEW IDEA\" Furnaces are made in the pipeless systems with choice of three styles of installation\u2014floor grating, partition register or wall deflector.\n\nSee page 34 for detailed specifications.\n\nWE MAKE A SIZE AND STYLE FOR EVERY NEED\nAll New Idea Furnaces Can Be Supplied in Three Pipe Systems As Illustrated\n\nThree Pipe Circulating System\n\nThe three pipe system has solved the heating problems of many homes. This system is equally installed in an old building as in a new one. With it you do not have to worry about getting heat as all of the warm air from the furnace is delivered to the living rooms through one large pipe and register directly over the furnace. Unpleasant floor drafts are eliminated also as the heat is distributed evenly throughout the house. The system is used extensively by the leading builders of Warm Air heat and is extended to the bath or any other distant room that is hard to heat, and with good satisfaction.\n\nThis system is especially adapted to the larger residences, large apartments, modernized and the smaller, compactly built homes, also Stores, Schools, Churches, Halls and factories.\n\nFurnace is shipped complete as illustrated above, with the following list of material furnished as standard equipment. Casting and hood, cast iron pipe, registers, etc., all polished and painted. Furnace is equipped with two cold air registers, two hot air registers and air pipes to wall, warm air registers face plates and two cold air registers face plates. All registers supplied in oxidized copper finish.\n\nSee page 35 for detailed specifications.\n\nPage Twenty-two\n\nSPECIALISTS IN WARM AIR HEATING AND AIR CONDITIONING\nThe No. 23 Hecla Warm Air Furnace\n\nTHE No. 23 HECLA\nFor Wood and for Coal\n\nA new furnace designed to burn both wood and coal, and to give proper results with either fuel.\n\nHas Oval Steel Ribbed Firepot which takes 27\" wood flat, and Individual Close Mesh Grate Bars.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\n| Specification                  | Measurement     |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Size of Firepot               | 27\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" x 18\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)\" |\n| Depth of Firepot to Grate Bars| 15\"             |\n| Grate Surface, Square Inches  | 345\"            |\n| Size of Firedoor              | 13\" x 11\"       |\n| Diameter of Smoke Pipe        | 8\"              |\n| Floor Space Required          | 38\" x 43\"       |\n| Height of Castings            | 50\"             |\n| Height of Furnace, Cased      | 62\"             |\n| Heating Capacity in Cubic Feet| 30,000          |\n| Shipping Weight               | 1100 lbs.       |\n| Warm Air Piping Capacity      | 520\"            |\n\nMade in one piece only\n\nLare Bros. and Co.

The side casings are fluted to give the necessary strength to withstand rough usage that school room heaters sometimes get. The casings are nicely finished and the whole appearance of the heater is neat and pleasing. With its free and even distribution of heat, neat appearance, simplicity of operation, the No. 23 Hecla School Room Heater will be found thoroughly efficient and satisfactory in every way.\n\nClare Bros. and Co.

Dodson, Acting Indian Agent, R.R. #3,\nThamesville, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant, enclosing quotations on a new furnace for the Moraviantown Indian Day School. On reviewing our file I find that the last report on this furnace was contained in a letter from Indian Agent Spence dated June 6, 1938, at which time he stated some minor repairs were required and he later had these done at a cost of $12.25. Since that time Mr. Spence has not mentioned the furnace and under these circumstances it is rather difficult for the Department to understand why this furnace should now be in a deplorable condition as stated in a recent letter from you. I should, therefore, appreciate more detailed information regarding the condition of the present furnace, outlining exactly what is the matter with it. I should also appreciate your stating why you recommend the most expensive installation on which E.S. Hubbell & Sons quote.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nCopy of Mr. Hubbell's estimate of furnace for Mr. Phalen.\n\n1 Hecla #23 Furnace & casing capacity 30,000 c.f.\nOval firepot 27\u00bd X 18\u00bd\nSize fire door 13 X 14\nWeight 1100 pds.\n1 new hot air pipe 24\"\n1 new cold air pipe 16\"\n1 new smoke pipe 8\"\n\nComplete installed $ 265.70\nGRANT'S HARDWARE\nand\nLOCKER STORAGE\nHIGHGATE - ONT.\n\nJuly 31/43\n\nEstimate\nOur Moravian Town School Furnace:\nFigured on air controls, glass areas etc., using all new material except cold air faces already on job:\n\n1 No. 23 Stela, oval fire box\nCombination (coal or wood) \u2014 $176.00\n1 86\" round register \u2014 20.00\n1 cold air face \u2014 1.56\n18 ft. of 12\" cold air pipe \u2014 8.00\n3 - 12\" elbows \u2014 3.00\n20 ft. 16\" cold air pipe \u2014 11.20\n2 - 16\" cold air elbows \u2014 4.00\n1 - 8\" furnace tee \u2014 1.25\n1 - 8\" elbow \u2014 1.00\n5 lengths 8\" furnace pipe \u2014 3.76\n7 ft. 26\" pipe \u2014 6.00\nInstallation \u2014 $50.00\nTotal installed complete \u2014 $290.76\n\nI recommend this installation.\n\nMelvin Grant\nGRANT'S HARDWARE\n\nLOCKER STORAGE\n\nHIGHGATE: Ontario\n\nJuly 31/43\n\nEstimate on Moravian Town school furnace:\nInstalled like old installation, using registers & pipes as they are.\n\nOne furnace, No 23 Nicola, oval top.\nCombination (coal or wood) $176.00\n\nFreight $5.00\nWarm air pipes & smoke pipe $20.00\nInstallation $35.00\n\nInstalled Complete $236.00\n\nMelvin Grant\nR.R.# 3, Thamesville, Ont., July 31, 1943.\n\nMr. Phillip Phalen,\nChief, Training Division\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. M. & R.,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nJuly 15-1-5 July 28.\n\nWhen I used the word 'deplorable' in reference to the furnace in the Moraviantown Day School I did not mean that it was beyond redemption but that it is in a state that requires attention. The school was redecorated just two years ago and the walls are almost as black as ever now. The furnace SMOKEs. When Mr. Doucet was here he remarked about it.\n\nThe furnace has been repaired several times in the past years. In fact one dealer told me he had done it. During Mrs. Ross' term she had the same trouble\u2014SMOKE\u2014\n\nThe furnace, perhaps, could be repaired. As I stated in my letter it is getting more and more difficult to get wood. The supply on the reserve is getting low. Men are difficult to find to cut it. This year we are lacking NINE CORDS in next season's supply.\n\nIf we had a combination coal and wood furnace we would be ready for such an emergency. I appreciate the fact that coal is hard to secure, i.e. Hard Coal.\n\nI am enclosing an estimate I have received today from Mr. Grant. You will note it is the same as Mr. Hubbell's and which I said seemed to be the most satisfactory. The price is lower. Now why did I say this? In putting up a shelter over our cellar entrance we got cheaper lumber and it is very inferior material. We get what we pay for. The best is generally the cheapest in the long run. I considered the highest priced the best.\nThe present furnace is bolted and these become burned off, parts separate, cracks appear, SMOKE, ASHES and DUST are sent into class-room and heat is digested. The newer ones are not bolted but are fused together. There are no gates in the present furnace. Have been burned out no doubt.\n\nIn my opinion the $290 estimate is much too expensive.\n\nIf the Department thinks the present furnace can be repaired with consideration of wood supply in the future might be a factor.\n\nI trust I have made things clear and that the department will be able to do something for us.\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nP.S. I enclose copy of Mr. Hubbell's estimate ON THE SAME FURNACE. You will note that Mr. Grant's estimate is about $30.00 lower.

I found this to be a very short drain, draining into a stone pile in the ground. I removed the stones and tile and built a cesspool five feet in the ground, had a galvanized pipe put direct from the zink to the cesspool. I believe this will be a permanent job.\n\nThe school furnace has been repaired and I am pleased to report that it is practically as good as new. The expense in this connection was more than I expected, but new castings was necessary to make it in good shape. The eavestroughs repairs of the teacherage was completed this required more eavestroughing than I estimated. When we started removing the old, we found more that should come off.\n\nStuart Spence,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa Canada.\n\nI have your letter of November 2nd, 1944 file No. 15-1-5 in reference to my voucher No. 177 for expenditures in connection with the Moravian Day School and teacherage.\n\nOn Mr. Arneils visit May 22nd, 1944 he authorized some new eavetroughing for the teachers residence, the furnace of the Day School repaired and two tons of coal supplied the school, no stated amount was authorized as it was hard to estimate the cost of these repairs. I thought at the time 20 or 30 feet of eavetroughing would put the system of the teacherage in fair shape, but when Mr. Grant got to taking it down more was eaten with rust than I had first thought, about three years ago these eavetroughs was painted, the school furnace was in very poor condition, there was continual reports of it smoking, and there was parts after we had it tore down that was burnt and warped so bad that repairs could not be made other than replacing them with new parts, for instance the large top casting that cost $16.54 was warped in such a shape, that the damper could not be closed with the results it would burn out the damper in a short time, we haven't had a damper on this account for a long time, the outside jacket or casing was beyond repairs and had to be replaced, this is now double with an asbestos lining between, the grates had to be replaced, and the grate frames was warped so that they had to be removed and corrected in order that the grates could be worked, the fire box was all recentered and I would say the furnace is practically as good as new.\n\n(over)\nI have had quite a job getting wood cut for the school since the war, due to a labour shortage, and it was thought that a couple of tons of coal would relieve the situation. I have placed the order for the coal but as yet it has not been delivered.\n\nStuart Spence\nIndian Agent.\nTHE HYDRO-ELECTRIC POWER COMMISSION OF ONTARIO\nPROMOTION DEPARTMENT\n\nReport No. 4493 File No.\n\nMr. Stuart Spence,\nIndian Agent,\nHIGHGATE, Ontario.\n\nTo Date November 1, 1946\n\nSubject Lighting Specifications\nMoravian Day School, Moravian Indian Reserve\n\nEnclosures:\nDrawing No. SL2-1260\nPlates 2, 3 and 7\nAppendix\n\nClassroom Lighting:\n\nThe following specifications apply to tungsten lamps only.\n\nThere are two types of lighting from which a selection may be made.

Good\nseeing conditions cannot be obtained with ceiling\nand upper walls darkened or dulled by age.\n\nTherefore, if there is any doubt about the suita-\nbility of the ceiling and walls, repainting in\naccordance with the foregoing specifications\nshould be done as part of the lighting.\n\nDo not select indirect lighting unless you are\nprepared to have the dust wiped out of the fixtures\nonce a month, and wash them three times a year,\nand to repaint the ceiling white when it becomes\ndiscolored or dull in tone.\n\nWindows at the right of pupils are more of a\nhindrance than a help. Therefore, they should be\nshaded with white Scotch-holland window shades.\nNovember 1, 1946\n\nComments: Continued\n\nIt is evident from the small windows of this school that the daylight illumination is very inadequate. It will therefore be necessary to make liberal use of the artificial lighting in order to overcome the deficiencies that exist at present.\n\nIf the location of the stove pipe interferes with the indicated location of the center row of fixtures, it will be better to move the stove and pipe sufficient to clear the fixtures, than to destroy the uniformity of the lighting by installing the fixtures to one side of the center of the room.\n\nIn a room of this width two rows of fixtures would not be adequate unless it should be that there is a very wide aisle down the centre of the room - 8 feet or more.\n\nThe lighting, if installed according to this plan and specifications, will qualify for a Department of Education grant. The grant must be approved by the local school inspector.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupervising Lighting Engineer\n\n/JDC\nNOTE \u2014 Entrance light 10\" x 4\" Opal glass (ceiling)\nFoyer & cloakroom light 10\" x 4\" Opal glass\non chair hangars\nMETHOD NO.1\nSPECIAL BLACKBOARD FIXTURE\nMAY BE FLUSH OR SURFACE MOUNTED\nUNITS OF THIS TYPE MUST BE ACCURATELY PLACED ACCORDING TO\nMANUFACTURER'S INSTRUCTIONS\n\nMETHOD NO.2\nELLIPICAL ANGLE REFLECTORS\nOUTLETS TO BE SPACED 2'-6\" FROM FRONT WALL.

The cost of installing a good lighting system is small compared to the benefits accruing from it. Some of these benefits are: minimized eye strain, clear seeing from all parts of the room, increased efficiency of teacher, independence of variations in daylight, better progress and fewer examination failures, greater benefits to pupils with subnormal eyes, better discipline, and more cheerful surroundings.\n\nRequirements of the System\n\nThe principal requirements of classroom lighting is that it shall provide evenly distributed illumination of adequate intensity for all desks, with sharp shadows minimized and with the least possible glare.\n\nTypes of Lighting\n\nThere are three types of lighting that may be used for classrooms. The selection will be influenced chiefly by the cost of the fixtures, the provision for cleaning them regularly, and the maintenance of the ceiling in good reflecting condition.\n\nIndirect Tungsten Lighting. See plate 2, groups 1 and 2.\n\nThis is produced by projecting light to the ceiling from which it is distributed throughout the room. Consequently the ceiling MUST be maintained in a highly reflective condition: white or near white.\n\nIndirect lighting involves the use of an inverted bowl or reflector of some sort. Therefore, the dust that collects in them MUST be cleaned out regularly and frequently. Wiping with a dry cloth once a month, and washing at least three times during the school season should be sufficient for ordinary conditions. This is particularly important in rural schools.\nThe quality of properly designed and installed indirect lighting is excellent\u2014softly diffused light that is beneficial to the eyes.\n\n**Semi-direct Tungsten Lighting.** See plate 2, group 4.\n\nThis lighting is produced by enclosing-glass units; No. 1, group 4 is of prismatic glass; units 2 to 5 are of white or milk glass. White glass units to comply with these recommendations must be greater in diameter than in depth.\n\nSemi-direct fixtures are satisfactory if they are of the specified size and shape, and suspended at the specified height.\n\nThe lighting is somewhat less refined in quality than indirect, but does not depreciate quite as rapidly from the accumulation of dust or discoloration of the ceiling.\n\n**Fluorescent Lighting.**\n\nThis is the newest form of lighting. Its higher efficiency makes possible the higher intensities of illumination that are so desirable, without increasing the cost of power used. The only fixtures that should be used in classrooms are those in which no bare tubular lamps are visible from normal viewing angles.\n\nIn school the pupils spend a considerable amount of time looking straight ahead at the blackboard or the teacher. If bare lamps are exposed to view the glare would be objectionable.\n\nProperly planned fluorescent lighting of reasonably high intensity surpasses ordinary tungsten lighting in quality.\n\nWhen fluorescent lighting is to be used on 25 cycle power, the utmost care is needed in the selection of fixtures that will minimize the flicker that is caused by the 25 cycle power.\n\n**Relative Cost.**\n\nFluorescent lighting is very much higher in first cost than tungsten lighting, particularly in 25 cycle districts. Indirect tungsten is next, and semi-direct tungsten the lowest.\nBLACKBOARD LIGHTING\n\nIt is most important that all the pupils be able to see distinctly the work that is written on the blackboards. Most blackboards reflect glaring light that prevents clear seeing. The most effective way of overcoming this is to shade the windows that admit the glaring light and illuminate the blackboards by supplementary units installed especially for the purpose.\n\nMaintenance\n\nAll lighting fixtures collect dust, particularly indirect fixtures of any kind. Dust absorbs and wastes light. This wasted light is paid for but not received. Cleaning of lighting equipment is just as necessary to a lighting system as lubrication to an automobile.\n\nDo not let the ceiling become dull with age. Dark ceilings increase glare and reduce the efficiency of the ceiling.\n\nALLOWANCE FOR DEPRECIATION\n\nIn the preparation of this recommendation an allowance has been made for natural depreciation of the lamps and the accumulation of dust on the lighting equipment between cleaning periods. The lighting will therefore appear higher in intensity when the system is new than it will after a few months' use.\n\nWIRING\n\nThe importance of adequate wiring is evident from the fact that a 10% voltage loss, due to inadequate current-carrying capacity, will cause a light loss of approximately 24%. Where the wire sizes are not noted on the lighting plan there is a table on the drawing which specifies minimum sizes. These sizes are based on a maximum voltage loss of 2%, which is in accordance with good wiring practice. (In no case should wire smaller than No. 12 B & S Gauge be used for branch circuits).\n\nWINDOW SHADES\n\nAttention is directed to the proper use of window shades. They are installed particularly to shield the desks near the windows from direct sunlight.\n\nIt is only under the MOST favourable conditions that the desks farthest from the windows receive fair daylight illumination. When the window shades are drawn over the upper half of\nthe windows, the illumination on desks farthest from the windows may be decreased 60% or more, depending upon local conditions.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis plan has been carefully prepared for this particular school. Emphasis is placed on the importance of providing lighting in accordance with present-day standards. REDUCTION OF THE NUMBER OF FIXTURES, OR THE SUBSTITUTION OF SMALLER LAMPS OR INFERIOR LIGHTING EQUIPMENT WILL RESULT IN INFERIOR LIGHTING THAT WILL NOT PRODUCE THE DESIRED RESULTS. The following steps are necessary in order to take full advantage of the benefits of better lighting.\n\n1. Install the lighting outlets as indicated.\n2. Insist on adequate wiring with wire sizes shown on the drawing.\n3. Install only mogul-socket fixtures for classroom lighting (for tungsten lamps).\n4. Select the type and size of fixture specified.\n5. All electrical work must be approved by your District Electrical Inspector.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupervising Lighting Engineer.\nGRANT'S HARDWARE\n\nLOCKER STORAGE,\nHIGHGATE : Ontario\n\nTo account with Moravian Reserve:\n\nAug. 30/44 Wire 3\" staples 25\u00a2 65\u00a2\nOct. 17/44 To work & repairs on school furnace\n+ Eavestroughing teachers residence\n79 ft. of trough & conductor pipe $14.22\n2 meters 1.00\nbase for school pump 1.75\nbrace & lag screws .50\nset of grate & crank 22.40\ntop casing for radiator & furnace $8.54\ntop casing 9.00\nsafety device 9.00\n6 ft. heat pipe 3.00\nWelding grate frame & smoke damper frame 5.00\nWork done 5.00\n2 lengths smoke pipe 1.20\n1 furnace tile / clock damper 9.60\n$703.84\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nAllet No.76-02-615\n\nPay to: Grant's Hardware,\nAddress: Highgate, Ontario.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Oct. 30 | To material for fence repairs of teacherage, and eavetroughing of teacherage, to repairs and labour repairing Moravian Bay School furnace as per attached accounts | $103.86 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

This project has been successfully administered and enjoyed by all. During the time of installing electric service, the writer had proposed that the Moravian Day School be wired, this did not meet with the approval of the Department.\n\nDuring the past winter the school children and adults received much good and enjoyed once a month in the school room educational films sponsored by the National Film Board. This required a cord strong from the teachers residence some 150 feet from the school to operate the projector. This practice is not only unhandy but dangerous. I have been advised that early this fall and continuing through the winter the Film Board are renewing this service throughout the district, and are arranging their schedule to call at the Moravian Day School once a month, also that films are available to the teacher for educational purposes upon application.\n\nMr. Dodson, the day school teacher, has a projector ordered and expects it in September. Mr. Dodson is doing this himself that is getting the projector for his own use, of which he is going to use on the Reserve for educational purposes.\n\nCould it be possible at this time to have the school wired for electric lights, not only for the use of a projector but for lighting the school on dark days, electric service could be used to advantage in Vocational training of which is carried on under Mr. Dodson with a great deal of interest and success among the Moravian children.\n\nover\nThe Electric service line is 150 feet from the school, and I would estimate the cost of installing the service in the school at around $100.00 with the approval of the Department I would be pleased to get tenders from Local electricians to do this work, submitting the same to the Department for their approval.\n\nStuart Spence,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 26, 1946.\n\nMr. Stuart Spence, Indian Agent,\nHighgate, Ontario.\n\nMoravian Indian Day School\n\nRef. your letter of August 15\n\nIn order to further a programme of visual education at the above school, the Department approves of its being wired for electrical lighting.\n\nIt is understood that tenders will amount to about $100.00.

Am pleased you may be able to be present.\n\nMr. agent Spence has written re getting hydro into our school... I hope this can be accomplished. We can make good use of it in visual education projects.\n\nSincerely,\n\nFred J. Godden\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nOur school supply requisition was late in being sent in. Up to date no supplies have been received.\n\nI am purchasing equipment for Visual Education in classroom and on Reserve among adults. We need materials for darkening the class room. We can get it in London and it will cost $25.00. I am taking the matter up today with Mr. Agent Spence. He will, no doubt, be asking for a grant to cover same. May I look for your approval?\n\nFor several years we have been striving to secure a music teacher for our school. Is there any possibility of our getting one?\n\nMr. Agent Spence has been trying to get Hydro in the school for some time. Material shortage is delaying the prospects. Is there any way in which we can get some kind of priority? With the $600.00 projector and no current we are forced to bring it from our house across to school each time we use projectors. Can you help us?\n\nFred J Dodson.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa Ontario.\n\nIn reference to your letter of August 26th, Department file No. 15-1-5W, in reply to my letter of August 15th, regarding wiring the Moravian Day School for electric service.\n\nI have contacted four local electricians, regarding tenders for this work, but in each case I have been advised that they have far more work than they can do with the material available to them.\n\nMr. Norman Evans of Ridgetown a well qualified electrician looked over the job and roughly estimated the cost around $150.00 and said he would let me know what he could do the job for providing he could get material, later he phoned me stating he was unable to get supplies, apparently at this time a complete job is impossible.\n\nRecently I have contacted the above electrician with the view of him installing the service and necessary wiring for a projector for visual training, this he verbally agreed to do at around $60.00, this will be a three wire service from the existing line, some two hundred feet from the school, installing service meter and whatever necessary equipment required for the projector, leaving everything in shape to install lights, receptacles, switches, at a later date.\n\nWith the Department's approval I would be pleased to employ Mr. Evans at time and material, he is a good workman and I am sure the cost will not be much over the $60.00.\n\nStuart Spence,\n\nIndian Agent.\nEX'D.\n\nA.\n\nOttawa, 4 October 1946.\n\nMr. S.

It is hoped that it can be done this summer and I would suggest the ceiling be white with the walls in very pale green or blue and the stove and pipes aluminum.\n\nI note that it is now possible to have electric lights in the school and trust that it is intended to do the installing this summer. The room will require six drops, with eighteen-inch globes and 500 watt bulbs.\n\nThe shingles do not look too good in spots and the roof should be checked for leaks.\n\nThe toilets require some repairs and I would recommend the provision of toilet paper as well as lime or ashes to keep the odour down.\"\n\nIt would be well to have screens for the windows so the windows can be put up without the fly nuisance.\"\nOttawa, July 12th, 1947.\n\nMr. Stuart Spence, Indian Agent,\nHighgate, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant, the Department will allow an amount of $150.00 for redecorating the interior of the Moravian Indian Day School.\n\nIt is noted that you can obtain the services of a responsible firm to do this work.\n\nBernard F.

I approached them on the possibility of renting the hall for a year or up to a five year term, preferable a five year term, so that the Department could have ample time to build a new class room. I offered them $10.00 per month which appeared to be satisfactory. I offered to purchase the hall, and they asked $2000.00 for it. I did not make them any offer as I thought they were asking too much for it. I promised them we would redecorate the Hall, and arrange to allow them to use the Hall for their monthly meetings. Considerable discussion arose over them wanting to use the Hall for dancing, and religious gatherings. I left the meeting without obtaining their permission to use it, but they were going to discuss it further, and would let me know the results. I understand one other Lodge member came later in the evening, and the proposition was turned down.\n\nMr. Arneil visited the Reserve November 5th, and he took this matter up with Fred Stonefish an active Orangeman and leader of his people. He promised Mr. Arneil that he would take this matter up again at their meeting in November 10th, and suggested to Mr. Stonefish that we would give them $15.00 for a two year lease, and he has reported to me that he was unable to convince the members to lease the Hall.\nAt a regular meeting of the Moravian Band Council November 10th, this question was discussed at some length, the Chief and Council was surprized and concerned as to why the Orange Lodge would not cooperate in this matter. Therefore it was resolved that the Council Hall be used for a Class room, of which I can with some expense, and a saving over the other proposition make a comfortable class room.\n\nThe Council hall is rather large, inside measurements are 48 feet long and 30 feet wide, I would suggest a black board 28 feet long be placed on the North West side, beginning at the west corner or the front of the hall, sixteen Jr. seats or desks be taken from the school and attached to narrow boards so they will not be fastening them to the hall floor, and with this arrangement they can be moved to one side, so that the hall could be used for other purposes if needed, half dozen new Jr. desks supplied along with a teachers desk and chair, a cupboard should be built for supplies, and if the Department see fit eight kindergarten chairs and two tables. We might find it hard to heat in the extremely cold weather, for very little, a partition could be put up for very little, taking 20 or 25 feet off the back of the hall.\n\nProviding this arrangement meets with the approval of the Department, I would be pleased with the materials required, and authority to make as suitable class room as possible, and directions in obtaining a teacher, we will need 20 cords of wood, this will be 24 inch wood, there is hydro in the school, and we might be responsible for the electric account, there is a piano in the hall that will be available to a music teacher.\n\nI regret very much in not obtaining the Orange Lodge cooperation in this matter, there excuse to me was if they rent their hall their Lodge will cease to exist.\n\nStuart Spence,\nIndian Agent.\nTo the Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nSHIP TO The Teacher, Moravian Day School, c/o Mr. R.

Have you anyone in mind for nomination as teacher to assist Mr. Dodson? The Moravian Council has offered us the use of the Council Hall as a classroom. We have ordered the desks and chairs and hope to have the classroom functioning by the first of January. If you have no one in mind would you object to our advertising in the local Toronto newspapers for a teacher?\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. G.

Spence, Indian Agent, Highgate, Ontario.\n\nMoravian Indian Day School.\n\nI have for answer your letter of November 14th, concerning arrangements which you have made for the opening of a second classroom in the Council Hall. It is regretted that you were unable to get the Orange Hall but the Department sincerely appreciates your action and that of the Band Council in allowing us to use the Council Hall for a classroom.\n\nWe have today ordered the following equipment for the new classroom:\n\n(a) Twenty eight feet blackboard,\n(b) Six Desks, small,\n(c) One Teacher's Desk\n(d) Eight Kindergarten Chairs\n(e) Two Kindergarten tables.\n\nAuthority is given for the local purchase of:\n\n(a) One Teacher's Chair\n(b) Twenty cords wood (If you will advise us of the price per cord we will forward you an accountable advance.\n\nYou can also obtain an estimate for the erection of a partition as you suggested.\n\nWith regard to the hydro, will the Council request rent for this building or would it be agreeable to them if we met the hydro account in lieu.\nI can not guarantee a delivery date on the desks as they are in very short supply and we are experiencing considerable difficulty in having our orders filled. At the present time delays of eight weeks are normal before orders are completed.\n\nWith regard to a teacher, I had one but she wanted immediate employment and I thought we would place her at Caughmawaga where one of our teachers will shortly be retiring because of ill health. However, if you will let us know the names of local papers in which we could insert advertisements, I will be glad to arrange for the publication of a teacher wanted ad. Unless, of course, there is someone whom you or Mr. Dodson have in mind, I am writing to Doctor Dorey of the United Church.\n\nBernard F.

We can let you know in a day or two whether we would have any objection to your advertising in the Toronto newspapers for a teacher.\n\nThe fact is, of course, that the teacher would probably have to board with Mr. Dodson, unless there is some other place near at hand which would be suitable.

It calls for a full basement with a furnace. If you are interested in a set of these plans also, please advise.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n1. Name of School: Jr. Div. Moravian Day School\n2. Agency: Moravian\n\n3. Type of Day School (including Plan No.): Plan No. 864 other than it is the opinion that a basement should be made under the Teachers living quarters.\n\n4.

Give complete details as to shipping instructions for supplies to this school:\n   Canadian Pacific Railway to St. Thomas Ontario New York Central Railway to Highgate Ontario\n\n9. The first step in the construction of any School is the location of water. Have you had a well dug, and if so, with what success?\n   No well has been good supply of running water in vicinity.\n\n10. Normally we do not provide one and two room Day Schools with electricity or running water unless hydro is available in the immediate vicinity of the school. Please state if hydro is available for this project.\n    Hydro is in the immediate vicinity.\n\n11. What type of fuel would you recommend:\n    Coal and wood\n\n12. What steps, if any, will be necessary to secure title to the selected school site?\n    An agreement of sale covering a parcel of land adjacent to our present Day school.\n\n13. Has an official of the Education Division assisted you in selecting this site?\n    No. The above piece of property I am sure can be obtained there is another choice site that I am not sure of the Dept. Selection would be appreciated.\n\n14. Have you oriented the proposed school on the site? Yes.\n    Remember: 1. The \"Wall of windows\" is designed by the Architects to face SOUTH.\n    2. Elevation should insure adequate drainage.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The former gives us the proper site designed by the Architect, with your approval I will enter into an agreement with Norman Stonefish Locatee of the South Half of Lot No. 42, held under Location Ticket No. 5890, and purchase the piece of land the depth of our present school site, and the width from our present school site west to the line between Lots No. 42 and 41, as indicated on the attached sketch.\n\nStuart Spence,\nAgency Superintendent.\nMarch 18, 1949.\n\nMr. R.S. Spence,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nHighgate, Ontario.\n\nMoraviantown Indian Day School.\n\nOne of the reasons why we suggested plan 888 is that the cost of such a building is relatively low.\n\nHowever, I note that you have Hydro in the immediate vicinity of the school and that running water could be readily supplied.\n\nTherefore, I am sending to you under separate cover a copy of plan No. 865 which provides a full basement, electricity and running water. It is naturally a more expensive school than plan 888. However, I note that you have a good foreman-carpenter and that the Indians could build the school by themselves.\n\nI will discuss the matter of the school site with officials of the Reserves and Trusts Division and will write you later concerning this. In the meantime, I would like to have your comments on plan 865.\n\nBernard F.

Plan No. 365 appears to be the most favourable of the two, and I trust there is a complete bill of materials for this school. I have no doubt that I have sufficient qualified labour on the Reserve to do the job.\n\nIn the course of a week or ten days, depending on the weather, it is planned to have an excavator on the Reserve in connection with a drainage scheme, and if it could be arranged, we could have our basement dug quite easily at that time. There is also a bulldozer coming with this outfit that could level the building site and school grounds permanently.\n\nThere is another little thought that might be considered. At the Caradoc Agency I understand the Department have a cement mixer, and wheelbarrows, that might be loaned us for this project, also we might have the use of a truck.\n\nStuart Spence,\nAgency Superintendent.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nCPR Street Spencer\nIndian Supr\nN L Highgate\n\nA modern town\nschool approve site\non lot forty two stop\nhave bulldozer do\nexcavation and\nplan 867 and levelling\ncost not to exceed\nfive hundred\ndollars\nSend the following message, subject to the conditions on the back thereof, which are hereby agreed to.\n\nVeuillez exp\u00e9dier la d\u00e9p\u00eache suivante aux conditions mentionn\u00e9es au verso, que j'accepte par les pr\u00e9sentes.\n\n413-5 (E)\n\nOttawa, April 11, 1949.\n\nMr. Stuart Spence,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nHighgate, Ontario.\n\nRE MORAVIANTOWN SCHOOL APPROVED SITE ON LOT FORTY TWO STOP HAVE\nBULLDOZER DO EXCAVATION PLAN 867 AND LEVELLING COST NOT TO EXCEED\nFIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS\n\nCharge: Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs\n\nBernard F.

The cost should not, in my opinion, exceed $100. Arrangements have been made with Superintendent F. L. Hall, of Caradoc Indian Agency, to send his cement mixer to the Moravian Indian Reserve to be used in running the cement for the foundation. It is, therefore, imperative that the cement be bought and delivered at the earliest possible date.\n\nThe work on the above school, as suggested in my memorandum of even date on file A17-9, should be supervised occasionally by Mr. Mahler, the carpenter-foreman, and if this is done, it should be possible to avoid a number of building difficulties as he, to my way of thinking, is capable and familiar with the construction of this type of school.\n\nJ.

Three rods from the school site, there is a six inch tile running along the side of the road draining the old school and teacherage, and I am tapping into this, we are well below the basement wall footings so that the drain will not interfere with construction, it has abundance of fall and will give us good drainage.\n\nIn further reference to the six inch tile drain we are tapping into, it is in need of repairs, and an immediate drainage must be given to the excavation, I am also taking the liberty to repair some 50 rods of this road drain, at an estimated cost of $100.00, half I suggest should be the responsibility of the road as the road benefits from this drain. I trust this meets with your approval, as this six inch tile will give all the drainage the school will ever need if put in proper working order.\n\nRegarding Mr. Fred Stonefish the carpenter foreman I have no doubt as to his ability to read blue prints, and manage construction, I believe you will find a building when completed, as well constructed as any school.\n\nStuart Spence, Agency Superintendent.\nSend the following message, subject to the conditions on the back thereof, which are hereby agreed to.\n\nVeuillez exp\u00e9dier la d\u00e9p\u00eache suivante aux conditions mentionn\u00e9es au verso, que j'accepte par les pr\u00e9sentes.\n\nOttawa, April 11, 1949.\n\nMr. Stuart Bence,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nHiawatha, Ontario.\n\nRE: PORVENIR SCHOOL APPROVE SITE ON LOT FORTY TWO STOP HAVE\nBUILDING TO BE EXCAVATION PLAN 867 AND LEVELLING COST NOT TO EXCEED\nFIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS\n\nCharge: Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs\n\nBernard F.

Stonefish at Moraviantown; this is an exceptionally good plan, and arrangements are working out very favourable, as Mr. Mahler is ready or is pouring the walls at Oneida, this will give us the use of the cement mixer, until all cement is poured at Moraviantown, and will also give Mr. Mahler some extra time with us if required, as it appears the construction of the foundation is going to be our biggest job.\n\nThe cement for this project has arrived in good condition and is stored at the Reserve, no other materials has been received. Lake Erie cement gravel can be delivered to the Reserve at $1.75 per cubic yard, this is the source of the best quality cement gravel in this district.\n\nIn the course of a week or ten days Mr. Mahler will be through with the cement mixer for a time, and upon being supplied with gravel, and cribbing materials we will be ready to proceed with this work.\n\nStuart Spence,\n\nAgency Superintendent.\nJune 15, 1949.\n\nMr. S.

He is at Moraviantown and pointed out that the basement had been excavated and that the cement was on hand, and if we could authorize local purchase of the items stated above, there would not be any unnecessary delay in proceeding with the construction of the building.

The school is ready for the electric wiring, and Superintendent Spence has submitted the attached two tenders from Grant's Hardware, Highgate, Ontario, and Norman Evans, Ridgetown, Ontario. We would appreciate it if your engineer would advise us as soon as possible which tender he recommends be accepted.\n\nIn connection with the wiring at this school, we received the following memorandum from the Minister's Office:\n\n\"I wish to refer you to the Director's memorandum of July 26th concerning electrical wiring for the new classroom at the school on the Moraviantown Reserve. Mr. Norman Evans of Ridgetown is recommended and also Mr. Melvin Grant of Highgate. Mr. Evans is preferred.\"\n\nPP/ST\n\nDirector.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa Ontario.\n\nRe: Moravian Day School\n\nIn connection with the construction of the Moravian Day School, I am and have run into some difficulty regarding wages paid.\n\nOriginally I had planned to employ Vester Jacobs throughout the job, and started him at 60\u00a2 per hr., on the promise that I would pay him more if his services warranted it; he was very unsatisfied with this wage, and became disagreeable to work with. I could not see fit to raise his wages, of which he continually complained about, and when the cement walls was completed, I had a chance to let him go, and another labour that I had planned on quite when tobacco harvest started, but I was fortunate to be able to hire another good man, fairly experienced carpenter, at any rate willing, of which I am paying 85\u00a2 per hr. therefore I have three good carpenters of which I am paying each 85\u00a2 per hour, and one labour that I am paying 40\u00a2 per hr.\n\nWhen I planned on constructing this building with Indian labour I interviewed Albert Tobias an Indian of the Band, with the view of employing him, but he would never promise he would, for sure never the less, when the project was approved and we where ready to start he came on the job at 85\u00a2 per hour, he is a good man, especially in cement work, and as good as the average carpenter, therefore to date we have made very good progress, and good workmanship. Mr. Tobias has informed me that unless he is paid $1.00 per hour he is going to quite the end of the week.\n\nMr. Fred Stonefish the carpenter foreman\nMr. Fred Stonefish, the approved carpenter foreman, is somewhat concerned over his pension allowance. An investigator from the Pension Department has been to the job to see him and warned him that he must not earn over $250.00 during the year or his pension allowance would be cut according to his earnings, with the results of this Mr. Stonefish has been threatening to quite. If I should lose both these men I would be at a loss to know what to do.\n\nMr. Tobias claims he can get $1.25 per hour. I don't doubt he can at this time. I have submitted tenders for the construction of a small house on the Reserve through welfare, one tender under the signature of Mr. Tobias. He advised me of his intentions, therefore I suggested he tender for this house rather than lose him altogether but I would much rather keep him on the school for another month at least.\n\nAs I write rafters over the main part of the building will be up ready for sheeting, and I would feel more at ease if the roof, siding, windows and outside doors were done.\n\nYour views in the matter of this man's wages would be appreciated. I am of the opinion he is well worth the additional 15\u00a2 per hour, this will include a power saw.\n\nStuart Spence,\nAgency Superintendent.\n| DATE   | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Sept. 2 | To redecorate the exterior of the Moravian Day School as per attached accounts | $ 85.00 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

This tender is $100.00 under my estimate. I might say that the Reid Co are a most reliable firm, I would recommend that their tender be accepted. They were XXXX the only firm that tendered although I mailed plans to the Wallace Co of Thamesville also.\n\nWe will also require 3/4 of an acre belonging to Nelson Stonefish on the east side of the school grounds. Stonefish is asking $100.00 for this land which I consider is reasonable.\n\nThe total amount required would be about $1300.00.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nDuncan C Scott Esq.\nDeputy Supt General\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nP.S. A resolution from the Indian Council authorizing the expenditure is enclosed.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nHon. Mr. Meighen -\n\nWe have a very prosperous school on the Moravian Reserve in western Ontario, but there is no accommodation for the teacher, nor is there any boarding house available. The present teacher, who is giving good satisfaction, is now living in the ante-room of the school-house. The Indians have passed a resolution asking that a teacher's residence be built and that the necessary site be secured at the cost of $100.00. Mr. Abraham, our agricultural representative, prepared plans and specifications of which we approved and called for tenders from some firms in western Ontario. Only one responded, the Colin Reid Company of Rothwell, Ont., who offered to erect the building in accordance with the plans and specifications for $1150.00, which is $100.00 less than Mr. Abraham estimated.\n\nWe wish to commence the cement work without delay and I would ask your approval for the expenditure of the necessary amount from the capital funds of the band which amount to $111,178.99. I would add that this firm is a reputable one and has done considerable work for us in the past always to our satisfaction.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, Nov. 26th, 1919.\n\nColin Reid Company,\nBothwell, Ont.\n\nYour tender Moravian school residence accepted.\n\nPlease commence work immediately.\n\nCharge I. A.\n\nDuncan C. Scott.\nNovember 27th, 1919.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Abraham -\n\nIt has been decided to accept the tender of the Colin Reid Company for the erection of the teacher's residence on the Moravian Reserve. I understand that you are going to Moraviantown immediately upon your return. You should close up matters regarding the site at once. You may ask the Accountant for a cheque for $100.00 in favour of Nelson Stonefish, to be handed to him when he executes a quit-claim deed transferring three-quarters of an acre adjoining the present school lot to His Majesty the King as represented by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs. Payment for the house and lot cannot be made as the Council suggests from interest funds, repayment to be spread over a term of years. It will have to be taken from the capital funds and you should obtain a resolution from the Council authorizing the expenditure of $1250.00 for the purchase of land and the erection of the building. You may inform the Indians that the funds at their credit in the capital account at the present time are $111,178.99.\n\nD.S.G.I.A.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Before making these purchases you should obtain competitive prices from a number of dealers and in each case purchase from the firm quoting the lowest price. With reference to the cook stove it is considered that a medium sized stove would meet the requirements. A medium priced iron bed and mattress may be furnished and the chairs, table and lamp, while serviceable, should be as cheap as possible. You should give the matter of the purchase of these articles your prompt attention and, while they should be serviceable in all respects, they should be as inexpensive as possible.

It is hoped that you have attended to these purchases and that the work on the building is completed and that it is ready for occupation by the teacher. You should see that any further work required to the building is finished as soon as possible, in order that the teacher can occupy the residence. You should inform the Department as soon as possible as to the progress that is being made in the building and also whether you have purchased the articles authorized by official letter of October 7th, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

As you know, an arrangement was made last year whereby Mr. Joblin was to be transferred to Moraviantown and a new teacher selected for Alderville. Both these arrangements have been carried out but in each case there is a little difficulty in regard to house accommodation for these men. A resolution has gone to Ottawa from this Board in regard to Alderville and I am sure the building proposition there will be entered upon as soon as possible.\n\nAt Moraviantown the situation is a little different. A small building has been erected there by the Department but there is no kitchen accommodation and Mr. Joblin feels that it is very inconvenient from the standpoint of housekeeping.\n\nI trust that you will see your way clear, in the very near future, to provide a kitchen for Mr. Joblin and I feel sure that he will do very acceptable work at that point.\n\nI thought you would like to have this personal note from me, as I have visited both these places during the month of October.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Abraham,\nChatham.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI dropped you a card a couple of weeks or so ago to ascertain if it would be convenient for you to run out here any time soon, but perhaps you have been away from home.\n\nMy job here of missionary and teacher is no sinecure I can assure you, and I cannot manage it longer than this month if I have to live alone. Conditions here make it impossible for me to ask my wife to come; for instance there are no cove troughs on the house, no cistern, nor any way of getting soft water. There are only the three small rooms in the house: no cellar nor garret, and hence no place to put a wash tub, board, or any of the coarser kinds of house keeping utensils, which would not look well in the bedroom nor parlour even if there were room for them, and it will be absolutely necessary for a kitchen, wood-shed, or something of the kind to be built.\n\nI shall also have to keep a horse. I can't be running to the Indians every time I have to use a horse.\nas too much time would be wasted for one thing,\nand they would probably be needing their horses\nat the same time I would be needing them. So\nit would seem necessary to have a stable built\nand these things should all be done before the cold\nweather starts.\n\nWould it be possible to have a kitchen built with\na small cellar under it? I don't know where one\nis to keep potatoes, apples, preserved fruit etc.\nI would also like to keep a few hens, but there\nis no place to put a hen.\n\nI would be glad to hear from you at your\nearliest convenience, as to what one might\nreasonably expect to get done this fall, for if\nthere is nothing doing, I can't stay.\n\nDo you expect to be visiting the Reserve any\ntime soon, for if so I would be glad to\nsee you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nFrank J. Joblin.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCHATHAM, ONT.\n\nOttawa, October 26, 1921.\n\nDear Mr. MacKenzie:\n\nIn reply to your letter No. 15-1-8, regarding the teacher's residence at the Moravian reserve, I beg to say that the residence that was built was erected to accommodate the school teacher, a Mr. Frank Joblin, who is a missionary school teacher and of course the building is not very satisfactory for a missionary. The Rev. Mr. Nethercott, the former missionary, was superannuated by the Missionary Board and has been allowed to remain in the missionary house.\n\nThe Indians at the reserve and the council are not in favour of making any more improvements to the teacher's residence and the council passed a resolution stating that they will not provide any more funds for this purpose. They give as their reason that the missionary is a Methodist and that many of the people on the reserve do not belong to the Methodist church and therefore they as a band should not contribute towards the erection of buildings to accommodate the Methodist missionary.\n\nI might say that there is a Methodist church on the Moravian reserve and quite a large number of the members of the Moravian band belong to this church. In view of this I would not recommend that any additional buildings, etc., be built at the school residence. Anything that can be done within reason to make Mr. Joblin more comfortable, such as papering the house and providing some shelves for the pantry, storm doors, etc., I believe should be done.\n\nP.S. Letter from Mr. Joblin enclosed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Agr. Representative,\nOttawa.\nOctober 25th, 1921.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThere is a request comes from Mr. Joblin, who is the missionary teacher at Moraviantown, to the effect that he needs a kitchen in the teacher's home. This building was put up by, and belongs to, the Department. Could a small grant be made sufficient to build a kitchen? I am not quite sure of the amount that would be required. If the Department would favor the putting up of a kitchen, I can secure the information as to how much will be necessary.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. Ferrier\n\nIndian Affairs.

We are also in receipt of communications from the Rev. Arthur Barner and from the teacher, Mr. Joblin, in respect to this matter.\n\nThe Department arranged for the erection of the teacher's residence at Moraviantown at the expense of the band. It now appears that the Indians on the reserve, and their council, are not in favour of making any more improvements to the teacher's residence, and the council has passed a resolution stating that they will not provide any more funds for this purpose. They give as their reason that the missionary teacher is a Methodist, and that many of the people on the reserve do not belong to the Methodist Church, and that, therefore, they as a band should not contribute towards the erection of buildings to accommodate the Methodist missionary. The Department realizes that in taking this action the Indians on the reserve are extremely short-sighted in their refusal to give financial assistance to any organization or man who is doing good work on their behalf. The decision of the band, however, makes it impossible for the Department to build a proper kitchen from the band funds.\n\nIt is with the strictest economy that the Department has to manage its finances for the remainder of the fiscal year, and I regret to inform you that this extensive addition will have to be postponed at this time.

I have noted the resolution of the Indian council, and in reply I wish to state that the advisability of having Mr. Joblin placed on this property has been discussed at some length with the officers of the Methodist Missionary Society. It has been decided to allow the Reverend J. C. Nethercott to continue in his residence on the property that is loaned to the Missionary Society for missionary purposes.\n\nI wish to inform you that the rental accruing to the Methodist Church is being devoted to missionary purposes, and you are, doubtless, aware that the Reverend Mr. Nethercott is the only ordained Missionary on the reserve. The Department has permitted the Methodist Church to occupy the property in question for the time being. You may inform Mr. Joblin, the present Teacher, that an effort will be made in the spring to put his residence in better condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nE. Beattie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHighgate, Ont.\nOttawa, February 6, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge yours of the 31st ultimo, referring to the occupation of the Mission farm on the Moravian reserve by the Rev. J. C. Nethercott. Your statement that the arrangement which has been made by this Department with the Methodist Missionary Society is not satisfactory to those immediately concerned. Further, I am aware that you and your family are living in a residence that is hardly adequate for your needs; that an addition, a cellar and a barn are required before your home will be a pleasant one for a married man.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the advisability of placing you on the mission farm property has been discussed at some length with the officers of the Methodist Missionary Society. It has been decided to allow the Rev. J. C. Nethercott to continue in his residence on this property which is loaned to the Methodist Church for missionary purposes.\n\nI wish to inform you that the rental accruing to the Methodist church is being devoted to missionary purposes. You have claimed that, if something can be made out of the mission property, the man who is doing the work ought to get it. The Department has ruled that the Society responsible for the missionary activity is entitled to such income. The Rev. Mr. Nethercott is paying to the church a fair rental for the privilege he enjoys and his relation to the church is solely that of a tenant and need not concern the active missionary.\n\nThe Department, as well as the Missionary Society, is desirous of retaining your services and I am explaining our position and ruling in some detail. Some time ago the band was approached with a view to disposing of the property in question and the placing of the proceeds into a new mission house to be erected near the council hall. This they were not willing to do. The Methodist Church and this Department are convinced that missionary teachers make better public servants when not engaged in farming activities.\n\nProvision has been made in the Estimates for the coming fiscal year for alterations and additions to the property which you now occupy. I have today requested Mr. R. H. Abraham, our Agricultural Representative, to keep this matter in mind and to arrange for the work to be done at the earliest possible date.\nI sincerely hope that these explanations will place you at ease in your important work and that in the future the Indian band and yourself will not have occasion to refer to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

June 30th/22\n\nThe Secretary\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have incurred some items of expense which I believe should be made up to me, namely:\n\n1. I have had to buy a screen door for the house, as it is not possible to live here when there is a fire burning, unless the door is open; and the flies and bees etc. were coming in so badly that it became necessary to get a screen door. The door with hinges, lock, screws nails etc. cost $3.65.\n\n2. On April 8th, in a letter to the Dept. I enclosed a receipt signed by Mr. Robinson of Thamesville, for $85.00, for bringing parcels for the Moravian school from Thamesville. I paid Mr. Robinson, of course, but the Dept. has not sent me the money.\n\n3. When we came to this house, the walls and ceiling were dirty and streaked, as there was no paper on them, and the plastering had not been very well done. We bought paper for the three rooms (costing nearly ten dollars) and put it on, and also whitened all the ceilings with a patent calomine which we bought. The job all told should be worth $20.00.\n\n4. I was authorized by the Dept. through the Agent to buy five dollars worth of seeds for the school garden. Mr. Abraham sent us some seeds in packages, and I spent $5.00 for 2\u00bd bags of seed potatoes @ $2.00 per bag. Receipt enclosed.\n\nWill you please let me hear from you concerning the above amounts, and oblige,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nFrank J. Joblin.\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAre we too impatient in relation to the proposed improvements in connection with the teacherage here at Moraviantown? Rev. Thompson Ferrier told me in London last 26th Oct., that it had been arranged at the Dept. to build an addition to the house here. I entered into correspondence with the Dept., and with Mr. Abraham at Chatham, so that all the preliminaries could be gotten through with and the work started as soon as the weather permitted in the Spring.\n\nI have letters from Mr. Russel T. Ferrier written Feb. 6 and Apr. 11th in which I was given to understand that the work would be done at the earliest possible date.\n\nUp to the present there hasn't been a shovel full of earth turned nor a board drawn to the premises, and we are fairly sweltering in the heat in this little house, with no place to put the stove out.\n\nThe farmers are drawing their hay now, and if the stable were built, I could have the hay drawn right from the field. I will now have to pay nearly double the amount later on.\n\nIt must be that the delay is unavoidable but it does seem most unfortunate that it is so. Mr. Pope, who is expected to do the work, says they are rushed with work now, and could have been through with this job if it had been put through earlier. I hope the undertaking is not postponed for another year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nFrank J. Dobbin.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It was impossible to begin this work earlier as the appropriation for the purpose has only recently been passed by Parliament.\n\nRegarding the expenses which you incurred in the purchase of a screen door to the amount of $3.65 and the delivery of parcels from Thamesville, as well as the cost of paper for three rooms in the teacher's residence, and the purchase of seed potatoes, I beg to say that you should forward accounts, in duplicate, to Mr. Agent Beattie, who should certify the same and forward to the Department, when consideration will be given to payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Manager.\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to Dept. Letter #15-I-1, of the 17th inst., relative to exchange of Missionary Teacher at this agency;\n\nI would say that Rev. C.W. Mo. Kenzie arrived on the 25th inst., and has taken charge of the work.\n\nWas interviewing Mr. Mo. Kenzie yesterday, and feel quite certain that he is going to request some few changes in the residence;\n\nHe asked me to whom should he make application for alterations to be made to house, and I informed him that it might be well for him to take the matter up with the Church authorities and they could in turn arrange with Indian Department as to what should be done.\n\nI know that the Council & Reserve feel that when the Mission Board have contributed nothing for the residence, stable, painting & repairs and fuel for residence, it is their turn to make any improvements required to the property at this date.\n\nI might state, that it would seem a mistake had been made, by erecting a residence & stable of the kind that they did in 1923.\n\nThe residence is only 4 small rooms, one story, cellar under one room; when a cellar could have been placed under whole house and had the whole building another \u00bd or whole storey higher at very little extra cost.\n\nThe stable has a loft over all with hip roof, with sufficient room to house hay enough for two horses, and no occupant of residence has used the stable for else than a garage for car;\n\nHalf the expense would have erected a much better garage.\n\nThe residence is far too small for married man & family.\n\nSEC. DEPT. OF IND. AFF.\n\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nYours Obediently,\n\nNelson Stone, Indian Agent.\nHighgate, Ont. April II/28.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRev. C.W. McKenzie, the Missionary Teacher of my agency, has asked me to have new screen doors and windows placed on the teacherage, and gravel walks in front and to the garage; and repairs to cellar and drains etc;\n\nAnd also, he has asked to have the garden plowed and manured and got ready for this season's crop;\n\nIn the garden plot at his residence, there is sufficient land for three or four family gardens, and the practice has been heretofore to have janitor or some member of Reserve, plow and prepare the lot have the teacher put in what small vegetables he requires, and the balance of land is planted to potatoes by the member and he and teacher get equal shares of the potatoes.\n\nThe past custom has given entire satisfaction to date, and it may be unwise to change it.\n\nIn regard to improvements & repairs to teacherage, the members of Council & Reserve are somewhat divided on this matter, as they feel that the Mission Board should be asked to assume some responsibility in this matter.\n\nThere are two Protestant churches on the Reserve, Anglican & the United Church, and only one school, the United Church receive all revenue from the mission farm which was granted by the Reserve years ago to the old Moravian Church, and although the Mission Board may be expending all said revenue on their church work of Reserve, yet the Anglicans get nothing and were originally just as much interested in the land granted as were others.\n\nI state these facts to show the view taken by about \u00bd of Reserve.\n\nYours Obediently,\n\nNelson Stone, Indian Agent.\n\nSEC. DEPT. OF IND.

You may also incur a reasonable expenditure in installing gravel walks from the front of the garage and having a few minor repairs made to the cellar and drains. No unnecessary expense should be incurred in the above, and, when the work has been completed, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the screen doors and windows, the gravel walks and the repairs to the cellar and drains.

You should inform the Rev. Mr. McKenzie that, whereas any expenditure in this connection would have to be met by parliamentary appropriation, the matter should be brought to the attention of the Department. It is considered unnecessary and even unwise for a teacher to discuss with the Indian band in council expenditure from public funds without the permission of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nNelson Stone, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHighgate, Ont.\nMay 3, 1929.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nI have discussed with Rev. Mr. Barner, Superintendent of Indian Missions of the United Church, the future of the work at the Moravian Indian Day School. In the event that the Rev. Mr. Wilding or another well qualified worker is appointed to this school, it may be necessary - depending on the number in the teacher's family - to enlarge the residence. I promised favourable consideration, in view of the fact that the Missionary Society is proposing to use during the next three or four years the rentals on the farm there for improvements to the buildings.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM REV ARTHUR BARNER,\nWESLEY COLLEGE, WINNIPEG, MAN., dated June 7, 1929.\n\nIndian Agent Stone will report in regard to the enlargement of the teachersage in due course. The way is opening for the making of improvements on the farm which we discussed and I shall be much obliged if the Department will authorize Mr. Stone to take oversight of these matters so that Mr. Leverton may have someone with whom to consult.\nRev. Arthur Barner, acting for Home Mission Board of United Church of Canada, has asked me to recommend to Indian Department enlargement and improvement to teacherage, this to be effected as soon as convenient after arrival of Rev. Wilding at Moraviantown. I hesitate to do this, as I feel the present plan combining the teaching and preaching to one individual is not in some respects very satisfactory, and may not be permanent, as the Anglicans are about as strong and numerous in membership as United Church. However, the present residence is far too small for any family, and is constructed in such a way that enlargement is very difficult. Cannot see what was the idea of erecting a house or stable like this one at that date, one storey small cottage with cellar under one corner, and too deep for proper drainage of cellar, one small bedroom. Had they put 2 storeys higher, bedroom upstairs, it would have cost but little more and now it would not require enlarging. The stable with loft above has never been used only as garage. Would like to be advised at an early date as to what would be your wish in these matters and I will try and carry out your wish.\nOttawa, July 17, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to that portion of your letter of the 10th instant, which is relative to the teacher's residence at the Moravian Indian Day School. As it is too small for any family, I believe it advisable to consider an addition or an enlargement. The Department has promised the Board of Home Missions of the United Church that favourable consideration to enlarging this building will be given, provided they appoint a well qualified worker.\n\nWhen the Rev. Mr. Wilding reports for duty, you will please discuss this question with him and let me have a recommendation as to how more room can be provided. You should estimate the cost of whatever addition is suggested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

The last report from the School Inspector shows that the school is without anything in the way of equipment. No requisition was received from the teacher since 1902, and it is solely due to his carelessness that this condition exists.\n\nMr. Inspector Ramsden, who visited the school lately, reports the same lack of equipment and says that he is sure that the method of teaching in this school is not along modern ideas.\n\nThe Indians are dissatisfied and careless about sending their children to school, but, if a qualified teacher, who is interested in his work, is given them, I am sure that a noticeable improvement would take place. There are over 25 children of school age on the reserve and it is too bad they should grow up in ignorance. They have a good school building and if the salary were raised a good teacher could be secured, and I would suggest that Mr. McCue's services be dispensed with after June 30, next, and the school reopened after the summer holidays with a new teacher.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sutherland,\n\nHave just returned from looking over the Chemong work. On the reserve there are 190 Treaty Indians, besides about 30 others. They seem to be on the increase, there having been not more than 160 all told, twenty years ago.\n\nThey impress me as being a pretty good type of the race. Their homes seem fairly tidy. Was in two or three parlors that would do credit to anyone. Had as fine a dinner as King Edward need ask for. There are at least a dozen homes in which there is either piano or organ.\n\nWhat they call the mission house is in fairly good condition, beautifully situated on the shore. Two acres for garden and a fine orchard. The Indian family occupying pays a nominal rental. He has a house of his own and as far as I could learn he would not object to the change if a missionary came. The house would be worth here $3,000, at least. The Indians bought it in view of missionary occupying it, and they would be glad if he were sent at once.\n\nThe new church is 30 x 45 brick with alcove additional for choir. It is well seated, lighted, heated (furnace) and as clean as a pin. It is the best looked after and neatest Indian Church I have seen. The old church, a frame is near by, in good condition and is used for S. School purposes. The school house and Council chamber is a fine substantial brick, two stories, and not much the worse of wear. Locked over the register, 28 names appear, the oldest 13 years of age. There are on the reserve not less than 40 to 45 who should be attending school.\n\nI took the chief nd his brother, both reliable men, and Christians into my confidence, and told them what we would like to do. They felt sure that all would be delighted. The Department has practically dismissed the teacher, and the people have farewelled him so the way in that respect seems clear. Ours is the only service held on the reserve. The Methodist church, by common consent, has the right of way. Winter evenings they have a congregation of about 100 to 120. About 55 are members of our Church. They hold class and prayer meetings. Last year, they paid on minister's salary $50, and contributed to the Missionary Society $52.00. They have an active Ladies' Aid Society which raised about $50.00 last year the most of which was spent in caring for the sick.\n\nIt seems to me a perfectly clear case. If the necessary arrangements can be made with the Department, and the right man can be found, the change should be made.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n(Sgd.) Geo. W. Henderson.\nlarge, and the work sufficiently important, to justify the appointment of both a missionary and a teacher. If this course is taken we would be glad of some arrangement whereby the missionary could have the use of the parsonage, and some other provision made for the teacher. I infer from Mr. Henderson's letter that the Indians will be quite willing to have the parsonage occupied by a missionary if one is sent, and if this should be in accordance with the views of the Department the Agent might be instructed to ascertain if a suitable dwelling for the teacher can be secured.\n\nI am your obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nEnclosure.\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, #172211, respecting the parsonage at Chemong Lake. It will be within your knowledge that we have not hitherto occupied Chemong as one of our regular missions, and it was merely visited at intervals by a minister from another field to conduct religious services. As the New England Company seems to have retired permanently from work at Chemong I feel it to be a duty to make better provision alike for the teaching of the school and the conducting of religious services. In view of this I requested the Rev. George W. Henderson, of Peterboro, Chairman of that District, to visit Chemong and advise me as to what steps he considered it advisable for us to take in meeting the needs of the case. I enclose a copy of his report, which although it may not contain any information not already in possession of the Department will nevertheless show how the situation is regarded by an impartial observer.\n\nThe question for us now to decide is whether we will send a missionary to Chemong besides nominating a teacher to take charge of the school, or simply confine our efforts for the present to the latter point and have religious services conducted as formerly by a minister from some adjacent field. I incline to the opinion that the Band is sufficiently\nOttawa, 23rd July, 1909.\n\nRev. Sir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant in further reference to the Chemong School, and in reply beg to say that when the Department decided to provide a better salary for the Teacher, it was with a view to obtaining the services of a thoroughly competent man who was married, and as there was no suitable house available other than the parsonage it was thought best to secure this house if possible. The Department is still of the opinion that for a time it would be to the advantage of the Indians to provide them with a good teacher, as the mission work could be attended to by a minister from another field; and it is thought that Mr. Henderson's report, a copy of which you enclosed, bears out this opinion.\n\nIn another letter from you of the same date you stated that you have application from some four or five different parties, married men of experience, who in addition to the salary mentioned by you would require a house to live in. If one of these is selected by you for Chemong School the Department will be prepared to pay a salary of $450., but if you desire to have the house for the Missionary it would be impossible to engage any of the applicants referred to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nA.

Furthermore, the Department is of opinion that, in view of the friction that has lately existed between the teacher and certain members of the band, a change of teacher will be in the best interest of all concerned.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons the Department cannot approve this resolution, and you will be good enough to advise the Indians accordingly.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nWm.

Dr. Sutherland of the Methodist Missions, Toronto, and, on his advice, I am writing to you regarding a teacher's position in one of the Indian Schools now vacant. He himself will write. He informed me, by you on the subject in a day or two. I am a University graduate, a native of N.S.Wales, Australia, and of Scottish parents. I taught school in that country for...\nseveral years. In 1905 I went to Hawaii to recruit my health, which is now perfect and has been since that year. There I taught a native school of over 20 pupils, and won the affectionate respect of scholars and parents.\n\nI came to the U.S.A. in 1906, and have taught during three years in Nebraska, in rural schools, the last school being offered to me again for this year also. But as a Bishop's subject I preferred to come to Canada, which I did over two months ago (June or 1907), & I hold a First Grade Teaching Certificate of the\nState Department of Nebraska... I have forwarded, to Dr. Sutherland, my references and testimonials, and given him details of my status and experience. I am in vigorous mental and bodily health, and am used to living and caring for myself in isolated places... I hate the Indian race, and in June-July 1907 made a tour of the Rosebud Reservation (South Dakota), with the Rev. Mr. Clark (Missionary), studying the school system, and addressing the Indians. I am a fluent and attractive speaker (I may say so without immodesty), and...\nI could conduct service and Sunday School if needed. I am forty-five years old, a Presbyterian, and an abstainer. If my character were not exceptional, I should not have addressed you.\n\nDr. Butterworth mentioned the Salt Lake Church among several other schools, as vacant; and I should be ready to go elsewhere, if necessary.

The dwelling, while a fine one once, is in a bad state of repair.\n\nThere will be a council meeting this evening when the question will be brought up.

Secretary.\n\nWm. McFarlane, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKeene, Ont.\nOn February 9th I received a letter from the Rev. Dr. Sutherland, making the proposition to me to change places with the teacher of the Borgina Island Reserve. I replied that I would consider the matter. Last week I wrote Dr. S. to the effect that unless I got positive orders from some one who has authority in the matter, I would prefer to remain where I am. To-day I received a letter from Dr. Sutherland stating that the arrangement was suggested by the Indian Department and that he wished I had decided to fall in with the arrangement. Now will you please inform me whether it is a positive order of the Department that I should make the change or whether it was a suggestion which I could either accept or refuse as I felt inclined? I like it here, and Chief Joseph Whitney informs me that the people are well pleased with my work. Then again, I am not a preacher, and prefer not to have any responsibility regarding religious work.\nexcept Sunday School work. While feeling that it is hardly fair to make the change without my consent, I shall bow to the decision of the Department.\n\nThere is another important consideration. I hear that the salary at Georgina Island is only $400. Please inform me on this and the other questions asked.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nTeacher\nMud Lake Reserve.\n\nP.S.

You will probably find the situation at Georginia Island as congenial as that which you now occupy.\n\nYou will of course be paid the same salary as you are receiving at Chemosy and, so far as the Department is concerned, you will not be responsible for any religious work on the reserve. Your moving expenses will also be paid for.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nGeo.

McLean, Esq.,\nSec., Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn compliance with your request of the 21st instant File No. 172,211-1 to visit Chemong Reserve at an early date, I may say I went there this week but unfortunately found Mr. Prosser away. I, however, made enquiries as to his conduct of the School and found the general opinion to be that he was not giving satisfaction. The Indians complained that he is not regular in his hours and has absented himself on different occasions, one for a half a day to attend a sale, school closed, one day in September last to show a trick bear at the Lindsay Fair and fifteen days during the hunting season of this Fall when his wife took charge of the School. They claim that he stated he had permission from the Department for this latter absence.\n\nThey also complained that he sleeps during School hours. One little girl of thirteen years of age whom I asked to give evidence stated that this happened a number of times and that he would put his feet on the desk and lay back in his chair. They also complained that he took little interest in preparing the scholars for the Christmas closing which has always been quite an event with these people and that he would not remain himself for the entertainment which took place on December 26th. He has had no clock since the Summer holidays, it having been broken and stored away in the Cupboard, they also claim that he has no watch. The School-room had a general untidy appearance, seats being piled up and in disorder. The attendance register is poorly and carelessly kept. I regret his absence during my visit and would much prefer to have had him present so that if he had any defense to offer for the\ncharges that were made against him, I would have been better able to have judged as to their accuracy. I may say, however, that there did not appear to be any ill-feeling towards him by any members of the Band, on the contrary they all said that he was a very good preacher but were just as unanimous that he was a very poor teacher. They claim that they do not need his services as a preacher as they are supplied each Sabbath Morning from the Selwyn Circuit.\n\nI fear he is indifferent and lazy and that it would be in the best interests of the Department to allow him to devote all his time to the education of his trick bear.\n\nI enclose you a resolution which was passed by the Band in my presence, which speaks for itself. If you deem it necessary for me to make another visit to the Reserve when Mr. Prosser is on duty, I will gladly do so.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Inspector,\nof Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, January 13, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to inform you that the Indians of the\nand Lake Band have expressed their dissatisfaction at your\nlack of qualifications and the methods of teaching followed\nby you in the Chomong school and, as you have not succeeded\nin obtaining the confidence of the Indians, the Department\nis of opinion that it would be to the interest of all con-\ncerned if you would give up this school by the 30th of\nJune, next.\n\nYou will have ample time before the date speci-\nfied to make other arrangements and the Department would\nlike you to accept this proposition and should a vacancy\noccur in the meantime you will be kept in mind, if you\ncare to continue work in an Indian school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

In that meeting I understand several hard things were said against me, nearly every one of which could be proved false.

My failure here would be widespread and would mean misplaced confidence and bad decision and work in the transfer.\n\nThe contest now reaches back to Georgia Island as Mr. Whiting told me that they were corresponding.

McLean, Secy.,\nSecretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of February 2nd file No. 172211 - 1, I have to report as follows:\n\nI visited the Chemong Reserve and interviewed Mr. Prosser as well as having a meeting with the Band. I asked Mr. Prosser with reference to the statements that had been made at the former meeting and he emphatically denied having been irregular in opening and closing the school. He admitted being absent one half day without leave when Mrs. Prosser took charge. He also states that the charge made against him of sleeping during school hours is of a trivial nature but did not deny that he might have dozed on one or two occasions. I enclose a statement he gave me signed by a number of the larger scholars with reference to this matter. As school was in session when I arrived, I took the opportunity of asking the scholars present which numbered twelve if any of them had ever seen him asleep during school hours and they all answered in the negative.\n\nHe claims he loses none of the school time in the attention he bestows upon his trained bear. He states he is sorry he did not remain for the entertainment at Christmas time as he believes that fact considerably agitated the Indians. He states that the young girl who gave some testimony against him at the last investigation interfered with the discipline of the school so much so as to tell a scholar that they had read long enough and when he did not agree with her, she left the school and has not returned since.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6148, File 414-1, part 1)\nThe Band was not nearly so much of one mind as to Mr. Prosser's conduct at the school on this visit as on my former visit, but they were in favor of having a certificated teacher and voted for this seventeen to ten. I may say that I am always favored getting as good teachers as possible but pointed out to the Band the difficulty the Department was experiencing in getting qualified teachers to remain for any length of time on some of the different Reserves. Some of the members of the Band were of the opinion that Mr. Prosser had never had a fair chance as the Council had passed a resolution requiring him to order no further supplies from the Department for the children, but that the parents of the children should be required to furnish all necessary school books. This I may say in my opinion does not work out well and causes a shortage of the necessary articles for the carrying on of the school.\n\nMr. Prosser was preceded by Mr. Cork who was an exceptionally good teacher and for this reason it would be more difficult for anyone to give the same satisfaction as might otherwise obtain. The Band were high in their praises of Mr. Cork, in fact a great deal higher than when Mr. Cork was in actual occupation of the position for at that time some of them complained to me and said that he was too old and desired his removal.\n\nI may say that the school had a better appearance than on my last visit. The register was better kept and the school room tidy. There should however be a clock in operation in the schoolroom. Some of the members of the Band quite freely expressed their opinion that Mr. Prosser was doing much better since my last visit. Mr. Prosser is of the opinion tha School Inspector Broderick who visited\nthe school in December 1910 would commend his work.\n\nThe Band is aware of the fact that the Department intends allowing Mr. Prosser to remain at least until the Summer holidays, by that time the Indians may be in a different frame of mind.\n\nMr. Prosser can do well if he applies himself and I think the Department should write him and tell him he is on trial for the last time and that it is expected that he will do his very best to increase the attendance by persuading/to interest the children and by working agreeably as possible with the Council and members of the Band. I would also ask him for a report as to the equipment of the school as in my opinion the resolution passed by the Council favoring the parents supplying the books to the children is a mistake.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies\nMr. Ramekem\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. Lusk told me last week that Daniel Whiting considered that I had not left enough money in his store also that the parsonage which I now occupy Mr. Whiting would rent with the land which he now owns and use it in connection as a summer resort. It isn't their educational interests they are looking for it at the financial. Please excuse the delay in the petition as I went slow and waited for some names wishing for every satisfaction.\n\nI remain\n\nResp. Yours\n\nJ. H.

I have furnished a number of copy books lately and two or three other books, and still there is not all that we requested. Some children are staying away with the plea that they have no books. Some are assisting their\nParents during the very trapping season some are indifferent and scarcely ever think of coming to school. Would be pleased to get your advice as to the best method of increasing the attendance in my school. When I went to Georgina Island they had a Scout Officer to assist Mr. Tweed.

Elgin Institute, Muncey, Ont., beginning on the evening of the twenty-third day of this month. This is a Conference held by the order of and under the direction of the General Board of Missions, with a view to making as thorough a study as possible of the Indian Work. It is, therefore, important that each member of the Commission on Indian Work as well as each worker engaged in Indian Work should be present. Such topics as the following will be presented and it is hoped that each member of the Conference will come prepared to offer some contribution to the discussion:\n\n\"How to make the Indian a good Citizen\"\n\"Remnants of Paganism\"\n\"Why should we educate the Indian\"\n\"Indian home life\"\n\"How far can Indian Missions be made self-supporting\"\n\"Possible co-operation between White Work and Indian Missions\"\n\nIt is also expected that each member of the Conference engaged in Indian Work will come prepared to give a report of his Mission, including the number of Indians under his care, the present conditions under which he is carrying on his work, adequacy of equipment and the future prospects of his work.\n\nThe Board undertakes to meet the travelling expenses of the delegates to the Conference, that is, of each missionary or missionary teacher and member of the Commission on Indian Work. It cannot undertake to provide for the expenses of the wives of any of the delegates, neither can entertainment be provided for any but the members of the Conference owing to the limited accommodation at Mount Elgin Institute.\nIt is also expected that the delegates will take advantage of the holiday rates which run from the 23rd to the 26th. Owing to the importance of the work it is thought that ample time should be allowed for the fullest discussion. The programme is being planned to cover the evening of the 23rd and the whole of the 24th and 25th. Muncey is on the Michigan Central Railroad, about thirteen miles East of St. Thomas. Delegates on enquiry at their local stations will be able to receive information as to routes and trains.\n\nTrusting that this Conference may result in great good for the work at large, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAGF-VS\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is evident that he has filled out this application without a clear understanding as to the maximum salary which is paid at Chemong.\n\nIn view of the urgency of the situation, I would recommend that as good an offer as the regulations of the Department will permit be made to this young man for the remainder of this year at least. We have an applicant who would be able to take up the work by the first of January. In the meantime, the Inspector of the district and the Chief on the Reserve have both urged that teacher be secured as early as possible.\n\nIt is my own opinion that no qualified teacher can at present be obtained for that position at the salary which has previously been paid.\n\nAwaiting your action and reply,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nJHA-VS\n\nJ.

Kindly explain why Miss Armour did not take the position.\n\nWith regard to Mr. Redmond, I beg to say that the Department cannot consider paying a salary of $600.00 to a person without any professional qualifications whatever. If, however, Miss Armour cannot take the position Mr. Redmond may be appointed temporarily, if he will accept the same salary, $400.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAest.

Mr. Redmond will not consider a temporary appointment at $400.00 per annum.

The difficulty has been to secure efficient and qualified teachers for the salary which the Department has been paying. We understand from the local conditions which prevail there that it is not a suitable place for a lady teacher, and desirable male teachers do not seem willing to give their services for the salary offered.\n\nIn response to our last advertisement we have received two applications which appear desirable. We are enclosing you copies of these applications; the one, you will notice, asking a salary much in advance of that now paid. We are expecting to have an interview with Mr. Buffam on Saturday and will do our best to secure him.

We are now enclosing copy of application submitted by Mr. H. O. Buffam whose appointment we would recommend if the Government can see its way clear to pay the salary asked for.

This is the best the Department can do and it would like to know whether this will be satisfactory to Mr. Buffam. If so, he should be ready to re-open the school at the earliest possible date.

On Feb. 14, the Athletic Club gave an Oyster Supper and used the school-room for the same purpose as on Jan. 29.\n\nI regret to see the school closed on these occasions but even if the school-room were not used in this way, it would be impossible to teach the next day owing to the noise of cleaning up and the commotion of running in and out.\n\nI wish to add that Mr. Agent McCann did not come here on these two dates to visit the school but to be present at...\nthese functions, at the latter of which he lowered himself to dance with the natives in the hall after they had been forbidden to do so by the Chief.

In reply I beg to inform you that your appointment was made on the recommendation of the General Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society which has the nomination of the teacher for the school on this Reserve and as there is no resident Missionary at Curve Lake, it is presumed that you were expected to take the regular church services.

This is due to the indifference or ignorance of the parents. Would you kindly advise me as to what course to pursue in the matter? The Agent has been here repairing the old church for a school room but has done nothing to remedy this condition.

They are not interested in their studies or in their play. They are as bright as any children in the country, and yet they do not get on as they should.\n\nThe formation of the trouble, I would say, lay in the system followed in employing the teacher. There is a teacher recommended by the Mission Board as teacher and preacher. The Department engages him on three-year terms. He is placed in a village to teach where the parents have no control over him whatever. They have absolutely no say in the matter; consequently, they are indifferent. They are not interested. The school is visited once a month by the agent who makes a report, but for anything further, he has no authority. The teacher may refuse to follow his instructions\u2014and by the way does. The school is visited once a year by an inspector who reports excellent work being done. An inspector by the way who stated in a convention during the past year, that Indian children had not the capacity for learning that white children had\u2014He had a lively opposition in Miss M.E. Shurp of St. James' School. I am stating conditions as I find them. I am well aware that the difficulties are not easily overcome, but it would be worth while trying.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\nOttawa, April 16, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 3rd instant in reference to the Chemong Indian School I beg to say that, although the teacher of this school was appointed on the recommendation of the Methodist Missionary Society, his retention in office is dependent on the satisfaction he gives and you may inform Mr. Buffam that the Department will expect him to conduct this school in the interests of the children under his charge and he should endeavour to obtain the goodwill of their parents and do all in his power to secure the hearty co-operation of parents and pupils. You may also inform Mr. Buffam, if necessary, that so long as he remains in the service of the Department he will be expected to carry out any suggestions for the management of his school made by the Department through you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In this connection I beg to refer you to official letter of the 14th of January last, in which your attention was called to the powers given you under certain sections of the Regulations relating to the Education of Indian Children.\n\nYou will be good enough to instruct the truant officer to see that all the children of school age on the reserve attend school regularly and punctually.\n\nIt is also noticed in your report that no time table is posted up in the school. You should instruct the teacher to make out a time table and put it up in the school-room.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J.

The causes that have led to this resolution, I find, are mainly not connected with the school. The parents who have sent their children with even fair regularity are anxious to have me retained. Some who have failed to send their children and whom I have tried to compel to do so vote to have me dismissed; the mover of the resolution has three little girls all over school age who have never been sent an hour to school, who wander almost as wild as Indians ever were. Others object to the School garden. Another objection was that I do not visit the sick; their Local Preacher told me more than a year ago that he had been appointed to do that as he could use their own language. Some are offended because I will not loan money to them. Also, I send to the city for supplies as I find prices at the village store exorbitant, this store is conducted by the Chief and his father.\n\nThese causes are all petty and unworthy. I have striven ever since I came here for the welfare of the Indians. I gladly invite an unbiased and efficient inspection of my work. Unfortunately the Agent is not capable of doing this.\n\nWill you kindly let me know if the Band has power to dismiss the Teacher? If so what warning must be given?\n\nAlso, must I leave the house and garden at this time of year? If so can I claim remuneration for the same?\n\nIf I have to leave at the close of this term can I claim salary in proportion of the number of days taught to the number of teaching days, as can be done in other schools?\n\nWill you kindly give these questions your consideration and answer me at your earliest opportunity, by return mail if possible?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I sincerely hope his successor will take a greater interest in the children.\n\nI note that you have requested the Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society to secure a qualified teacher. I must say that I have grave doubts about the wisdom of that system. I think if the Department would engage the teacher through their own supervision or through a school board of the members of the Band with assistance of the agent or some one who is directly interested and would have direct supervision then that there would be better results. I have had a great deal of worry over this school. For the last year there has been an agitation in the Band to put the teacher away.

All the produce was grown by school pupils from seed supplied through the Indian Agent, from your Dept. Exhibits were made of corn, beets, onions, pumpkins, squash, canned fruit, peas, beans, carrots, parsnips, tomatoes, apples, drawing, writing, etc.\n\nThere was a lack of system about the fair that can be improved next year.\n\n(1) The children should know in the spring what they can win prizes for.\n\n(2) They should know what an exhibit should consist of.\n\n(3) They should have the fair organized; a president, vice-president, sec.-treas., and a committee should be appointed from the school children. This should be done in the spring of the year.\n\nFor next year we can make arrangements to have these things done at the proper time.\nOttawa, October 30, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Abraham, Agricultural Representative of this Department, in his report on the Mud Lake Reserve, states that the school fair held at the Chemong School was, considering that it was the first fair of any kind ever held on the reserve, a decided success. He thinks, however, that there was a lack of system about it that might be improved next year.\n\nKindly bring this matter to the attention of the Department next spring, so that all arrangements for the fair may be made then.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nR. J. McCamus, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKeene, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nI feel proud of Mrs. Hanes our teacher of the Cheewaybud school, and so do my son George and a great many other children. Says Mrs. Hanes is best teacher they ever had before she came as a teacher. The children had no proper training and now they are properly trained both morally and intellectually. But there is some trouble to Mrs. Hanes derived by Miss Whitney and two others and now I ask the Department to uphold her and to still continue her teaching in the future.\n\nI am highly recommend her as a qualified teacher for the above Cheewaybud school.\n\nDirecting the Department to attend this matter in question.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Haines as a qualified teacher for our Indian Reserve, of which she is teacher of the day school, and also Superintendent of our Sunday School.\n\nMrs W.J. Haines has a great interest in the Indian children in trying to educate them, and is doing all she can to make them understand the ways and rules of life.\n\nHoping the Department will have Mrs W.J. Haines to remain as our teacher and missionary for a few years for the benefit of our Indian children, for the changing of teachers after being here one or two years is of no way in which to give our Indian boys and girls an education.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nArthur Whiting,\nPetoskow, P.O., Ont.\nMEMORANDUM,\n\nChief Dan Whetung, Jr., who called at the Department on the 28th ultimo, made complaints about the teacher of the Chemong School. He was under the impression that he as Chief should have more to say about the school than the teacher and Mrs. Haines was not disposed to let him. He seemed to think that he should have a say in all that goes on on the reserve in regard to education, religion, etc. He also objected to the teacher changing the hours of the Sunday school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

A communication has been received from another member of the Whetung family stating that the teacher is doing good work.\n\nThe Department would like you to state what trouble is amongst the Whetungs about the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Johnston, Treasurer\n\nDec. 8th, 1916\n\nMrs. Benson\nSchool Inspector\nBad Bay\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThere has been so much dissatisfaction about the way things are being done in our public school here, that our council has passed a resolution which has been sent to you through the Indian agent \"Mr. McComas,\" requesting you to grant us the authority of organizing a school board on the same system as they have in Brantford Reserve, as promised me by you when I was there in Nov. The reason for this dissatisfaction is that our teacher seems to be slightly unbalanced or at least acts in a strange manner for one in her position; a few days ago she wrote on the blackboard the word \"whore\" and taught the children that one of our ladies who has long been prominent in church and town organized was that kind of a woman.\n\nAnd on Monday she hit a small boy about twenty-five times on the head, and knocked him right off his seat, and she also did not teach this week for two and a half days without explanation of her absence, and this is not the first time she has stayed away.\n\nThis boy's father is in the trenches in France but his mother threatens to have the teacher arrested for striking him on the head. And the other lady who was called a \"whore\" also threatened to sell as she felt it very keenly, for she has always used the teacher very kindly.\n\nAs a result of these similar happenings there are only a few children attending school now as the parents do not like to think of their children being taught such things while other...\nI am afraid I may have mixed up in a court trial of some kind or that the children might get blinded or deafened by being struck on the head. She is an extremely bad example for the children because no matter if she is seen doing a thing she lies and says she didn't do it. Therefore we cannot understand how the Methodist Society could have sent such a woman here unless they were in total ignorance of the kind of person she is. She also takes her baby girl and a boy or two years old to school with her which is also a nuisance. We should have an unmarried teacher.\n\nDifferent times lately I have been asked to speak to her about things she has done but have had to refuse the request as I find it perfectly useless to parley with a person who has so little brain and no principle. In view of these circumstances we hope that this resolution that has been forwarded will meet with an early and favorable reply.\n\nThanking you in advance,\n\nYours Truly,\nD.E. Whiting\n\nP.S. It may interest you to know that the lady who was called a \"whore\" by the school was the one who made the pie which you referred to when I was there, as the beef you had ever eaten if you find it necessary to come I would meet you in Peterboro with my car any day if you would let me know.\n\nD.E.\nChemong Council\n\nD. E. Whetung, Chief\nA. McCue, Secretary\nG. Johnston, Treasurer\n\nCurrie Lake, Dec. 6th 1916.\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nWe would like you to try and get us another teacher as soon as possible as the present teacher (Mrs. Haines) seems to be slightly unbalanced or at least act very strangely for a woman in her position.\n\nThe following will give you an idea of the things she has been doing.\n\nOne day last week she wrote the word \"whore\" on the blackboard and told the children that one of the ladies in our village was that kind of a woman. This lady was doing something that made a mistake years ago but confessed herself and joined our church and now is an organizer in the church. And she always used Mrs. Haines kindly and through her Mrs. Haines was appointed president of the Ladies Aid Society. But she neglected her duties as president to such an extent that the society never amounted to any thing since.\n\nThen again, on Monday she whipped a boy Bertram Webster nine years old about twenty-five times on the head and face and knocked him right off from his seat to the floor. His stepfather has gone overseas to France doing his bit in the trenches and his mother has plenty of trouble without anything more. The boy was sick for a few days. And Mrs. Haines has not come to school since. Whether she had any explanation? Of course this is not the only time. In Sept. 13 and 14 she missed school without a reason and always denies everything. There are only a few of the many peculiar things Mrs. Haines has done. So we think a change necessary and that a teacher could be secured in a few days if our needs.\nwere advertised in The Peterboro paper.\n\nThese ladies Miss Davis Whiting and Mrs. Mebane whose boy was flagged will not proceed with the case if Mrs. Harris is expelled from her school otherwise they will send the information in the newspapers further.\n\nI had been to the Indian Dept. in November and Mr. Benson promised me that they would grant the council the privilege of forming a School Board. If they were satisfied this Board would be on the same system as they have in Bradford Reserve.\n\nKindly look this over and an early reply will greatly concur.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nD.E. Whiting Chief.\nDecember 6th, 1916.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFor some time information has been coming to me concerning trouble between the teacher and some of the people at Chemong. The letter which is enclosed arrived this morning and I feel it my duty to forward it to the Department.\n\nI have tried to influence both parties to adjust their differences and try to work together at least until the end of the school year, but of course it is not competent for me to take any official action as between the teacher and the people.\n\nFrom Rev. Francis Johnson, of Lindsay, the Methodist minister who is supplying the church work at this point, I have received a letter which indicates that a very serious quarrel has been in progress for some months. I quote the concluding page of his letter as follows:\n\n\"I am sorry for Mrs. Hanes, for if she has been so indiscreet as to write on the blackboard of the school and call attention of the children to it, I am afraid her usefulness is at an end there. She, however, denies having written, or said such thing about Miss Daisy Whetung as are reported by the school children. I consider Mrs. Hanes competent and zealous and should do good work somewhere else, if she has a free hand. I would, in confidence to you, recommend her resignation or removal, as I think her useful...\"\nness there is at an end. I am sorry to have to say this, for I had expected a good deal of help from her in the work there. If you can give her another chance somewhere else it would be a God send to her. In the meantime, if you see your way clear to come down and see for yourself, it would have a good effect.\n\n\"Sincerely yours,\"\n\n(Signed) F. Johnson.\n\n\"P.S. What that work needs is a good competent man that would teach the school, preach, act as Indian agent, all in one and give him a living salary. It would be the best think that could be done for church and state.\"\n\nYours truly,\n\nJHA/M.\n\nEnc.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esquire,\nAss't Secretary & Deputy,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, December 16, 1916.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant in reference to the trouble existing between the teacher and some of the Indians on the Chemos Reserve and enclosing a communication from Chief Whetung on this subject.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department agrees with you that it would be in the best interests of this school to have a change of teachers at once. As Mrs. Hanes was appointed on your recommendation, the Department considers that it would be well for you to ask for her resignation, as her services will not be required after the Christmas holidays. The Department would like you to take steps to secure the services of a qualified teacher to take her place after the New Year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst.

(RG 10, Volume 6148, File 414-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nIn reply to official letter of the Department No. 17221/1 dated No. 25 regarding complaints made by Chief Whiteman of Mied Lake against the School Teacher Mrs. Hanes. I beg to say that while Mrs. Hanes is a fairly good teacher and takes an interest in her work, she is a very little body and talks too much. In further explanation of the present trouble I may say that when she and her family came to Chumney a year ago last October they were in very poor circumstances. She ran an account at Daniel Whitney's store which she promised to pay when she received her first payment of salary. Instead of doing so she went elsewhere for supplies and paid cash. Even sent to the J. Balzer & Co. for goods by mail and expense herself on the plea that Whitney overcharged her. You can easily understand how Whitney would resent this but to give him his due he waited until she got her mislaid remittance when the account was paid and I think this would have passed over without serious result had there been no talk but the teacher would not hold her tongue. I cautioned her on several occasions and warned her that she was\nSir,\n\nmaking trouble for herself, but to no avail what has further aggravated the matter is the fact that Mr. Hanes has a good something husband. A young smart man who will content himself to mind the tribal while his wife worked and supported him, in such times as these, is not to be compared with the worst Indians in Canada. As a consequence the Indians have very little respect for them, and he also is quite a failure. Mr. Hanes has made charges against Chief Whiting and his sister to me in writing, which I feel quite sure she could not prove and are not true. That would be a very serious business for her if she were to give them the information.\n\nI would strongly recommend that she be removed as soon as possible otherwise I fear there is serious trouble ahead for her.\n\nRegarding the difference between the reports of the two Whiting families, I may say that Joseph Whiting's family have no children going to school, they are not on friendly terms with Daniel Whiting's family, and any person who will speak against Daniel's family will be championed by Joseph's family.\n\nI cannot say to what extent the other...\nSir,\n\nmembers of the Board share the prejudice of Chief Whitney and his family towards Mrs. Harris but I do know that the chief is quite popular with the most of them and I also know that the attendance at school is falling off.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Arnup, Assistant Secretary Foreign Missions of the Methodist Missionary Society that Mrs. Hanes' services will not be required after the Christmas holidays and he has been asked to take steps to secure the services of a qualified teacher to take her place after the New Year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J. McCamus, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKeene, Ont.\nCurve Lake, Dec. 11th, 1916.\n\nRev. J. H. Arnup, B.A.,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of the 8th inst. to hand. I thank you for the information it contains, also for the assistance you have been to me and for all previous information. Very recently, some Indians have called upon us, among them the Ex-Chief. We are informed by one that was present at the second Special Council that was called for December 2nd, by Chief Whetung, for the purpose of asking for our removal, that Chief Whetung was the only member to talk on the subject, all the others refused to discuss the question, they being satisfied. The Whetung family are the only one of fifty-five families, that is against us.\n\nMr. Hanes has had considerable trouble with Mr. Whetung Sr. and son, Chief Whetung, and feels he can endure it no longer. He has been to town to see a lawyer about it. And as advised, has decided to enter a case against the Whetungs for assault on Nov. 30th, and also for untrue and bad things they have been saying about us by word and in notes which we still have, and to have them bound over to keep the peace. This lawyer also advised me to enter a case against them and have them bound over to peace. I have decided to do so. This being settled, we feel sure that no more difficulty will arise from the Whetungs. Then all will go on peaceably.\n\nAbout the complaints laid by Chief Whetung, I truthfully deny writing anything on the board about anyone of the Whetungs at any time. And as for Mr. McCue, she still sends her three boys, among them Bertram, and gives me no trouble.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) Zella May Hanes.\nDecember 19th, 1916.\n\nDear Sir:\n\n- Re Chemong Indian School -\n\nA careful reading of my letter of December 8th on this matter shows that I made no recommendation for a change of teacher. My last communication put the Department in possession of the information which had come to me concerning conditions at Chemong, but made no suggestion that dismissing the teacher would provide a solution for the whole matter. I did report having used my personal influence with both parties toward securing an amicable settlement but added: \"Of course it is not competent for me to take official action as between the teacher and the people.\"\n\nWhile we are quite willing and indeed anxious to cooperate with the Department in every effort for the good of the Indian people, I am not aware of anything in official regulations or in the administration of Indian Affairs which gives the representative of the Missionary Society any right to ask for the resignation of a teacher appointed by the Department in an Indian School. Developments since December 8th make it still clearer that anyone lacking legal authority in Indian affairs would be ill-advised to attempt a settlement of affairs at Chemong. This is clearly borne out by the enclosed letter received yesterday from Mrs. Hanes. It is in answer to\na note in which I advised both parties that the information in my possession had been forwarded to the Indian Department, and that the matter was now in their hands for decision and action.\n\nIf the Department decides that whatever may be the outcome in other directions a change of teacher is necessary as a result of the difficulty which has arisen, I will immediately take steps to secure the application of another qualified teacher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJHA/M.\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esquire,\nAss't Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nCurve Lake, December 17th\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\n489859\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nPermit me to state to you a few facts. I have just made out the report of Chimoq School and am sending it to the Agent.\n\nAs long as we got everything we need from the merchant here, Mr. Dan Whetung Jr., everything went lovely. But since we first got milk and other necessaries from other Indian families, that family of Whetungs have tried to make all kinds of disturbances. They have tried every means to force us to their way, and now that they can't, they are trying to put us out.\n\nI understand that the last resort is to falsely accuse me, and ask for my removal etc. About the writing on the Blackboard, I wish to explain fully. First, I have had considerable trouble with B. McCue's Boys.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6148, File 414-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nI have punished them in various ways, and I could punish more severely but have neglected. One incident that frequently occurs is Bertram's interrupting the class recital by making a clever answer and then laughing audibly over it. On Nov. 30th, I only reproved him again, and when he was interrupting the class, I made a statement. Here at noon, told it differently. I shall now explain.\n\nI had the front board nearly filled with words and their meanings. The class in concert were pronouncing and spelling them. One word was abhor - hate. Bertram miscue pronounced it (loav, whose). I corrected him. Then I said that what he said was loav, and there is another word pronounced the same. I wrote it on the bottom of the board, saying can you spell it? Bertram said, yes we can spell all bad words. Then laughed heartily. While he was laughing,\nAnother member of the class whispered what the meaning? I, in a low whisper said I call a person, or rather a woman who becomes a mother and doesn't marry and still continues to live such a life. \u2014 and I pointed to the word. \u2014 rubbed it off. \u2014 saying I hope there is none in this village. My back was to the class and I heard one whisper Daisy Whetting. I repeated, I hope there is none in this village. \u2014 Reviewed the remainder of the words and the class went to their seats. It was then 10 to 12. I went to dinner. Mr. Hanes drove me to school in the afternoon.\n\nWhen we got at the corner, the two Whetting women came out and held us up and in public before the 20 children accused me of saying what I did not. Then Daisy wrote me a terrible note. I showed it to the lawyer.\nwho advised me & put it in High Court...and sue for slander. Nor is this first time they have slandered me.\n\nMatters have quieted since, and we feel that everything will go all right and peaceably in the future.\n\nI take this opportunity to thank you for my last year's salary $600. Received in full Nov. 2nd 1916. Also, for all the school supplies sent to Chemong School.\n\nWhen we first came, the agent informed us that, if we wanted anything for the mission house here, to write him, and the Dept. would furnish it. We asked for a pump. Last August, the agent wrote me that he would soon be up and was bringing a pump with him. Oct. 18th, the pump came. Oct. 30th, the Chief came and took it. I asked him why. Chief say \"The Dept. have gone their limit. They're not going to do any more around here without first asking us.\"\n\nWe are somewhat in the dark as to these matters and would like information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMrs. W.

I was visited last night by the school teacher Mrs. W. J. Haines, who states that the Chief still keeps the school house locked up and prevents any children belonging to the band from being educated. I presume we are liable to be sued for the teacher's salary while she is wrongfully prevented from earning her salary.

E. Broderick, Public School Inspector for Victoria County. Although Mr. Broderick has not been in recent touch with affairs at Chemong, he is well informed as to the general situation, and I beg to suggest that the Department make use of his services at least by way of consultation in the investigation which is to take place.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJHA/M.\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nEncl.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esquire,\nAss't Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nPeterboro' January 24th, 1917.\n\nTo Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire however to lay before you a number of complaints that have been made regarding trouble at the Chemong Indian Reserve for some time past on account of the bad management.\n\nIn the first place Chief Dan Whetung was elected chief on 16th October 1913 for three years till October 1916.\n\nLast spring he notified us he had been re-elected although we did not get notice to attend the meeting, only his own voters, and the election should not have been held then and he was not properly re-elected.\n\nWhen the teacher was appointed the Chief informed her that there was no Mission house in the Village (which was untrue) and said he had a house of his own he rented to school teachers at $8.00 per month. The Chief wanted the Mission House for himself, and he told people he was going to live in it. He objected to the Teacher having a pump and had it taken out.\n\nHe quarreled with the Teacher and assaulted her husband, and was fined for so doing by the Police Magistrate and then out of spite closed the school and kept the key of the school. Parents are compelled to send their children to school, but were not allowed to do so on account of the action of the chief.\n\nThe Teacher is well qualified and has had fourteen year's experience, and no fault can be found with her, but the Inspector required certain improvements which the Chief refused, and Rev. Mr. Arnup wrote that the Inspector would not go to the Village again till a change was made there.\n\nI applied for the privilege to cut wood at the public reserve for those who have no wood lots, and was refused while the supporters of the Chief were allowed to cut wood there and nothing was done to them, and the Indian agent did not object.\nso far as we knew. The agent does not treat us fairly. He has secrets with the Chief and acts without consulting the band and allows the Chief to act without consulting the band.\n\nThe Indian Act (Section 96) provides that the Chief may be deposed for dishonesty, intemperance, immorality or incompetency by the Governor in Council.\n\nThe Chief was guilty of intemperance. He was seen drunk in the Little Windsor Hotel in Peterboro. He was seen one Saturday night last summer taking his auto car near the Mission House and the next day several of the men were seen staggering around drunk.\n\nHe was also guilty of bribery and threatening to force people to sign a petition to dismiss the school teacher, and telling them if they refused they would be refused credit at the store owned by him and his father.\n\nI have proof for all the above, and regret I was not informed when your officer went to the Reserve yesterday so that I could be there to prove my statements to him. I would ask to have the present Chief deposed.\n\nThanking you for your courtesy in the past,\n\nI am\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Affairs.\n\n490986 Ottawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to inform you an officer from the\nHeadquarters was here\non Tuesday, the January\n23rd, 1907\nand I am sure he was\nwell pleased with Mrs.\nHanes, the Teacher of the\nChemong Ind. School.\n\nThanking to the Department.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nChief Jas. Whitney\nCurve Lake\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6148, File 414-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nI beg to report that I have visited the Chemong school and made inquiries as to the teacher with the following results.\n\nI first visited the school, preferring to hear the teacher's side of the trouble before listening to the Indians. I found the school in session but a very small attendance. Mrs. Haines informed me that she understood that the children not at school were being kept at home by their parents. Asked as to their reasons for keeping children away from school, she told me that she thought Chief Dan Whetung to blame for the parents' actions. She also stated that the Chief had locked the school up and that she was unable to re-open it at the proper time after the New Year. In endeavoring to find out what cause, if any, the Chief had for opposing the teacher I had to listen to a great deal of church and \"Ladies Aid\" gossip which appears to have been largely the cause of the present condition of ill-feeling between the teacher and some of the Indians. Unfortunately, Mrs. Haines appears to have got herself mixed up in church troubles and has not been as careful as she might have been in her remarks about certain of the ladies of the church. The climax of the trouble seems to have been reached when the teacher wrote the word \"whore\" on the blackboard. There are various versions as to what took place and what was said in connection with the meaning of the word. In making her explanation of the affair, Mrs. Haines contradicted the version she gave in her letter to the Department. She stated to me that Daisy Whetung's name was not mentioned at the time by any one in the school. One of the school boys told me that he heard her connect Daisy Whetung's name with the meaning of the word. Mrs. Haines, in her letter to the Department, states that one of the school children\nmentioned the name. Whether or not Mrs. Haines mentioned this person's name in connection with the word does not appear to me to be material, especially after hearing all she had to say about Miss Whetung. It was plainly evident from Mrs. Haines' remarks that, no matter what she may have said, she certainly believes Miss Whetung to be immoral. But apart from this it would appear that the writing of such a word on the board in front of a class of children was very unwise. The result has been that the majority of the Indians resent such conduct on the part of the teacher and refuse to send their children to school. I regret to have to say that Mrs. Haines showed a rather vindictive spirit in her remarks and I could plainly see that to leave her in charge of the school would be useless. However good a teacher she may be, she has spoiled her usefulness so far as Chemong is concerned.\n\nIn taking the matter up with the Indians, I found that their chief cause of complaint was the afore-mentioned instance in connection with Miss Whetung. I also ascertained that a very large majority of the Indians were against her and that they claimed to be taking such a stand independently and not for the sake of supporting the Chief. I also found that the Indians were willing to accept a new teacher who was brought by the Agent. I requested them to leave the matter in the hands of the Department and that it would be dealt with, but did not state what action would be taken. They asked that they be advised as to what conclusion was reached and I told them that they would probably hear through their Agent as soon as anything was decided upon. I beg to recommend that another teacher be secured for the Chemong school and that Mrs. Haines be given two months notice of the change.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 6, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nIn connection with previous correspondence relative to the complaints against Mrs. Haines, teacher of the Chemong Indian School, I beg to say that, as the result of the investigation recently held into these matters, the Department has decided to dispense with Mrs. Haines' services on the 31st of March, next, and you will be good enough to notify her accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J. McCannus, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKeene, Ont.\nOttawa, February 6, 1917.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reference to previous correspondence regarding the complaints made against Mrs. Haines, teacher of the Chemong Indian School, I beg to say that, in view of the report made by the Inspector of this Department who was sent to investigate these complaints, it has been decided to dispense with Mrs. Haines' services at the end of the current quarter, the 31st of March, next, and our Agent has been instructed to notify her accordingly.\n\nI have, therefore, to request that you will be good enough to take the necessary steps to secure a qualified teacher for this school.\n\nWould it not be possible to secure a married man to look after the interests of the mission at this point, with a wife capable of taking charge of the school work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. H. Arnup, B.A.,\nAsst. Secretary, Foreign Missions,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nWesley Building,\n299 Queen St., West,\nToronto, Ont.\nFebruary 13th, 1917.\n\nRe Chemong School.\n\nYours of recent date is to hand, announcing the decision of the Department to effect a change of teachers at this point on March 31st next.\n\nThe General Secretary and myself concur in the view that a situation has arisen at Chemong which so seriously discounts the usefulness of the present teachers, Mrs. W. J. Hanes, as to make a change of teachers desirable.\n\nBefore entering into direct negotiations with another teacher we should be very glad to learn what steps the Department proposes to take in order to make the position of the teacher at Chemong reasonably secure against unwarranted interference on the part of Chief Whetung, the Chief's father, and other members of their family. This request is based on information already communicated to the Department by correspondence or in personal conversation.\n\nI beg to refer to the evidence furnished (1) by the teacher, (2) by the constable, (3) by the Public School Inspector, Mr. G. E. Broderick, of Lindsay, regarding earlier difficulties. You will recall the statements concerning threats and intimidation directed against both Mr. and Mrs. Hanes, the police court conviction for assault, the locking of the\nschool-house door, which indicate not merely an attitude of personal antagonism to the present teacher but an assumption of authority and a disregard of legal rights which, if persisted in, could not fail to affect injuriously the position and efficiency of any teacher who might be appointed. We have reason to fear that the removal of Mrs. Hanes, if unaccompanied by any expression in regard to the methods above referred to, would seem to strengthen the position of this family in their attitude towards the school.\n\nThis letter is in no sense intended as a criticism of the attitude or action of the Department to date, which in its fairness and moderation has earned our support as already expressed. In real anxiety for the future, however, we desire to direct this inquiry for information regarding further action.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJHA/M.\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esquire,\nAss't Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, February 20, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to my letter to you of the 4th ultimo requesting that you be kind enough to send to the Department a copy of the newspaper containing the paragraph to which you refer in your letter of the 30th December last with regard to Mrs. Hanes, may I request that you will be good enough to forward a copy at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. Daniel Whetung,\nPostmaster,\nCurve Lake, Ont.\nOttawa, February 20, 1917.\n\nChief,-\n\nI have to inform you that it is observed that your attitude with regard to the conduct of affairs on the Chemong Indian Reserve has not, on different occasions, been such as should be adopted by the chief of a band. A tendency is evident on your part to act at variance with the Department, which is a condition of affairs that cannot be countenanced.\n\nIt should not be necessary to remind you that it is absolutely essential for the Department to exercise full control over its affairs in the different agencies; and I am quite sure that, with a little thought, you will come to a realization of this fact.\n\nI may say that should there be a further tendency to relegate to yourself the control of affairs on the reserve without regard to the Department, the question of your deposition from the chiefship would have to be considered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

References from J. L. Garvin, I.P.S. for Barrie, and others, are on the way, but my nomination is being made largely on the strength of a personal interview with Mr. Buie. He is 22 years of age, of splendid appearance, a member of the Baptist Church, and a second year student in Arts at McMaster University.\n\nOn account of examinations, Mr. Buie will not be available for service until April 25th. This is to be regretted, but no other qualified teacher has applied, and the only other prospective applicant would be available only on the same date. Having in mind present conditions at Chemong, Mr. Buie is the type of teacher whom I should be glad to see placed in the position. You will note that he is not a Methodist, which may enable him to dissociate himself more completely from both parties to the recent trouble there.\nIn accordance with a suggestion made to me during a recent visit to the Department, I include the further recommendation that the salary for this period continue as at present, at the rate of $600.00 per annum.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJHA/M.\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nJ.

J. Haines and his wife at the Chemong village. As a result Mr. Haines and his wife were ordered to vacate an action that was tried yesterday in the Chemong village before Magistrate R. J. McCannus. The plaintiff was Daniel Whetang who claimed that Mr. Haines and his wife had been notified by Indian Agent McCannus to vacate the Mission house by the second of April. Mr. Haines is a Methodist Missionary and his wife is a school teacher. Mr. G. N. Gordon who appeared for Haines asked the Magistrate to dismiss the case.\n\nA STATEMENT\n\nMr. Gordon makes the following statement in connection with the case:\n\nThe Methodist Missionary and his wife, who is a teacher, were asked by Chief Daniel Whetang when they intended to leave, and Indian Agent McCannus told them they could find this was notice to vacate and he issued warrants for the arrest of the woman and her husband, and sent an Indian from the Reserve to make the arrest. If either of these parties had been arrested off the Reserve the arrest would not have been legal, as the Indian Agent had no power to issue a warrant for an arrest outside the Reserve. At the trial the Indian Agent said he had heard of the matter from his own observation and what he had heard he was satisfied as to the guilt of the parties. Although Mr. Haines and his wife were taking steps to remove their stuff, proceedings were taken against them by the Indian Agent, as trespassers, and the Indian Agent claimed he had paid to two men to watch the premises.\n\nCase Tried At Chemong Village\n\nFor some time past an attempt has been made to have vacated the premises occupied by Mr. W.

Any trial which is to be held on the reserve should be brought to Peterboro, where they will get their right judgment according to law, as our agent Mr. Evans, has no judgment. My reason for protesting against the agent & Chief are: I asked them for land and firewood sometime ago, but they would not give it to me, I was told to buy my wood & land. I am of one of the original Indian Descendant, of the Treaty Indians belonging to mud lake Reserve, having a wife and three children, and should have 50 acres of land given to me at the Reserve according to the Indian Act.

(RG 10, Volume 6148, File 414-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nReceived a letter from Mr. McCue, Indian agent, saying that you did not think a delegation to Ottawa necessary to adjust the school trouble here. In regard to this I want to say that it is not altogether the school trouble that is bothering us, but there is such a hostile feeling among the people that we fear they may be at war among themselves before long. My uncle Joseph Whiting calls himself the chief here. He writes letters and signs his name Chief Joe Whiting, which he seems to foolishly imagine he is. He has gathered his own and few followers around him. They hold their own council meetings and do not attend the regular council which is held once a month, and which the members can attend and have any matter fairly and squarely discussed and settled according to the wishes of the people. Mr. Knott who is not an actual member of this band is one of the main supporters of Joe Whiting. He goes from house to house with all kinds of untrue stories spreading discontent among the people and making trouble in many homes. Joe Whiting and some Knott families imagine and spread impossible reports, such as this, that we want to get mission house and change it into a boarding house that we are trying to induce Potts, a white man who married one of the ladies here, to live here as resident etc. These reports are entirely imaginary and untrue.\n\nWe think and advise the best way that strong measures be taken to stop this abuse, as a riot is to be avoided.\n\nThat Joe Whiting be made to understand that he is not recognized.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6148, File 414-1, part 1)\nby the Ind. Dept or else where and that Mr. Knott be warned to strictly attend his own business as he is actually a non-treaty Indian from Georgina Island who was smuggled in here.\n\nI had a chat with Mr. H.C. Ross of the Ind. Dept., whom I met in Peterboro and he said that a clearer understanding would be arrived at by going to Ottawa in person as he had gathered from letters received from Joe Whetung and Mr. Knott etc. that Knott was an awful man, but after a few minutes chat & explanation entirely reversed his opinion.\n\nI sincerely hope that trouble among the people may be stopped. My whole desire is and has always been for peace and quietness as many of our boys are in the trenches and some are wounded and some killed and there is plenty of trouble without the people fighting among themselves.\n\nHoping to soon have this matter adjusted before it is gone too far, I write the Dept. to have an investigation or whatever they think is necessary and I will do anything in my power to assist.\n\nKindly reply\u2014\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nD.E.

In my opinion having regard to the whole situation, school conditions at the Mud Lake reserve are in every way most unsatisfactory. They are a positive discredit to those responsible for the moral and educational welfare of the children of that community. I think it my duty to urge strongly that a more generous and a more rigorous policy be adopted in regard to the education of these children. And I recommend that,\n\n1. An immediate effort be made to secure a properly qualified teacher. If a married man of the right type could be secured who would occupy the Mission house and who could serve the community as Missionary and Indian Agent so much the better.

Having visited Chemong I am able to corroborate what Mr. Broderick states and what I understand he has reported to the Department regarding the condition of the school buildings there. He expresses the opinion that it would be very difficult, if indeed it would be desirable, to secure the services of a firstclass qualified teacher unless some improvement can be made in the plant and equipment with which he would have to work. In supporting the view expressed by Mr. Broderick I beg to state that the Missionary Society is ready to cooperate with the Government to the full extent of its obligations in any forward policy which may be adopted at Chemong.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJHA/M\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nJ.

Mr. Arnup and Dr. Endicott.\n\nI discussed school matters with Mr. Arnup and he suggested that they place Mr. Joblin, who has been teacher at Alderville for sometime and is dissatisfied with conditions there, at Chemong and that Mr. Jones, who has been at Christian Island, take his place at Alderville.\nSir,\n\nRegarding a teacher for the chimney school. I have stated in previous communications that the present teacher Mr. Albert Melvin does not want to teach and has asked several times to be relieved. He is of the old school and not at all up to date and while he is a good man and tries to do his best yet the school is suffering for the want of a good teacher. Mr. Albert Whitney has been asking me if there is any prospect of getting a qualified teacher. If not, he says he has decided to leave the Reserve. He has a very bright boy about seven years old and he is determined to give him a good education. He had Mr. Melvin for a teacher himself and he knows what he is\u2014a good man but a poor teacher. Mr. Whitney is one of the best men in the Band. He is a good farmer and is getting ahead. He has a good farm, a good house and frame barn on stone foundation with stables below. Last fall he sold $100 worth of stock at one sale. He was able to buy $200 worth of wheat bonds. Mr. Whitney intends renting a farm in the white settlement where his boy will have the benefit of a good and qualified teacher.\n\nI would strongly recommend that the Department advertise for a qualified teacher for the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I understand that Mr. McCue is known to the Department, and also I learn from Mr. Barner that Mr. McCue is willing to undertake the duties of the school at Chemong.\n\nMr. Wesley F.

As Mr. McCue is not a qualified teacher salary can only be allowed him at the rate of $500.00 per annum for the period which he teaches.\n\nWith reference to the re-appointment of Mr. Watson, who wishes to return and resume duties in the spring, I beg to say that the Department is informed that he is an old man and not fit for the work. It is, therefore, considered that it would be well to obtain the services of another teacher to begin duties, if possible, on or about the first of April, next.

McGannis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKeene, Ont.\nHall's Bridge, Ontario.\n\nFebruary 9, 1920.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am writing you with regard to the securing of a school-teacher for the Indian village of Curve Lake, known as Chemong Indian Reserve.\n\nWe secured a teacher, Mr. Watson, last summer, who found it impossible to continue his duties on account of his wife's ill-health. Another teacher is urgently needed, and the Indian Agent, R. J. McCamus, of Keene, says that he will have no difficulty in securing one if he is permitted to do so.\n\nThe people of the reserve urge me to ask you to take whatever steps are necessary to secure a teacher, and if any arrangement can be made by which Mr. McCamus can be allowed to make the selection, the difficulty of securing one may be lessened.\n\nTrusting that you will be able, by some means, to secure a teacher for the children of this Reserve, I beg to remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(Sgd) Harold J. Bell.\n\n(probationer Wesley Circuit.)\nFebruary 19th, 1920.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your file No. 172211, dated December 23, 1919, in which you approved the appointment of Mr. Alfred McCue as teacher of the Chemong Indian Day School, I have to advise you that we have recently received a letter from Mr. McCue, in which he states that owing to the prevalence of diphtheria there is a very small attendance at the school,\u2014only two and three pupils,\u2014although the school has been kept open since his appointment.\n\nSince receiving the letter from Mr. McCue, we have received a letter from Mr. Harold J. Bell, our minister on the Wesley circuit, near Peterboro. This latter is a surprise to us, as one would hardly suppose the people would be pressing for the appointment of a qualified teacher if there is so small an attendance as mentioned by Mr. McCue. We enclose herewith copy of the letter which we have received from Mr. Bell. Perhaps you will communicate with the Agent at Chemong to secure the real facts in this case?\n\nWe have just been put in touch with a young woman, now at Queen's University, who wishes to take up work in the mission fields of Ontario. We were on the point of taking up with her the question of appointment to Chemong after Easter (as per the suggestion of the Indian Department) when this letter from Chemong comes to hand. We would be glad to receive at your convenience any information which you may have as to the school situation at Chemong.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nJ. D.

James Endicott, General Secretary for Foreign Missions of the Methodist Church in Canada, regarding the present school situation at Chemong. He states that he recently received a letter from Mr. McCue, the teacher, stating that, owing to the prevalence of diphtheria, there is a very small attendance at the school, only two or three pupils, although the school has been kept open since his appointment at the beginning of January, last.\n\nRev. Mr. Endicott also forwards a communication from Mr. Harold J. Bell, their minister on the Wesley circuit, in which he states that another teacher is urgently needed and that the people of the reserve have asked him to take steps to secure a teacher and that you would have no difficulty in securing one, if allowed to make the selection.\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough to furnish full information as to the present situation at Chemong, also as to whether you can obtain the services of a qualified teacher. You should also state fully regarding the attendance and whether, if the services of a qualified teacher are secured, there will be a full and regular attendance, and also if the epidemic of diphtheria on the reserve is now over. An early reply will oblige.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J.

It would have been better for me if he never came at all, for we had our place all seeded down and even had a man to rent it for pasture but when a good teacher came we decided to stay and he plowed some of the land again.

But our boy should be...\nBusy as no time now as he is eight past. The little time Mr Watson was here he was doing fine. He did not let them idle their time in school he kept the little ones busy at the black board. I hope we will be able to get another teacher as good as Mr Watson. We were very sorry he had to leave. So I hope you will try and get us a good teacher and you will greatly oblige us.\n\nFrom\n\nMrs Albert Whiting\n\nWishing you a Happy New Year.\n\nIf we cannot get a teacher would you please let me know soon.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to official letter of the Department No. 172211 dated Feb. 21st.\n\nRegarding conditions in Chimooy School I beg to say that the parents will not compel their children to go to school while Mr. Alfred Watson is teacher. They respect him highly as a man but they have no faith in him as a teacher he is of the old school and he does not seem to bring the children on and what is worse he does not seem to be able to instruct them. The diphtheria epidemic is quite over but the parents still fear that as an expense for not sending the children to school. The fact of the matter is the people are completely discouraged over the school business. They are anxious to have their children educated but since I was appointed agent in 1913 they have not had one teacher here who commanded their respect. Mr. Watson was an old cranky man they had no respect for him which yet he brought the children on and they were quite willing to put up with him. But of course he could not stay.

No doubt, by the end of May or early in June several resignations will be received and new teachers will be required on the re-opening of the schools after the summer holidays.

I think if this was done she might perhaps remain. She is undecided yet as to whether she will go to the university this year or not.\n\nI would also call your attention to the fact that the Chumney school is now a very heavy one and really should have two teachers, as you will notice by the report there are over 30 in the primary class all needing individual attention and few teachers would undertake it.\n\nI wish to say further that Miss Jervis has a marked influence for good over the young people of the village in general she spent one year teaching at the Fort on Lake Winnipeg and got a good insight into Indian character.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I will say first of all that I have agreed to return to teach there in September because I know more can be accomplished when the same worker remains for some time. My reason\nfor asking that two teachers be employed was not that I would have less work but more time to do better work. There are now enrolled twice as many pupils as have been before and more will begin in the fall making a total of about fifty-five. If it is a question of salary I would think it would pay the Government to have every child in the village attending school if it did mean two teachers rather than to have one teacher with a dozen or so pupils and the others running wild in the woods. This has been exactly the case and the Indians are thoroughly dissatisfied with the people who have lived in the mission house and as they say were more interested in their garden than their school work. In conversation with the agent he told me that they refused to teach certain subjects on the curriculum because they thought the Indian children were not intelligent enough. This\nmakes the teachers work heavier now. I think it would be especially difficult to secure a teacher for only six months and of course if one can first be found at all I will undertake it alone but as Superintendent of the Educational part you should know the true state of affairs I think there is a great deal of work that one must do outside of school and unless it is done there is little or no use in educating the children the moral and spiritual tone of the village is low and it is very\nOTTAWA, October 28th, 1921.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 24th instant, referring to the need of a sub-school for the winter months in connection with the Mud Lake (Chemong) Indian Day School.\n\nI had written to Mr. R.

It is a very difficult matter to secure even a fair average attendance however at any time. A good many of the children do not like Miss Brown.

There are vacancies for two teachers on the Saugeen Reserve, and, if you contemplate a change from your present position, you might communicate with the Indian Agent, Mr. T. A. Stout, Chippewa Hill, Ont., and obtain full particulars regarding conditions, etc., at these schools, which are, respectively, Saugeen Village and French Bay.

I have noted, with regret, that Miss Jessup is not prepared to accept this school and that you are getting in touch with an Indian on the reserve, who would undertake the work.\n\nThe Department cannot approve of the permanent appointment to the Mud Lake School of any teacher who is not properly qualified.

We are willing to pay more for a qualified teacher and no other kind will do. We have from 15-25 children school age and what is the average? It is because the Indians are discouraged with such lack of school teachers sent to our Reserve\u2014\n\nPreviously the mission Board and Ind. Dept. has been employing\nBut I strongly suggest that the Ind. agent be authorized that he advertise in the local paper & posterboard and secure a good teacher which he is most capable of doing.\n\nHoping this will be met with your approval and that a qualified teacher is secured.\n\nI had to go away from my Reservation to get what little education I have and I am sending one child away from home now to be taught by a qualified teacher is this going to be continued? I hope not. I hope that there will be a different system of securing a teacher.\n\nYours Chief D.C.

Manning, B.A., D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary, Home Missions,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nWesley Buildings,\nToronto, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI visited the Indians at Chemong, or Mud Lake, last week and discussed with them the question of a missionary-teacher for that point. You will remember that I mentioned the name of Mr. Joblin as a likely man to take up that work. I find that there is local objection to Mr. Joblin\u2014largely because of his domestic relations with the people at Alnwick, several of which tribe are married among the Indians at Chemong. I think, therefore, we shall have to drop that name and try to find someone else.\n\nI discovered that there is a large attendance of children at the School there, and the people think that one teacher is overburdened with the task. There are at the present time twenty-eight children in the primary class, and an average attendance of forty in the entire School. They suggest that next year two teachers be appointed; that the teacher in the senior room be a man and that he act as missionary-teacher. I pass this on for your information, and you will use your own judgment when the returns for the year in connection with the School come in.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Nov. 20, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of Rev.

Arrangements can be made for the accommodation needed, in a public hall which is contiguous to the present school building.

McCamus, Indian Agent, Keene, Ont., that we would approve of the temporary appointment of Mr. Smith for the balance of the present school year, and that salary at the rate of $100 per teaching month would be allowed. This matter was discussed with the Rev. T. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, who visited the Department yesterday, and he concurred in the appointment of Mr. Smith for the balance of the present school year.\n\nI shall be pleased if you would make a statement in due course with reference to your wishes for the coming academic year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

You also tell me that the Rev. T. Ferrier concurred in this arrangement.\n\nYou requested that we give a statement with reference to our wishes for the coming academic year. We had hoped to be able to secure a Missionary Teacher for this school for next year, but if Mr. Smith, whom you have engaged, proves satisfactory and is available for next year, it might be wise to continue him as Principal of this school with Miss Harris, or some other young lady, as second teacher, in which event we would supply Sunday services as we are doing now. If Mr. Smith should not be satisfactory, and the school should be without a teacher, we will do our best to find a Missionary Teacher. I may say that we had one whom we could recommend very highly engaged to take this school next year, but the new developments lead us to think that he might as well be placed elsewhere. If we decide definitely on this course, I will inform you in due time.\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory,\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nC.E. Manning\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst.

The cheque for the Mud Lake teacher's salary will continue to go direct to the incumbent and not through your office as it was, quite properly, not included in the list sent to me by the General Secretary under cover of December 31st, last.\n\nThe duties commence on September first and I shall be glad to cooperate with you in the matter of securing applications. Chief Dan Whetung, of Curve Lake, is an intelligent Indian and he takes an interest in this school. He has already written the Department that applications have been received by the Indian council. I have asked him to submit them to the Department and have stated that the nomination is in the Church authorities. I shall keep in touch with you in this connection.\n\nI wish also to acknowledge your letter of the same date, addressed to me.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. Roy Whetung, who is a member of the Mud Lake Reserve, situated in the Township of Smith, in this County, has spoken to me about the condition of education in the Reserve.\n\nThey have, at present, he informs me, a teacher who does not appear to be qualified to teach the children more than elementary subjects. Mr. Whetung states that, in the result, he has had to send his oldest boy to another school.\n\nThere are a number of children requiring education in the Reserve, and it would seem desirable that a teacher, fully qualified to train them and bring them on, is necessary.\n\nKindly let me hear from you in connection with the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6148, File 414-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, July 27, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Peck:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, concerning a complaint of Mr. Roy Whetung, of the Mud Lake Indian Band, relative to the qualifications of the teacher of the day school on the reserve. I am satisfied that Whetung's contention - that it is necessary to send his boy to another school - is not in harmony with the facts. Mr. Public School Inspector R. F. Downey, B.A., of your city, has reported from time to time very favourably on the qualifications and success of Mr. Arthur A. Smith, who has taught the Mud Lake Indian Day School for the past two years. Mr. Indian Agent McCamus, of Keene, and Chief Dan E. Whetung, of Curve Lake, also considered this teacher was giving entire satisfaction. In the summer of 1924, when the question of re-engaging Mr. Smith was before the Department, Chief Dan E. Whetung wrote in part as follows: \"We are greatly pleased with his work. . . . . He is really the right kind of teacher.\"\n\nI may add that the Department has received with much regret the resignation of Mr. Smith. I am corresponding with the Missionary Society of the United Church, which is associated with us in the conduct of the school, with a view to securing a suitable successor.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

J.V. MacNeilly of Bridgenorth, Ont.\u2014Any testimonial that this Methodist Pastor gives, you may depend upon. I would assume that if the applicant referred to should receive the appointment, it will meet with the approval of Chief Dan Whetung of Curve Lake, who I believe takes considerable interest in this school.\n\nWith the qualifications such as you have stated, I judge you are likely to give the position to Mr. Lewis, and hope to hear from you that this is the case.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJNS:GF.\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE\n\n[Signature]\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of official letter of the Department No. 25-1-1 dated the 17th inst., intimating that a teacher had been provided for Chernogy day school.\n\nI am pleased to know this and I will endeavor to be at Chernogy when the school opens.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nCurve Lake\n\nOct. 25/26\n\nA.

Thank you for\nyour prompt reply and attention.\n\nWe have increased in population\non our Reserve for the last 30 yrs\nalmost double, and we must\nhave something over sixty children\nof school age, and it is serious\nthat way our school is crowded.\nSometimes the teacher has to put three\npupils in one seat. We have\nconsidered this matter in our council\nand decided we should have two\nschool rooms and two teachers\nand it should be done immediately.\none of the rooms in the town Hall could be used as one temporarily until such time that a new school is being built. We have sent a resolution to the Dept. to send a man here to look over the situation and advise us.\n\nI am always willing to do anything that is reasonable and anything that would be a benefit to the education and I trust the Dept. will act quickly so the bigger children get discouraged when they do not get along in school as well as they ought to as there are too many children and worse of all too many grades in one room. The last two teachers we had resigned on account of nervous breakdown.\n\nThanking you in advance,\n\nYours Chief D.E. Whitney\nOttawa, October 29, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of the 25th instant, in which you recommend that a second teacher and classroom be provided at the Mud Lake Indian Day School.

He states that one of the rooms in the town hall could be used as a classroom for the time being. Please let me have a recommendation in this connection.

Smith. There are over fifty children on the roll and about one third of those in standard one. The room in the hall building formerly used for the school is still available and the furniture that would be required would consist of blackboards, a teacher's desk and chairs; and ten desks for children.\n\nI may say that the present number of scholars is likely to be maintained for some years, and there is the necessity for two teachers or otherwise a very competent one with experience.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nR.J.

We have every confidence in the Department in making a wise appointment to the Mud Lake Indian Day School, and at present have no desire to make a nomination for this position. We are grateful to you for bringing this to our attention, and, should occasion arise, we will be glad to avail ourselves of the privilege of nominating a teacher in this School.\n\nYours most faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nOGY: BJ\nOttawa, July 11, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer you to official letter of the 16th ultimo, in which you were requested to ascertain from Miss Scott, the assistant teacher at the Mud Lake Indian Day School, whether she desires to retain her position at this school for the next school year or not. You will please communicate with Miss Scott, ascertaining definitely whether she intends to resume duties when the school reopens after the present summer holidays, on September 2nd, next, and you should inform the Department of her decision. In discussing this matter with Miss Scott, you should draw her attention to the report of the public school inspector regarding her work during the last school year, and inform her that, if she intends to remain, it will be with the understanding that there will be a noted improvement shown in her work. The Department will expect an early reply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nV. M. Eastwood, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPeterborough, Ont.\nPeterborough, Ontario\nJuly 14th, 1930.\n\nTHE SECRETARY,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSir: Reference your letter #25-1-1 June 16/30\nand letter #25-1-1 July 11th, 1930.\n\nI beg to say that I interviewed Miss Scott, teacher\nat the Mud Lake Reserve, on June 17th, and I informed\nher of the adverse report that the Public School\nInspector had given regarding her work. She said\nshe thought Mr. Downey took exception to the children\nleaving their seats for various things and promised\nme that she would maintain order in her class room at\nall times in future. She would like to carry on\nwith the work at the Mud Lake school and would resume\nher duties when school re-opens on September 2nd, if\nthis meets with the Department's approval.\n\nI had been aware of the fact that Miss Scott's work\nhad not been altogether satisfactory and in order to\nimprove the conditions in the Junior room I wrote\nMr. Lewis and also Miss Scott giving Mr. Lewis the\nsame authority as a principal of the school, which up\nto the present he had not exercised and I instructed\nMiss Scott to take instructions from Mr. Lewis. I\nthink with the support of the teacher in the Senior\nroom that Miss Scott would be able to maintain the\nproper discipline in her class room.\n\nI have not discussed the matter with Mr. Downey, the\ninspector, as I have been unable to get in touch with\nhim recently. I might suggest that if Mr. Downey\nwould submit his reports through this office that I\nmight be able to assist and co-operate with him in\nremedy certain conditions before they get too far.\nI must say in regard to Miss Scott, that at all times when I visited the school I thought she was quite interested in her work and was making fair progress and it was a surprise to me to get a report such as I did. Outside of noting a certain untidiness in the school room and the falling off in attendance, at any time I visited the school room I concluded that her work was satisfactory.\n\nI would suggest that she be given until Christmas to show an improvement. In another letter I am forwarding an application received which you might consider in regard to the position left open by the resignation of Mr. Lewis.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent,\nMud and Rice Lake Reserves.\nLakefield, Ont.,\nJuly 3, 1930.\n\nMr. V.M.

In addition, I also hold a certificate in Elementary Art and one in Physical Training Grade \"B\".\n\nDuring the past year I have been teaching in a large rural school north of Lindsay in\nat grades ranging from beginners to a second form in high school. My classes consisted mainly of senior grades.\n\nI am leaving my present school for the sole reason of desiring a school closer home if at all possible.\n\nI should like to refer you to my inspector Mr. G. E. Portland of Fenelon Falls, Ont., who, I assure you, would willingly give you a satisfactory report of my year's work while under his inspectorship, also to my secretary Mr. P. H. Schroter of Kinmount, Ont.\n\nI wish to add that I have already called in reference to this matter and know you will do all you can to secure me the position.

I have also acquainted Miss Scott of the fact that she is engaged provisionally until the end of December.\n\nIn connection with the Department's allowance of a residence on the Reserve formerly used by Mr. Lewis, Miss Carveth intends to board on the Reserve for the present as her parents live in Lakefield and would be unable to accompany her.

The building is in very fair condition. The new furnace installed last fall is a great improvement and giving good satisfaction. The classrooms are light and airy and well equipped; Agent Eastwood states that the average attendance has improved during the past year and that the pupils are making very fair progress in their studies.\n\nThe Agent has been advised to keep in closer touch with school work and to send in the regular monthly school report which he has not been doing. This has been an oversight rather than neglect on his part.\n\nThos. McGookin.\n\nInspector.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR.

If we had a\nPrincipal with more experience and if Miss Carveth could\nbe induced to remain as assistant, I think this would be\na move in the right direction.\nOttawa, November 7th, 1930.\n\nSir,-\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Mud Lake Indian Day School, draws attention to the services being performed by Miss Scott, teacher of the junior room. He states that she is somewhat disappointing and does not take hold of the work with sufficient interest and enthusiasm. In this connection, I would refer you to official letter, dated July 29th, last, in which it was stated that it should be distinctly understood that Miss Scott was on trial until the end of December, next.\n\nI have to request that you will state whether you would recommend that her services be dispensed with when the school closes for the coming Christmas holidays and a new teacher engaged to replace her for the beginning of the new year.

I think after giving her a fair trial, which we have already done, that I would recommend that her services be dispensed with when the term closes at Christmas Holidays and engage a new teacher with services to begin at the new year as per your letter.\n\nAt the present time I have no teacher in view for the position, but will immediately make inquiries to this end.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\nMud and Rice Lake Reserves.\nOttawa, November 17, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, in which you recommend that the services of Miss Scott, teacher of the junior room at the Mud Lake Indian Day School, be dispensed with when the school closes at the coming Christmas holidays. In this connection I have to say that you should inform Miss Scott, by written notice, not later than the end of the present month, that her services will not be required after the school closes at Christmas.\n\nYou should continue your enquiry with a view to obtaining the services of a qualified teacher for the junior classroom, to begin duties at the beginning of the new year. It might be advisable for you to take this matter up with the public school inspector, who may be able to recommend the services of a teacher. You should forward, for the information and approval of the Department, full particulars as to the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher whom you nominate for the position. The salary allowed would be at the same rate as is paid Miss Scott, viz., $80 per teaching month.

There are some band members who will not send their children. These we have appealed to in every way.

(RG 10, Volume 6148, File 414-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Mr. Harris,\n\nTo inform you that Miss Margaret Gardner teacher is very unsatisfactory for this school. There are seven in the entrance class and they all claim the seven are not getting on very good. I am proud of the way our school had been getting on in the last few years and it would be too bad to keep her on; as the pupils have lost interest in her. I for one as others would like if you could see your way to make a change as soon as possible for the interest of the children.\n\nThanking you,\n\nChief D.E. Whitney\nOttawa, December 15, 1931.\n\nDear Chief:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, relative to the teaching services being performed by Miss Margaret Gardiner, the present teacher of the Mud Lake Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to inform you that enquiry is being made regarding your request for a change in teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nChief D. E. Whetung,\nCurve Lake,\nOnt.\nOttawa, December 18, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from Chief D. E. Whetung regarding the services of Miss Margaret Gardiner, teacher of the Mud Lake Indian Day School. He states there are seven pupils in the entrance class and that they are not making much progress. He also states the pupils have lost interest and that he, with others, would like to have a change in teacher as soon as possible, in the best interests of the children.\n\nI have to request that you will make an early report, stating your opinion regarding Miss Gardiner's services and whether or not you would advise that a change be made in the teaching services at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nV. H. Eastwood, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPeterborough, Ont.\nPeterborough, Ontario  \nDecember 19th., 1931\n\nThe SECRETARY  \nDepartment of Indian Affairs  \nOttawa, Ontario  \n\nDear Sir:-\n\nIn reply to your letter #25-1-1 of Dec. 18th., I wish to advise that there is some dissatisfaction with both the teachers at the Mud Lake Day School.\n\nOn receipt of your letter I called Mr. R.F. Downey by telephone and he stated that he was not satisfied with either teacher. His words were - \"I am somewhat fearful of the value of Miss Gardiner's services in the senior room\" and he intimated at the same time that Miss Long was not entirely satisfactory.\n\nRecently I have heard from several members of the Reserve that things were not satisfactory and I was in the course of preparing a report in the matter when your letter was received.\n\nMy opinion is that Miss Gardiner is not making progress with her pupils, she over-emphasizes such exercises as singing to the detriment of studies. I also think she is not progressive. In this Mr. Downey concurs. He stated that Miss Gardiner did not attend the fall convention in Peterborough.\n\nI would recommend a male teacher for the Senior class. I think same could be secured readily.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nMud and Rice Lakes\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, informing the Department that in the opinion of yourself and the Public School Inspector the services of Miss Margaret Gardiner, teacher of the Mud Lake Indian Day School, are not entirely satisfactory. It is noted that the pupils are not making progress.\n\nIn reply I have to say that if you consider a new teacher taking charge would not interfere unduly with the work of the pupils during the balance of the present school year, especially in the case of the pupils in the entrance class, you may inform Miss Gardiner that her services will not be required after the end of January, next. In the event of giving her this notice, you should, in consultation with the Public School Inspector, nominate the services of a qualified male teacher to succeed her as from February 1st, next. It is necessary that one month's notice be given before dispensing with the services of a teacher. If you notify Miss Gardiner that her services will not be required after the above mentioned date, you should forward in due time, for the approval of the Department, the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher whom the Inspector and yourself recommend be appointed. The Department will leave this matter for the Inspector and yourself to decide as to whether a change should be made at the date mentioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nV. M. Eastwood, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPeterborough, Ont.\nOttawa, January 18, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to correspondence concerning the services of Miss Margaret Gardiner, senior teacher at the Mud Lake Indian Day School. She has written the enclosed letter, which I should like to have returned for our file when you have examined it.\n\nAfter reading Miss Gardiner's letter, the Department is not quite satisfied that her services should be discontinued. If you have not already engaged the services of another teacher, please take no further steps to this end, but give Miss Gardiner's representations careful consideration and let the Department have a full report with the return of her letter. It must be kept in mind that, at Indian day schools, the extra-curriculum activity is nearly as important as the classroom exercises.\n\nEncl.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

I knew perfectly well the Mr. Downey did not approve of me in some respects. I knew it immediately when I introduced myself to him at school fair; knew it still more when he visited me. Said I should not join the two fourth classes so much, & The third class should give individual teaching. They were joined because there was no difference in them, and I had\nIt was over that, and\none or two other matters\nthat I wished to see you,\nand I still hope you\nwill come to the school\nwhere I can talk to you\nand show you also\nabout the cause of\nthe disagreement.\n\nThe Sunday School\ndoes need help badly,\nand I have felt that\nI could do much to\ntry to help raise the\nmoral standard of\nthe children, for God\nknows they need it. I\nliked my school work\nliked everything except\nthe fact that I had no\nhome of my own where I\ncould do more to help\nto start at the beginning\nof 2nd class work and told\nthirds & with 3rd class\nwork not very serious\neither, with both fourths.\nIt was useless to teach\nthe same thing to two\nclasses.

The results\nhave justified my course,\nand I haven't spared\nmyself.\n\nMr. Downey gave me\nno chance for explanation\nbut eulogized Mr. Lewis\nand his individual\nteaching \"as though I had\nnot even tried it. I have\nalways been credited\nwith getting the slow ones\non.\" I have not had the\nEntrance pupil fail for\nmany years.\n\nMiss Long & I had an argument over seats, and Mr. Kelting unfairly siding to her side of the story, told when I was absent, and then sprung upon me at dinner time. I begged him to go to school and see for himself, but he absolutely refused to hear one word I had to say.\n\nI can honestly say I had no thought of self when I asked for the seat I wanted\u2014seat\u2014but thought only of the comfort of my pupils.

Gardner\nCape Lake, Ont.,\nJan. 11th/32.\n\nR. T. Ferrier\nSupt. Ind. Education\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI received a notice from Mr. W.M. Eastwood, Indian Agent, Mud Lake, and Rice Lake, that my services would not be required after Oct. 1st.\n\nI cannot understand why, unless that some one has been reporting things that are absolutely one-sided and I feel fairly sure that such has been done.\n\nI received your letter re Inspector Downey's report. As far as it is possible I have given individual\nteaching. As far as possible,\nthe classes is concerned\nit was done for the sake\nof the children\u2014not mine.\nThere was no foundation\nto work on\u2014and I found\nthe senior 15 not one whit\nahead of the junior as\nregards any one subject.\nBy putting them together\nas very many teachers do,\nI had more time to give longer\nand more frequent lessons,\nsuch as are extremely nec-\nessary here.\n\nThe same is true of the\ntwo thirds. The class just\npromoted from the junior\nroom was ahead of the\njunior in ground work\nin arithmetic.\n\nIf Mr. Downey had given\nme a chance to really ex-\nplain the situation,\nInstead of taking it for granted that I must be a failure, the world, I verily believe, have sent me a different report.\n\nAs for the A.T. class which I was to take from the other room to lessen the pressure of numbers there, I had every intention of taking them when I had the other classes advanced enough so that they would take less time. They were taken last week 2 November. I knew Miss Long could at first do more for them than I could, so she could and did combine her II & I Classes in Language & Geography. Now it is different; Classes,\nthough by no means up\nto standard in every-\nthing, do know some-\nthing well, however,\nmore briskly are inter-\nested, and History lessons\nare no longer a trial,\nare more better lessons\ntoo, but a time of real interest.\nI have always had the\nreputation of being a\nteacher who never neglects\nthe slow pupils, and\nthough I've had Entrance\nClasses nearly every\nyear, have not had a\npupil fail for fifteen\nyears, and then it was\nmy first year in a\nnew school.\n\nThere is much immorality\nhere, and help is greatly\nneeded in Church & Sunday\nschool. I have a large class in the latter\u2014young people and some older ones. While I was away the Sunday there was no Sunday School as there was no one to take my class. I have begun a club for my big school boys, and it is to help them grow square\u2014slow work and discouraging at times it must be. But I love boys' work.\n\nI don't dance, play cards, etc., but I have not once in any way interfered with those who do, nor mentioned such pleasures in O.S. or day School. I don't believe \"trades\" are the best means of fighting whiskey, tobacco, and immorality, and almost every girl 17 fourteen and\nover smokes cigarettes more or less, and some of my boys are steeped in them.\n\nWhy should my children and the people generally be robbed of the only one in the whole Reserve that is quietly trying to help them to live decent Christian lives and on the whole really enjoying the work too?\n\nBesides, anything I can do outside of school work, is not detracting from the success of the school work but rather aiding it. Such work does not require as much time as addresses, cards, and boyfriends.\n\nI think almost every one who saw the school...\nConcert we put on this year says it was the evergreen here. My room gave a cantata taking nearly an hour; clean interesting full of the real spirit of Christmas. The children love singing and the sprightliness of the dialogue part was a surprise to many.\n\nMr. Whiting may be \"a very progressive Indian,\" but he & his family do not try to help in uplift in any way.\n\nI know I have the sympathy of the better class here who do want to see their children get on. It is unfair to the Entrance particularly, who all failed dismally last year, to give them a new teacher just now.\n\nWe do need here a teacher's house badly.\n\nI need money, too.\nafter all, that only\nself myself & those\ndependent on me God\nfor every one perhaps\nthe greatest blessing one\ncan have, almost per-\nfect health combined\nwith an intense love for\nthe great outdoors, and\nI use both, (the combination,\nI mean) in all my\nwork.\n\nI'd surely be glad if\nyou would reconsider\nyour decree, and if\nI do not make for\nby June, then send\nin the ultimatum.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMargaret Gardiner.\nPrincipal -\nMad Lake Indian\nDay School.\nPeterborough, Ontario\nJanuary 20th., 1932\n\nThe SECRETARY\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter #25-1-1 of Jan., 18th, 1932 I wish to advise that following your instructions contained in letter #25-1-1 of December 22nd., 1931, with the approval of Mr. Downey, I engaged the services of MR.W.G.Rome, subject to the approval of the Department.\n\nI inclose the letter of Mr. Rome, making application. I may have mis-understood instructions contained in your letter in committing the Department in the manner set forth above.\n\nI inclose letter of Miss Gardiner as requested. I have no further comments to make in addition to telephone conversation of to-day.\n\nI do wish to say that I feel sincerely sorry for the necessity of having to recommend the course taken but am glad of having confirmation after having explained verbally in detail.\n\nI think Miss Gardiner should have special consideration for reasons as stated by telephone.\n\nI inclose a letter I received from Miss Gardiner. This might be considered confidential from the foot note added but I think it has corroboration of the unsatisfactory condition of affairs, and I therefore submit it for your information.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\nMud and Rice Lakes\nOttawa, January 21, 1932.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to your services at the Mud Lake Indian Day School. The Department regrets that it is necessary to make a change during the academic year. In view of the facts that have been brought to our attention, no other course was possible. It is entirely probable that you are not wholly responsible for the difficulties that have arisen; but the Department, acting upon the advice of our local representative and the Public School Inspector, directed that a new teacher be engaged to commence duties on the first proximo.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Margaret Gardiner,\nMud Lake Indian Day School,\nCurve Lake, Ont.\nDear Mr. [Name],\n\nI do hope that I might at least be given a reason for this dismissal from this school. I truly can think of nothing that justifies such a proceeding, which endangers the chances of the Entrance Class here for success at the examinations next June.\n\nI know that almost all the parents are satisfied, and that they are anything but pleased with the action.\nof your Department.\n\nUnless the teacher to take my place is willing and able to teach a big Bible Class in Sunday School, the class must be discontinued.\n\nI have a boys' club which meets at the time of one of the boys, and which will I know do very much toward giving my boys ambition, clean manly characters and the ability to do something more useful in the world than loaf around the corner. It has real joy to see those boys' eyes shine as we took up \"the tourniquet\" in first aid, watched to see if their number make a\nspeech, or try to do so, and play guessing game in History. We closed our last meeting with a talk on the Gentlemen's Psalm (15) and prayer.\n\nOne interested in Christian work sent me a surprise gift of fifteen lovely Bibles two weeks ago. The children, several of them, both boys and girls, are memorizing the Commandments and a goodly number of Bible verses in order to win a Bible.\n\nI was in a home visiting a sick girl one day last week. I told of the news from the Dept. The next day, I was sent a note asking me to go to the home of one\nTo the Indians and bring my letter. I did so. We met the chief on there and I talked for a short time, then he said he would get up a petition as several had that day told him they would sign one. I have not heard since what they did, or whether they have done anything, as I cannot make myself ask questions like that. I'd never make a politician - couldn't canvass votes.\n\nI do think, however, that the people ought to be allowed to speak sometimes. Otherwise how shall they ever get any sense of responsibility.\n\nWould not the Government Inspector - who comes here once a year - I think (I've never met him)\nCome now and do an act of simple justice by investigating this matter at once?\n\nI feel my responsibility for the welfare of these children so much, and I like them and the work so well, and have found such genuine friendliness among the older people\u2014parents especially\u2014that I am loath to give up the work here.\n\nThe night I received the fatal (?) message from Mr. Eastwood I wrote voicing my suspicions and a few opinions, trusting to his honour not to divulge them, at least some of them, without due consideration. But I surely said nothing thought to be untrue.\n\nI know heads of Departments are busy, and often callous too, but I'm hoping you are not the latter, and that you will read this thoughtfully. It has been written after much thought and prayer.\n\nYours, M. Gardiner\nTo the Deptt. of Indian Affairs.\n\nSir,\n\nam enclosing herewith a petition signed by (thirty-five) members of this reserve, which goes to show how many are in favor of our present teacher Miss Gardiner being kept on here, as there does not seem to be any reason whatever, she has been notified that she won't be needed after the end of Jan., for what reason was not mentioned, she herself has had nothing to do with this, but only that we ourselves feel that she is not being dealt fair with, most all those that have children in her room their names are on this list, so that goes to show that the parents are satisfied with her work, and not only that, it would not be fair to the children either as it would take sometime for children & teacher to get used to one another before they could make any headway, that is if another teacher was appointed, then too this is a poor time of the year to be making changes like this why hadn't she been discharged at the end of the year & give her a chance to get another position, not have her just put in a month & fire her for no reason at all whatever the complaint is should of been made known, then too Miss Gardiner will be missed in the church & S.S. where she has taken an active part visiting the sick & doing what she could to help them as well we've never had a teacher take an interest in things like that before that we can remember, & could not have this happen for any reason for having been here since early in Dec.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hoping to hear from you soon.\nJanuary 29, 1932.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nOn the 27th and 28th instant, I visited the Mud Lake Indian reserve, with a view to straightening out difficulties at the school there. Miss Gardiner has given quite good service but is very difficult to get along with and the reserve is divided in its allegiance to her. This is affecting the attendance and the work of the school generally and I believe that some parents of Entrance pupils - of which there are 7 - are really concerned about their progress.\n\nThe arrangement that Miss Gardiner should leave today and be replaced on Monday by Mr. Rome was confirmed. Mr. Eastwood understands the situation and care will be taken in the future to see that the members of the Band do not agitate every time there is a little complaint. Both factions understand the serious effect of dissension. I called at several homes and met the leaders of both sides. In September, if there is a suitable one-room school with a residence opening, Miss Gardiner might be given another chance. She does a lot of Sunday school and other Christian work after school hours.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn accordance with recent regulations of the Department of Education the enclosed Teacher's Record Card is sent to you in order that the experience of this teacher, in the school indicated, may be certified by the school inspector or secretary of the School Board.\n\nIf possible, please enter the annual salary of the teacher during the period indicated. It is essential that the experience be certified by the signature of the present inspector or secretary in column headed, \"Inspector's Signature\".

Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nD. D. Moshier, Esq.,\nChief Inspector,\nBoard of Education,\nToronto, Ont.\n559 Aylmer St.,\nPeterboro Ont.\nMarch 25th. 1936.\n\nVincent Eastwood Esq.,\nAgent for Indian Affairs,\nPeterboro Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Eastwood:\n\nLast fall I was asked by Mr. Rome, teacher of the school at Curve Lake, if it would be possible for me to arrange to teach music in his school there. It was impossible during the winter months, but now that better weather is here, and due to the fact that I have re-arranged my school work, I would like to add the Reserve school to the list of schools where I supervise the teaching of music.\n\nAs you know, I am supervisor of music for the schools in Peterboro County. I teach the schools all around Curve Lake School, and also teach the Indian School at Hiawatha. According to the regulations set out by the Department of Education at Toronto, the fee for teaching a two room school the size of Curve Lake School is one hundred dollars per year, payable at the rate of ten dollars per month for the ten school months, or in a lump sum. My duties would be to visit the school once a week, and teach each class for the period of one hour, the music course set out by the Department of Education.\n\nAs you probably know, the Department of Education make a special grant for the teaching of music in all schools.

The children at Rice Lake all appear to be much younger than at the other reserves. Four pupils, I believe, passed their entrance examinations at Alnwick Indian Day School, under the charge of Mr. John Loukes.\n\nM. Eastwood,\nIndian Agent.\nPeterborough, Ont., Oct. 11, 1930.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nQuarterly report for period ending Sept. 1930.\n\nMr. Rome, principal of the Mud Lake Indian Day School resigned and Mr. Stuart Mackey was appointed in his place. Mr. Mackey is now establishing himself and would appear to me to be a worthy successor of Mr. Rome. At the beginning of school a new teacher has a little difficulty gaining the confidence of his pupils. Attendance fell off but is now, I am glad to say, improving. Tuition grants were secured for one member of the Mud Lake Reserve attending Vocational school at the Peterborough Collegiate Institute and three pupils from the Alnwick Indian Day School attending Campbellford High School.\n\nH. Eastwood,\nIndian Agent.\nDear Mr. Eastwood,\n\nRecently you asked me to note down and send to you facts regarding the Ontario plan for training handicapped children in rural areas. I am glad to summarize here information I have gathered.\n\nOntario now has a fully organized system of educating such children without removing them from their home and school environment. The school is surveyed by Provincial officials who diagnose the needs of the children. Units of special training are then prescribed according to the child's needs. With the help of these units, the local teacher can carry on.\n\nThe units are of several kinds, but those of particular interest here would be\u2014\n\n(a) Opportunity Units, for pupils who are unusually backward in any overall subject.\n\n(b) Sight-saving Units, for children whose eyes are defective.\n\nI quite believe that I am justified in stating that Opportunity Units would be of even greater value to our Indian School than to the average \"white\" school. Miss Long & Mr. Rome, with long experience here, heartily agree.\n\nI mention the sight-saving unit because of the frequent occurrence of trachoma among the Indians. There are two cases under treatment in the school at present, and while I am told that they stand in little danger, it is conceivable that the sight-saving units might be of value at some future time.\n\nCape Lake,\nOct. 13, 1938.\nA word on the nature of the training given to backward children might not be out of place. The emphasis is placed on the fundamentals: reading, writing, spelling, arithmetic. Special direct teaching methods & materials are employed. After 18 years, an attempt is made to teach some manual crafts sewing, knitting, wood carving, seed work, in simple forms, give the child skills which enable him to hold up his head among the children who are learning more rapidly than he in literary fields.\n\nRegulations for Ontario state that the teacher should hold an Auxiliary Class certificate. If not, however, temporary certificates may be issued to suitable teachers for 1 year. I may state here that I am prepared to take the course in Auxiliary work this summer, if we get cooperation from the Dominion. I feel that a knowledge of Auxiliary methods would be of more value to a teacher of Indians than any other single summer course.\n\nThe only information regarding cost of these units which I could locate was in an article by Dr. Amoss, Can. Sch. Journal, Feb., 1936. In speaking of cost, he says \"It may be noted that the average cost of each training unit last year was under $3.00.\" Although this seems unreasonably low, the context seems to indicate that $3.00 was the actual total cost per unit.\n\nDr. Amoss, Inspector of Auxiliary Classes, Dep. of Education, Toronto, is in charge of the work.\nSince I have a strong personal desire to see these units put into operation here, I hope you will bear with me if I set down what are really opinions. I feel that the advantages of using this work would be these\u2014\n\nFirst, to the pupils\u2014handicapped\u2014\n\nThey would be thoroughly trained in the three \"R's.\"\n\nThey would be mentally much healthier; their self-respect retained, their spirit unbroken by a continual feeling sense of inferiority. This same feeling of inferiority is at the root of much actual mental illness occurring in later life.\n\nGenuine interest in schoolwork should cut down truancy, very common in this type pupil.\n\nHappily occupied, he no longer should be furnishing a continual entertainment for the rest of the school.\n\nRenewed interest in schoolwork would give the teacher a chance to inculcate sensible health and living habits.\n\nSecond, to the remaining members of the class\u2014\n\nMore advanced teaching methods could be used. More work done by class, less by teacher, in learning new facts, etc.\n\nThe drag of the dull pupil would be removed.\n\nThis would mean the fuller exploration of new fields uncovered in schoolwork, the introduction of interesting topics otherwise untouched; in short, the covering a wider & richer course than the teacher, faced with the need of constantly drilling the slow scholar, could possibly have covered before.\n\nClass standards would be higher. The clever child would no longer have the dull pupil as a foil.\nI might add a third division\u2014the benefits to the community. In the work of training the Indians to take a place in the outside world, the school\u2014I'd think\u2014is the most powerful factor. Increasing the school's efficiency would seem to be the apparent way to bring the end of Indian isolation a lot closer. And I believe that the introduction of this system of auxiliary training would increase the efficiency of our schools materially.\n\nOne point I might raise in closing: these units should make it possible, in two-teacher schools, to place the great lumps of boys stagnating in primary grades under the care of the man teacher. These big boys present a much simpler disciplinary problem to a man than to a woman.\n\nI hope, Mr. Eastwood, that this report is satisfactory; and that you will forgive what may seem unwarranted verbosity in spots. I have come to feel strongly on these spots. I hope my inexperience has not led me astray.\n\nSincerely,\n\nStuart Mackey.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI enclose letter received from Mr. Stuart Mackey, principal of the Mud Lake Indian Day School, which he has written at my request, explaining a system of training which he suggests would be of benefit to the school children of the Mud Lake Reserve. I discussed the matter very thoroughly with Mr. Mackey and he has gathered considerable information concerning his suggestion, which I submit in this letter.\n\nI agree with his suggestion that this type of training would be peculiarly adaptable to this school. The attendance has been rather difficult to secure from the larger boys and this method would supply an interest which they would not otherwise have.\n\nI am unable to add anything further to Mr. Mackey's letter and submit it for your consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\nRICE AND MUD LAKES AGENCY\n\nVME:P\nOttawa,\nNovember 14, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 4th instant enclosing a letter from the Principal of the Mud Lake Indian Day School explaining a system of training which he considers would benefit the children attending the Mud Lake School.\n\nThe Department appreciates receiving Mr. Mackey's suggestion and it is hoped that he will arrange to take the auxiliary class certificate during the summer of 1939.\n\nIt is hoped to be able to provide the funds required for the erection of a new two-roomed school on the Mud Lake Reserve during next summer. In view of this and the fact that Mr. Mackey has not yet received the auxiliary class certificate it is felt that it would be preferable to defer action on his suggestion until the academic year 1939-40. In the meantime officials of this Branch will get in touch with Dr. Amoss, Inspector of Auxiliary Classes, Department of Education, Toronto, and make the necessary arrangements for the survey that would be necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nV.M.

The Junior teacher, Miss Long, is also sick and the attendance has dropped to only a few. It is hoped by the end of this week that the conditions will improve as the Flu is not of a serious nature and cases have been quite mild. I have no reports of similar conditions on the other Reserves but expect to be able to get through to the Alnwick Reserve tomorrow but roads to Rice Lake and Alnwick have been blocked for a week with no cars getting out.\n\nI trust I have your approval in the matter of closing the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\nRICE AND MUD LAKES AGENCY\n\nVME:P\nOttawa,\nMarch 2, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo in which you state that acting on the recommendation of Dr. E.E.

E. Bryce of Toronto, in fact she had moved to Clydesdale and apparently had taken over a school there before I received your wire. I wired her to call me by telephone but received no reply so I assume that she was not interested. I therefore found it necessary to promote Miss Long to the principalship, temporarily and on Mr. R. F. Downey's recommendation secured the services of Miss Anna May Tate of R.R.#4, Bobcaygeon, for the Junior class. She commenced duties October 6th. I am able to advise as to her qualifications \u2014 she has no teaching certificate, she has senior matriculation less one subject. She appears to be quite capable to take over as Junior teacher and Miss Long will advise me as to what progress she makes.\n\nIt is extremely difficult to secure teachers in this locality and I hope that this present arrangement will work out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\nRICE AND MUD LAKES AGENCY\n\nVME:P\nOttawa,\nOctober 16, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Mud Lake Indian Day School\nNo. 414\n\nIn regard to the above school I would refer you to my memorandum of August 8 in which you were informed that the teacher, Mr. Stuart Mackey had given up duties effective July 1, 1941.\n\nTo succeed him the Department has promoted Miss Bertha V.

Miss Long is correct in saying that she has been employed since 1931, a period of nearly thirteen years. She was first engaged at a salary of $60.00 a month, which was increased to $85.00 a month on November 1, 1938, and to $95.00 a month on October 1, 1941, at which time she was promoted to the principalship of the school.\n\nCareful consideration has been given to her request and it has been decided to increase her salary from $95.00 to $100.00 a teaching month, effective January 1, 1944.\n\nR.A.

Eastwood,\n385 Water St.,\nPeterborough, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Eastwood -\n\nHaving used all my intrigue to secure a teacher for Curve Lake and not having had any success I felt that I should let you know. I tried to reach you by phone while I was in Peterborough yesterday to tell you my failure.\n\nI felt sure that Miss Atkinson would finally consent but apparently not. All our Summer Course students were engaged at salaries as high as $1600. The Province appears to be pegging minimum salaries at $1200. You can therefore see why it is difficult to secure a teacher at the $1000 mark.\n\nI am at present at the Geneva Park Conference of Public Affairs. If I can interest anyone even at a higher salary that you suggested I shall have such an individual get in touch with you immediately.\n\nOn Saturday Mr. Smitherain was short 5 teachers for the schools of East Peterborough. There are a number of returned men coming back. Whether it would be possible to interest one of these I could not say. It might be worth trying the Armstrong Home on 669 Water St. I see that Earl is due home shortly. He might consent to teach Junior Room work for the sake of the primary school experience.\n\nI hope you may have luck.\n\nYours sincerely\n\n\"L. W.

Hamilton, teacher at the above mentioned school, effective April 5th, 1947.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nWith reference to file 25-1-1 (WT1) dated the 21st of February, wherein I was instructed to secure the services of a teacher for the junior room at the Mud Lake Indian Day School, I find that I am having some difficulty in securing an applicant for the position, however, I have Mr. E. C. Anderson, Inspector of Public Schools for Peterborough west and Victoria east, making inquiries and I have Mr. L. W. Copp, Principal of the Peterborough Normal School interested in getting a successor to Miss Hamilton. Mr. Copp states that he feels sure he can secure a teacher by the end of May when the present class graduates. It will be necessary to secure the services of a supply teacher for the period between Easter and the end of May.\n\nMiss Long, who is principal at the Mud Lake Indian Day School, is now receiving $110 a month plus bonus which became effective on the 1st of September 1946 and has been doing very satisfactory work which I reported when recommending her for the increase. In my opinion it would be beneficial to have a male teacher on the staff of this school and this vacancy could be filled by a male teacher but certain difficulties present themselves in that he could not be paid more than Miss Long and it is questionable that he would accept much less.\n\nMay I please be advised as to the salary to be paid a female teacher and, if available, a male teacher, in order that I may advise Mr. Copp and in the event that we are unable to secure the services of a teacher before the new teachers graduate.\n\nV. M. EASTWOOD\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 20th, 1947.\n\nMr. V.M.

For a teacher holding a second class certificate, the minimum salary will be $1,200.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDepartmental file 25-1(WT1) dated March 20th instructed me to report if I was not successful by the 31st of March in securing the services of a junior teacher for the Mud Lake Indian Day School.\n\nI have a reply from Mr. E. C. Anderson, Public School Inspector, stating that he was making inquiries and would advise. Mr. L. W. Copp, Principal of the Normal School, has been doing everything possible to secure the services of a teacher but states that they are in great demand at the present time. Of his graduating class at the Peterborough Normal School, ten have been assigned to the city of Hamilton and most of the teachers that he could recommend have been interviewed by various municipalities desiring their services, however, I have interviewed a Miss Phyllis Davidson of R. R. #1, Keene, whom Mr. Copp arranged for me to meet, I believe that she would be interested and I am awaiting her reply. She graduates the end of May. Mr. Copp informs me confidentially that she is being granted her first class certificate without writing and he highly recommends her.\n\nI have asked Miss Davidson to visit the reserve and talk the matter over with Miss Long who comes from the same locality as she does, before making her decision. She is to advise me within a weeks time.\n\nA supply teacher will be required from the opening of school after Easter until the 31st of May, possibly longer if unable to secure one of the graduating class of the Normal School.\n\nV.

I have discussed this with Mr. Leo W. Copp, principal of the local Normal School, and he has been kind enough to communicate with the Provincial Department of Education and in his correspondence with his Department, confirmation of this has been received and it is pointed out that an Indian Day School is not regarded as the necessary qualifying experience.\n\nIf our interpretation of this regulation is correct, it will be difficult to get the services of Miss Phylis Davidson, who I hope to secure for the 15th of May.\n\nI am now in touch with Mr. K. O. Birkin, inspector for East Peterborough, concerning the possibility of securing one of two teachers now available. He is to advise me as to their qualifications and I hope to receive word from him in a few days. Both these prospective teachers have been teaching for some time.\n\nIn the meanwhile the junior classroom, with an enrolment of forty-two pupils, has been out on an enforced holiday. I am hopeful of getting someone to take charge this week even on a temporary basis, regardless of their qualifications.\n\nM. H.

Fowlie,\nBobcaygeon, Ontario.\n\n/B\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nWith reference to file 25-1-1(WT1) and further to my letters of April 3rd and 30th, I regret to report that I have received a letter from Miss Phyllis Davidson of R.R.#1, Keene, Ontario stating that in view of existing regulations of the province she will be unable to take the post of junior teacher at the Mud Lake Indian Day School.\n\nThis leaves the junior class room without a teacher and I have no prospects at the moment of being able to secure a replacement. As a result the children have been out of school since the Easter holidays as it was impossible for Miss Long, teacher of the senior class room, to look after the junior class as well as there are some 76 pupils in the school in two separate class rooms.\n\nI have been in touch with Mr. E.C. Anderson, School Inspector for West Peterborough, Mr. K.O. Birkin, School Inspector for East Peterborough, Mr. L.W. Corp, Principal of the Peterborough Normal School and the Peterborough School Board and they have been unsuccessful in securing a teacher for this school. With the Provincial regulations in regard to the granting of a certificate requiring the teacher to teach in a Provincial school the first year, the prospects of securing a graduating teacher from the Normal School are very remote.\n\nV.M. EASTWOOD\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nWith reference to file 25-1-1(WTL) of February 21st, March 20th and subsequent letters in this file, may I have authority to advertise locally for a teacher for the junior classroom of the Mud Lake Indian Day School to replace Miss Hamilton resigned. I have had [no] success in securing the services of a teacher and suggest that an early start be now made in order to assure the services of a junior classroom teacher for the fall term.\n\nV. E.

Eastwood,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\n385 Water St.,\nPeterborough, Ont.\n\nMud Lake Indian Day School\n\nI have been in touch with a teacher whom I think could handle the junior room at Mud Lake quite satisfactorily. She is Miss Irene Reesor, who is teaching the primary room at the Caughnawaga U.C. Day School. Miss Reesor is fifty-four years of age, holds a First Class Ontario Teaching Certificate, has twenty-one years of teaching experience in provincial schools and one year of experience in Indian schools.\n\nShe seems interested in continuing to teach Indians and is, I believe, willing to transfer. Her home is near Toronto, and this school would be more convenient for her than Caughnawaga.\n\nHowever, I would like to inquire concerning the accommodation available for teachers at this school. I presume from the Annual Report submitted that the teachers are living in a mission house. However, I would like to have any comments you might wish to make concerning this situation.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMay 23, 1949.\n\nMr. V.M. Eastwood,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\n385 Water St.,\nPeterborough, Ont.\n\nMud Lake Indian Day School\n\nUpon receipt of your letter of May 3, I immediately wrote to Miss Reesor concerning the junior room at the Mud Lake School. I regret to advise that I have just received a letter from her today saying that she is not anxious to board but would prefer to remain at her present school where housekeeping facilities are available. We should, therefore, advertise immediately, and if you will agree, we will insert the following advertisement in whatever papers you would wish to recommend:\n\n\"WANTED - Qualified teacher for primary grades in two-room Indian Day School at Mud Lake.

The Examiner has a wide distribution. There is also in Peterborough a normal school and I will get in touch with Mr. Leo Copp, the principal, and the local newspaper. In asking for the immediate insertion of the advertisement I have in mind the difficulty in securing a replacement two years ago. I understand in order to qualify the graduates of the normal school have to spend one year teaching in a Provincial school. This makes it difficult to secure a graduate from the normal school but Mr. Copp has been helpful in the past.\n\nV. A.

(RG 10, Volume 6148, File 414-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, January 21, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, with enclosures, concerning the Mud Lake Indian Day School. Your action in engaging Mr. W. G. Rome is approved. Salary at the rate of $95 per teaching month will be allowed in his case. It is understood that he will commence duties on February first.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nV. M. Eastwood, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPeterborough,\nOnt.\nP.P.Z. Oshawa, Ont.,\nFeb. 29th, 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nI cannot remember whether I gave you the above address the day you were at Curve Lake, or left you with the other address, McKellar, only. I have not yet received my salary cheque for January, and have been wondering if it might have been sent and delayed somewhere.\n\nI am at present with a sister-in-law near Oshawa who has to make up a big payment on her farm this week. With that cheque I can manage to give her \u00a3250 to help out so am hoping it will come along soon if possible. I left address at Mr. Eastwood's office where I went twice in a vain endeavour to see him about something else.\n\nMy memories of Curve Lake cannot fail to\nbe happy ones, for the kindness of the people was truly wonderful\u2014a big surprise tea-party in the hall the last night I was there, gifts\u2014quill boxes from your mother when I called to say good bye.\n\nI thought you'd be what you said\u2014\"you'll leave in a Christian spirit,\" but I'm British and Irish, and did not think it contrary to a Christian spirit to try to say a few words to Dan Whiting when paying my board, just before I left (not about board), intending to ask him to shake hands then, as I do want some day to visit Curve Lake, if only for an hour or two, and want to feel free to enter Dan's home too. It was all a mistake, however, as I should have known after my experience over the seats \"question.\" Hope I'll never again see such a look of malicious hate and triumph on any man's face as was on his.\n\nI do thank you sincerely for having come to Curve Lake, and I know all will be for\nthe best.\n\nI have not forgotten that you said you would hereafter take into consideration when choosing teachers, the fact that some reserves need teachers who can lead in church and Sunday School work. It will mean much.\n\nI have never found people who were so grateful for little visits; nor who responded more readily to sympathy with their joys (they are Jews) and cares and sorrows. Indians are supposed to be stoical but I saw tears in the eyes of even two or three men when I said good-bye, though I shed none myself (didn't dare).\n\nPardon this long letter, and believe me when I say I am glad I met you, and glad that you are the Superintendent of Indian Education.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMargaret Gardner\nMiss Gardiner - RR No 2\nSalary for January 95.00\n\nMiss Gardiner relinquished duties as of 8 January 1932\n**Ontario**\n\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\n**TEACHERS' SALARIES**\n\n**FOR QUARTER ENDED March 31st, 1932.**\n\n| NAME OF TEACHER | NAME OF SCHOOL | ANNUAL GRANT OR SALARY | AMOUNT DUE | ADDRESS TO WHICH CHEQUE IS TO BE SENT |\n|-----------------|----------------|------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Margaret Gardiner | Mud Lake       | $950.00                |            |                                      |\n\n**Salary for Jan. .......... $95.00**\n\n**Address:**\n\nR.R.No.2\n\nOrillia, Ont.\n\n**REMARKS:**\n\nMiss Gardiner relinquished duties at this school on January 31st, 1932.\n\n**EXAMINED and found correct.**\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY THAT THIS VOUCHER IS CORRECT.\n\n---\n\n**Form 14**\n\nIndian Affairs.

As you know, salaries are generally paid at the end of each quarter, and, for this reason, your case was easily overlooked. I have directed that payment be made forthwith, so you will receive a cheque in a day or two.\n\nDo not hesitate to write to me if you are desirous of re-entering Indian work next September. The best time to write would be about the 15th or 20th of June. It is possible that there will be some opening which would be quite suitable for you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T.

The lower one\nto be the school-room and the upper one to be the\nhall-room. It is the general feeling by all the\npeople in Chernong that this building should be put up\nthis year, and the money to be got out of the Indian\nfunds to pay for this building.\n\nTherefore it was moved by L.D. Taylor second by\nThomas Quinquis that this building must be erected\nthis year as it is needed in our village. The words\nwere carried unanimously.\n\nWe earnestly pray that the above statement will be\nsanctioned by the Department and will give us\nan early reply.\n\nA church-organ is also needed in our church. Therefore\nit was moved by L.D. Taylor second by James McEve\nto get a new organ for the Church, and to be paid\nwith the rent-money for the Mission farm of\nnext year or rather next summer rent, 1901.\nCarried unanimously.\n\nDaniel Whelington, Joseph Brown (Sign)\nSecretary.\nMeine 8th February\n\nI have forwarded to you the enclosed resolution of the Lake Band of Indians with reference to the building of school houses and a... because the school house in present use is a very old building and very cold for the children to sit in; it is likewise too small; the Band has no place for meeting but the school house which is very inconvenient for that purpose. The Band is very much in need of such a building and if I am allowed I would recommend that their request may be granted.\n\nThe church organ in use is worn out and cannot be repaired; a new organ is very much needed. If the Band can get a mortgage for the rent of the mission property, I hope the Department will grant the same. Kindly reply as soon as convenient.\n\nS. H. of J.

It is to be built by first the frame of scantling and then one layer of brick on the outside and lath and plaster inside - two stories high - first story to be the school and second story to be the Council Hall room. A partition in entering the first room to be about 8 or ten feet from the door in which the stairway is to be made for getting up to the Council room. There are seats and desks for the school room but seats must be got for the Council Hall room - 8 or 10 windows in the school room and 10 or 12 windows in the Council room.

They were informed that tenders could not be called for until the plans and specifications had been furnished and approved.\n\nAgent\n\nThe Superintendent then asked if the Department would sanction the expense of obtaining plans and specifications, to which a reply in the affirmative was given. On the 17th April, Mr Macfarlane, the Agent forwarded plans and specifications for a building of the dimensions first given, the cost of which was put at $2400.00. It was considered that the proposed building was larger than was necessary and the Indians were asked to reconsider the matter and Mr. Well of Peterborough, the architect...\nthem has, I understand, the original plans and is preparing new plans and specifications for a building of reduced dimensions.\n\nThe cost of the building, when undertaken, will have to be paid from the capital funds of the Band, which has over $36000 to its credit, but until the new plans are received and approved no tenders for its erection can be called for or contract awarded.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I do not approve of the Agents being allowed to select those from whom plans, any more than supplies, should be procured. I will be glad, in future, to have my attention called to any cases of this kind in order that I may direct who should be employed to do any work in connection with these matters.\n\nDeputy Supt-General.\nMemo:\n\nMr. Matheson,\n\nWill you kindly let me know whether there has been any instruction from the Deputy Minister as to the employment of architects to prepare plans in connection with buildings paid out of band funds.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nI can find no instructions from the D.M. in this connection.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe the Mud Lake Band of Indians have been trying to find out when Mr. Wilson is going to finish the second contract by our agent Mr. McFarlane and as we cannot get any real satisfaction from him we therefore write to you.\n\nThe resolution past by our band here was to pay Mr. Wilson $500.00 to furnish all the necessary of the combined building, that is the seating of the council chamber, with long seats and chairs for the committee room. Of course we have seats in the present school which will do if repaired a little to put in the new school along with about 4 (four) new larger ones for larger pupils and lamps for the council chamber. This room will also be used for entertainments and the seats must be got at once as the combined building will be open sometime next month by having tea-meeting and concert.\n\nWe received the estimates from Mr. McFarlane which Mr. Wilson the contractor made out.\n\nIt is a shame how he has let down for price. Why! The closets and fencing which\nhe has $50.00 for can all be done buying the stuff and erecting it for about $10.00 or $20.00. The fence is only about 8 or 9 feet long from the closest church fence as shown here. Why this is a shameful work, as we Indians have very little money and have no money to spend on extravagantly. We don't mind paying for a thing what its worth, but when it goes as far beyond the place. Of course we have very little idea of what a furnace is worth, but he has furnished $70.00 and $50.00 for brick and labor, which we think is steep enough, and cutting holes for furnaces $25.00 a place for maps $25.00.\n\nAll we are asking is to have our combined building furnished with all the accessories needed both inside & outside just as our resolution stated. When we paid our resolution on 5th Nov. 1901. We stated to give Mr. Wilson $500.00 to furnish all the necessaries of the combined building both inside & outside and the seats for the council chamber, are the things most needed, and immediately. We do hope he has not received the $500.00 yet until he completes his contract. We complained with the agent early to see that the second contract is done right and properly.\nWe also told Mr. McFarlane agent, and Mr. Blackwell\nthe architect that so much will be taken out of\nthe first contract as it was not fulfilled. The lack\nof mortar on the roof was not put on and also on\nbetween the brick wall and the frame wall, and the\nchimney is 6 feet at the bottom and only 5 brick wide\nat the top which is a very bad chimney to carry off\nthe smoke. We hope that this work carried out and\nis settled. Likely you know of the estimates of\nthe second contract but I will just copy which\nwe received from our agent.\n\nFurnace ... $170.00\nClosets ... $150.00\nPlacing seats/decks ... $5.00\nBrick for furnace/bricks ... $50.00\nCutting holes etc. for pipes ... $25.00\nCase for maps ... $25.00\nConcrete for furnace bottom\nfilling in holes for furnace ... $50.00\n\nTotal ... $505.00\n\nWe are satisfied with the rest of the building except the\nabove statement. Wishing to give us an early reply\nand write direct to us for once, as this is very\nimportant and no delay, for the new building will soon\nbe opened, and seats are wanted.\n\nDaniel Whiting, Jr. Secretary.

Two side walls in the cellar to support the foundation walls which were going out on account of water washing out on the sides and underneath. One side wall is 13 1/2 ft long, 2 1/2 ft high, 1 1/2 ft through. The other is 16 ft long 3 ft high and 2 ft through.\n\nI think these cement floors are very much needed when the water is high for when water has been in a cellar and leaves again, it leaves a very muddy floor and makes it very unpleasant on entering the church or Hall after walking on the wet clay. Then the walls had to be supported in some way and if not by cement probably some way which would be more expensive, but I think the cellars that were in their buildings these floors are very necessary and would be worth your approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\nRice Lake Band,\nRenfrew, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Contractor of the cement work in the cellars of the new church and also the cellar of hall and school building combined.

Before dealing with the question of payment the Department desires to know have a full report from you in regard to this work.

And in reply would say I cannot understand why there is delay in the payment of my little account with this Band, in putting down concrete floor in the cellar of the Hall and Church.\n\nBoth the agent Mr. Wm. McFarlane and the architect Mr. Belcher of Peterboro had seen the water entering the cellar which would lay there for months causing the place very unclean and unhealthy. And advised the Band to do something to lay down concrete floors with its proper slope into the drain. Since all this was done there has been considerable fall of heavy rain in which water enters same as ever but with the proper slope from the walls on the floor.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6148, File 414-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nInto the drain the water was carried off very readily and now there has been no water lying in the cellars of these buildings this fall or winter. There is also proper drainage underneath the concrete floors and laid down tile feeding from all directions into the drain. The cellars today are clean and healthy, but before this was done it was something disgraceful and unhealthy having water lying there on the clay floors for months. The Indian Department must think that this Band of Indians are all fools and don't know how to carry on their own business. If they did they are very much mistaken for there are Indians here who know as much about carrying on business as some of the members of the Indian Department. And if you could show me one instance where this\nIndian council ever tried to defend\nthe Indian department. I would speak\ndifferently. I have been easy with this\ncouncil by waiting for my payments\nfrom the Indian funds. But, if this is\nnot paid by the end of this month,\nFebruary, I shall have to look for some\nauthority to assist me in collecting. Or\nI think the council must have money\nenough in their own council treasury\nto pay the bill as I done at\nsatisfactory work for them which\nthey are greatly pleased, as they all claim\nif this was not done this fall, there would been\nagain big washouts from under the foundation\nwalls in the spring, as it did last spring.\nI hope this will be a little more soon as\nI'm getting sick of this Tom fooling.\n\nYours,\n\nDaniel C.

It is not yet clear under what authority you acted. The Agent has been written to and the Department awaits a report from him and the council in the matter.\n\nYou would have acted with more discretion had you awaited authority from the Department before doing the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Receiving no word from the\ndepartment or from the agent wrote again\nin the fall to the agent. The agent & the\nchief asking him if he thought these concrete\nfloors would cost more than a hundred\ndollars. They came to me, as I have done\ncertain amount of laying concrete floors\nand I told them I thought the floors\ncould be put down for $75.00 or $80.00.\n\nReceiving no more word about it and the season was getting late, and seeing that the walls were damaged last year with the water, they thought it was advisable to lay the floor immediately. They came to me asked me to go ahead with the work at $75.00 and that they would see I got paid. I got the material ready cement and tile and then there came a heavy frost for over a week we had to wait until there came a thaw.\n\nWe got good weather for the work for about a week, so you could see it was getting late in the season for the job. But it was perhaps a great saving to the destruction of the buildings the coming season. I don't see why the Ind. Dept. cannot see fit to pay this account supposing they are not responsible.\nDoes not the Act say the Indians could use their money at any time for improvements to buildings on the reserve and is not this a great necessary improvement.\n\nWhy should not the Land Dept. pay this account when they are paying the school teacher $300.00 a year salary without the consent of the Band. This Band are only willing to pay the present teacher $200.00. We will have to get some capable man to see about our affairs if this account is not paid to land dept. Yours Truly\n\nH.B. D.E.

Comstock and Sons, Peterborough. You will be good enough, therefore, to place the order with this firm, giving them information as to the size of the desks, the number of each size and also the size of the rear seats. The firm will deliver the desks which at the school and place them in position, for a reasonable price will be paid.

McFarlane, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKeene, Ont.\nBUILDINGS and PREMISES.\n\nThe condition of school property is far from satisfactory. The building itself is a very substantial one and its architectural appearance is rather pleasing. In the planning of the interior, however, the interests of the school have been sacrificed to make room for other purposes. The class-room is very much too small for the accommodation of the pupils enrolled; it is ill ventilated, insufficiently lighted and improperly heated. At present the air supplied to the class-room is conveyed from a room malodorous from tobacco, spittoons and other filth. Later on, when the furnace is discontinued, and the room heated by a stove there will be absolutely no means of supplying fresh air to the class-room except by means of the windows. Some 30 odd children, in a room only half as large as it should be, without any ventilation and heated by an unjacketed stove, is a condition which can only be a menace to the community. The closets are, perhaps, the worst I have ever seen. They are too far away. There is absolutely no privacy and they are in a most filthy condition. On the invitation of the Chief, I am going out in the near future to discuss with the band the question of school improvement; and I hope that next year you may see a very marked improvement in the condition of this school.\n\n(Sgd.) G.E.Broderick\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nI beg to call your attention to the extract hereunder from the report of Mr. Inspector Broderick on the Chemong Indian School. You will see that Mr. Broderick says that on the invitation of the Chief he is going out in the near future to discuss with the band the question of school improvement. I think it would be well to have our Agent, Mr. McCannus, present at this meeting and I would suggest that Mr. Broderick be asked to advise him when he purposes again going to Chemong.\n\nMr. Broderick says that the new teacher, Mr. Buffam, is earnest and efficient and takes a great interest in the community life of the people as well as in the pupils of the school and that the school work is in a very satisfactory condition considering the short time Mr. Buffam has had charge.\n\nI may mention that the school-room, about which Mr. Broderick complains, is in the Council House building. The main entrance is also the entrance.\ntrance to the Council chamber, which is over the school,\nand to a meeting place in a room adjoining the school\nand I have no doubt that the presence of these is the\ncause of the mal odorous condition. It would be a\ngood thing if they had a separate school-house, as\nso long as the building is used for all the purposes\nit was designed for it will be hard to overcome the\nconditions complained of.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6148, File 414-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter dated Nov. 21st and No. 172211/5 referring to the visit of Mr. Inspector Brodie to Mud Lake School. I wish to say that I am well acquainted with Mr. Brodie and I will be pleased to meet him at Chemong anytime he may be fit to appear if at all possible.\n\nRegarding the Water Closet at the school. On the occasion of each visit to the reserve I have warned the officers that they must have them cleaned and each time they promised to do so. I visited again on the 14th and found I was pleased when I arrived there to find that the Council had made arrangements to have them cleaned the next morning. I came over night and oversaw the work of cleaning myself. I find them thoroughly cleaned, scrubbed out and disinfected.\n\nI must say I am at a loss to see\u2014distance Mr. Brodie's assertion that the Closets are absolutely without privacy. If he means that persons by one the street can see a person going to or from the Closets, he is right; otherwise, I am compelled to give it an unqualified contradiction. They are built of native Lumber doors of the same a perfectly close partition between Girls' Closets and Boys' and high board fence guard out a few feet from the doors and supporting...\nSir\u2014\n\nThe girls and boys in town. I am very sorry to have to contradict Mr. Brederich's idea\u2014call the school perfectly private.\n\nRegarding the school room it is small for the number of children, but they are not piled on top of one another at all. The ceiling is quite high there is an excellent foul air ventilator\u2014a draft that will catch a piece of paper and hold it to the grate. Of course to Mr. Brederich's way there is no fresh air supply when the furnace is not firing except through the windows\u2014the furnace is intended to heat the whole building. Hall, council house and school, and uses a large quantity of wood, for warming they use a small stove in school house. However there is very good window ventilation from wind to last through the council chamber, and here again I must say fair of Mr. Brederich. I have sat in the room at five council meetings and I thought it as clean as a council room usually is\u2014in fact the first time I visited it I was struck with the clean appearance of it. During these council meetings some of the men chew tobacco and they use dishes with water in for spittoons\u2014they do not smoke during the meeting, but so often it is overcome of them\u2014Now if a person were only willing to put forth an effort to make\nSir,\n\nIn view of existing circumstances, one minute would suffice to throw a few shingles in those spots where there is a window or two and have good ventilation with a door between the two rooms to stop the draft at pleasure. But some people would sooner sit down and write letters to the Department on foul air than get up and open a window.\n\nI have ordered a fanbelt for the stove and it was ready on Saturday. I intended fixing two windows in school room and two in council room, with ropes and pulleys so that they can be let down easier.\n\nI would advise that nothing further be done till next season, as the Band have some idea of enlarging the old Church and using it as a hall\u2014this hall is too small for their Council\u2014therefore if they should do that then the present hall will be used for the school room and it will be twice the size of the present room.\nSir,\n\nand lighter from both views\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nV.J.

Two men went out with the load and arrived there in the middle of the afternoon. The Indians, seeing this load over for them drew it to the school helped them to unload and drew their load back and ferried it over free. They placed two racks and went back to the City a distance of fifteen miles and sent two men back in a few days to place the Racks. The whole thing could easily have been done in one day.\n\nThe Hiawatha School Board put in twelve new Racks and one of the Board placed them in two hours, and charged the balance $24. Two men should place 36 Racks in three hours at most.\n\nI cannot recommend this charge as fair and just. I have interviewed Mr. Conolly twice but he wont reduce it.\n\nTruly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Regarding the motor boat account I wish to explain that there was no land to be got nearer than six miles that was suitable, and then over a very rough road where it was impossible to draw more than half a load. So I employed Mr. Whitney with his motor boat to bring it from Kawartha Island a distance of about two and half miles. Then of course it had to be hauled from the wharf by team. The boat we used was really the float which was for taking teams across the narrows, and would only carry a very limited amount. Altogether the hauling & the house was expensive, but I tried to write it up the very best possible advantage. The stones also were hard to get, as they had been well suited for the Church and Hall. Water had to be hauled from the lake a distance of nearly half a mile.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nIndian Affairs.

As the appropriation is considerably overdrawn, I wish to say that there were several things which I did not foresee when making the estimate, and which will form the most part accounts for the overdraw. Such as, the Beams to support centre of floor, lumber lost, etc., new chimney requiring $460 new brick & labor, etc., removing and carrying under Winchester, etc., cement platform & steps outside, etc.\n\nAfter the walls & ceiling were patched (plastered) the rest of the walls looked so dirty, I had to determine them. The land was free from the island, as I explained in a previous letter, also cost uprate. Then there was the item of board for the men for which Whitney & Son charged them $1 per day. They do a summer tourist trade and charge $15.00 per day, or was the lowest they would go. We had no alternative. This made it worse a little higher.\n\nI am pleased to say that the school is quite warm. The ventilation system works perfectly.

One should be appointed, or if there is one, he should be instructed to do his duty. A teacher cannot get good results if the children stay away half of their time which is the case at this school. Some of the Indians complain that the teacher is no good, and that is why they do not send their children to the school. As far as I could see from their work etc., the children are more advanced and have made better progress than under the old teacher.\n\nThe inspector has not visited the school this year.\n\nThere are no pupils in the fourth class. The children say they never have had a written examination until this year. Examinations should be held regularly and certificates given to the successful pupils. This would encourage the children to try and pass.\n\nThey have 30 seats and need 10 more as they often have 40 pupils.\n\nThe colsets at this school are very poor, new ones with shields should be built. What they have now are in one building and have no shields. They have only boards between them. Immoral conversations take place between the pupils of both sexes.\n\nThe blackboards are very poor, rough and hard to write on, and not very distinct. They look as they were built by someone who did understood nothing about plastering.\nOttawa, July 14th, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has been informed that new closets should be erected at the Mud Lake day school.\n\nKindly furnish the Department with an estimate of the cost of building separate closets for the boys and girls.\n\nIt has, also, been reported that the blackboards are in poor condition.

I beg to say that this trouble arose from the purchase of a pump for the Mission property. I was under the impression that this would be paid for out of the special grant to the Indians otherwise I certainly would not have made the purchase without buying it before the Council. The funds of the Band are very low. Since the land is covered and this land is rough and not suited for cultivation - with the exception of a small part of it - and the possibilities of making a living are slim unless they leave the village. In view of these facts I think the Department should help them by at least paying for the expenses incurred for the cultivation of their children which would include this pump and repairs on Mission house.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6148, File 414-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 2nd instant and previous correspondence; I beg to say that the Department considers it reasonable to charge the cost of the pump purchased for the Mission property against the funds of the Mud Lake Band, in view of the fact that the band receives $50.00 per annum rental for the teacher's residence from an appropriation voted by Parliament. I may also say that it is only fair that the band in its capacity of landlord shall keep the said property in proper condition for renting.\n\nI have also to point out that one-half of the teacher's salary is paid from the appropriation provided by Parliament and the cost of school supplies are not charged to the band's funds. It will, therefore, be seen that the band is being accorded fair treatment. The only charges made against band funds are for expenditure which would materially benefit the members thereof. Kindly explain the matter clearly to the Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAas. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J. McCamus Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKeene, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

They have now engaged a single man and the payment of the rental should cease. At a recent Methodist Conference for that district a new Missionary was appointed. It may be that he will take up his residence in the parsonage, but the Indians had no definite information of that while I was there. If he does not, and if an opportunity arises I think the building should be rented for the summer months. It is a beautiful location and would bring in some revenue for the Indians, if a suitable tenant offered. The building itself is somewhat out of repair and I am afraid the last occupants, Mr. and Mrs. Haynes, were not very careful. Unfortunately the key was not available and I could not enter the building.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6148, File 414-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nREPORT OF INSPECTOR BRODERICK ON THE MUD LAKE DAY SCHOOL\n\nI venture the opinion that it was a serious mistake to attempt to convert an ill constructed, cast-off church into a school building. The result is just what might have been predicted\u2014a wretched failure. The lighting is very, very bad. The heating is also very bad, partly because the new windows are a misfit and there are no stern windows, partly because the stove is perhaps insufficient heating capacity for the room and partly because of utterly insufficient draft. This inadequate draft comes from stove pipe too long, imperfect chimney and from the fact that the chimney is connected up with a supposed ventilating system. Of course, there cannot possibly be any ventilation under present conditions.\n\nThe outbuildings could not well be worse than they are. The girls' building and the boys under one roof, without screened approaches and separated by only a thin board partition. It would be difficult to have conditions more favorable to immorality.\n\nSUGGESTIONS\u2014\n\n1. A new building erected immediately behind the school with a space of 12 feet between. The building to be constructed for wood shed and closets from a plan which I shall be pleased to submit if requested.\n\n2. A new chimney built of capacity to serve as ventilator as well as smoke flue.\n\n3. A properly jacketed stove with fresh air flue from outside connected up so as to give proper heating and ventilation.\n\n4. Adequate window space so as to give ample light. At present the light space is utterly insufficient.\n\nDate of Inspection.\u2014May 3rd, 1916.\nWith reference to the Chemong school house, I beg to say that there are a few changes required that would make a great improvement and add to the comfort of the school. At present the stove is in one corner of the room and with certain kinds of weather the pipe smokes. I would recommend that the stove be placed in the center just in front of the present entrance door from the cloak room, and that this door be closed up and two doors cut out from the cloak room one at each side. The girls coming in one door and the boys the other.\n\nThere is also some new pipes required perhaps 20. I estimate the improvements at $25.00. I don't think it would cost any more and I would recommend that it be done as soon as possible before the cold weather comes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6148, File 414-5, part 2)\nBuilding and premises are altogether unsuitable for school purposes. The grounds are too small and ill-shaped and unsuitable as a playground. The ground is, besides, made hideous by a dilapidated shed in the rear.\n\nThe school house, judged from any point, has not a single advantage. In that Indian community there is a fine brick church, occupied one hour a week and a fine brick \"Council Building\" which might easily have been modified and made to accommodate the school. Why the old cast-off church should have been converted into a school building is impossible to understand. And why the \"repairs\" should have taken the form they did is equally hard to understand. It was evidently not the work of anyone who knows anything about school buildings. There is no language too strong in condemnation of this building. There is no pretense at proper heating. There is a pretense to get proper lighting and proper ventilation. Neither the one nor the other has been secured. An effort was made to have a main light from one side of the class room. But the light is altogether insufficient and it is from the wrong side of the room. But the light is altogether insufficient and is from the wrong side of the pupils.\n\nAs to ventilation there is none.\n\nNo cloakrooms, no water supply.\n\nBut as to conditions inside and out, of the building itself the outbuildings are worse. At the back of the ground there is a building that serves as a closet. Both closets are under one roof and are separated by only a thin board partition. There is nothing\u2014absolutely nothing\u2014to give privacy. Having said this I have said enough.\n\nDate of Inspection\u2014February 24th, 1919.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS\u2014\n\nSteps be taken to secure a proper site and erect a suitable school building as soon as possible so that the children of the Band may have all the advantages which such a building would afford.\nExtract from Teacher's Annual Report on the Chemong School for the year ended March 31, 1920.

Please take remedial measures without delay and with the least possible expense.\n\nThe Provincial Inspector and a recent Commission have suggested that a second teacher be appointed, whose class could be conducted in a building which is situated close to the present building. Please make a recommendation in this connection, indicate what building is referred to, its condition and what arrangements we could make for its use.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ.

Concerning the Chimooy School and accommodation for a second teacher.\n\nI beg to say that owing to the large number of primary pupils in attendance it is not possible for one teacher to do them justice. Miss Harris is doing her very best and she is giving good satisfaction but there should be two teachers.\n\nThe room in the public hall is still available where the school used to be held and it would do very well if we could acquire a teacher's platform and desk and there would be 10 x 12 seats arranged. There is a stove in the room which might serve the purpose.\n\nThe platform would cost about $100. There would also be blackboards required probably about 20' x 3'.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I may say that I have made an estimate of the probable cost and I find it would be about $50.00 and it might run to $60.00. Mr. Smith is very particular about himself and also the school room. He likes to see things clean and tidy and this is a very good feature in a teacher for Chemong School.\n\nI would recommend that this very necessary house-cleaning be done during the holidays and also that 10 new double seats be purchased.\n\n(Sgd.) R. J. McCamus.\nOttawa, July 28, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to that portion of your letter of the 23rd instant regarding the cleaning required at the Mud Lake (Chemong) Indian Day School, I have to inform you that you may arrange to have the ceiling and walls kalsomined and the woodwork given a coat of paint. We note that you estimate the cost of this work to be approximately $60. It should be completed before the school re-opens after the present summer holidays. You should purchase the material and arrange for the labour in having the painting and kalsomining done. Please forward properly certified vouchers in duplicate covering the expenditure incurred for the material and labour.\n\nRegarding the supplying of ten double desks, I have to request that you will state the name of the manufacturer of the desks at present in use at the school, as it will be necessary to have the same type in order to have uniformity in the seating arrangement. As desks are made in different sizes to suit the ages of the pupils, please state the size required. You should also state whether the desks at present in the school are double or single and full shipping directions should be given. If you are unable to give the size of the desks required, from some catalogue of school furniture, you should state the average age of the children for whom they are to be used. Please state also the number of desks at present in the school. When we have full information the order will be placed here.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

There are 96 graded to suit children from 7 to 10 and 16 from 10 to 15. The new ones are required to be 5 for pupils from 9 to 11 and 5 for pupils from 11 to 15, and the new seats are to form a complete row with back support. The teacher prefers that new seats be double as an economy in aisle space as the room is long and narrow.\n\nI may say that the seats at present in use were purchased from the Cornstock Furniture Co. of Peterboro.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I note that the desks at present in use were purchased from a Peterboro firm, and, as the Department wishes to have desks that will match in general colour, it is considered advisable for you to call for prices locally. Please ask dealers in Peterboro to quote on 5 No. 3 double desks and on 5 No. 4 double desks. You should stipulate a desk that will match the ones in use at present.

F. Downey,\nInspector.\nOttawa, May 13th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Mud Lake (Chemong) Indian Day School, states that the blackboards need attention, also that the boys' closet is dirty and needs cleaning out.\n\nPlease report the type of blackboard in the school, and state whether it needs to be repainted or what you would advise be done to place it in good condition.\n\nYou should arrange to have the boys' closet thoroughly cleaned and placed in a good sanitary condition. No unnecessary expense should be incurred for the purpose, and when the work is completed, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost. The closet should be cleaned as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J. McCamus, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKeene, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of the Department No. 25-1-5 dated November 12th, 1924 and also of a later date May 18/25 regarding recommendations made by the Public School Inspector for repairs on the Chemong clay school building.\n\nI beg to say that I am prepared to have the work done during the month of August. I have no doubt I can procure the labor required from members of the Band, but if the Department thinks it best I can let the contract at a right price.\n\nThe teacher complains that a great deal of cold air comes in through the north end where his desk is situated. I would recommend that the drop siding be taken off that end, the wall covered with a good felt lining and the drop siding put on again. This would cost about $25.00 extra.\n\nPainting outside of school 2 coats, floor 2 coats, blackboards 2 coats and painting the closets an estimate at $75.00 with extra on north end and 200.00\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The drop siding should be taken off the north end of the building and the walls covered with a good grade of building paper and the siding put on again. We note that you can procure the labour required for this work from the members of the Band. You should arrange for the purchase, after obtaining competitive prices, of the paints, oils and any other material required for the purpose, and also for the labour in doing the work. You should keep proper time sheets, in duplicate, of the labour employed. A supply of forms for the purpose are enclosed herewith. If necessary, you may employ a competent foreman to have charge of the work, and the same should be completed to your satisfaction. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the material and time sheets, in duplicate, properly signed by the men and certified by yourself should be forwarded.\n\nThis work should be completed, if possible, during the present summer holidays, and it should, therefore, receive your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

A few pictures would do much to brighten up the school. If a few pictures were provided, the \"problem of attendance\", mentioned on the preceding page, would surely be lessened to some extent.\n\n\"I wish to point out that the closets should be cleaned out before winter sets in. The boys' closet is in a very unsanitary condition.\"\nOttawa, December 9th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Mud Lake (Chemong) Indian Day School, recommends that a few pictures be supplied in order to brighten up the walls of the classroom. We will be pleased to order a number of pictures suitable for the classroom, but they are unframed. If these pictures were sent, could you arrange to have them framed in inexpensive frames, locally, forwarding accounts, properly certified, covering the cost of having the work done. An early reply giving this information is desired.\n\nThe Inspector also draws attention to the condition of the closets, which, he states, should be cleaned out before the extreme cold weather sets in. He states that the boys' closet is in a very unsanitary condition. I have to request that you will arrange to have the closets at this school thoroughly cleaned and put in a sanitary condition as soon as possible.
